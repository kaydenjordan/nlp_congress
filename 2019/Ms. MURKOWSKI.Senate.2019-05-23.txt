 Mr. President, I have asked for a few moments on the  floor today to speak about an issue I care about deeply. It is a part  of the globe, a part of the world that, in my view, is truly evolving  and is as dynamic an area as anyplace on planet Earth. This is the  Arctic.   The Arctic is growing in prominence around the globe. Countries like  China, India, and Germany have taken a keen interest in what happens in  the far north.   I have had many colleagues ask me: Why should a Senator from, say,  the State of Indiana care about the Arctic?   I guess my rhetorical answer would be this: Well, why should China  care about the Arctic? Why should Japan, Germany, and India care about  the Arctic? If they are paying attention to it, shouldn't we, as an  Arctic nation that actually has territory in the Arctic, be interested  and focused on this as well?   To be fair, we have made some good progress this year. I appreciate  the administration working with us. I appreciate my colleagues here in  the Congress who worked with us to ensure that we were able to advance  appropriations for the first polar security cutter. This is significant  news for the American Arctic. People have heard me say that we have  about 1\1/2\ icebreakers in the United States right now. We have the  Polar Star, which breaks ice down in Antarctica, meeting our  obligations there. We have the Polar Sea, which is tied up in  Washington State and will probably never see service again. We have a  medium-strength icebreaker, the Healey, which does a fair amount of  research work. But for us, as an Arctic nation, it is important to have  a fleet of icebreakers.   That is what we, as an Arctic nation, must be working toward, so a  contract for the design and construction of the first polar-class  icebreaker to be built in the United States in the past 40 years was  awarded just last month. As a nation, we haven't seen work on an  icebreaker in four decades now.   A total of $20 million is also being provided for long lead time  materials for a second polar security cutter. Hopefully, we will be  talking about more than just one polar security cutter and we will one  day have what this country, as an Arctic nation, should have, and that  is a fleet.   But the Arctic is about more than just icebreakers. It is about the  people who live there. It is about the environment. It is about its  location on the globe. The Arctic is a living and breathing place. I  think some people, in their mind's eye, view the Arctic as a frozen  wasteland, or perhaps it is a snow globe that just kind of sits up on a  shelf and you don't touch it. But it is not. It is home to some 4  million people in the Arctic region. It is not highly populated, but  there are people living, working, raising their families, subsisting,  and engaging in commerce. It is an important place.   It is a good thing when officials at the highest levels get together  to discuss the issues within the Arctic. That  [[Page S3080]]  is what happened earlier this month--actually May 6 and 7--at the  Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting in Rovaniemi, Finland. The Foreign  Ministers for each of the eight Arctic nations were in attendance. The  significance of that is noteworthy. It was only the second time in the  council's 30-plus-year history that all of the eight Ministers were  gathered together. I was pleased to be a part of the U.S. delegation  that was led by our Secretary of State, Secretary Pompeo.   This was actually the fifth Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting that I  have attended going back to 2011, when the ministerial was held in  Nuuk, Greenland. At that point in time, it was then-Secretary of State  Clinton. That marked the first time the U.S. Secretary of State  attended such a meeting. So 2011--it wasn't too many years ago that the  United States had a Secretary of State attend.   The Arctic Council includes the eight Arctic nations. The eight  Arctic nations are Canada, United States, Russia, Finland, Sweden,  Norway, Iceland, and Greenland. It also includes six permanent  participant groups within the Arctic Council that represent the  indigenous populations within the region. Four of those partially  reside in Alaska, and those are the Aleut International Association,  the Arctic Athabaskan Council, the Gwich'in Council International, and  the Inuit Circumpolar Council. While only the Arctic nations have  voting rights, the permanent participants have a seat at the table, and  they provide valuable input into the council's discussions and  deliberations. I think we really saw the impact of the permanent  participants at this most recent ministerial.   The council also has 38 observers, including 13 non-Arctic nations-- this goes back to China, as I mentioned earlier--13 intergovernmental  and interparliamentary groups, and 12 nongovernmental entities. The  number of observers and the number of pending applications to be  observers has grown considerably in the past several years. Again, it  just goes to demonstrate the rest of the world's interest in the  Arctic.   Much of what we have seen reported after the ministerial that was  held in Rovaniemi focused not on what happened but on what didn't  happen at the ministerial, which was that, for the first time, there  was not a signed ministerial declaration.   I was not part of any of the Minister-level discussions that went on  either prior to their convening in Rovaniemi or directly prior to the  day of the ministerial itself, but the crux of the impasse there was  language regarding climate change and how much of the declaration would  actually reference it.   This has all been reported very widely in the media, but what has not  been reported nearly as broadly are the areas of agreement that were  highlighted at the ministerial. All eight nations signed a joint  ministerial statement--not a declaration but a statement--which  reaffirmed their commitment to maintain peace, stability, and  cooperation in the Arctic. That is kind of a given. That is what we  want to work for with each ministerial. But the joint statement  recognized the diversity of the inhabitants of the region and the  rights of the Arctic indigenous people. It also reaffirmed the  commitment to sustainable development and the protection of the Arctic  environment.   In addition to that very short statement, there was a statement by  the chair of the ministerial meeting--the Foreign Minister of Finland-- that encompassed what would have been in a declaration had one been  signed and noted many of the areas of agreement amongst all the Arctic  nations. These were items such as the importance of the role of  scientific research, along with traditional and local knowledge, the  significance of the Arctic Environment Ministers' Meeting, the Arctic  Climate Change Update 2019 report, the outcomes from the Arctic  Resilience Forum, the convening of the Second Arctic Science  Ministerial. It encourages further work in adapting to climate change  impacts, such as permafrost thaw, and responding to weather extremes,  including the increased risk of wildfires.   Looking at the Foreign Minister's statement, it was clear that there  were many areas and many provisions on which there was cooperation and  agreement within the Arctic Council and many areas of agreement on  environmental issues as well.   Another topic reported in the news was comments by Secretary Pompeo  the day before the ministerial that were pretty direct. They were  pretty directed and were directed to Russian and Chinese activity in  the Arctic. The Secretary's remarks pointed to a reality, plain and  simple. They pointed to a growing reality that today's Arctic is not  the Arctic we have known in generations past.   We all still want--I certainly want, as one who works hard on Arctic  issues every day--we want those buzz words that are synonymous with the  region to continue to apply today and well into the future, words like  ``cooperation,'' ``collaboration,'' and calling the Arctic the ``zone  of peace.''   Greater accessibility to the region and its resources, as we are  seeing the ice that is receding from the shore--with greater  opportunities for commercial transit, you have greater accessibility-- is also bringing increased international awareness. You have seen not  only a level of interest, but you have seen a level of investment  activity and clearly competing interests that are presenting.   Some of this is great news. Fiber optic cable and satellite coverage  are bringing a level of connectivity to small, remote, and isolated  communities, which is something the communities embrace. With these  advancements, we see impacts on the culture and on the values of the  indigenous populations.   We are seeing opportunities for tourism. Cruise ships with thousands  of passengers are pulling into small coastal communities, which  certainly boost their economy, but think about the impact when you have  1,000 people who may want to disembark into a community that doesn't  have the infrastructure. It dwarfs the local population and impacts the  existing infrastructure there.   Then, of course, whether we like it or not, national security  interests are now at the forefront of many of the discussions about the  High North. Secretary Pompeo--again, his words were pretty direct. He  said:         The region has become an arena for power and for       competition. And the eight Arctic States must adapt to this       new future.    He also said that the Arctic Council no longer has the luxury to  focus exclusively on scientific collaboration, cultural matters, and  environmental research. He suggests that there is a new age of  strategic engagement in the Arctic.   I don't disagree with the Secretary that military and national  security issues are much, much, much more prevalent now than they were  only 10 years ago, and it kind of begs the question as to whether the  Arctic Council should expand its portfolio and take on these issues.  That was the discussion I participated in later that day in Helsinki at  the Munich Security Conference that was focused on Arctic security.   When the Arctic Council was established in 1996, military and  national security interests were specifically excluded from Council  activities. They chose to focus on economic development and resilience,  the environment, research, the cultures, and left off of the mission  requirements, if you will, the issues of national security and military  interest. I think that is probably why we have been able to see such  cooperation and collaboration coming out of the Arctic Council for  these many years.   Yet, as was mentioned by the Foreign Minister from Finland in a  follow-on discussion about the ministerial, it is not as if we can just  place a ``Do Not Disturb'' sign on the Arctic--we as Arctic nations. It  has changed. It is changing. Investment is happening. The activity is  already occurring. So whether we are ready for it, whether we want it,  whether we want to put out that ``Do Not Disturb'' sign or not, it is  happening.   Russia is modernizing, and they are expanding their security posture  in the region. Some say it is in a provocative manner; we can argue  about that. But it is certainly a manner that suggests that they  recognize the value of the region to their national interests, as well  as the growing non-Arctic nation attention and access to the region.   China is also quite interested. During the same week as the Arctic  Council  [[Page S3081]]  Ministerial, the Arctic Circle Assembly held a forum in Shanghai. So  think about it. We were having an Arctic Circle Assembly in Shanghai.  Think about how far Shanghai is from the Arctic. It highlighted China's  interest and their investment in the Arctic. So, again, the geography  can say that this is not an Arctic nation, not even a near-Arctic  nation, but from scientific research to economic interest in the  Arctic's natural resources, China has made it very clear that it has no  intention of reducing its interests in a Polar Silk Road.   What Secretary Pompeo made very clear is, look, if there is going to  be investment in the region, we all need to be operating by the same  rules, and the rules require transparency--transparency when it comes  to investment in the region, regardless of who is making it. I would  add to that notion that those who live in the region should benefit  from any investment in the Arctic, as they are the ones who bear the  greatest risk in any economic activity, whether it is on the shore or  in the waters.   We recognize there are plenty of opportunities in the Arctic, as we  are seeing the impacts of climate change and what that means to an area  that is becoming more exposed, but with those opportunities come very  real challenges, and we have to address those as well. That includes  environmental effects that come with climate change as we see a reduced  sea ice cover and the need to develop rules of the road to provide  transparency for the growing amount of investment in the Far North by  both Arctic and non-Arctic actors alike.   One of the underreported events of the Rovaniemi Ministerial was the  signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Arctic Council and  the Arctic Economic Council. This new agreement will provide a  framework to enhance responsible economic development and build  partnerships for issues of common interest and capacity building of  Arctic inhabitants. Perhaps this is the first step in developing a  framework for transparent Arctic investment and a new age of strategic  engagement in the Arctic.   I was very honored to attend both the Arctic Council Ministerial in  Finland, as well as the Arctic Circle Assembly in Shanghai. I continue  to believe it is critical for us--for those in the administration, for  us here in Congress--to actively engage in the Arctic. We have a lot at  stake here. The region has a lot at stake, and we need to establish  sound policy that will take advantage of all of our opportunities and  address our challenges while ensuring that we are working to the  benefit of the local residents.   I think it is so important to reinforce that we cannot assume that if  we are not stepping it up in the Arctic, that means nobody else is.  That is absolutely and positively not the case. There is a level of  engagement and there is a level of interest that is global. We are one  of the eight Arctic nations. We have a place; we have a people in the  Arctic. We have an obligation, as an Arctic nation, to behave as one.   Alaskans are more than happy to lead whenever and wherever possible,  but this is not an Alaska-specific issue. This is not just Alaska. This  is all of us as a country. We also need that recognition at the Federal  level.   I encourage Members of this Chamber to recognize the importance of  the Arctic, to pay greater attention to what is happening there, to  make the region a priority in our policymaking efforts, and to help  ensure that America, which is an Arctic nation by virtue of Alaska-- that we, as an Arctic nation, catch up to all of the others that are  looking with great interest, whether making investments or truly making  an impression on the Arctic.   I yield the floor.
