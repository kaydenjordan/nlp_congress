 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this January 15, 2022, tragedy struck a community in my  home State of Texas. A terrorist held four people hostage at a Jewish  synagogue for 11 hours. We are immensely grateful that each hostage  ultimately escaped unharmed, though the psychological scars are real  for the victims and lasting for the community.   This act of terrorism has no place in our society.   Today, my colleagues, in the strongest terms and means possible,  firmly and fiercely condemn the terrorist's acts and condemn those who  target any Americans, and in this instance our Jewish brothers and  sisters.   Early in the morning on Saturday, January 15, 2022, the Congregation  Beth Israel near Fort Worth, Texas, was targeted.   At this synagogue, worshipers welcomed the attacker inside. The rabbi  even made him tea. The worshipers faced Jerusalem and began to pray.  The attacker then pulled out his weapon, and an 11-hour standoff  ensued.   That Saturday, America held its breath. We prayed for the safe return  of loved ones and family members.   No one in America should ever face this kind of fear and terror and  evil.   The worshipers at Congregation Beth Israel showed remarkable courage  when faced with evil in their own house of worship.   And all Americans rose to the occasion when our sisters and brothers  faced this kind of adversity. The four hostages, including the rabbi,  battled their attacker. Later, the hostages were able to escape, and  the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team secured the synagogue.   Americans, as one, rushed in to support Congregation Beth Israel.  Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Americans of all faiths and others  prayed for the Texas community and for those victims this past January.   Our hearts go out to the families of this congregation that they had  to endure such an unjust evil that this terrorist caused. Thank God  they escaped.   Today, we support the community of Colleyville, Texas. Today, we  support Congregation Beth Israel. And today, we support the brave  survivors of this heinous attack.   We applaud the bravery of Congregation Beth Israel, the survivors,  and our heroes in blue, Texas law enforcement.   As patriotic freedom-loving Americans, we condemn the evil and the  darkness of anti-Semitism. And we will fight hate and bigotry and anti- Semitism.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I am closing with a simple statement.   We must end terrorism and anti-Semitism here in the United States.   The violence suffered in Colleyville could have happened anywhere in  America.   Let's take a minute to review some Jewish history. It literally began  in that fateful year of 1492 when Europeans arrived in the New World,  and a number of Jews fought alongside George Washington in the American  Revolution.   And the first Jewish man to give his life for this country was also  ironically the first Jew to be elected to public office in the  Colonies: Francis Salvador.   By 1840, the Jewish-American community was tiny, only 15,000 out of  17 million, but it was strong and it was stable and it was prosperous.  And within a decade it had tripled. At the time of the Civil War, there  were only 150,000 Jews in America, but nearly 10 percent fought in the  Civil War.   During the 19th century, the repression and the old world of Jews in  Europe just became too much for so many, and by 1924, two million  European Jews had immigrated to the United States.   Jewish Americans have woven a rich tapestry into the history of our  Nation.   Jonas Salk discovered the polio vaccine. How many lives did that one  man save?   Richard Feynman was an American physicist and was integral in  formulating quantum physics.   What is even more remarkable is the percentage of Jews that have won  Nobel Prizes. Twenty-two percent of all Nobel Prize winners had Jewish  heritage, and 36 percent of American winners had Jewish heritage. It is  remarkable.   It is refreshing to be on the floor and have both sides agree, and  there is power in that, and there is strength in that, and I urge this  Congress and all Americans to join me in condemning these violent acts  and the evil of anti-Semitism. We are a beautiful and wonderful  country, and we have to act like it.   My heart goes out to the hostages and their families for undergoing  this terrorist attack in the beautiful and wonderful community of  Colleyville, Texas, who are fortunate enough to be represented by such  a wonderful Member of Congress in Beth Van Duyne. Our prayers are with  the victims and their families.   Mr. Speaker, it is great to be here on the floor with you today, and  I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1315
