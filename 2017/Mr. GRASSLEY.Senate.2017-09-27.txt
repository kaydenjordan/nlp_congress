 Mr. President, today, the Senate is voting to confirm  Makan Delrahim to serve as the Assistant Attorney General for the  Antitrust Division. When Mr. Delrahim was 10 years old, his family fled  the tyranny of Iran and settled in the United States, knowing no  English. Since then, Mr. Delrahim received his B.S. from the University  of California in 1991, his J.D. from the George Washington University  School of Law in 1995, and his M.S. from Johns Hopkins University in  2002.   Mr. Delrahim's professional career and broad range of legal  experiences have prepared him well to lead the Antitrust Division. He  has experience in both the private and public sectors. He has worked at  various law firms and served in government, including as staff director  to then-Chairman Hatch of the Senate Judiciary Committee, deputy  counsel to the President of the United States, and Deputy Assistant  Attorney General of the Antitrust Division at the Department of  Justice. He also served as a Commissioner of the U.S. Antitrust  Modernization Commission.   Mr. Delrahim will serve as the highest ranking Iranian-American  official ever at the Department of Justice. His journey epitomizes the  American dream. He is well known and liked by my colleagues and me. I  am pleased to support his nomination today.
