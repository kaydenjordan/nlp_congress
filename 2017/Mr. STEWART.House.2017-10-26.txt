 Mr. Speaker, much has been said about the tumultuous  times in which we live, and it is true, we do face enormous challenges.  But I would like to remind the American people of the things that will  get us through these times.   My parents were part of the Greatest Generation. My father was a  pilot in World War II, and I am honored to wear his Air Force wings. My  mother was a mother of 10 amazing children, many of which are with me  today. They are the best friends that I have ever had.   Our parents taught us something that each of us has embroidered and  now hangs on our individual family walls, and it is this: Our family's  motto is duty, honor, service to God, family, and country.   We are, as Abraham Lincoln said: ``The last best hope of Earth.''  That was true when he said it. It is still true today.   We created the miracle of the Constitution; we survived the  catastrophe of the Civil War; we defeated communism, totalitarianism,  fascism; we have the strength to get through the challenges that we  face today. But it will only be true if we are true to that principle:  Duty, honor, service to God, family, and country.                            ____________________
