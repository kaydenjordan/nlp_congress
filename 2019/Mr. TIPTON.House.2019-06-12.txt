 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sergeant First Class  Will D. Lindsay from Cortez, Colorado, an American soldier, who was  recently killed defending our country in the Kunduz province of  Afghanistan.   He and Specialist Joseph Collette, both Fort Carson based soldiers,  were killed in an attack fighting against the Taliban.   Sergeant Lindsay was born in Cortez in 1985. The grandson of World  War II veteran, Richard Lindsay, and World War II veteran, Warren  Waldorf, he was no stranger to service. He followed his grandfather's  footsteps when he enlisted in the Army in 2004, ultimately, getting  selected into the elite 10th Special Forces Group.   This prestigious fighting group deploys to some of the world's most  heated combat zones. Sergeant Lindsay bravely deployed with them seven  times, including five tours in Iraq, one in Tajikistan, and this final  deployment to Afghanistan.   As a highly decorated combat veteran, Sergeant Lindsay had an  expansive list of military awards and decorations to include a Silver  Star, Purple Heart, four Bronze Stars, two Meritorious Service Medals,  two Meritorious Unit Commendation, the Valorous Unit Award, the Army  Superior Unit Award, four Army Good Conduct Medals, the National  Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the  NCO Professional Development Ribbon with numeral four, the Army Service  Ribbon, two Overseas Service Ribbons, the NATO Medal, the Special  Forces Tab, the Combat Infantryman Badge, the Military Free-fall  Jumpmaster Badge, the Master Parachutist Badge, the Chilean Airborne  Wings, and the Senior Instructor Badge.   Sergeant Lindsay's record is a testament to his commitment of putting  country before self, as he did in the Army for nearly 15 years.   I stand before the House of Representatives with a heavy heart  thinking about his family and their great loss, especially his wife,  Sarah, his four daughters, and his parents, Grant and Tammy. I join the  town of Cortez, his brothers and sisters in arms, and the entire Nation  in mourning his untimely death. I have gotten to know Sergeant  Lindsay's family over the years and his loss will be felt by many in  our small community.   Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Lindsay's death is a painful reminder of the  sacrifices our men and women in the military endure, as well as their  families.  [[Page H4438]]  Sergeant Lindsay was a true American hero, from one of the most rural  areas of Colorado, who died protecting his men and the country he  loved.   He dedicated his life to selflessly protect our great Nation, and we  are all proud of him. His loss is tragic, but his legacy will be  remembered for generations to come, and the world is a better place  because of him.                            ____________________
