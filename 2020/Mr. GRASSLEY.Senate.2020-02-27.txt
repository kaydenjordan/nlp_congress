 Mr. President, I ask permission to speak in morning  business for 1 minute.    Mr. President, I would like to recognize what my staff  in Iowa does because I can't be in Iowa all the time. I am in  Washington, DC, for long periods of time.   This is my 40th year holding Q&A in each of Iowa's 99 counties. My  regional staff is also committed to holding meetings across Iowa. My  Iowa staff serves as my eyes and ears when I am working in Washington,  DC. That is why they host mobile office hours in every county and  attended roughly 1,400 meetings across the State last year.   My regional directors tour hospitals, businesses, and childcare  centers. They meet with disaster victims, government officials, and  senior citizens. They attend ribbon cuttings, community forums, and  legislative discussions.   Serving Iowans is my top priority. I urge Iowans to contact any of my  six offices across the State if I can be of assistance on Federal  matters.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I come to the floor for two reasons. I  am first going to recognize the good work that the Secretary for the  Majority, Laura Dove, has done for the entire U.S. Senate, particularly  for the majority but mostly for the smooth running of the Senate.   Before I speak on another issue, I want to associate myself with the  great comments that Leader McConnell made this morning about the work  of the Secretary for the Majority, Laura Dove. Laura's work in the U.S.  Senate has been tremendous, with over 20 years of service. Few know  Senate procedures as well as Laura Dove. She keeps the Senate firing on  all cylinders, working for the American people.   I am a Senator who hasn't missed a vote in almost 27 years. Laura  Dove and the Republican cloakroom, partnering with her and with me in  my commitment to not miss a vote--they ensure that I am here when I am  needed for those votes. I thank Laura for helping me serve the people  of Iowa effectively.   I wish Laura all the best in her next chapter. There is no doubt that  we will miss her sharp intellect and warm smile here in the Senate  Chamber.                            ____________________     Madam President, as Iowa farmers count down the days to  get into the fields, baseball fans are counting down the days for that  first pitch to cross the plate. As a farmer and also as a baseball fan,  hope springs eternal.   However, we have gotten wind that Major League Baseball is throwing  local clubs a curve ball--a curve that would hurt baseball, hurt local  economies, and the fields of dreams in my home State. That is three  strikes right there.   I have got news. Don't count us baseball fans out. These local  communities and this U.S. Senator aren't going to sit on the sidelines.  Now, here is the news: Major League Baseball said that it may cut ties  with as many as 42 Minor League clubs, including three historic  affiliates in Iowa: The Burlington Bees, the Clinton LumberKings, and  the Quad Cities River Bandits.   I have been in communication with the deputy commissioner of Major  League Baseball, Dan Halem, both in letters and on the phone, about the  importance of these teams to Iowa. I am sure a lot of my colleagues  have made the same contacts.   I have also joined, with a bipartisan group of my colleagues, in  introducing a resolution today supporting all Minor League Baseball  teams across the country. For generations of Iowans, these ball clubs  are a vibrant source of civic pride, a vibrant source of entertainment,  and--would you believe it--also a vibrant source of economic  development.   While I have been to just a handful of Major League Baseball games, I  have fond, fond memories of going to Minor League Baseball games in  Waterloo, IA. We call them the Waterloo White Hawks, a club team for  the Chicago White Sox. I had an opportunity, as a young person, to see  Luis Aparicio play there in Waterloo before he made it big in the  majors as a shortstop for the Chicago White Sox.   You can see that I want Iowans to continue to have that same  experience. For the record, I am and will always go to bat for Iowa. As  Iowa's senior Senator, I will do what I can to ``root, root, root for  the home team.''   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
