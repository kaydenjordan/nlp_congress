 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this terrible bill  because this terrible bill will increase the cost of energy on every  hardworking American in the United States.   This bill actually calls for a doubling of the excise tax on oil and  on gas, doubling of the royalties on oil and on gas.   I was in my district yesterday with Americans for Prosperity at the  True Cost of Washington event where they actually brought down the  price of gasoline to $2.38, the price it was before Joe Biden took  office. I had families in my district crying because they could finally  put gas in their cars and food on their dinner table in that day.   The Democrats come here today, and they want to lecture us about  putting people over politics?   That is a joke, and it is a lie.   These tax increases on oil and gas will only hurt poor families all  across America. I don't care if you are in Seattle, Washington; I don't  care if you are in Miami, Florida; you could be in Chicago, Illinois;  New York City; or San Francisco, California; those tax increases hurt  the very poor among us, and the Democrats are cool with it.   Mr. Speaker, vote ``no'' on this bill.
