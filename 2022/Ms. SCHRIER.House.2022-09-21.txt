 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the lives of two  outstanding Eighth District residents.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor the legacy of Carmen Louise  Bossenbrock who passed away on July 31, 2022, at the age of 94. Carmen  was a pioneering figure in the fight against polio, a tireless  community advocate, and a beloved lifelong Wenatchee Valley resident.   As the polio epidemic rampaged across Washington State, Carmen became  a medical leader in the Wenatchee Valley. Working at Deaconess Hospital  and later Central Washington Hospital as a physical therapist, Carmen  was often the only thing standing between polio patients and  debilitating paralysis.   For 2 years, in the thick of the epidemic, she was the only licensed  physical therapist practicing in north central Washington. As patients  flooded through her doors, Carmen devoted herself to the recovery of  hundreds of patients. As a reflection of her tireless leadership,  Carmen became the head of physical therapy at Central Washington  Hospital until her retirement.   Carmen remained a tireless advocate against polio in her later  career. She was an active member of the Wenatchee Rotary Club--one of  the first women to join. There she passionately led fundraising for  global vaccine programs to ensure no family would have to experience  the devastation of polio.   Friends remember Carmen as a pillar of the community, splitting her  time between her beloved pear orchard in Dryden and her mission to  eradicate polio.   We are deeply grateful for Carmen's service. Her legacy will forever  be a part of the Wenatchee Valley and Washington State. I join Carmen's  family and friends in mourning their loss of an extraordinary woman.         Honoring the Life of Gunnery Sergeant Arthur Branson Summers     Mr. Speaker, I would like to share the story of Gunnery  Sergeant Arthur Branson Summers, a U.S. marine killed in action in  World War II. After 76 years, his body has returned home to his family  members and has been laid to rest in East Wenatchee, Washington.   Gunnery Sergeant Summers of Company I, 3rd Battalion, 6th Marine  Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, was killed in the winter of 1943 in the  Betio Island battle with Japanese forces. Sadly, Summers was 1 of 1,000  servicemembers who died that day and 1 of almost 500 whose remains were  never found. Tragically for his family, friends, and loved ones, they  were deemed nonrecoverable in 1949.    But this changed in 2009 thanks to the tireless work of the nonprofit  organization History Flight. After a small piece of military rain  poncho was found near the site, History Flight began excavations in  2009 and discovered the body of Gunnery Sergeant Summers along with  several other lost servicemembers. His remains were brought home to his  family, nephews David and Donald McCannel. He received an honorable  burial in East Wenatchee, Washington.   Gunnery Sergeant Arthur Branson Summers answered our Nation's call at  a time of great need, and for his service, valor, and sacrifice, we are  forever thankful.   I would like to recognize History Flight for their work to return  Summers to his home and to thank David and Donald McCannel and their  families for providing Gunnery Sergeant Summers an honorable burial on  American soil.   On behalf of a grateful Nation and the entire Eighth District, we are  proud to have Gunnery Sergeant Summers in his final resting place in  East Wenatchee, Washington.      Honoring the Issaquah All-Stars and the Bonney Lake/Sumner Little                                League Teams     Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to honor some  tremendous young athletes. The Eighth District had not one but two  teams representing our State at the Little League World Series. The  Issaquah All-Stars represented the northwest region at the Little  League Softball World Series, and the Bonney Lake/Sumner Little League  team, at  [[Page H8015]]  the baseball Little League World Series.   Mr. Speaker, I am so proud of these young athletes who represented  our district and State so well on the national stage. Congratulations  to them and their families on their success.                            ____________________
