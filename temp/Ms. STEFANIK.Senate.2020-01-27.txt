 And the fact is the aid was given to Ukraine       without any announcement of new investigations?        Ambassador SONDLAND. That's correct.         And President Trump did in fact meet with       President Zelensky in September at the United Nations,       correct?        Ambassador SONDLAND. He did.         And there was no announcement of       investigations before this meeting?        Ambassador SONDLAND. Correct.         And there was no announcement of       investigations after this meeting?  [[Page S585]]         Ambassador SONDLAND. That's right.    Mr. Counsel PURPURA. So while the security assistance was paused, the  administration did precisely what you would expect. It addressed  President Trump's concerns about the two issues that I mentioned on  Saturday: burden-sharing and corruption.   A number of law- and policymakers also contacted the President and  the White House to provide input on the security assistance issue  during this period, including Senator Lindsey Graham. The process  culminated on September 11, 2019. On that day, the President spoke with  Vice President Pence and Senator Rob Portman. The Vice President, in  NSC Senior Director Tim Morrison's words, was ``armed with his  conversation with President Zelensky from their meeting just days  earlier in Warsaw, Poland, and both the Vice President and Senator  Portman related their view of the importance of the assistance to  Ukraine and convinced the President that the aid should be disbursed  immediately. After the meeting, President Trump terminated the pause,  and the support flowed to Ukraine.''   I want to take a step back now and talk for a moment about why the  security assistance was briefly paused--again, in the words of the  House managers' own witnesses. Witness after witness testified that  confronting Ukrainian corruption should be at the forefront of U.S.  foreign policy towards Ukraine. They also testified that the President  had longstanding and sincere concerns about corruption in Ukraine. The  House managers, however, told you that it was laughable to think that  the President cared about corruption in Ukraine, but that is not what  the witnesses said.   According to Ambassador Volker, President Trump demonstrated that he  had a very deeply rooted negative view of Ukraine based on past  corruption, and that is a reasonable position, according to Ambassador  Volker. Most people who know anything about Ukraine would think that.   Dr. Hill testified:         I think the President has actually quite publicly said that       he was very skeptical about corruption in Ukraine. And, in       fact, he is not alone, because everyone has expressed great       concerns about corruption in Ukraine.    The House managers have said the President's concern with corruption  is disingenuous. They said that President Trump didn't care about  corruption in 2017 or 2018 and he certainly didn't care about it in  2019. Those were their words. Not according to Ambassador Yovanovitch,  however, who testified that President Trump shared his concern about  corruption directly with President Poroshenko--President Zelensky's  predecessor--in their first meeting in the Oval Office. When was that  meeting? In June of 2017--2017.   The President also has well-known concerns about foreign aid  generally. Scrutinizing and in some cases curtailing foreign aid was a  central plank of his campaign platform. President Trump is especially  wary of sending American taxpayer dollars abroad when other countries  refuse to pitch in.   Mr. Morrison and Mr. Hale both testified at length about President  Trump's longstanding concern with burden-sharing in foreign aid  programs. Here is what they said.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          The Trump administration has indeed provided       substantial aid to  [[Page S588]]       Ukraine in the form of defensive lethal aid, correct?        Ambassador TAYLOR. That is correct.         And that is more so than the Obama       administration, correct?        Ambassador TAYLOR. The Trump administration--         Defensive lethal aid.        Ambassador TAYLOR. Yes.        Ambassador VOLKER. President Trump approved each of the       decisions made along the way, providing lethal defensive       equipment.        Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. And the Trump administration       strengthened our policy by approving the provision to Ukraine       of antitank missiles known as Javelins.        They are obviously tank busters. And so, if the war with       Russia all--all of a sudden accelerated in some way and tanks       come over the horizon, Javelins are a very serious weapon to       deal with that.    Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Ukraine is better positioned to fight Russia  today than it was before President Trump took office. As a result, the  United States is safer too. The House managers did not tell you about  this testimony from Ambassadors Taylor, Volker, and Yovanovitch. Why  not?   These are the facts, as drawn from the House managers' own record on  which they impeached the President. This is why the House managers'  first Article of Impeachment must fail, for the six reasons I set forth  when I began on Saturday:   There was no linkage between investigations and security assistance  or a meeting on the July 25 call. The Ukrainians said there was no quid  pro quo and they felt no pressure. The top Ukrainians did not even know  that security assistance was paused until more than a month after the  July 25 call. The House managers' record reflects that anyone who spoke  with the President said that the President made clear that there was no  linkage. The security assistance flowed, and the Presidential meeting  took place, all without any announcement of investigations. And  President Trump has enhanced America's support for Ukraine in his 3  years in office.   These facts all require that the first Article of Impeachment fail.  You have already heard and will continue to hear from my colleagues on  why the second article must fail. Once again, this is the case that the  House managers chose to bring. This is the evidence they brought before  the Senate.   The very heavy burden of proof rests with them. They say their case  is overwhelming and uncontested. It is not. They say they have proven  each of the articles against President Trump. They have not. The facts  and evidence of the case the House managers have brought exonerate the  President.   Thank you for your attention.   Mr. Chief Justice, I think we are ready for a break.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                                    Recess
