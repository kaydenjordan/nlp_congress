 Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate my friend Lisa  Wilkins--I used to know her when she was Lisa Morgan--on her retirement  after 32 years of teaching in the Knox County school system.   Lisa started teaching in 1987 as a first-grade teacher at Karns  Elementary School, and she held that position for 17 long years. After  that, she took a job at Rocky Hill Elementary School as a teacher for  third and fourth graders, then became a literacy coach for Chilhowee  Intermediate School, Maynard Elementary School, and Sequoyah Elementary  School. She then returned to teaching first graders for the last 8  years of her career at Rocky Hill Elementary School.   Lisa's favorite thing about teaching these little kids was the joy  she could see on their faces, Madam Speaker, every day. She loved  seeing their sweet little faces light up every time they entered her  classroom, and she took great joy in seeing the proud looks on their  faces when they finally understood a difficult concept.   Lisa had a positive impact on so many students and teachers, Madam  Speaker, throughout her career. She had a special talent for mentoring  new teachers and helping them find their footing, and that talent will  surely be missed.   At a weak moment, she married her husband, Kent, and 31 wonderful  years later, they have raised two daughters, Morgan and Madison, along  with their two dogs, Baylee and Brentley. Kent adores his wife, as he  should, and says she is the best mother, wife, and teacher anyone could  ever dream of.   I congratulate Lisa on her retirement. I wish her all the best in the  next chapter of her life. I can't imagine her retiring, since she is 1  year younger than I am.                            ____________________
