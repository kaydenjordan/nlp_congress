 Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I have to point out that the  gentleman and many of the people who just led that moment of silence  for the horrible shooting that just happened can't find it within  themselves to give a moment of action to make sure that these shootings  don't happen in the first place.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in belated celebration of RECORD Store Day  and the incredible record stores that call central Florida home.   Last month, I got to visit many of these stores, hearing from the  small business owners and employees about their love for music and what  we can do to support small businesses and the arts.   The next time you are in central Florida, please take the time to  visit Bossa `N Roll Records, Bynx, Foundation College Park, Park Ave  CDs, Re-Runz Records, Remix Records, Retro Records, Rock & Roll Heaven,  Smartpunk's RECORD Shop, Uncle Tony's Donut Shoppe, which has records,  and any store that I may have missed.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all the record stores for being a vital part of  our economy and our arts community.                            ____________________
