 Mr. President, every week I have been coming down to  the floor of the Senate to talk about a special Alaskan, someone in my  State who, through their hard work and community service, whether to  their neighbors or to their country, makes Alaska a better place for  all of us. We call these people the Alaskans of the Week. Learning  about these individuals and sharing their stories with my Senate  colleagues, Alaskans, and Americans who watch what we do here or who  are in the gallery, is probably one of the best parts of my week every  week.   Like most of my colleagues, I will soon be going home for the Fourth  of July. We will celebrate this very special holiday with our families  and our communities. Some of us will go to barbecues or march in  parades or attend other community gatherings. Some of us will gather in  spots across our State and watch fireworks. Personally, I will be with  my family catching king salmon at my family's ancestral fish camp up on  the Yukon River, one of my favorite places in the entire world.   Regardless of where we are, all of us will certainly feel a swell of  pride for our country. We will remember the hard-fought battles that  brought us independence, and we will remember those who have served and  sacrificed to keep our country the land of the free and the home of the  brave. They are the heroes among us, and Alaska is chock-full of these  heroes.   Today I want to recognize one of them, a very special hero who is our  Alaskan of the Week--Solomon Atkinson, who spent nearly his entire  adult life serving our country with honor and dignity and now serves  his community in Alaska tirelessly.   Let me tell you a little bit about Sol and his illustrious career in  the military. Sol was born in 1930 to Harris and Elizabeth Atkinson in  Metlakatla, AK.   Metlakatla is on Annette Island on the Inside Passage, where so many  Americans take cruises to see the glaciers and the whales. It is home  to the only federally recognized Indian reservation in our State.   Sol could have continued to live in Metlakatla, where he was a  commercial fisherman as a young man, but, like so many patriotic  Alaskans, he chose to leave his home and join the military. Sol joined  the U.S. Navy, and for 22 years--from 1951 to 1973--he had by anybody's  standards a remarkable patriotic military career.   In 1953, Sol volunteered for the Navy's legendary Underwater  Demolition Team and was deployed to the Pacific, including Korea. Some  history buffs will know and recall that the Underwater Demolition Team,  the UDT, was the precursor to the present-day Navy SEALS--frogmen, as  they liked to call themselves. In fact, Sol was on the very first Navy  SEAL team created by President Kennedy in 1962, and I have a copy of  the SEAL Team One plank owners certificate, commissioned on January 1,  1962, with Sol's name proudly displayed.   So Sol became a Navy SEAL--the first Navy SEAL, literally. He became  a SEAL team training instructor, training new Navy SEAL recruits. He  was affectionately referred to as ``the Mean Machine'' by the Navy  SEALs. He also had the honor of training 48 astronauts, including Neil  Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Jim Lovell, just to name a few, in  underwater weightlessness simulations. His prized possession is a  framed plaque bearing the signature of all those astronauts, all those  American heroes whom he trained.   Sol completed three combat tours in Vietnam. By the time he retired  from the military, he had earned numerous awards and medals for  personal valor, including the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. But  what is truly remarkable about Sol is that after he retired from the  Navy, he moved back home to Metlakatla and continued to serve his  country and serve his community. He served on the Indian Community  Council, on the school board, and as mayor of Metlakatla. He has also  been very involved in veterans affairs and was the president of the  first veterans organization on the island and was instrumental in  starting that organization. He has spent years reaching out to his  fellow veterans to make sure they receive the benefits, honor, and  dignity they earned.   Jeff Moran, the superintendent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in  Metlakatla, said this about Sol:         I could go on and on regarding the wonderful things that       Sol has done for his community. We would not be here today       without his leadership and knowledge [and commitment].    I, too, can go on about Sol. Many Alaskans can go on about Sol and  all the things he has done. But I also want to mention, particularly on  the eve of the Fourth of July, that he is part of a long tradition in  my State of Alaskan Natives who have served in the military, who have  served our country even during darker times in our history when many  Alaskan Natives were discriminated against and denied basic rights.   On the eve of the Fourth of July, we celebrate America's independence  but also in particular those who have fought for that independence over  the last 200 years. As I mentioned, one proud element of my great State  is that we have more veterans per capita than any State in the country,  and Alaska Native veterans serve at higher rates in the U.S. military  than any  [[Page S3840]]  other ethnic group in the country--something I like to refer to as a  special kind of patriotism because they have been doing this for  decades, like Sol--even at times, as I mentioned, when the country  hasn't always treated that group of patriotic Americans with the  respect and dignity they deserve. Sol personifies this special  patriotism.   The SEALs who served with him wrote this about him in a tribute:         Sol's story will continue to be told by the men he trained,       by the officers who relied on him, by the Frogmen who all       respect him. An officer, a gentleman, an athlete, a friend,       Sol Atkinson is all of these, but of all of these traits, he       is first a Frogman.    We can see the pride the Navy SEALs have for Sol, a plank owner for  the entire organization.   In conclusion, I will add that he is a patriotic Alaskan through and  through, and I thank him for all he has done for Alaska, for our  veterans, and for America.   Sol, congratulations on being our Alaskan of the Week. Happy Fourth  of July to you, to Alaska, and to all the men and women in our military  and the citizens of our great Nation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
