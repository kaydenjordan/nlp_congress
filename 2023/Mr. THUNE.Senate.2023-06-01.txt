 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before I begin, I would like to take just a  moment this morning to recognize a pillar of the South Dakota press  corps who has served at WNAX in Yankton, SD, for an incredible 47  years. His name is Jerry Oster, and he truly is an institution on the  media landscape in South Dakota.   Jerry joined WNAX as news director in September of 1976, and he has  become one of the most familiar and beloved voices on the airwaves in  South Dakota.   I have had many great conversations with Jerry over the years on air  and off, and I can say for certain that his departure will leave a very  big hole in the South Dakota radio scene. But he has more than earned  his retirement, and I know that he will relish getting to spend more  time with his wife Cheryl--herself just recently retired from an  amazing 43 years with Farm Credit Services of America--and with his  sons and their wives and his six grandchildren.   Jerry, congratulations on an incredible and award-winning career, and  enjoy some well-deserved rest.                                 H.J. Res. 45    Mr. President, last August, mere days after he had signed a bill that  would supposedly reduce the deficit by $238 billion, President Biden  announced a student loan giveaway that is said to cost taxpayers nearly  a trillion dollars over the next decade. In a Presidency distinguished  by bad economic decisions, this was a particularly notable one.   There are two main parts to the President's scheme. There is the  outright forgiveness of $10,000 in Federal student debt--or $20,000 for  Pell grant recipients--which is set to cost American taxpayers  somewhere in the neighborhood of half a trillion dollars. Then there is  the President's radical revamp of the income-driven repayment system,  which will bring total cost for the President's plan somewhere close to  a trillion dollars.   There are a number of obvious problems with the President's plan for  forgiving student debt. I say ``forgiving student debt,'' but it is  more like transferring the cost of student debt for the relatively  small percentage of taxpayers in this country with student debt to  American taxpayers as a whole. It is something of a slap in the face to  Americans who chose more affordable college options or worked their way  through school to avoid taking on student loans or whose parents  scrimped and saved to put them through college.   It is also a slap in the face to members of the military who signed  up to serve this country and earned GI bill benefits to help with  tuition or training. Not to mention that negating this popular benefit  could drag down recruitment and retention.   And, of course, it is deeply unfair to ask the many Americans who  worked hard to pay off their loans or who never pursued college in the  first place to take on the burden of student debt for individuals who  took out loans for college or graduate school and agreed to pay them  back.   And let's remember, we are asking taxpayers, at large, to foot the  bill for student loan cancellation for Americans who enjoy greater  long-term earning potential than many of the Americans who will be  helping to shoulder the burden for their debts.  [[Page S1859]]    The President's student loan giveaway isn't a government handout for  the needy; it is a government handout that will be disproportionately  beneficial to Americans who are better off. It is ironic coming from  someone who claims he wants to build the economy from the bottom up and  the middle out. The President's student loan giveaway is decidedly more  top-down, let's face it.   And speaking of the economy, Americans continue to struggle with the  effects of the Democrat-driven inflation crisis that has beset our  economy for most of the President's administration. Prices are up 16  percent on average since the President took office, and we are nowhere  near getting back to the target inflation rate of 2 percent.   What is the President's student loan plan almost guaranteed to do? In  the words of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget  where the President's own Treasury Secretary served on the board, the  President's student loan giveaway will ``meaningfully boost  inflation''--``meaningfully boost inflation.''   I have talked about the forgiveness part of the President's plan and  how fundamentally unfair it is, but that is only half of the  President's student loan giveaway. The other half is just as  problematic because it sets up a system in which the majority of  Federal borrowers will never fully repay their loans. The Urban  Institute, a left-of-center think tank, estimates that just 22 percent  of those with bachelor's degrees enrolled in the President's new  income-driven repayment program would repay their loans in full--22  percent--and many individuals would never be required to repay a penny.   And who will be footing the bill for all those student loan dollars  that aren't repaid? Well, you guessed it--the American taxpayers.   Needless to say, the President's income-driven repayment plan will  not only fail to curtail student borrowing, it will actually encourage  it. If you can reasonably expect that you won't have to fully pay back  your loans, you are much more likely to feel free to borrow and to  borrow liberally.   And, of course, neither the President's outright student loan  forgiveness nor his forgiveness masquerading as income-driven repayment  will do anything to address the problem of soaring college costs. In  fact, the President's student loan giveaway is likely to make the  problem worse.   You only have to look at what happened when Democrats forced through  their $7,500 tax credit for Americans who purchased electric vehicles.  Car manufacturers, not surprisingly, raised their prices by a similar  amount. Similarly, if colleges can expect that the Federal Government  will pick up a sizable part of the tab for their students' education,  they are extremely unlikely to feel any pressing need to cut costs or  to stop tuition hikes. If anything, colleges might further increase  tuition and fees.   Currently, the outcome of the forgiveness portion of the President's  student loan giveaway is unclear. The President's legal authority for  this action is dubious, and his ability to unilaterally forgive student  loans has been challenged in the Supreme Court, with a decision  expected within weeks.   And, today, the Senate looks likely to pass a resolution that would  block the forgiveness part of the President's proposal. Unfortunately,  the President is guaranteed to veto the measure, and there are not  enough Democrats in the House and Senate willing to override his veto.  Apparently, the possibility of garnering votes from Americans with  student debt is reason enough for Democrats to ignore the blatantly  regressive nature of the President's student loan giveaway--and the  fact that it will almost unquestionably worsen the problem of rising  college costs, not to mention the fact that it will drive up inflation  and balloon the deficit.   I haven't even mentioned the third part of the President's student  loan legacy, which is the COVID-era student loan repayment pause that  President Biden has extended six times during his Presidency with no  reasonable justification. That pause, which has been in place for 3  years now, costs taxpayers $5 billion per month. Fortunately, this  pause is guaranteed to end thanks to the Fiscal Responsibility Act, the  legislation Speaker McCarthy and President Biden agreed on to raise the  debt ceiling. But while the end of the pause is a victory for  taxpayers, the savings that will result pale in comparison to the  tremendous costs of the President's student loan giveaway. And if the  Supreme Court doesn't overturn the forgiveness portion of the  President's student loan giveaway, American taxpayers will be stuck  with the full nearly trillion-dollar bill. It will be one more negative  economic legacy from Democrats and the Biden administration.   I yield the floor.
