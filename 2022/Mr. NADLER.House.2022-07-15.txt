 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8297, the  Ensuring Women's Right to Reproductive Freedom Act.   The Supreme Court's disastrous decision in Dobbs to overturn Roe v.  Wade has exacerbated what was an already dire crisis in abortion care  access--one that threatens to undermine women's equality and health.   In the wake of the Dobbs decision, State legislatures across the  country are moving to ban abortion outright. As if that wasn't  draconian enough, some States are also passing laws targeting people  who help others obtain an abortion. This includes the notorious Texas  law, SB8, which permits any person to collect a $10,000 bounty by suing  someone who ``aids or abets an abortion.''   Not content to strip women of their bodily autonomy and equality in  their own States, some State legislatures are now contemplating efforts  to inhibit the ability of women to travel out-of-state to obtain lawful  healthcare, including by threatening their friends, families, or even  employers with legal action.   H.R. 8297 would put State legislatures considering such laws on  notice by providing additional Federal legal protections that reaffirm  and enhance enforcement of the constitutional right to interstate  travel, which includes travel to obtain legal healthcare services like  an abortion.   This legislation is not enough. Many people, a disproportionate  number from  [[Page H6653]]  communities of color, do not have the option of traveling across State  lines because they lack the resources to bear the costs of out-of-state  travel, which include the related costs of childcare, lodging, or time  off from work.                                time  1145    That is why it is essential that we also pass H.R. 8296, the Women's  Health Protection Act of 2022, which would protect the right to  abortion nationwide. The House has already passed this bill, but the  Senate Republicans have twice blocked its passage. This is  unacceptable. We must do everything we can to ensure protection of  abortion access in a post-Roe world.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on both H.R. 8297  and H.R. 8296.   But this is not enough either. We face a radical Supreme Court  deliberately packed with extremists by a plot by the Federalist  Society, by Mitch McConnell, and by Donald Trump to pack the Supreme  Court with extremists who have no regard for our liberties and who will  destroy every liberty we have if we don't do something about it. That  is why Congressman Johnson, Congressman Jones, Senator Markey, and I  have introduced legislation to unpack the Supreme Court by increasing  the number of Justices by four.
