 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this  resolution.   After carefully reviewing all of the evidence and the Articles of  Impeachment before us, it is clear that President Trump abused the  power of the Presidency and obstructed Congress.   I did not come to this conclusion lightly.   Impeachment is an extremely serious matter, but no President can be  allowed to pressure a foreign country for personal and political gain.  No President is above the law.   His behavior has jeopardized the integrity of our elections, put our  national security at risk, and placed his personal interests above  those of the American people.   His obstruction has prevented the House from conducting its  constitutional duty of oversight of the executive branch.   By failing to uphold his oath of office, President Trump forces each  of us as Members of the House of Representatives to uphold ours.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do just that, and defend our  democracy.
