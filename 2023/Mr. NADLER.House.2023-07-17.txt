 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 111, the Providing  Accountability Through Transparency Act of 2023.   This simple but important legislation would require our regulatory  agencies to provide a summary in no more than 100 words and in plain  language of proposed rules on Regulations.gov, thus providing the  American public with more transparency and easy understanding of new  rules and regulations.   The Administrative Procedure Act already requires that the public be  informed and have the chance to provide feedback to our agencies on the  rules that they are contemplating.   This bill, though, would bring a new level of transparency to our  agencies' hard work by giving the public a simple and easy-to- understand summary of possible new rules that might affect them or  their business.   I also commend this bill's sponsors for requiring that the summary is  made available online. Transparency and accessibility must go hand in  hand.   This legislation has already passed the Senate. I urge my colleagues  to support it and send it to the President for his signature.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, this is good legislation that will provide transparency  to the regulatory process. I urge all Members to support it, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
