 America, we have lift off. In a surge of fire, thunder, and  smoke, Artemis I lit the early morning sky and was launched into the  cosmos. At 9 million pounds of thrust, Artemis I is the most powerful  rocket ever launched from the Earth. I was honored to see this historic  flight firsthand early yesterday morning.   Now, after 50 years, America takes its first major step toward going  back to the Moon; and we are bringing our many international partners  with us, including the EU, Japan, Canada, and other allies.   In Central Florida, we locals beam with pride that Artemis launched  from the storied 39B pad from Cape Canaveral.   This first mission was a long time in the making. The Orion  spacecraft began to be developed during the Constellation program from  2005-2010.   In 2017, I was proud to vote formally to establish the Artemis  program. Over the next 5 years, America got to work, including every  State. Many Central Floridians helped build or assemble the Orion  capsule, the Space Launch System, the crawler transporter, and other  components.   During that 5-year period, NASA and SpaceX also kept busy on another  key project, launching the Crew Dragon spacecraft. On May 30, 2020, I  saw, firsthand, Astronauts Bob and Doug launch in the Spacecraft  Endeavour and dock at the International Space Station. This was the  first crewed launch from American soil in 9 years.   Since then, we have seen multiple SpaceX and Blue Origin crewed  flights. Travel in low Earth orbit to and from ISS is now a regular  occurrence in Central Florida.   With these flights well in hand, NASA turned its efforts toward deep  space exploration once again. As the most powerful rocket ever to fly  from the Earth, we knew the first Artemis launch would never be easy.  But America never gives up.   It turned out that, after two scrubbed launches, the third time was  the charm. As I stand here this morning, the Orion spacecraft just had  its next burn to set it on a course for a lunar flyby. The closest  approach to the Moon will be on November 21, before entering a distant  retrograde orbit around the moon on November 25. It will roughly travel  1.3 million miles, farther than any other crew-designed spacecraft that  has ever traveled.   It is a test flight, of course, so we will push Orion's capabilities  to the maximum to ensure it is safe for future astronauts. Then Orion  will return to the Earth in about 25\1/2\ days. After that, NASA will  construct extensive evaluations of the returning Orion capsule.   From there, the future of crewed lunar spaceflight will begin to  accelerate. In 2024, Artemis II will be the first crewed launch around  the Moon in a new craft. In 2025, Artemis III crew will have the first  woman and next man land on the Moon. And in 2027, Artemis IV will dock  with the Lunar Gateway Space Station and begin our permanent presence  on the Moon.   We will seek to discover water, learn from the harsh lunar  environment, and advance new technologies. By the 2030s, these  experiences and innovations will help us prepare to go to Mars and  beyond.   For today, let us take a moment to appreciate and thank the  tremendous accomplishments of Administrator Bill Nelson and the amazing  people at NASA. Yesterday was a critical milestone in our country's  space history. This is a first major step for America to go back to the  Moon, and then on to Mars and beyond.                            ____________________
