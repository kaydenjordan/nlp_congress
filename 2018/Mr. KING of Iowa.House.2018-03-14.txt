 Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Harris for leading on this  Special Order here this evening and appreciate the opportunity to be  recognized.   There are a number of things that I would point out. For starters, I  chair the Constitution Committee for a reason, and the delivery by Mr.  LaMalfa on California's horrible Reproductive FACT Act law--it is not  facts, by the way, but it forces pro-life pregnancy centers to provide  free advertising for the abortion industry.   I don't think there is any question, if you coerce people to  advertise for something that, in the first place, is immoral and  directly runs against the convictions of the people who are  volunteering their time and those who are contributing their resources  to bring about a crisis pregnancy center, which is driven by the hearts  of the pro-life community in America--I can hardly think of anything  more important than having that happen.   Now, freedom of speech is one thing. You can't limit speech. But for  a State to impose speech, that is another level. That goes beyond. That  is beyond the pale of the constitutional First Amendment rights.    So as I think about crisis pregnancy centers and what it matters and  how it matters to me and the district that I represent: Not long after  I was elected to Congress, I went to Gabriel's Corner in Council  Bluffs, Iowa. I walked in there, a crisis pregnancy center, a building  that was built in what was an empty lot across the street from Planned  Parenthood's abortion center. As I walked in there, they had a big  picture window they had set up and a kneeler there so that you could be  there to look out through that window and pray for those mothers who  were going into the Planned Parenthood.   And they said to me in that briefing that if a mother was able to  have a 4D ultrasound then--this would be about, say, 13, 14 years ago-- that 70 percent of the mothers would decide, once they had seen the  ultrasound, to keep the baby.   As we walked through there, we finished the tour, and I said: Where  is your ultrasound?   They said: Well, we don't have one.   I said: Why not?   They said: We can't afford it.   They told me the price on it then was $100,000 for a refurbished  ultrasound. I said: Let's raise the money for the ultrasound so that  you can save 70 percent of the lives of the babies who come in here  because of their mother.   So we set about the fundraising effort. I hardly got started and an  anonymous benefactor showed up and said: Why are you waiting? Why don't  you have the ultrasound?                                time  1830    I answered: We're raising the money.   He said: Well, go buy the ultrasound, but don't tell anybody who I  am.   So he wanted to be an anonymous benefactor. We did that; set up the  ultrasound. The annual dinner for Gabriel's Corner, the first little  baby that was saved by Gabriel's Corner that we knew was brought along  to that dinner. And I looked back in that dinner and there was that man  sitting in the table clear back at the end, not talking to anybody, but  watching. Wow. I have never forgotten what that meant.   Another occasion, an individual came to me and he said: I'm in  between careers. I need something to do.   As we discussed this, it came to the foundational idea to establish  Mary's Choice in Sioux City, Iowa. They went ahead with that, a  Catholic pregnancy center, a crisis pregnancy center. As they followed  through, they built that next to--or they developed it next to Planned  Parenthood's abortion clinic.   Planned Parenthood couldn't stand the guilt of people praying for  them, so they built a big fence, thinking that was going to block the  prayers. Well, I think it attracted them instead. The last time I was  there, I had my picture taken in front of the Planned Parenthood center  in Sioux City. There is a Century 21 real estate sign in front of  there, and you can't read ``Planned Parenthood of the Heartland'' any  [[Page H1591]]  longer on there except in the glue, where they pulled the sign off. It  is for sale, or may be sold by now.   Progress has been made, lives have been saved. The respect for  innocent, unborn human life has grown. And to muzzle them, or force a  speech, not just limiting their freedom of speech, but forcing speech-- so I just looked at my iPhone here, and there are a number of  ultrasounds that have been texted to me. I am kind of like, I guess I  would say, the number one proponent of procreation in Congress, as far  as I know.   Here is one. It says: ``Baby looked good yesterday. Moving like crazy  on the ultrasound.''   I answer: ``This is so beautiful. I'll keep my prayers going. This  ultrasound is an answer to them. God's blessings.''   Next ultrasound comes along. This is dated just last Friday. I sent  back: ``What is the heartbeat rate for this perfect little miracle?''   She answers: ``161 beats per minute.''   And then I say: ``Purring along like a finely-tuned racing motor,  that little miracle.''   ``Yes, and she's moving all around'' is the answer.   And here is the conclusion of this. I just think this is so important  to implant this in our memory.   She answered this way, this mother: ``These ultrasounds are amazing.  Watching her stretch and cross her legs, curl up her hand, suck her  thumb. At 19 weeks, I can't imagine anyone contemplating abortion would  proceed with it after seeing that in their own little baby.''   That little baby is my little granddaughter, and I am going to stand  up for life so long as I live.
