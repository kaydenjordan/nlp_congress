 Mr. Speaker, this gas price surge we are seeing at the  pump wasn't caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It wasn't caused by  COVID-19. It isn't transitory.   It is not even caused by price gouging some are alleging by oil  companies or gas stations. Indeed, the U.S. Secretary of Energy said  there is no gouging due to that.   No, they are all excuses President Biden has tried to use to shift  blame for the increasing prices that he is causing himself.   Mr. President, we know the truth. The American people know the truth.  Sir, your price hike was caused by day one anti-American energy  policies.   Gas prices have increased every single month under the Biden  administration, from his first day in office canceling Keystone,  suspending oil and gas leasing on Federal lands, and draining our  Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  [[Page H5104]]    He has also emboldened Putin by removing sanctions on the Nord Stream  2, therefore making Europe more dependent on Soviet-style energy.   President Biden hasn't taken responsibility for his failed policies.  Instead, he is trying to cover them up or blame others.   We must flip the switch on American energy production and reverse the  Biden failed energy agenda. Putin is making a killing because of this.   We have the wherewithal in this country to influence world prices by  producing ourselves.                            ____________________
