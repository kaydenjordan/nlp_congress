 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of the Caesar Syria Civilian  Protection Act authored by my good friend Chairman Engel.   For nearly 7 years, we have watched the barbaric Assad regime launch  countless attacks on the people of Syria. Since the conflict began in  2011, more than 500,000 people have been killed and 14 million have  been forced from their homes.   This destabilizing exodus has imposed painful burdens on neighboring  countries. Our committee has heard disturbing testimony directly from  Syrians caught up in this horrific nightmare. In fact, I recently met  with the brave defector known to the world as Caesar, for whom this  bill is named.   His story is gut-wrenching. He told me about the shocking scale of  torture and murder being carried out within the prisons of Syria. The  photographic evidence he smuggled out and showed to us proves beyond  any doubt the brutality of Bashar al-Assad. The images are shocking and  indelible.   The bill before us today will increase international pressure on  Assad and his backers by targeting their means of support. Foreign  companies and banks will have to choose between doing business with  Assad or with the United States.   The bill will also sanction anyone who flies weapons or fighters into  Syria to support his murderous regime.   This bill is about creating leverage to push the parties to  negotiate. It is about finding a way forward, to be determined by the  Syrian people, that does not allow Assad to continue to exterminate  them or drive them from their homes.   This bill, as the chairman said, has passed the House twice and is  long overdue. I am confident it will pass tonight, and I hope that the  Senate will take it up promptly in the new Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join us as we seek to ease the  immense suffering of the people of Syria and give them a better hope  for the future, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), an original cosponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I once again recognize the work of Chairman  Engel, his cosponsors, and former Chairman Royce.   Those of us who have talked to eyewitnesses and seen video and photos  will never forget the atrocities perpetrated by Bashar al-Assad: the  bombing of the hospitals, the torture of prisoners, and the gassing of  children who died agonizing deaths in their beds.   For 7 years international diplomats have debated ways to protect  civilians in Syria, with no results. Today, we send a strong message  that the United States will work to ensure that Assad's war machine is  halted.   It is not too late to act, as Mr. Hill eloquently stated. The people  of Syria cannot afford further delay. I urge all Members to support it,  and I sure hope this time the Senate will be able to pass it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill to help Taiwan regain  observer status in the World Health Organization, introduced by my good  friend from Florida (Mr. Yoho).   The House passed this bill unanimously last Congress. Because Taiwan  has an especially distinguished record of international contributions  to global health, Taiwan's exclusion from the WHO is not just unfair,  it is also dangerous.   The world is more and more interconnected, and pandemics are a  constantly growing threat that can cross borders at the speed of a  jetliner. Unfortunately, President Xi and the Communist Party of China  continue to jeopardize global health in their campaign to marginalize  Taiwan.   Taiwan has been totally excluded from participating at the WHO's  World Health Assembly for 2 years running. Ultimately, Taiwan's  expulsion from the WHO illustrates a broader trend. Taiwan is a model  democracy that makes the world better, while China is a revisionist  authoritarian power that places the world at risk.   This year will be significant for U.S.-Taiwan relations as we look  forward to the 40th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act.   Xi Jinping just delivered a speech, where he reiterated a willingness  to use force against Taiwan, and said: ``The Taiwan issue will  disappear with the rejuvenation of the nation.''   I urge my colleagues to start this year on the right foot by  supporting Taiwan's WHO participation and telling President Xi that  Taiwan will never disappear under our watch.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Chabot), a cosponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, diseases and pandemics know no borders. Taiwan is a  critical player in the global health and the internationally connected  transportation hub. By excluding Taiwan from participation in the WHO,  the Communist Party of China is placing the world at risk because of  their own insecurities.   I again thank Mr. Yoho and Chairman Engel for this bill which  deserves our unanimous support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to endorse the NATO Support Act. We are  rapidly approaching the 70th anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization, a fitting time for the House to reaffirm the importance  of the transatlantic alliance.   NATO was born out of the chaos of World War II and built to fortify  European democracies against Soviet totalitarianism. Time and again,  the alliance has proven that the free peoples of the world are  strongest when they stand together.   From the confrontation with communism during the Cold War, to the  defeat of Milosevic in Kosovo, to the battlefields of Afghanistan,  American soldiers and those of her NATO allies have fought and bled  together to protect our country and to make others free.   This alliance has enhanced our military capability, increased our  intelligence collection, and created a bulwark against international  terror. NATO is critical to our national security and to the  preservation of our military prowess around the world.   It solidifies our friendship with the individual countries in the  alliance. But friends also must be honest with each other. That is why  I am glad that this bill strongly supports the decision of the Wales  Summit in 2014, that each member country should ramp up defense  spending to 2 percent of their GDP.   An alliance of mutual defense is only as strong as each country's  commitment to its spending goals. While some member countries have made  great strides toward this commitment, others are still lagging behind.   Statements of support, like this bill, are important in affirming our  relationships around the world. But actions speak louder than words. No  statement about the importance of NATO speaks as loudly as the tangible  commitment each country makes to ensuring the strength of the alliance.   In the meantime, I am glad to join this effort to reaffirm the  continuing importance of NATO, which deserves our full support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in the spirit of the bipartisanship behind  supporting this bill, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia  (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Speaker, let me first say to Mr. Connolly, we have a  lot of passionate partisan debates on this floor, but I have to say,  that was a class act on his part, and I thank him for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Hurd), an original cosponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to  close, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot overstate the critical role that NATO has  played in the history of the 20th century, and for 7 decades, it has  been the cornerstone of international security and a force for freedom  around the world.   I look forward to its continued vitality in defending America and our  allies for another 70 years.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Hack Your State Department Act,  which will help address lingering cybersecurity gaps at the Department  of State.   The massive breach of the State Department's unclassified computer  network in 2014 exposed grave weaknesses.   In the years since that attack, problems have continued to mount. The  Department's cybersecurity response program received a ``D'' rating,  the lowest of any agency, on its Federal Information Security  Management Act report card in 2017.   Last September, the Department revealed that it recently suffered a  breach of its unclassified email system, which exposed the personal  information of some of its employees.   The Department needs cost-effective solutions to these IT security  challenges.   Today's legislation directs the Secretary of State to develop and  implement a vulnerability disclosure process that will allow threat  researchers from the private sector to identify and report  cybersecurity flaws.   Currently, there is no legal avenue that allows them to do so. This  bill fixes that problem.   The bill will establish a ``bug bounty'' pilot program to reward  ethical hackers for discovering and reporting vulnerabilities at the  Department.   These programs have been used successfully by the Defense Department  and numerous private companies to improve their cyber defenses at  minimal cost. In fact, I remember introducing a similar bill for the  Department of Homeland Security.   As a national security agency, the State Department must do more to  secure its networks. The Hack Your State Department Act is a small but  important step towards cost-effective solutions.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the author, Mr. Lieu, for putting his  computer science background to work here in the Congress, and he  understands, I believe, the nature of the threats that we face in the  cyber realm and the importance of a strong cybersecurity partnership  between the public and the private sectors.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In closing, I want to again thank the author, Mr. Lieu, and his  primary sponsor, Mr. Yoho, for this creative effort to harness private- sector know-how to improve cyber defenses at the Department of State.   As the gentleman, Mr. Lieu, indicated, I moved this very same  legislation when I was chairman of the Homeland Security Committee for  the Department of Homeland Security, and I believe it is working very  effectively. The Department of Defense has done the same thing. Now it  is time for the Department of State to take on this challenge as well.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
