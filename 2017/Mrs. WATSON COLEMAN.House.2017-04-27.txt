 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  talent and hard work of the youth in New Jersey's 12th District.   This past weekend, a group of East Brunswick High School students  were recognized as the best team from the Northeast in the We the  People competition. Competing against more than 1,200 students, this  team demonstrated knowledge of constitutional principles in both  historical and contemporary contexts.   This weekend, students from John Witherspoon Middle School of  Princeton and West Windsor-Plainsboro South High School will come to  Washington to compete in the final round of the 2017 National Science  Bowl.   To all of these students: The guidance of your teachers, Alan  Brodman, Bill Merritt, and Sunila Sharma, and your hard work is  evident, and New Jersey's 12th District is very proud of you.   It is an honor to represent a district that continues to emphasize  the importance of STEM and civic education, and encourage our Nation's  youth to thrive.                            ____________________
