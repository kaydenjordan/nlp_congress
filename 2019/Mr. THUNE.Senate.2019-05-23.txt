 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, if you have a leak in your sink or a  dripping pipe in the bathroom, you generally fix it yourself or call a  plumber to fix the problem. You don't look at your otherwise  functioning house and decide to raze it to the ground because of the  plumbing issue. But that is basically what Democrats want to do with  our healthcare system.   Our healthcare system certainly isn't perfect, but our system also  has plenty of positive things going for it: high-  [[Page S3068]]  quality care, choice, access to innovative technology and treatments,  and most Americans are pretty satisfied with their health insurance. So  a logical thing to do would be to fix the problems with our system and  to preserve what is working, but that is not what Democrats want to do.   Democrats want to destroy our current system and replace it with a  single, one-size-fits-all, government-run program known as Medicare for  All.   What will that mean for Americans? Paying more and waiting longer for  worse care.   Medicare for All is estimated to cost $32 trillion or more over 10  years. That is more money than the Federal Government has spent in the  last 8 years, combined, on everything. One Medicare expert estimates  that doubling the amount of individual and corporate income tax  collected would not be enough to cover the cost of Medicare for All. I  don't know about the Democrats, but I don't know too many families who  can afford to have their tax bills double.   Yet it is not just higher taxes. Medicare for All would eliminate  Americans' healthcare choices.   Don't like the one-size-fits-all government healthcare plan? Too bad.  You will not have any other option. Private and employer-sponsored  healthcare will be a thing of the past. Your only choice will be the  government's plan.   Your treatment choices will also be limited. If the government will  not want to pay for a particular cancer treatment, for example, you  will be out of luck. There will be no switching of an insurer to a  better carrier. Unless you have tens or hundreds of thousands of  dollars lying around to cover that treatment option entirely out-of- pocket, you are going to go without.   Then, of course, there are the long wait times that are a hallmark of  socialized medicine. Patients in Canada and the United Kingdom, both of  which have government-run healthcare systems, face tremendous wait  times for care. It can take up to a year to get a medical procedure in  Canada--one of the reasons you hear so many stories about Canadians  coming to the United States for care. Imagine having to wait a year for  your child to get a needed surgery. That is the kind of thing that  parents can look forward to under Medicare for All.   As I said earlier, there are, undoubtedly, parts of our healthcare  system that can be improved, and the Republicans are, in fact,  currently working on legislation to increase access to affordable  medication and to address the issue of surprise billing, but the  solution is not to destroy our current system and force people to pay  more for less choice and worse care.   The Democrats' ideology has outrun their common sense. The  Republicans are committed to improving America's healthcare system and  preserving Americans' healthcare choices. I hope the Democrats will  abandon their plan for government-controlled healthcare and switch  their focus to helping us.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12:45  p.m. today, the Senate proceed to legislative session to consider  Calendar No. 94, S. 151; I further ask that the committee-reported  substitute amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a  third time, and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as amended,  with no intervening action or debate; finally, that if passed, the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call  be rescinded.    Madam President, pretty much every American has had to  deal with illegal robocalls. How many times have you answered the phone  only to discover it is an automated message saying that you have won a  contest that you never entered or asking you to provide personal  information like your bank account or Social Security number?   Illegal robocalls, I think we can all agree, are a major nuisance,  and too often they are not just a nuisance. Scammers use these calls to  successfully prey on vulnerable populations like elderly Americans who  are sometimes less technologically savvy. Scammers target the kind of  personal information that can be used to steal your money and your  identity, and when scammers are successful, the consequences for their  victims can be devastating.   Well, there are laws and fines in place right now to prevent scam  artists from preying on Americans through the telephone. These measures  have been insufficient. In many cases, robocall scammers simply build  the current fines into the cost of doing business. On top of this, the  Federal Communications Commission's enforcement efforts are hampered by  a tight time window for pursuing violators.   That is why I introduced the legislation before us today, the  Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act, or  the TRACED Act, along with my fellow Commerce Committee member, Senator  Markey. The TRACED Act provides tools to discourage illegal robocalls,  protect consumers, and crack down on offenders. It expands the window  in which the FCC can pursue intentional scammers from 1 year to 3  years, and in years 2 and 3, increases the financial penalty for those  individuals making robocalls from zero dollars to $10,000 per call to  make it more difficult for robocallers just to figure fines into the  cost of doing business.   It also requires telephone service providers to adopt new call  verification technologies that would help prevent illegal robocalls  from reaching consumers in the first place. And, importantly, it  convenes a working group with representatives from the Department of  Justice, the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of  Commerce, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, State attorneys  general, and others to identify ways to criminally prosecute illegal  robocalling.   Criminal prosecution of illegal robocalling can be challenging.  Scammers are frequently based abroad and can quickly shut down shop  before authorities have a chance to get to them, but we need to find  ways to hold scammers criminally accountable. When scammers are  successful, they can destroy people's lives, and they should face  criminal prosecution for the damage they do.   I am very pleased that the TRACED Act has attracted a tremendous  amount of support from Members of both parties. In fact, 84 Senators  have signed on as cosponsors of this bill. I am especially grateful to  Senator Markey for partnering with me on this legislation. I appreciate  Chairman Wicker and Ranking Member Cantwell for prioritizing this bill  as they have assumed the reins at the Commerce Committee.   I am also very pleased that this bill has attracted tremendous  support from State governments and industry and consumer groups. All 50  State attorneys general support this bill, and it  [[Page S3075]]  has been embraced by the AARP, Verizon, AT&T, CTIA, USTelecom, NTCA,  Consumer Reports, and a number of other organizations. It is also  supported by all of the current Commissioners at the Federal Trade  Commission and the Federal Communications Commission.   I think we all know that the TRACED Act will not prevent all illegal  robocalling. I think we can all agree it is a big step in the right  direction. It will make life a lot more difficult for scam artists and  help ensure that more scammers face punishment for their crimes. I am  excited the full Senate is voting on this bill today, and I hope that  the House will quickly take it up so that we can get this legislation  to the President's desk.   Before I close, I would be remiss if I didn't quickly thank several  staff members whose tireless efforts helped get us here today. In my  office, I recognize and thank Alex Sachtjen and Nick Rossi. I am  thankful for their dedication and expertise. I thank Dan Ball and  Crystal Tully, who serve on Chairman Wicker's team at the Commerce  Committee, Daniel Greene on Senator Markey's staff, and John Branscome  and Shawn Bone on Ranking Member Cantwell's staff. This truly was a  team effort. I am glad that we have an opportunity to do something that  in a very big bipartisan way will start putting steps forward that will  help prevent something that has become a scourge in the lives of so  many Americans.   I yield the floor.    I appreciate the comments from the Senator from  Massachusetts and also his great work on this. It has been a team  effort and a great partnership. He and I--although in many cases we  represent different parts of the country, we all represent constituents  who care deeply about this issue and want to see their Congress do  something about it.   I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member of the committee.   Madam President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe) and the Senator from South Dakota (Mr.  Rounds).
