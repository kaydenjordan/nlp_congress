 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 261.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5891) to establish an interagency task force to improve the  Federal response to families impacted by substance abuse disorders.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 5891.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have all heard about the opioid epidemic, and I  always feel, despite the fact that it has been very publicized, it has  still been underpublicized. Over 40,000 people every year die of this  epidemic.   I am old enough to remember the Vietnam war, and it was relatively  late in that war before we got to 41,000 deaths, and we all remember  how that divided the country. There are more people that die in this  year, every year, than the number of people who are both murdered and  die in car accidents combined.   I am on a variety of committees, and if you sit on almost any  committee, I think, in this institution, eventually the topic of opioid  abuse comes up. One of the things that hits me when it comes up is the  degree to which there are varying opinions on what to do with this, and  it varies from agency to agency.   Therefore, what I am proposing in this bill is a task force that gets  together two representatives from the Department of Health and Human  Services, the Department of Education, the Department of Agriculture,  and the Department of Labor to look for solutions and look for best  practices. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is also supposed  to appoint four other members to this task force.   I don't want this to be one of the task forces that is hanging out  there for too long. They have got to come back with recommendations  within 9 months, and, hopefully, we will use these recommendations by  this time next year on this floor.   It is very frustrating, like I said, to attend these hearings and  hear, among the experts, such divergent opinions as to how to save some  lives here. We really cannot be spending more time on programs that  don't work or having the agencies not work with each other.   I look forward to strong leadership in this committee. I expect that  they will be taking advice from strong local leaders who have done what  they can to address this epidemic around the country. We must put our  full weight behind a coordinated strategy to bring stability and health  to our communities.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my final comment on this issue, first of all, for the  folks back home, is that when politicians talk about resources, they  really mean money. Back in Wisconsin, when I think of resources, I  think of timber, iron ore, oil, gas, and that sort of thing. But up  here, I guess when we talk about resources, we mean money.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my Democratic colleagues for  making this a fine piece of bipartisan legislation. I hope when the  recommendations come back in 9 months, we can have another nice big  bipartisan vote and move the recommendations out.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
