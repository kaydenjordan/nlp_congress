 Mr. Speaker, today, I join my colleagues in celebrating  National Girls and Women in Sports Day.   Our female athletes deserve a level playing field in competitive  sports. Unfortunately, that is under attack today by the far left.   The far left's gender interpretation has created chaos in women's  sports. Biological men who would otherwise not be competitive in male  sports can now identify as women and dominate girls' sports. Time and  again, we have seen biological men win championships in women's and  girls' swimming, running, and wrestling.   By distorting reality, the left has made a mockery of competitive  sports and has forced many talented female athletes to watch as their  dreams are being crushed by biological males.   Mr. Speaker, whatever happened to the fight for Title IX so women's  sports and activities could be on their own and have equal opportunity?   It is time for logic and reason to return to the discussion.  Biological men have no place competing in women's sports.   We have gender-specific sports for a reason: Men and women are  biologically different. That is not news.   Women and girls deserve to have their own women-only sports.                            ____________________
