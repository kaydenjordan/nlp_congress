 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 50th  anniversary of Special Olympics Wyoming, an organization that has made  a profound difference in the lives of many Wyoming citizens.   In October, Special Olympics Wyoming will celebrate its 50th  anniversary held in conjunction with its annual State Fall Tournament  in Casper.   Special Olympics was founded in 1962 by Eunice Kennedy Shriver. It  began in Maryland as a summer camp for youth with intellectual  disabilities. Rosemary Kennedy, Eunice's sister, had an intellectual  disability and was the inspiration for Eunice. By 1968, Special  Olympics had become a worldwide sensation. Over 1,000 participants  competed in the first International Special Olympics Games in Chicago.   Special Olympics Wyoming was established 10 years later in 1972 by  Helen and Lloyd Wampler. Their first event was the Wyoming Summer Games  at Natrona County High School, where 215 athletes competed in track and  field or swimming.   Special Olympics Wyoming offers year-round athletic and sports  training for youth and adults who have an intellectual disability. They  provide ``opportunities to develop physical fitness skills, express  courage, experience joy and participate in the sharing of talents,  skills and friendship with their families, friends, other Special  Olympics athletes and the community.''   As the Wyoming athletes strive to meet their athletic goals, their  participation and success within the program accentuates why Special  Olympics Wyoming was started. Today, there are roughly 1,600 active  athletes throughout Wyoming who participate in 16 different sports.   Special Olympics Wyoming hosts five annual statewide events that  promote healthy competition, refine athletic skills, and build  friendships statewide. These events include the State Winter Games,  State Summer Games, Summer Sports Classic, Equestrian Show, and the  State Fall Tournament.   Former Special Olympics Wyoming CEO, Priscilla Dowse, is an  exceptional example of this type of dedication. During her 44-year  involvement in the program, Dowse more than tripled the number of  athletes, expanded the unified partners from 70 to 525, and increased  fundraising efforts from $15,000 to $186,000 with the partnership from  Wyoming law enforcement.   Her commitment to Special Olympics Wyoming led her to travel  internationally and incorporate different training and leadership  programs in an effort to improve Special Olympics Wyoming. Dowse  described Special Olympics Wyoming as `` . . . a place that individuals  with intellectual disabilities had a place to shine, to be successful,  to have fun and laugh. And I was mesmerized,''   Since Dowse's retirement, the organization has continued to grow  under the leadership of Jen Haines. As Dowse said ``if you put a team  together, there's almost nothing they can't do.'' Jen's unwavering  commitment will be a strong asset as the organization continues to  thrive.   The mission of Special Olympics Wyoming would not be possible without  the resolute dedication of their staff members, coaches, volunteers and  mentors contributing their time and expertise to the athletes. Current  Staff and Board Members are:    Jennifer Haines--CEO & President   Tara Short--Vice President of Development   Bobby Casey--Vice President of Programs   Laura Kelly--Director of Program Services   Cathy Bisiar--Direct of Law Enforcement Torch Run   Christine Rodriguez--Office Administrator   Erin Gamroth--Marketing & Communications Coordinator   Molly Blomstrom--Office Assistant   Jessica Purdum--Director of Unified Champion Schools   Karen Beddoes--Area I Director   Chrissy Bowns--Area II Director   Marsha Dial--Area III Director   Carrie Pilcher--Area IV Director                              Board of Directors    Chair: Ron Casalenda, Douglas Police Department (retired)   Vice-Chair: Carolyn Griffith, the City of Casper (retired)   Treasurer: KieLee Ellsworth, Porter, Muirhead, Cornia & Howard   Secretary: Tiffany Vermillion   Bill Rogers, Jonah Bank   Kerry Namken, Platte Valley Bank   Lisa Foutz, Fremont County School District #1   Phil Grabrick, Gillette WY   Taryn Blackett, Natrona County SD # 1   Jen Haines, President & CEO (ex-officio)   Tess Robinson, Casper Senior Center--Athlete Representative    It is an honor for me to rise in recognition of this significant  milestone for Special Olympics Wyoming. The impact and opportunities  Special Olympics Wyoming has created for people living with  intellectual disabilities is incredible. Bobbi joins me in extending  our congratulations to Special Olympics Wyoming on their 50th  anniversary.                            ____________________
