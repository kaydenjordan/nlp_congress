 Mr. President, I move to proceed to S. 1.    Mr. President, later today--on day 34 of this partial  government shutdown--the Senate will be voting on a proposal to finally  end it. We will be voting on the one plan--the only one on the table-- that would reopen the shuttered portions of the Federal Government. It  is a pragmatic compromise that could end this impasse right away.   The choice is absolutely clear, and the Nation is watching. Members  can vote to immediately reopen the entire government with a compromise  package that the President will actually sign, or they can hold out for  the Democratic leader's dead-end proposal that stands no chance of  earning the President's signature and ending the partial shutdown.   The President's compromise would accomplish three things. First, it  ends the shutdown and resumes pay for Federal workers right away.  Second, it strikes a bipartisan compromise on the issue of immigration  and border security with ideas from both sides. Third, it provides  stable, full-year funding for the Federal Government, not another  short-term bandaid.   First, ending the shutdown. We have heard from Federal workers whose  lives are in disarray. We have heard about the family hardships caused  by the Democrats' unwillingness to sit down and negotiate with the  President. We have heard from those who have endured over a month  without pay. We have heard from the men and women of the U.S. Coast  Guard, air traffic controllers, TSA agents, and other Federal  employees. Every American deserves a fully operational government.  Taxpayers aren't getting special tax refunds for these weeks when  services and Agencies have been diminished or are unavailable.   The President has been at the negotiating table, ready to talk and to  fix it. Democrats have made the opposite political calculation, and our  Nation is paying the price.   The way forward is simple. We all know the ground rules. We need a  compromise that can pass both Chambers and earn the Presidential  signature. That is the way you make a law in this country. The first  proposal we will vote on today is the only legislation that exists with  any chance of checking those boxes--getting the President's signature  and making a law.   On immigration and border security, this legislation provides the  resources the men and women who risk their own safety to defend our  border tell us are necessary. In the past year, we have watched as  apprehensions of family units at the borders have risen--more young  people brought into danger.   They have seen more interdiction of illicit substances like heroin,  methamphetamine, and fentanyl and higher rates of attempted crossings  by gang members and criminals.   The need for more security on our border is not a partisan invention.  It is a fact. It is a reality most Senate Democrats readily admit.   One Senate Democrat said: ``I'm willing to support more border  security.''   Another said: ``Certainly, you need barriers. And we support  barriers.''   Not to be outdone, a third said: ``I'm a huge advocate of border  security.''  [[Page S542]]    If they agree with the need, they should agree with this modest  proposal. It would fund new enforcement and surveillance technologies,  recruiting and training hundreds of new Border Patrol agents, and it  would direct about one one-thousandth of Federal discretionary spending  for physical barriers along the highest priority sections of the  border--barriers like the ones that the current Democratic leader  joined then-Senators Obama, Biden, and Clinton in supporting back in  2006; like the barriers constructed by President Obama's own  administration; like the barriers in which many of my Democratic  colleagues happily voted to invest billions of dollars during the last  Congress.   These commonsense physical barriers were a bipartisan point of  agreement until about 5 minutes ago, but the President went even  further to win Democrats' support. For example, his proposal also  provides for a 3-year legal status for certain individuals currently  covered by DACA and TPS.   That is what this law provides: the border security we need, plus  actual statutory authorization for DACA recipients, written into law,  for the first time--not the unilateral hand-waving of the Obama  administration.   Finally, this bill would complete the full-year appropriations that  both parties worked very hard on last year. The last thing we need is  another temporary measure. Last year's appropriations process left  stable, bipartisan funding measures on the 1-yard line. We don't need  to punt from the 1-yard line and set up another crisis just like this a  couple of weeks from now. We need to finish our work and run these  seven full-year bipartisan funding bills into the end zone--into the  end zone--and finish last year's work.   Let me conclude by simply stating what will be on display in this  Chamber today. The American people will see plainly which Senators want  to make a law and clean up this mess and which Senators are content to  continue making political points and nothing else.   Making law versus making points, that is a choice. Any one of my  Democratic colleagues who rejects the compromise offer but votes for  the Democratic leader's partisan showmanship will be saying the  following: They will be saying that political fights with the President  matter more--more--than Federal workers and their families, border  security, DACA and TPS recipients, as well as government funding.   Let me say that again. If my Democratic colleagues reverse their  voting records on border security, if they decide that spending one  one-thousandth of Federal spending on Obama-style steel barriers has  become totally impermissible just because President Trump is in the  White House, then, they will be saying that political games outrank  Federal workers, the Coast Guard, DACA recipients, TPS recipients, and  all their constituents, as far as this Democratic Party is concerned.   Deep down, my friends across the aisle know this is not a reasonable  reaction to a President of the other party. They know the Speaker of  the House is unreasonable on these subjects, with her own Members and  her own House majority leader openly contradicting her on national  television, and that Senate Democrats are not obligated to go down with  her ship.   They know that denying the President one-tenth of 1 percent for  spending on needed border security is not worth hurting this many  people. It is obvious what the Senate needs to do.   Today, we will decide whether we turn a new corner and begin putting  the last month behind us or whether we will all continue to show up for  work, stuck in exactly the same situation.   Only one bill does all the bipartisan things I discussed. Only one  bill has any chance whatsoever of becoming law. So we ought to vote for  it.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, I move to instruct the Sergeant at Arms  to request the presence of absent Senators, and I ask for the yeas and  nays.    Madam President, I withdraw my motion to proceed to S.  1.    Madam President, what is the pending business?                            ____________________     I send a cloture motion to the desk for Senate  amendment No. 5.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk  for Senate amendment No. 6.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls be waived.    Madam President, I move to proceed to S. 1.
