 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Madam President, last Friday, America watched in horror  as the news story broke of yet another school shooting, this time at  Santa Fe High School in Texas.   Eight students and two teachers were fatally shot. Thirteen victims  were wounded in another devastating tragedy. The alleged gunman was a  student who came into the school with his parents' shotgun and handgun  and used them to commit mass murder.   Of course, we grieve for the families and victims in Santa Fe, and,  of course, we are grateful for first responders who ran toward the  sound of gunfire. But let's be honest--the shooting in Santa Fe High  was, by one count, the 22nd school shooting in America this year. We  are in the 21st week of this year. We have had more than one school  shooting a week in the United States of America. America's  schoolchildren, sadly, now go to school expecting that there will be a  shooter on the premises.   After the Santa Fe High School shooting, a reporter interviewed a  student named Paige Curry at the school. The reporter asked: ``Was  there a part of you that was like, this isn't real, this could not  happen at my school?''   Paige Curry replied: ``There wasn't.''   When the reporter asked why so, she said: ``It's been happening  everywhere. I've always felt it would eventually happen here too.''   Can you imagine we have reached this point in America if that is how  many of our Nation's high schoolers think? Sadly, in Paige Curry's  case, she was right. Her school was the target last week.   On Sunday, the New York Times posted an article titled ``New Reality  for High School Students: Calculating the Risk of Getting Shot.''   The article discussed how students across America, from Iowa to  Oklahoma, from Illinois to Mississippi, from Seattle to New York, are  now forced to go through their day planning what they would do if the  shooting starts in their school.   The article quotes one student, a sophomore in a New York high  school, describing how vulnerable her desks were in each class where  she sat.   She started making mental calculations about when the gunman came to  the door whether she would be in the line of fire. She said her English  class is the safest class for her each day because it is down a  hallway, and it makes it hard for the shooter to find it, but her math  class makes her particularly vulnerable because she said she sits in  the second desk in the second row in a direct path from the door. The  student, whose name is Emily Rubenstein, said:         It's like the front lines of a war. Being seated in front       of the classroom could be what makes you live and what makes       you die.    It is not just high schoolers who think this way; my 6-year-old  granddaughter came home and told her mom recently that she had been  warned that if there is a shooter in the school--she is a first- grader--if there is a shooter in the school, stay away from the windows  and get down on the floor as quickly as possible.   Is there any sane person in America who thinks our kids should be  going  [[Page S2803]]  through this? Is there any sane person in America who believes this is  expected by the Second Amendment to our Bill of Rights?   Let's be clear. Addressing our Nation's epidemic of gun violence and  school shootings should be a top priority. About 300 Americans are shot  every day, a third of them fatally. Gun violence is a public health  crisis. It is traumatizing an entire generation of America's kids.   In recent weeks, students across the country have marched in the  streets, walked out of their classrooms to call on us--elected  leaders--to step up and do something to reduce gun violence. The  students are having an impact. At least 15 States have passed  legislation to close gaps in their State gun laws since February 14,  which was the date of the Parkland shooting in Florida. Four States-- Maryland, Florida, Vermont, and Washington--have passed bills to ban  bump stocks. Congress has not. Seven States have passed bills to make  it harder for domestic violence abusers to get guns--Kansas, New York,  Ohio, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, and Washington. Congress has not. Three  States have passed red flag laws to temporarily remove guns from people  who pose extreme risks--Florida, Maryland, and Vermont.   These State-level reforms are significant, and they are even  happening in States such as Florida and Kansas, which have a reputation  of being friendly to the gun lobby. I hope my State of Illinois will  soon join the ranks of the States that have passed meaningful State- level gun measures this year. We came close in Illinois when the  General Assembly passed a landmark, bipartisan bill to provide more  accountability for gun dealers' sales. Governor Bruce Rauner  unfortunately vetoed that bill, but the General Assembly is working  hard to put a revised bill back on his desk.   In addition to these State law reforms, the student movement has  brought major changes in corporate behavior. Major gun retailers, such  as Dick's Sporting Goods and Walmart, have voluntarily changed their  sales practices. Companies such as Delta, United, Hertz, and Avis ended  affinity relationships with the National Rifle Association.  Institutional investors and financial companies are now pressuring the  gun industry to change its behavior. These businesses understand that  inaction is not an option. The student movement for gun safety has  helped them realize this.   Unfortunately, it is extremely unlikely that this Congress will take  any meaningful action this year to reduce gun violence in America. Why?  Because President Trump and the Republican majority in Congress still  won't push for any gun reforms that the gun lobby opposes. They are  letting the gun lobby dictate Federal policy. That is a mistake. It is  disgraceful. The gun lobby cares about one thing above all else:  selling guns. They are not going to support any reforms that might  reduce their sales.   On Sunday, the incoming president of the National Rifle Association,  Oliver North--you may remember him from the Iran-Contra controversy-- blamed everything from video games to Ritalin for our epidemic of  school shootings. He blamed everything except guns.   In fact, rather than support efforts to strengthen our gun laws, the  gun lobby is gearing up for their last big push this year to urge  Congress to weaken our gun laws even further. On April 16, the  Washington Examiner reported that longtime NRA board member Grover  Norquist ``said he has received assurance from the Republican  leadership'' that Congress will put the NRA's concealed carry  reciprocity bill on the agenda this year before the August recess.   Make no mistake--as appropriations bills and the Defense  authorization bill move through Congress, the gun lobby and their  allies are looking to weaken the gun laws on the books even more than  they already have. America, keep your eye on Congress.   To all the students and young people across America who are asking  for leadership when it comes to reducing gun violence, many of us hear  you loud and clear, and we are not giving up. Congress may not get the  job done this year when it comes to closing the enormous gaps in our  gun laws, but this movement of young people is making incredible things  happen in statehouses across America. They are rapidly becoming a major  force for change in corporate behavior, and they are soon-to-be voters.  This movement is getting results, and Congress is going to have to  choose whom it will listen to--the students who are spending their  class time thinking about whether their desks are in the line of fire  or the gun lobbyists who want to further weaken gun laws on the books  so they can make more gun sales.   I know where I stand. I am going to keep doing everything I can to  put the safety of my granddaughter, my grandson, and kids in our  neighborhoods across America ahead of the gun lobby's agenda of selling  more guns. We may not be able to stop every shooting in our schools and  in our streets, but if Congress takes meaningful action to close the  gaps in our gun laws, we will save lives.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet),  the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Cardin), and the Senator from Illinois  (Ms. Duckworth) are necessarily absent.
