 Mr. Chair, recently, hospital staff and  healthcare providers in my district shared with me that their emergency  rooms are filled with children and teens struggling with their mental  health.   We know rates of youth anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation  have skyrocketed across the country. While this was a problem before  COVID, the pandemic has made it so much worse. This is a national  emergency, specifically in our schools.   Last year, 75 percent of public schools reported increased concerns  around students showing trauma symptoms. Yet, only half of those  schools felt they had the resources to be able to address students'  mental health needs. Our children need help, and our parents need a  place to turn.   The Mental Health Matters Act includes legislation to address the  critical and unmet needs for school-based mental health providers.   My legislation establishes a 5-year grant program to recruit and  retain counselors in public schools, ensuring that whether you are in  Head Start or high school, kids have the mental health care support  they need to be healthy and thrive.   Mr. Chair, a ``yes'' vote today for this act is a vote for a healthy  future for all.
