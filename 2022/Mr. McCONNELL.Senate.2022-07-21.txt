 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, Washington Democrats' one-party  government has actually performed an amazing feat. In 18 months, they  have taken an economy that was ready to soar and completely derailed it  with $2 trillion in unnecessary borrowing, printing, and spending. Now,  9.1 percent inflation is pinching hard-working Americans every time  they visit the gas pump or the grocery store.   The Biden administration has tried their hardest to find a silver  lining amid the economic storm clouds they helped create. They have  touted the strength of consumer spending to conclude our economy is  strong. That is what they said. Well, of course, consumer spending has  only gone up because the price of nearly everything has increased. A  recent economic analysis shows the American people do spend more on  gas, groceries, furniture, and clothes than we used to, but--listen to  this--adjusted for inflation, they are actually consuming less--paying  more, getting less.   Parents of school-age kids are some of the hardest hit. Four in ten  say they won't go back-to-school shopping before the upcoming school  year. One young mother in Nevada says she will ``pick out one or two  shirts'' for her daughter ``and that's it.'' Inflation has made  everything else too expensive.   Over in Arizona, inflation forces the average household to spend over  $9,600 more a year compared to when President Biden took office. Many  families simply don't have that much wiggle room in their budgets and  are resorting to desperate measures simply to stay afloat.   One Phoenix area food bank has seen a 78-percent increase in visitors  compared with just last year--78 percent more families who simply can't  afford to live in this Democrat-run economy. A woman in line at the  food bank said she had never needed to visit one before but ``the  prices are way too high'' right now to support four children on her  husband's salary.   Colorado families are facing the highest inflation costs in the  Nation, in the whole country: nearly $10,900 in extra spending per year  compared to the beginning of the Biden administration. Not  surprisingly, Coloradans are falling behind on paying for daily  necessities. One pawn shop owner in the State has noticed a marked  increase in loan seekers at his business. For most of them, they just  need ``30 bucks, 40 bucks'' to ``pay small bills, get gas, put  groceries on the table.''   This is all happening in my home State of Kentucky as well. People  are taking out loans, cutting back spending, and relying on charity  just to cope with ever-increasing prices. But that hasn't stopped  Washington Democrats from proposing new ways to wreck our economy. As  we speak, they are batting around a new suite of tax hikes aimed  squarely at the middle class. If Democrat-driven inflation hasn't  pushed struggling families off the edge quite yet, the Democrat-driven  recession certainly will finish the job.   So what is on the menu? New taxes on small businesses already  struggling with inflation, new fees and regulations on American energy  producers that will send prices even higher at the pump, new socialist  price control schemes to stifle healthcare innovation.   Apparently, record inflation isn't enough to make Democrats realize  their reckless economic agenda is a failure, an abject failure. Maybe  tax-hike-induced stagflation will set them straight.                                   Ukraine    Madam President, now on another matter, I had the honor, along with  others, of greeting the First Lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska, who  greeted us here in the Capitol. Like my colleagues in the room, I was  moved by her blunt, plaintive remarks to Congress. As her country  endures the fifth month of a brutal Russian siege, Ms. Zelenska was  candid about the pain and suffering Russia's unprovoked war of  aggression was causing her homeland. She said: ``Russia is destroying  our people.''   The First Lady conveyed the incredible determination of the Ukrainian  people and echoed their simple request for the tools to fight their own  fight--``Weapons,'' she said, ``to protect one's home and the right to  wake up alive in that home.''   I hope the First Lady's visit helped steel our colleagues' resolve as  friends of Ukraine. Russia's invasion has already reminded the West  that revisionist aggressors cannot be appeased. And Ukraine's brave  resistance, equipped with the arsenal of the free world, is a further  reminder that this is a fight they intend to win.   The Senate should be proud of our work over the past several months  to get more lethal capabilities into Ukrainian hands. But at every step  of the way, the Biden administration has been a bit slow to green light  the game-changing weapons Ukraine's frontline defenders actually need.   I urged the President for more than a year to take specific actions  to deter Russian aggression against Ukraine--actually, before it  escalated. Last June, I urged him to deliver lethal capabilities to  Ukraine and other states in Vladimir Putin's crosshairs. Instead, the  administration slow-walked security assistance for months.   In December, I called for U.S. military reinforcements along NATO's  eastern flank, but the President waited until February to deploy  forces--too late to deter Putin's aggression. And even after Russia had  launched its unlawful invasion, the President has repeatedly deterred  himself from providing Ukraine the capabilities it needs.   With nearly every weapons system requested by Ukraine, the cycle in  Washington plays out like this: first, hesitation and concern; then,  excuses that Ukraine couldn't effectively use the proposed weapons or  objections that providing them would escalate the conflict; then-- then--grudging willingness to transfer the weapons; and finally, with  weapons in Ukrainian hands, self-congratulations from the Biden  administration that they are having a positive impact on the  battlefield. It is exhausting to watch this decision-making cycle  repeat itself from Kentucky. It must be exacerbating to watch it from  Kyiv.   The need for advanced, longer-range weapons to turn back Russia's  aggression is painfully obvious. Air defense capabilities to combat  Russia's continuing long-range strikes against civilian populations  across Ukraine, anti-ship weapons to combat the Russia Black Sea  blockade and the humanitarian food crisis it is causing worldwide, and  more capable, longer-range artillery to pound Russian positions in  occupied Ukraine from relative safety--this will help offset any  numerical advantage Russia has achieved by pumping so much more combat  power into its invasion force.  [[Page S3584]]    So here it is. Putin cannot be allowed to believe he can just wait  for the West to become complacent. It would do a moral disservice to  the brave Ukrainians fighting every single day for their country. But  this is not just about Ukraine's security. If Russia achieves its  objective in Ukraine, it will imperil our own security. And if we  waiver--if we waiver--on Ukraine, it would certainly send an  unmistakable signal of weakness to Beijing, which is watching the  conflict in Ukraine very closely.   For their part, so are our friends and allies in China's backyard. As  Japan's Prime Minister put it back in May: ``Ukraine might be East Asia  tomorrow.''   Russia's brutal war has cost the people of Ukraine their homes, their  safety, and their lives. But it has also reawakened the West to the  reality of long-term deterrence and competition.   It has led modern partners like Sweden and Finland to cast their lot  with the greatest military alliance in the history of the world. And it  has prompted current treaty allies to shake off years of neglect for  their own defense capabilities. All of this will result in greater  burden-sharing, interoperability, military capability, and collective  security for the NATO alliance.   The United States cannot afford to neglect this lesson ourselves. As  the leader of the free world and the No. 1 target of revisionist  adversaries like China and Russia, we have to take seriously our  obligation to maintain America's military superiority.   We need to act quickly and pass a defense authorization bill that  restores our readiness, grows our stockpiles of critical munitions,  reinforces our position along NATO's eastern flank, and lays the  foundations for a new era of credible deterrence in Asia by modernizing  and equipping our military for real competition with China.   I hope the Democratic leader will let the Senate take action on this  critical legislation without further delay.
