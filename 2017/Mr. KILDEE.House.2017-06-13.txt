 Mr. Speaker, the American people are speaking up, and  they are absolutely terrified of the Republican healthcare plan,  TrumpCare. According to a FOX News poll, two-thirds of Americans  disapprove of TrumpCare. That's a FOX News poll.   Why? Because it will take away healthcare from 23 million Americans.  For those who still have the good fortune of being able to get  insurance, they will pay more for worse care. If you are age 50 to 65,  fasten your seatbelts; you are about to pay five times what others will  pay for health insurance and for prescription drugs.   Of course, in the Senate, they are crafting their version of  TrumpCare in secret, behind closed doors. Nobody knows what is in it.  Why? Because they know the American people will reject it.   We know we have got issues we have to deal with in healthcare. No law  is perfect, and the ACA is one of those. But my goodness, you cannot do  this behind closed doors. We have to do this in public. People need to  understand what Congress is doing. We have got to get it right, and we  have to do it in the open.                            ____________________
