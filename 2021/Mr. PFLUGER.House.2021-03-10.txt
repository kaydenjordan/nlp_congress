 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a Texan, a constitutional  conservative, and in strong opposition not only to the amendments but  to H.R. 8, a bill that would impose so-called universal background  checks and gut the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners  throughout this country.   We all mourn the loss of innocent lives from gun violence that has  happened in my district and in those around the country. No family  should ever have to endure such tragic and terrible unnecessary loss.   But the truth is that this legislation does nothing to address the  root causes of gun violence and may do little to actually prevent  criminals from obtaining guns, as has previously been said during this  debate.   What will be prevented, though? Your ability to lend your neighbor a  [[Page H1301]]  firearm if there are reports of break-ins; the ability of your suicidal  friend or family member to ask you to remove their firearms from their  home; or if a colleague comes to you and says that they are trapped in  an abusive relationship and scared for their life, you could face a  $100,000 fine or prison time for lending out your gun for self-defense.   If we are going to effect real change, we don't need to tack  additional restrictions on law-abiding citizens. We need to look at the  root causes and have a transparent and open debate here to talk about  mental health and the proper enforcement of laws that we already have.   This is yet another example of Federal overreach, another example of  the erosion of our rights, and a slippery slope that will strip all  Americans of our Second Amendment rights as outlined in the  Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment and  the bill.
