 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to  honor the life and service of U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Kyle McKee.   Staff Sergeant McKee was killed on November 12 in a Black Hawk  helicopter crash during a routine peacekeeping mission in Egypt. He was  one of five American soldiers who lost their lives in that crash, all  members of the Multinational Force and Observers, which oversees the  peace agreement reached between Egypt and Israel as part of the Camp  David Accords of 1978.   This tragic loss of life came less than 24 hours after our Nation  observed Veterans Day, and it is a somber reminder that the security  and the freedoms we enjoy each and every day are not free. They are  paid for by the service and sacrifice of brave men and women in uniform  like Staff Sergeant McKee.   Originally from Leroy Township, Staff Sergeant McKee graduated from  Riverside High School in 2003 and followed in both his father's and  brother's footsteps when he enlisted in the Army that same year.   In the 17 years that have passed since, he served as a crew chief in  Iraq, Afghanistan, and Korea, receiving numerous awards and  decorations, including the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the  National Defense Service Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, and both  the Army Commendation and Achievement Medals.   I could go on. The list of Staff Sergeant McKee's military accolades  is not a short one.   But he wasn't just a patriot who stepped up to serve his country. He  was also a dedicated husband to his wife, Nikki, and a father to not  only two sons but his daughter, who is expected to be born any day now.   As a father of three myself, I can't begin to imagine the pain his  family is feeling right now.   I invite the entire northeast Ohio community to join Kelly and me in  keeping them in our prayers and giving them strength and support during  this difficult time.   I know this entire Chamber is forever grateful to Staff Sergeant  McKee for his service, so I would like to conclude by requesting a  moment of silence to honor his life and pray for his loved ones.                            ____________________
