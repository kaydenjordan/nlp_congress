 Mr. Speaker, 54 years ago, our country made a commitment  to older Americans and their families. In 1965, the Older Americans Act  was enacted to support a wide range of services and programs for  individuals over the age of 60. By passing this legislation, Congress  made a promise to help provide compassionate care to our Nation's most  vulnerable adults who are sometimes exploited, abused, or neglected.    This legislation is vital to Georgia's seniors, and it supports many  important community-based services like nutrition programs at churches  and family caregiver support.   I have seen the benefits of these programs firsthand, as I have had  several opportunities to deliver Meals on Wheels to those who are  unable to grocery shop or prepare a warm meal for themselves. What a  privilege, as a Member of Congress, to visit with these older adults  and talk to them about their contribution to this great country as we  delivered these meals.   This legislation upholds the dignity of those who are aging, and it  has received bipartisan support for more than 50 years. Today should be  no different, as we have a responsibility to uphold the promise that  was made to support our Nation's seniors.   I urge my colleagues to, once again, reauthorize the Older Americans  Act.
