 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, Montanans didn't send me here to shut down the  government, but they also didn't send me here to let their priorities  die in a lameduck session that is in every part lame. I stand here  still urging this body to take up a public lands package and secure the  border.   A public lands package should include the permanent reauthorization  of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. A public lands package should  include the Yellowstone Gateway Protection Act that permanently  conserves public land in Paradise Valley. A public lands package should  include  [[Page H10425]]  H.R. 3764 to provide long-overdue Federal recognition to the Little  Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians.   Mr. Speaker, we could just kick the can here on government funding,  on our public lands, and on border security all because Chuck Schumer  and Nancy Pelosi are folding their arms, shaking their heads no, and  refusing to secure our border.   Mr. Speaker, this lame-duck session doesn't have to produce lame  results. I urge my colleagues to take up a public lands package and to  secure our border.
