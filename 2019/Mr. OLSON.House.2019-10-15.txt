 Madam Speaker, I want to introduce a great friend to every  American. This is Sergio Cardenas, with his mom, Maria Elena. This  photo was taken by John Mone.   Sergio's heart is full of love. I spent a lot of time with him and  his family this past Sunday. Sadly, my time with Sergio will be more  time than he spends this year with the person he loves the most in this  world, his father, Gustavo.   Gustavo has been held in a Venezuelan prison, without trial, for  nearly 2 years. Gustavo is one of the Citgo Six, six American Citgo  employees illegally thrown into jail by the dictator Maduro.   Sergio's heart needs an operation. The surgery may take his life.  Yet, he delays this operation because he wants to hug his father and  tell him, ``I love you,'' face to face.   Sergio gave me some words as we parted Sunday from Houston. He told  me, ``Please tell President Trump to get my dad home.''   Sergio, we just told the whole world that we will never, ever give  up.                            ____________________
