 Mr. Speaker, what I really want to say about this bill  would probably make me wind up on the prayer list of the church folks  back home.   This bill is horrendous for America. Most Americans want a job; they  want a decent, safe place to live; they want their kids educated; and  they want to be left alone to lead their lives the way that they want  to. This bill violates every one of those basic tenets.   It is going to destroy the economy and raise inflation. People will  not be economically more secure.   It is encouraging additional illegal immigration at our southern  border, and it is making our communities less safe.   It is going to destroy private daycare. This bill is going to allow  the government to tell you where you have to have your kids educated.   Has the majority not learned anything from what happened in the  elections a couple of weeks ago?   By the way, it is going to tell you how you have to live your life,  what kind of car you can buy, what kind of business you can run, and  how to operate your business. Americans are sick and tired of this kind  of government overreach.   Mr. Speaker, 87,000 new IRS agents to spy on Americans' bank  accounts, to come dig in the cushions of your couch, in order to pay  for SALT? This thing stinks like 3-day-old roadkill on south Georgia  asphalt. Vote ``no.''
