 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first I want to acknowledge those individuals that Mr.  Curbelo pointed out and congratulate them for their courage and their  kindness as they attempt to get southern Florida back on its feet.   But the key phrase here that my friend from Florida mentioned was the  following: Now it is time for us to do our part.   ``Our part'' calls for a much more vigorous effort, a much more  robust investment, and it could, it should, be done now. We don't have  to wait to get this done. We don't have to parcel this out in the small  amounts that are being suggested.   Now, earlier this week, I rose in opposition to H.R. 3823, the  Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act, as well.  Today, I am disappointed to say that I am not going to support today's  updated version of the legislation either, based on the word ``more.''   I take no issue with a clean 6-month extension of the FAA expenditure  authority, but today's bill includes an extensive list of extraneous  provisions.   If we are to include extraneous measures on this must-pass  legislation, then the process of compiling the bill should have been  done in a bipartisan manner. Instead, our Republican friends assembled  their near-term priorities barely, if at all, consulting the Democratic  minority, even though many of these issues are indeed bipartisan.   Worse, rather than work together to solve what is rapidly becoming an  American humanitarian crisis, they chose to take most of the day off to  unveil the tax cut for the wealthiest people in America.   The priorities at this moment are misguided. As I noted earlier this  week, while I support the disaster tax relief in this bill, the package  is plainly insufficient. I had hoped that we might work together in a  manner on these provisions, but that has not occurred.   Traditionally, in this body, we honored and used to respect what is  known as the national principle. It was a code of honor that bound us  together when one part of the Nation was beset by disaster. Whether it  was an earthquake in California, a hurricane in North Carolina, a  tornado in Massachusetts, floods in Missouri, or forest fires in  Alabama, we did not ask about gender, race, geography. We simply said  the national principle prevails and the Federal Government will offer a  robust response.                                time  1745    We are failing in that respect to set the precedent today. Instead,  unfortunately, this disaster relief package that we will consider does  not provide the comprehensive package of incentives and relief that  will drive investment and speed up recovery in American communities in  Texas, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the devastation across  Puerto Rico.  [[Page H7561]]    These hurricanes left massive devastation in their wake, and the  ongoing situation in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico are dire.  The situation not only justifies but demands a comprehensive package of  incentives and relief to help these communities and their residents get  back to their feet.   Republicans will hide behind an amendment they added to the Rules  Committee last night. It is really a fig leaf, amounting to $68 per  person in tax relief. We can do much more for our American brothers and  sisters in the Caribbean, especially given that the administration  continues to drag its feet in terms of sending an emergency  supplemental request. That should be done forthwith. We can do better,  and we must do better.   They are making vague assurances that we will get around to  considering a more extensive package later, but delay and uncertainty  will make the situation worse, not better.   Today's package should have included other powerful and proven tax  incentives that we have extended in the past disaster recovery efforts  consistently. I consider this a missed opportunity.   We need to do more to help our fellow Americans recover from these  tragedies. Therefore, I intend to oppose this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. DeFazio), who is the ranking member of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New  York (Ms. Velazquez), and I must tell you that anybody who has  witnessed her heartfelt advocacy on behalf of the people of Puerto Rico  in the last 24 hours would be moved. I also would say that nobody in  this Chamber knows more about what has happened in Puerto Rico right  now than the gentlewoman from New York, Nydia Velazquez.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, you just heard the eloquent testimony from Ms. Velazquez  about what the people of Puerto Rico are facing right now.   I wish that the majority would have approached this process  differently. The reauthorization of the FAA could have been a simple,  straightforward exercise. It could have and should have been a  bipartisan effort. They saddled the FAA with unrelated partisan  priorities, incorporated with little input from Democrats, and  presented a weak tax package to address the recent major national  disasters.   As I said when a version of this bill came up earlier this week, I  wish the disaster tax relief section were better designed and more  extensive. This updated bill still doesn't provide adequate relief to  the affected families and communities who desperately need it. You just  heard from Ms. Velazquez on that basis.   While waiving penalties on the withdrawal of retirement savings and  expanding EITC and child tax credit provisions are helpful, the  majority inexplicably left out some of the most economically powerful  tax incentives on the shelf, including those that would be helpful to  rebuild devastated infrastructure.   Given this damage and the needs of hard-hit areas, especially the  Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, I cannot understand why we are not  including proven  [[Page H7564]]  assistance contained in previous disaster tax packages as we did to our  family and friends in places like Texas and Louisiana.   Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
