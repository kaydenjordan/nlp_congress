 Mr. Speaker, for the last month, my brothers and  sisters in the UAW have been standing up for their livelihoods, their  families, and their future. When home, I have joined them at all hours  and all shifts just to listen, to support, and to understand.   Being on a picket line is hard work, but UAW workers are committed  workers who are a crucial component of building America's auto industry  and driving our Nation's economy.   This strike has been about the collective community and workers  across America being treated fairly, with dignity and respect. Many UAW  members are newer hires and temporaries, workers who are paid less than  their colleagues whom they work side by side with. Many temps work 7  days a week, get no overtime, have no sick pay, and can't take time for  a family emergency.   The good news for the country is that a tentative agreement between  the UAW and GM is now going for ratification.   All workers need to recognize they benefit from the courage,  commitment, and caring of these UAW workers. We need their jobs here;  we need manufacturing here in this country; but we need fair pay, fair  benefits, and commitment to produce here in the United States of  America. Their fight is the fight of all workers.                            ____________________
