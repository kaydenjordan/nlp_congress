 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning in defense of  Governor Gavin Newsom, who recently defied his own idiotic COVID edicts  as he partied at one of the few restaurants that has not yet been  forced out of business. I defend him because he was doing what we once  all did in a free society, make our own decisions over what risks we  are willing to run and what precautions we are willing to take  according to our own circumstances to protect our own health.   Yes, COVID is a nasty bug, and a quarter of a million Americans have  died while having it, but this isn't the bubonic plague. The CDC's best  estimate is that if you are under 49, your chance for surviving COVID,  if you get it, is 99.92 percent. Even if you are over 70, you have a  94.6 percent rate of recovery. Forty percent who get it, don't even  know they have it. And yet we have allowed our officials to ruin our  quality of life over it, destroying countless businesses, throwing tens  of millions into unemployment, robbing our children of their  educations, and shredding our most cherished rights as Americans.   Governor Newsom's night of partying should be a wake-up call for  every American.   Every time we step outside our homes, the risks that we face  multiply. A free society assumes that its citizens are competent to  assess those risks, balance them against the avoidance costs, and to  manage their decisions in a generally responsible way. It is called  common sense, and it is a necessary prerequisite for self-government  and liberty.   The choices of an octogenarian with emphysema might be very different  from those of a healthy Governor from California. Only a fool would  claim the omniscience to make an informed judgment for every person in  every circumstance in every community. Yet sadly, this crisis has  revealed that fools abound in public office, and that a fool with power  can quickly become a petty tyrant.   Which brings us back to Governor Newsom. These government nannies  love to tell us that they are just following the science. Well, what  does this science actually tell us? It tells us that COVID poses  virtually no risk to children but can be severe among the elderly. So  what did these lockdown leftists do? They closed all the schools and  ordered infected patients into nursing homes.   The science tells us that outdoor transmissions of the virus are  extremely rare, and that 80 percent of infections occur in people's  homes. So what did these lockdown leftists do? They closed our beaches,  parks, and campgrounds and ordered people to stay at home.   The science tells us that obesity is a contributing factor to the  severity of the disease. So what did these lockdown leftists do? They  closed all the gyms and kept the liquor stores open.   The lockdowns haven't saved lives. The States with the most stringent  lockdowns generally have the highest mortality rates from COVID. Utah  [[Page H5936]]  stayed open while next door, Colorado shut down. Utah currently has  half the COVID mortality rate and three-fourths the unemployment rate  as Colorado. But the lockdowns have cost countless lives from suicides,  drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence, and deferred health  screenings and treatments.   Recently, Governor Newsom demanded that restaurant diners replace  their masks after every bite, but also minimize the times they are  taken off. I guess that means you take really big bites. Thanksgiving  dinners are allowed in California, but only when they are held outside,  guests are seated 6 feet apart, and they last no more than 2 hours. Now  it is all right to use the bathroom, but only if it is frequently  sanitized, otherwise presumably you will just have to use the bushes.  And for God's sake, no singing.   I have wondered how much longer the American people are going to  tolerate this nonsense.   So let us not criticize Governor Newsom. Perhaps he has just offered  us all deliverance from his own folly.   Nor should we criticize the California legislators who ignored travel  and quarantine restrictions to junket in Hawaii. Nor should we ridicule  Speaker Pelosi for choosing not to wear a mask in a hair salon that was  forced to close for the rest of us.   Good for them. They are demonstrating by their actions the freedom  that every American citizen needs to reclaim from these very same  people. The Governor should make his own decisions about running his  own life. I only ask that he and his ilk would stop telling us how to  run ours.                            ____________________
