 Mr. President, last Thursday, the U.S. Senate crossed  one of the greatest thresholds that exist in our system of government.  We began just the third Presidential impeachment trial in American  history. This is a unique responsibility which the Framers of our  Constitution knew that the Senate--and only the Senate--could handle.  Our Founders trusted the Senate to rise above short-term passions and  factionalism. They trusted the Senate to soberly consider what has  actually been proven and which outcome best serves the Nation. That is  a pretty high bar, and you might say that later today, this body will  take our entrance exam.   Today, we will consider and pass an organizing resolution that will  structure the first phase of the trial. This initial step will offer an  early signal to our country. Can the Senate still serve our founding  purpose? Can we still put fairness, evenhandedness, and historical  precedent ahead of the partisan passions of the day? Today's vote will  contain some answers. The organizing resolution we will put forward  already has the support of a majority of the Senate. That is because it  sets up a structure that is fair, evenhanded, and tracks closely with  past precedents that were established unanimously.   After pretrial business, the resolution establishes the four things  that need to happen next. First, the Senate will hear an opening  presentation from the House managers. Second, we will hear from the  President's counsel. Third, Senators will be able to seek further  information by posing written questions to either side through the  Chief Justice. Fourth, with all that information in hand, the Senate  will consider whether we feel any additional evidence or witnesses are  necessary to evaluate whether the House case has cleared or failed to  clear the high bar of overcoming the presumption of innocence and  undoing a democratic election.   The Senate's fair process will draw a sharp contrast with the unfair  and precedent-breaking inquiry that was carried on by the House of  Representatives. The House broke with precedent by denying Members of  the Republican minority the same rights that Democrats had received  when they were in the minority back in 1998. Here in the Senate, every  single Senator will have exactly the same rights and exactly the same  ability to ask questions.   The House broke with fairness by cutting President Trump's counsel  out of their inquiry to an unprecedented degree. Here in the Senate,  the President's lawyers will finally receive a level playing field with  the House Democrats and will finally be able to present the President's  case. Finally, some fairness.   On every point, our straightforward resolution will bring the clarity  and fairness that everyone deserves--the President of the United  States, the House of Representatives, and the American people. This is  the fair roadmap for our trial. We need it in place before we can move  forward, so the Senate should prepare to remain in session today until  we complete this resolution and adopt it.   This basic, four-part structure aligns with the first steps of the  Clinton impeachment trial in 1999. Twenty-one years ago, 100 Senators  agreed unanimously that this roadmap was the right way to begin the  trial. All 100 Senators agreed the proper time to consider the question  of potential witnesses was after--after--opening arguments and  Senators' questions.   Now, some outside voices have been urging the Senate to break with  precedent on this question. Loud voices, including the leadership of  the House majority, colluded with Senate Democrats and tried to force  the Senate to precommit ourselves to seek specific witnesses and  documents before Senators had even heard opening arguments or even  asked questions. These are potential witnesses whom the House managers  themselves--themselves--declined to hear from, whom the House itself  declined to pursue through the legal system during its own inquiry.   The House was not facing any deadline. They were free to run whatever  [[Page S288]]  investigation they wanted to run. If they wanted witnesses who would  trigger legal battles over Presidential privilege, they could have had  those fights. However, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee  and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee decided not to. They  decided their inquiry was finished and moved right ahead. The House  chose not to pursue the same witnesses they apparently would now like-- would now like--the Senate to precommit to pursuing ourselves.   As I have been saying for weeks, nobody--nobody--will dictate Senate  procedure to U.S. Senators. A majority of us are committed to upholding  the unanimous, bipartisan Clinton precedent against outside influences  with respect to the proper timing of these midtrial questions. So if  any amendments are brought forward to force premature decisions on  midtrial questions, I will move to table such amendments and protect  our bipartisan precedent. If a Senator moves to amend the resolution or  to subpoena specific witnesses or documents, I will move to table such  motions because the Senate will decide those questions later in the  trial, just like we did back in 1999.   Now, today may present a curious situation. We may hear House  managers themselves agitate for such amendments. We may hear a team of  managers led by the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees  chairmen argue that the Senate must precommit ourselves to reopen the  very investigation they themselves oversaw and voluntarily shut down.  It would be curious to hear these two House chairmen argue that the  Senate must precommit ourselves to supplementing their own evidentiary  record, to enforcing subpoenas they refused to enforce, to  supplementing a case they themselves have recently described as  ``overwhelming''--``overwhelming''--and ``beyond any reasonable  doubt.''   These midtrial questions could potentially take us even deeper into  even more complex constitutional waters. For example, many Senators,  including me, have serious concerns about blurring--blurring--the  traditional role between the House and the Senate within the  impeachment process. The Constitution divides the power to impeach from  the power to try. The first belongs solely to the House, and with the  power to impeach comes the responsibility to investigate.   The Senate agreeing to pick up and carry on the House's inadequate  investigation would set a new precedent that could incentivize frequent  and hasty impeachments from future House majorities. It could  dramatically change the separation of powers between the House and the  Senate if the Senate agrees we will conduct both the investigation and  the trial of an impeachment.   What is more, some of the proposed new witnesses include executive  branch officials whose communications with the President and with other  executive branch officials lie at the very core of the President's  constitutional privilege. Pursuing those witnesses could indefinitely  delay the Senate trial and draw our body into a protracted and complex  legal fight over Presidential privilege. Such litigation could  potentially have permanent repercussions for the separation of powers  and the institution of the Presidency that Senators would need to  consider very, very carefully.   So the Senate is not about to rush into these weighty questions  without discussion and without deliberation--without even hearing  opening arguments first. There were good reasons why 100 out of 100  Senators agreed two decades ago to cross these bridges when we came to  them. That is what we will do this time as well. Fair is fair. The  process was good enough for President Clinton, and basic fairness  dictates it ought to be good enough for this President as well.   The eyes are on the Senate. The country is watching to see if we can  rise to the occasion. Twenty-one years ago, 100 Senators, including a  number of us who sit in the Chamber today, did just that. The body  approved a fair, commonsense process to guide the beginning of a  Presidential impeachment trial. Today, two decades later, this Senate  will retake that entrance exam. The basic structure we are proposing is  just as eminently fair and evenhanded as it was back then. The question  is whether the Senators are themselves ready to be as fair and as  evenhanded.   The Senate made a statement 21 years ago. We said that Presidents of  either party deserve basic justice and a fair process. A challenging  political moment like today does not make such statements less  necessary but all the more necessary, in fact.   So I would say to my colleagues across the aisle: There is no reason  why the vote on this resolution ought to be remotely partisan. There is  no reason other than base partisanship to say this particular President  deserves a radically different rule book than what was good enough for  a past President of your own party. I urge every single Senator to  support our fair resolution. I urge everyone to vote to uphold the  Senate's unanimous bipartisan precedent of a fair process.                            ____________________     Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to state that, for the  information of all Senators, the trial briefs filed yesterday by the  parties have been printed and are now at each Senator's desk.       Unanimous Consent Agreement--Authority to Print Senate Documents    The CHIEF JUSTICE. The following documents will be submitted to the  Senate for printing in the Senate Journal: the precept, issued January  16, 2020; the writ of summons, issued on January 16, 2020; and the  receipt of summons, dated January 16, 2020.   The following documents, which were received by the Secretary of the  Senate, will be submitted to the Senate for printing in the Senate  Journal, pursuant to the order of January 16, 2020: the answer of  Donald John Trump, President of the United States, to the Articles of  Impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives against him on  January 16, 2020, received by the Secretary of the Senate on January  18, 2020; the trial brief filed by the House of Representatives,  received by the Secretary of the Senate on January 18, 2020; the trial  brief filed by the President, received by the Secretary of the Senate  on January 20, 2020; the replication of the House of Representatives,  received by the Secretary of the Senate on January 20, 2020; and the  rebuttal brief filed by the House of Representatives, received by the  Secretary of the Senate on January 21, 2020.   Without objection, the foregoing documents will be printed in the  Congressional Record.   The documents follow:              [In Proceedings Before the United States Senate]                    Answer of President Donald J. Trump   The Honorable Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, Hereby                                 Responds:         The Articles of Impeachment submitted by House Democrats       are a dangerous attack on the right of the American people to       freely choose their President. This is a brazen and unlawful       attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election and       interfere with the 2020 election--now just months away. The       highly partisan and reckless obsession with impeaching the       President began the day he was inaugurated and continues to       this day.        The Articles of Impeachment are constitutionally invalid on       their face. They fail to allege any crime or violation of law       whatsoever, let alone ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' as       required by the Constitution. They are the result of a       lawless process that violated basic due process and       fundamental fairness. Nothing in these Articles could permit       even beginning to consider removing a duly elected President       or warrant nullifying an election and subverting the will of       the American people.        The Articles of Impeachment now before the Senate are an       affront to the Constitution of the United States, our       democratic institutions, and the American people. The       Articles themselves--and the rigged process that brought them       here--are a transparently political act by House Democrats.       They debase the grave power of impeachment and the solemn       responsibility that power entails. They must be rejected. The       House process violated every precedent and every principle of       fairness governing impeachment inquiries for more than 150       years. Even so, all that House Democrats have succeeded in       proving is that the President did absolutely nothing wrong.        President Trump categorically and unequivocally denies each       and every allegation in both Articles of Impeachment. The       President reserves all rights and all available defenses to       the Articles of Impeachment. For the reasons set forth in       this Answer and in the forthcoming Trial Brief, the Senate       must reject the Articles of Impeachment.             I. the first article of impeachment must be rejected         The first Article fails on its face to state an impeachable       offense. It alleges no crimes at all, let alone ``high Crimes       and Misdemeanors,'' as required by the Constitution. In fact,       it alleges no violation of law whatsoever. House Democrats'       ``abuse of power'' claim would do lasting damage to the       separation of powers under the Constitution.        The first Article also fails on the facts, because       President Trump has not in any way ``abused the powers of the       Presidency.'' At all times, the President has faithfully and       effectively executed the duties of his Office on behalf of       the American people. The President's actions on the July 25,       2019, telephone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of       Ukraine (the ``July 25 call''), as well as on the earlier       April 21, 2019, telephone call (the ``April 21 call''), and       in all surrounding and related events, were constitutional,       perfectly legal, completely appropriate, and taken in       furtherance of our national interest.        President Trump raised the important issue of burden       sharing on the July 25 call, noting that other European       countries such as Germany were not carrying their fair share.       President Trump also raised the important issue of Ukrainian       corruption. President Zelensky acknowledged these concerns on       that same call.        Despite House Democrats having run an entirely illegitimate       and one-sided process, several simple facts were established       that prove the President did nothing wrong:        First, the transcripts of both the April 21 call and the       July 25 call make absolutely clear that the President did       nothing wrong.        Second, President Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials       have repeatedly confirmed that the call was ``good'' and       ``normal,'' that there was no quid pro quo, and that no one       pressured them on anything.        Third, the two individuals who have stated for the record       that they spoke to the President about the subject actually       exonerate him. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon       Sondland stated that when he asked the President what he       wanted from Ukraine, the President said: ``I want nothing. I       want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.'' Senator Ron Johnson       reported that, when he asked the President whether there was       any connection between security assistance and       investigations, the President responded: ``No way. I would       never do that.'' House Democrats ignore these facts and       instead rely entirely on assumptions, presumptions, and       speculation from witnesses with no first-hand knowledge.       Their accusations are founded exclusively on inherently       unreliable hearsay that would never be accepted in any court       in our country.        Fourth, the bilateral presidential meeting took place in       the ordinary course, and the security assistance was sent,       all without the Ukrainian government announcing any       investigations.        Not only does the evidence collected by House Democrats       refute each and every one of the factual predicates       underlying the first Article, the transcripts of the April 21       call and the July 25 call disprove what the Article alleges.       When the House Democrats realized this, Mr. Schiff created a       fraudulent version of the July 25 call and read it to the       American people at a congressional hearing, without       disclosing that he was simply making it all up. The fact that       Mr. Schiff felt the need to fabricate a false version of the       July 25 call proves that he and his colleagues knew there was       absolutely nothing wrong with that call.        House Democrats ran a fundamentally flawed and illegitimate       process that denied the President every basic right,       including the right to have counsel present, the right to       cross-examine witnesses, and the right to present evidence.       Despite all this, the information House Democrats assembled       actually disproves their claims against the President. The       President acted at all times with full constitutional and       legal authority and in our national interest. He continued       his Administration's policy of unprecedented support for       Ulaaine, including the delivery of lethal military aid that       was denied to the Ukrainians by the prior administration.        The first Article is therefore constitutionally invalid,       founded on falsehoods, and must be rejected.            II. the second article of impeachment must be rejected         The second Article also fails on its face to state an       impeachable offense. It does not allege any crime or       violation of law whatsoever. To the contrary, the President's       assertion of legitimate Executive Branch confidentiality       interests grounded in the separation of powers cannot       constitute obstruction of Congress.        Furthermore, the notion that President Trump obstructed       Congress is absurd. President Trump acted with extraordinary       and unprecedented transparency by declassifying and releasing       the transcript of the July 25 call that is at the heart of       this matter.        Following the President's disclosure of the July 25 call       transcript, House Democrats issued a series of       unconstitutional subpoenas for documents and testimony. They       issued their subpoenas without a congressional vote and,       therefore, without constitutional authority. They sought       testimony from a number of the President's closest advisors       despite the fact that, under longstanding, bipartisan       practice of prior administrations of both political parties       and similarly longstanding guidance from the Department of       Justice, those advisors are absolutely immune from compelled       testimony before Congress related to their official duties.       And  [[Page S291]]       they sought testimony disclosing the Executive Branch's       confidential communications and internal decision-making       processes on matters of foreign relations and national       security, despite the well-established constitutional       privileges and immunities protecting such information. As the       Supreme Court has recognized, the President's constitutional       authority to protect the confidentiality of Executive Branch       information is at its apex in the field of foreign relations       and national security. House Democrats also barred the       attendance of Executive Branch counsel at witness       proceedings, thereby preventing the President from protecting       important Executive Branch confidentiality interests.        Notwithstanding these abuses, the Trump Administration       replied appropriately to these subpoenas and identified their       constitutional defects. Tellingly, House Democrats did not       seek to enforce these constitutionally defective subpoenas in       court. To the contrary, when one subpoena recipient sought a       declaratory judgment as to the validity of the subpoena he       had received, House Democrats quickly withdrew the subpoena       to prevent the court from issuing a ruling.        The House may not usurp Executive Branch authority and may       not bypass our Constitution's system of checks and balances.       Asserting valid constitutional privileges and immunities       cannot be an impeachable offense. The second Article is       therefore invalid and must be rejected.                               III. conclusion         The Articles of Impeachment violate the Constitution. They       are defective in their entirety. They are the product of       invalid proceedings that flagrantly denied the President any       due process rights. They rest on dangerous distortions of the       Constitution that would do lasting damage to our structure of       government.        In the the first Article, the House attempts to seize the       President's power under Article II of the Constitution to       determine foreign policy. In the second Article, the House       attempts to control and penalize the assertion of the       Executive Branch's constitutional privileges, while       simultaneously seeking to destroy the Framers' system of       checks and balances. By approving the Articles, the House       violated our constitutional order, illegally abused its power       of impeachment, and attempted to obstruct President Trump's       ability to faithfully execute the duties of his Office. They       sought to undermine his authority under Article II of the       Constitution, which vests the entirety of ``[t]he executive       Power'' in ``a President of the United States of America.''        In order to preserve our constitutional structure of       government, to reject the poisonous partisanship that the       Framers warned against, to ensure one-party political       impeachment vendettas do not become the ``new normal,'' and       to vindicate the will of the American people, the Senate must       reject both Articles of Impeachment. In the end, this entire       process is nothing more than a dangerous attack on the       American people themselves and their fundamental right to       vote.

Cipollone,                         Counsel to the President, The White House.        Dated this 18th day of January, 2020.                                   ____    [In the Senate of the United States Sitting as a Court of Impeachment]               In re Impeachment of President Donald J. Trump   Trial Memorandum of the United States House of Representatives in the               Impeachment Trial of President Donald J. Trump                                 INTRODUCTION         President Donald J. Trump used his official powers to       pressure a foreign government to interfere in a United States       election for his personal political gain, and then attempted       to cover up his scheme by obstructing Congress's       investigation into his misconduct. The Constitution provides       a remedy when the President commits such serious abuses of       his office: impeachment and removal. The Senate must use that       remedy now to safeguard the 2020 U.S. election, protect our       constitutional form of government, and eliminate the threat       that the President poses to America's national security.        The House adopted two Articles of Impeachment against       President Trump: the first for abuse of power, and the second       for obstruction of Congress.\1\ The evidence overwhelmingly       establishes that he is guilty of both. The only remaining       question is whether the members of the Senate will accept and       carry out the responsibility placed on them by the Framers of       our Constitution and their constitutional Oaths.                                Abuse of Power         President Trump abused the power of his office by       pressuring the government of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020       U.S. Presidential election for his own benefit. In order to       pressure the recently elected Ukrainian President, Volodymyr       Zelensky, to announce investigations that would advance       President Trump's political interests and his 2020 reelection       bid, the President exercised his official power to withhold       from Ukraine critical U.S. government support--$391 million       of vital military aid and a coveted White House meeting.\2\        During a July 25, 2019 phone call, after President Zelensky       expressed gratitude to President Trump for American military       assistance, President Trump immediately responded by asking       President Zelensky to ``do us a favor though.'' \3\ The       ``favor'' he sought was for Ukraine to publicly announce two       investigations that President Trump believed would improve       his domestic political prospects.\4\ One investigation       concerned former Vice President Joseph Biden, Jr.--a       political rival in the upcoming 2020 election--and the false       claim that, in seeking the removal of a corrupt Ukrainian       prosecutor four years earlier, then-Vice President Biden had       acted to protect a company where his son was a board       member.\5\ The second investigation concerned a debunked       conspiracy theory that Russia did not interfere in the 2016       Presidential election to aid President Trump, but instead       that Ukraine interfered in that election to aid President       Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton.\6\        These theories were baseless. There is no credible evidence       to support the allegation that the former Vice President       acted improperly in encouraging Ukraine to remove an       incompetent and corrupt prosecutor in 2016.\7\ And the U.S.       Intelligence Community, the Senate Select Committee on       Intelligence, and Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III       unanimously determined that Russia, not Ukraine, interfered       in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election ``in sweeping and       systematic fashion'' to help President Trump's campaign.\8\       In fact, the theory that Ukraine, rather than Russia,       interfered in the 2016 election has been advanced by Russia's       intelligence services as part of Russia's propaganda       campaign.\9\        Although these theories were groundless, President Trump       sought a public announcement by Ukraine of investigations       into them in order to help his 2020 reelection campaign.\10\       An announcement of a Ukrainian investigation into one of his       key political rivals would be enormously valuable to       President Trump in his efforts to win reelection in 2020--      just as the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails       had helped him in 2016. And an investigation suggesting that       President Trump did not benefit from Russian interference in       the 2016 election would give him a basis to assert--falsely--      that he was the victim, rather than the beneficiary, of       foreign meddling in the last election. Ukraine's announcement       of that investigation would bolster the perceived legitimacy       of his Presidency and, therefore, his political standing       going into the 2020 race.        Overwhelming evidence shows that President Trump solicited       these two investigations in order to obtain a personal       political benefit, not because the investigations served the       national interest.\11\ The President's own National Security       Advisor characterized the efforts to pressure Ukraine to       announce investigations in exchange for official acts as a       ``drug deal.'' \12\ His Acting Chief of Staff candidly       confessed that President Trump's decision to withhold       security assistance was tied to his desire for an       investigation into alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2020       election, stated that there ``is going to be political       influence in foreign policy,'' and told the American people       to ``get over it.'' \13\ Another one of President Trump's key       national security advisors testified that the agents pursuing       the President's bidding were ``involved in a domestic       political errand,'' not national security policy.\14\ And,       immediately after speaking to President Trump by phone about       the investigations, one of President Trump's ambassadors       involved in carrying out the President's agenda in Ukraine       said that President Trump ``did not give a [expletive] about       Ukraine,'' and instead cared only about ``big stuff'' that       benefitted him personally, like ``the Biden investigation.''       \15\        To execute his scheme, President Trump assigned his       personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, the task of securing the       Ukrainian investigations.\16\ Mr. Giuliani repeatedly and       publicly emphasized that he was not engaged in foreign policy       but was instead seeking a personal benefit for his client,       Donald Trump.\17\        President Trump used the vast powers of his office as       President to pressure Ukraine into announcing these       investigations. President Trump illegally withheld $391       million in taxpayer-funded military assistance to Ukraine       that Congress had appropriated for expenditure in fiscal year       2019.\18\ That assistance was a critical part of long-running       bipartisan efforts to advance the security interests of the       United States by ensuring that Ukraine is properly equipped       to defend itself against Russian aggression.\19\ Every       relevant Executive Branch agency agreed that continued       American support for Ukraine was in America's national       security interests, but President Trump ignored that view and       personally ordered the assistance held back, even after       serious concerns--now confirmed by the Government       Accountability Office (GAO) \20\--were raised within his       Administration about the legality of withholding funding that       Congress had already appropriated.\21\ President Trump       released the funding only after he got caught trying to use       the security assistance as leverage to obtain foreign       interference in his reelection campaign. When news of his       scheme to withhold the funding broke, and shortly after       investigative committees in the House opened an       investigation, President Trump relented and released the       aid.\22\  [[Page S292]]         As part of the same pressure campaign, President Trump       withheld a crucial White House meeting with President       Zelensky--a meeting that he had previously promised and that       was a shared goal of both the United States and Ukraine.\23\       Such face-to-face Oval Office meetings with a U.S. President       are immensely important for international credibility.\24\ In       this case, an Oval Office meeting with President Trump was       critical to the newly elected Ukrainian President because it       would signal to Russia--which had invaded Ukraine in 2014 and       still occupied Ukrainian territory--that Ukraine could count       on American support.\25\ That meeting still has not occurred,       even though President Trump has met with over a dozen world       leaders at the White House since President Zelensky's       election--including an Oval Office meeting with Russia's top       diplomat.\26\        President Trump's solicitation of foreign interference in       our elections to secure his own political success is       precisely why the Framers of our Constitution provided       Congress with the power to impeach a corrupt President and       remove him from office. One of the Founding generation's       principal fears was that foreign governments would seek to       manipulate American elections--the defining feature of our       self-government. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams warned of       ``foreign Interference, Intrigue, Influence'' and predicted       that, ``as often as Elections happen, the danger of foreign       Influence recurs.'' \27\ The Framers therefore would have       considered a President's attempt to corrupt America's       democratic processes by demanding political favors from       foreign powers to be a singularly pernicious act. They       designed impeachment as the remedy for such misconduct       because a President who manipulates U.S. elections to his       advantage can avoid being held accountable by the voters       through those same elections. And they would have viewed a       President's efforts to encourage foreign election       interference as all the more dangerous where, as here, those       efforts are part of an ongoing pattern of misconduct for       which the President is unrepentant.        The House of Representatives gathered overwhelming evidence       of President Trump's misconduct, which is summarized in the       attached Statement of Material Facts and in the comprehensive       reports prepared by the House Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence and the Committee on the Judiciary.\28\ On the       strength of that evidence, the House approved the First       Article of Impeachment against President Trump for abuse of       power.\29\ The Senate should now convict him on that Article.       President Trump's continuing presence in office undermines       the integrity of our democratic processes and endangers our       national security.                           Obstruction of Congress         President Trump obstructed Congress by undertaking an       unprecedented campaign to prevent House Committees from       investigating his misconduct. The Constitution entrusts the       House with the ``sole Power of Impeachment.'' \30\ The       Framers thus ensured what common sense requires--that the       House, and not the President, determines the existence,       scope, and procedures of an impeachment investigation into       the President's conduct. The House cannot conduct such an       investigation effectively if it cannot obtain information       from the President or the Executive Branch about the       Presidential misconduct it is investigating. Under our       constitutional system of divided powers, a President cannot       be permitted to hide his offenses from view by refusing to       comply with a Congressional impeachment inquiry and ordering       Executive Branch agencies to do the same. That conclusion is       particularly important given the Department of Justice's       position that the President cannot be indicted. If the       President could both avoid accountability under the criminal       laws and preclude an effective impeachment investigation, he       would truly be above the law.        But that is what President Trump has attempted to do, and       why President Trump's conduct is the Framers' worst       nightmare. He directed his Administration to defy every       subpoena issued in the House's impeachment investigation.\31\       At his direction, the White House, Department of State,       Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and Office of       Management and Budget (OMB) refused to produce a single       document in response to those subpoenas.\32\ Several       witnesses also followed President Trump's orders, defying       requests for voluntary appearances and lawful subpoenas, and       refusing to testify.\33\ And President Trump's interference       in the House's impeachment inquiry was not an isolated       incident--it was consistent with his past efforts to obstruct       the Special Counsel's investigation into Russian interference       in the 2016 election.\34\        By categorically obstructing the House's impeachment       inquiry, President Trump claimed the House's sole impeachment       power for himself and sought to shield his misconduct from       Congress and the American people. Although his sweeping       cover-up effort ultimately failed--seventeen public officials       courageously upheld their duty, testified, and provided       documentary evidence of the President's wrongdoing \35\--his       obstruction will do long-lasting and potentially irreparable       damage to our constitutional system of divided powers if it       goes unchecked.        Based on the overwhelming evidence of the President's       misconduct in attempting to thwart the impeachment inquiry,       the House approved the Second Article of Impeachment, for       obstruction of Congress.\36\ The Senate should now convict       President Trump on that Article. If it does not, future       Presidents will feel empowered to resist any investigation       into their own wrongdoing, effectively nullifying Congress's       power to exercise the Constitution's most important safeguard       against Presidential misconduct. That outcome would not only       embolden this President to continue seeking foreign       interference in our elections but would telegraph to future       Presidents that they are free to engage in serious misconduct       without accountability or repercussions.        The Constitution entrusts Congress with the solemn task of       impeaching and removing from office a President who engages       in ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and       Misdemeanors.'' \37\ The impeachment power is an essential       check on the authority of the President, and Congress must       exercise this power when the President places his personal       and political interests above those of the Nation. President       Trump has done exactly that. His misconduct challenges the       fundamental principle that Americans should decide American       elections, and that a divided system of government, in which       no single branch operates without the check and balance of       the others, preserves the liberty we all hold dear.        The country is watching to see how the Senate responds.       History will judge each Senator's willingness to rise above       partisan differences, view the facts honestly, and defend the       Constitution. The outcome of these proceedings will determine       whether generations to come will enjoy a safe and secure       democracy in which the President is not a king, and in which       no one, particularly the President, is above the law.                                  BACKGROUND       I. Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment        To understand why President Trump must be removed from       office now, it is necessary to understand why the Framers of       our Constitution included the impeachment power as an       essential part of the republic they created.        The Constitution entrusts Congress with the exclusive power       to impeach the President and to convict and remove him from       office. Article I vests the House with the ``sole Power of       Impeachment,'' \38\ and the Senate with the ``sole Power to       try all Impeachments'' and to ``convict[]'' upon a vote of       two thirds of its Members.\39\ The Constitution specifies       that the President ``shall be removed from Office on       Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or       other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' \40\ The Constitution       further provides that the Senate may vote to permanently       ``disqualif[y]'' an impeached President from government       service.\41\        The President takes an oath to ``faithfully execute the       Office of the President of the United States.'' \42\       Impeachment imposes a check on a President who violates that       oath by using the powers of the office to advance his own       interests at the expense of the national interest. Fresh from       their experience under British rule by a king, the Framers       were concerned that corruption posed a grave threat to their       new republic. As George Mason warned the other delegates to       the Constitutional Convention, ``if we do not provide against       corruption, our government will soon be at an end.'' \43\ The       Framers stressed that a President who ``act[s] from some       corrupt motive or other'' or ``willfully abus[es] his trust''       must be impeached,\44\ because the President ``will have       great opportunitys of abusing his power.'' \45\        The Framers recognized that a President who abuses his       power to manipulate the democratic process cannot properly be       held accountable by means of the very elections that he has       rigged to his advantage.\46\ The Framers specifically feared       a President who abused his office by sparing ``no efforts or       means whatever to get himself re-elected.'' \47\ Mason asked:       ``Shall the man who has practised corruption & by that means       procured his appointment in the first instance, be suffered       to escape punishment, by repeating his guilt?'' \48\        Thus, the Framers resolved to hold the President       ``impeachable whilst in office'' as ``an essential security       for the good behaviour of the Executive.'' \49\ By empowering       Congress to immediately remove a President when his       misconduct warrants it, the Framers established the people's       elected representatives as the ultimate check on a President       whose corruption threatened our democracy and the Nation's       core interests.\50\        The Framers particularly feared that foreign influence       could undermine our new system of self-government.\51\ In his       farewell address to the Nation, President George Washington       warned Americans ``to be constantly awake, since history and       experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most       baneful foes of republican government.'' \52\ Alexander       Hamilton cautioned that the ``most deadly adversaries of       republican government'' may come ``chiefly from the desire in       foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our       councils.'' \53\ James Madison worried that a future       President could ``betray his trust to foreign powers,'' which       ``might be fatal to the Republic.'' \54\ And, of particular       relevance now, in their personal correspondence about       ``foreign Interference,'' Thomas Jefferson and John Adams       discussed their apprehension that ``as often as Elections       happen, the danger of foreign Influence recurs.'' \55\        Guided by these concerns, the Framers included within the       Constitution various  [[Page S293]]       mechanisms to ensure the President's accountability and       protect against foreign influence--including a requirement       that Presidents be natural-born citizens of the United       States,\56\ prohibitions on the President's receipt of gifts,       emoluments, or titles from foreign states,\57\ prohibitions       on profiting from the Presidency,\58\ and, of course, the       requirement that the President face reelection after a four-      year Term.\59\ But the Framers provided for impeachment as a       final check on a President who sought foreign interference to       serve his personal interests, particularly to secure his own       reelection.        In drafting the Impeachment Clause, the Framers adopted a       standard flexible enough to reach the full range of potential       Presidential misconduct: ``Treason, Bribery, or other high       Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' \60\ The decision to denote       ``Treason'' and ``Bribery'' as impeachable conduct reflects       the Founding-era concerns over foreign influence and       corruption. But the Framers also recognized that ``many great       and dangerous offenses'' could warrant impeachment and       immediate removal of a President from office.\61\ These       ``other high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' provided for by the       Constitution need not be indictable criminal offenses.       Rather, as Hamilton explained, impeachable offenses involve       an ``abuse or violation of some public trust'' and are of ``a       nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated       political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done       immediately to the society itself.'' \62\ The Framers thus       understood that ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' would       encompass acts committed by public officials that inflict       severe harm on the constitutional order.\63\      II. The House's Impeachment of President Donald J. Trump and           Presentation of This Matter to the Senate        Committees of the House have undertaken investigations into       allegations of misconduct by President Trump and his       Administration. On September 9, 2019, after evidence surfaced       that the President and his associates were seeking Ukraine's       assistance in the President's reelection, the House Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence, together with the       Committees on Oversight and Reform and Foreign Affairs,       announced a joint investigation into the President's conduct       and issued document requests to the White House and State       Department.\64\        On September 24, 2019, Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that       the House was ``moving forward with an official impeachment       inquiry'' and directed the Committees to ``proceed with their       investigations under that umbrella of [an] impeachment       inquiry.'' \65\ They subsequently issued multiple subpoenas       for documents as well as requests and subpoenas for       witness interviews and testimony.\66\ On October 31, 2019,       the House approved a resolution adopting procedures to       govern the impeachment inquiry.\67\        Both before and after Speaker Pelosi's announcement,       President Trump categorically refused to provide any       information in response to the House's inquiry. He stated       that ``we're fighting all the subpoenas,'' and that ``I have       an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want       as president.'' \68\ Through his White House Counsel, the       President later directed his Administration not to       cooperate.\69\ Heeding the President's directive, the       Executive Branch did not produce any documents in response to       subpoenas issued by the three investigating Committees,\70\       and nine current or former Administration officials,       including the President's top aides, continue to refuse to       comply with subpoenas for testimony.\71\        Notwithstanding the President's attempted cover-up,       seventeen current and former government officials       courageously complied with their legal obligations and       testified before the three investigating Committees in       depositions or transcribed interviews that all Members of the       Committees--as well as staff from the Majority and Minority--      were permitted to attend.\72\ Some witnesses produced       documentary evidence in their possession. In late November       2019, twelve of these witnesses, including three requested by       the Minority, testified in public hearings convened by the       Intelligence Committee.\73\        Stressing the ``overwhelming'' evidence of misconduct       already uncovered by the investigation, on December 3, 2019,       the Intelligence Committee released a detailed nearly 300-      page report documenting its findings, which it transmitted to       the Judiciary Committee.\74\ The Judiciary Committee held       public hearings evaluating the constitutional standard for       impeachment and the evidence against President Trump--in       which the President's counsel was invited, but declined, to       participate--and then reported two Articles of Impeachment to       the House.\75\        On December 18, 2019, the House voted to impeach President       Trump and adopted two Articles of Impeachment.\76\ The First       Article for Abuse of Power states that President Trump       ``abused the powers of the Presidency'' by ``soliciting the       Government of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations       that would benefit his reelection, harm the election       prospects of a political opponent, and influence the 2020       United States Presidential election to his advantage.'' \77\       President Trump sought to ``pressure the Government of       Ukraine to take these steps by conditioning official United       States Government acts of significant value to Ukraine on its       public announcement of the investigations.'' \78\ President       Trump undertook these acts ``for corrupt purposes in pursuit       of personal political benefit'' \79\ and ``used the powers of       the Presidency in a manner that compromised the national       security of the United States and undermined the integrity of       the United States democratic process.'' \80\ These actions       were ``consistent'' with President Trump's ``previous       invitations of foreign interference in United States       elections,'' \81\ and demonstrated that President Trump       ``will remain a threat to national security and the       Constitution if allowed to remain in office.'' \82\        The Second Article for Obstruction of Congress states that       President Trump ``abused the powers of the Presidency in a       manner offensive to, and subversive of, the Constitution''       when he ``directed the unprecedented, categorical, and       indiscriminate defiance of subpoenas issued by the House of       Representatives pursuant to its `sole Power of Impeachment.'       '' \83\ Without ``lawful cause or excuse, President Trump       directed Executive Branch agencies, offices, and officials       not to comply with those subpoenas'' and ``thus interposed       the powers of the Presidency against the lawful subpoenas of       the House of Representatives, and assumed to himself       functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the       `sole Power of Impeachment' vested by the Constitution in the       House of Representatives.'' \84\ The President's ``complete       defiance of an impeachment inquiry . . . served to cover up       the President's own repeated misconduct and to seize and       control the power of impeachment.'' \85\ President Trump's       misconduct was ``consistent'' with his ``previous efforts to       undermine United States Government investigations into       foreign interference in United States elections,'' \86\       demonstrated that he has ``acted in a manner grossly       incompatible with self-governance,'' and established that he       ``will remain a threat to the Constitution if allowed to       remain in office.'' \87\                                   ARGUMENT       I. The Senate Should Convict President Trump of Abuse of           Power        President Trump abused the power of the Presidency by       pressuring a foreign government to interfere in an American       election on his behalf.\88\ He solicited this foreign       interference to advance his reelection prospects at the       expense of America's national security and the security of       Ukraine, a vulnerable American ally at war with Russia, an       American adversary.\89\ His effort to gain a personal       political benefit by encouraging a foreign government to       undermine America's democratic process strikes at the core of       misconduct that the Framers designed impeachment to protect       against. President Trump's abuse of power requires his       conviction and removal from office.        An officer abuses his power if he exercises his official       power to obtain an improper personal benefit while ignoring       or undermining the national interest.\90\ An abuse that       involves an effort to solicit foreign interference in an       American election is uniquely dangerous. President Trump's       misconduct is an impeachable abuse of power.\91\    A. President Trump Exercised His Official Power to Pressure Ukraine                         into Aiding His Reelection         After President Zelensky won a landslide victory in Ukraine       in April 2019, President Trump pressured the new Ukrainian       President to help him win his own reelection by announcing       investigations that were politically favorable for President       Trump and designed to harm his political rival.\92\        First, President Trump sought to pressure President       Zelensky publicly to announce an investigation into former       Vice President Biden and a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma       Holdings, on whose board Biden's son sat.\93\ As Vice       President, Biden had in late 2015 encouraged the government       of Ukraine to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor general who had       failed to combat corruption.\94\ The Ukrainian parliament       removed the prosecutor in March 2016.\95\ President Trump and       his allies have asserted that the former Vice President acted       in order to stop an investigation of Burisma and thereby       protect his son.\96\ This is false. There is no evidence that       Vice President Biden acted improperly.\97\ He was carrying       out official United States policy--with the backing of the       international community and bipartisan support in Congress--      when he sought the removal of the prosecutor, who was himself       corrupt.\98\ In addition, the prosecutor's removal made it       more likely that the investigation into Burisma would be       pursued.\99\ President Trump nevertheless sought an official       Ukrainian announcement of an investigation into this       theory.\100\        Second, President Trump sought to pressure President       Zelensky publicly to announce an investigation into a       conspiracy theory that Ukraine had colluded with the       Democratic National Committee to interfere in the 2016 U.S.       Presidential election in order to help the campaign of       Hillary Clinton against then-candidate Donald Trump.\101\       This theory was not only pure fiction, but malign Russian       propaganda.\102\ In the words of one of President Trump's own       top National Security Council officials, President Trump's       theory of Ukrainian election interference is ``a fictional       narrative that is being perpetrated and propagated by the       Russian security services themselves'' to deflect from       Russia's culpability and to drive a wedge between the United       States and Ukraine.\103\ President Trump's own FBI Director       confirmed that American law enforcement has ``no information       that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016       presidential election.'' \104\ The Senate Select Committee on  [[Page S294]]       Intelligence similarly concluded that Russia, not Ukraine,       interfered in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.\105\       President Trump nevertheless seized on the false theory and       sought an announcement of an investigation that would give       him a basis to assert that Ukraine rather than Russia       interfered in the 2016 election. Such an investigation would       eliminate a perceived threat to his own legitimacy and boost       his political standing in advance of the 2020 election.\106\        In furtherance of the corrupt scheme, President Trump       exercised his official power to remove a perceived obstacle       to Ukraine's pursuit of the two sham investigations. On April       24, 2019--one day after the media reported that former Vice       President Biden would formally enter the 2020 U.S.       Presidential race \107\--the State Department executed       President Trump's order to recall the U.S. ambassador to       Ukraine, a well-regarded career diplomat and anti-corruption       crusader.\108\ President Trump needed her ``out of the way''       because ``she was going to make the investigations difficult       for everybody.'' \109\ President Trump then proceeded to       exercise his official power to pressure Ukraine into       announcing his desired investigations by withholding valuable       support that Ukraine desperately needed and that he could       leverage only by virtue of his office: $391 million in       security assistance and a White House meeting.                         Withheld Security Assistance         President Trump illegally ordered the Office of Management       and Budget to withhold $391 million in taxpayer-funded       military and other security assistance to Ukraine.\110\ This       assistance would provide Ukraine with sniper rifles, rocket-      propelled grenade launchers, counter-artillery radars,       electronic warfare detection and secure communications, and       night vision equipment, among other military equipment, to       defend itself against Russian forces that occupied part of       eastern Ukraine since 2014.\111\ The new and vulnerable       government headed by President Zelensky urgently needed this       assistance--both because the funding itself was critically       important to defend against Russia, and because the funding       was a highly visible sign of American support for President       Zelensky in his efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict       from a position of strength.\112\        Every relevant Executive Branch agency supported the       assistance, which also had broad bipartisan support in       Congress.\113\ President Trump, however, personally ordered       OMB to withhold the assistance after the bulk of it had been       appropriated by Congress and all of the Congressionally       mandated conditions on assistance--including anti-corruption       reforms--had been met.\114\ The Government Accountability       Office has determined that the President's hold was illegal       and violated the Impoundment Control Act, which limits the       President's authority to withhold funds that Congress has       appropriated.\115\        The evidence is clear that President Trump conditioned       release of the vital military assistance on Ukraine's       announcement of the sham investigations. During a telephone       conversation between the two Presidents on July 25,       immediately after President Zelensky raised the issue of U.S.       military support for Ukraine, President Trump replied: ``I       would like you to do us a favor though.'' \116\ President       Trump then explained that the ``favor'' he wanted President       Zelensky to perform was to begin the investigations, and       President Zelensky confirmed his understanding that the       investigations should be done ``openly.'' \117\ In describing       whom he wanted Ukraine to investigate, President Trump       mentioned only two people: former Vice President Biden and       his son.\118\ And in describing the claim of foreign       interference in the 2016 election, President Trump declared       that ``they say a lot of it started with Ukraine,'' and that       ``[w]hatever you can do, it's very important that you do it       if that's possible.'' \119\ Absent from the discussion was       any mention by President Trump of anti-corruption reforms in       Ukraine.        One of President Trump's chief agents for carrying out the       President's agenda in Ukraine, Ambassador Gordon Sondland,       testified that President Trump's effort to condition release       of the much-needed security assistance on an announcement of       the investigations was as clear as ``two plus two equals       four.'' \120\ Sondland communicated to President Zelensky's       advisor that Ukraine would likely not receive assistance       unless President Zelensky publicly announced the       investigations.\121\ And President Trump later confirmed to       Ambassador Sondland that President Zelensky ``must announce       the opening of the investigations and he should want to do       it.'' \122\        President Trump ultimately released the military       assistance, but only after the press publicly reported the       hold, after the President learned that a whistleblower within       the Intelligence Community had filed a complaint about his       misconduct, and after the House publicly announced an       investigation of the President's scheme. In short, President       Trump released the security assistance for Ukraine only after       he got caught.\123\                         Withheld White House Meeting         On April 21, 2019, the day President Zelensky was elected,       President Trump invited him to a meeting at the White       House.\124\ The meeting would have signaled American support       for the new Ukrainian administration, its strong anti-      corruption reform agenda, and its efforts to defend against       Russian aggression and to make peace.\125\ President Trump,       however, exercised his official power to withhold the meeting       as leverage in his scheme to pressure President Zelensky into       announcing the investigations to help his reelection       campaign.        The evidence is unambiguous that President Trump and his       agents conditioned the White House meeting on Ukraine's       announcement of the investigations. Ambassador Sondland       testified that President Trump wanted ``a public statement       from President Zelensky'' committing to the investigations as       a ``prerequisite[]'' for the White House meeting.\126\       Ambassador Sondland further testified: ``I know that members       of this committee frequently frame these complicated issues       in the form of a simple question: Was there a quid pro quo?       As I testified previously with regard to the requested White       House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes.''       \127\        To this day, President Trump maintains leverage over       President Zelensky. A White House meeting has still not taken       place,\128\ and President Trump continues publicly to urge       Ukraine to conduct these investigations.\129\      B. President Trump Exercised Official Power to Benefit Himself                                 Personally         Overwhelming evidence demonstrates that the announcement of       investigations on which President Trump conditioned the       official acts had no legitimate policy rationale, and instead       were corruptly intended to assist his 2020 reelection       campaign.\130\        First, although there was no basis for the two conspiracy       theories that President Trump advanced,\131\ public       announcements that these theories were being investigated       would be of immense political value to him--and him alone.       The public announcement of an investigation of former Vice       President Biden would yield enormous political benefits for       President Trump, who viewed the former Vice President as a       serious political rival in the 2020 U.S. Presidential       election. Unsurprisingly, President Trump's efforts to       advance the conspiracy theory accelerated after news broke       that Vice President Biden would run for President in       2020.\132\ President Trump benefited from such an       announcement of a criminal investigation into his       Presidential opponent in 2016.\133\ An announcement of a       criminal investigation regarding a 2020 rival would likewise       be extremely helpful to his reelection prospects.        President Trump would similarly have viewed an       investigation into Ukrainian interference in the 2016       election as helpful in undermining the conclusion that he had       benefitted from Russian election interference in 2016, and       that he was the preferred candidate of President Putin--both       of which President Trump viewed as calling into question the       legitimacy of his Presidency. An announcement that Ukraine       was investigating its own alleged 2016 election       interference would have turned these facts on their head.       President Trump would have grounds to claim--falsely--that       he was elected President in 2016 not because he was the       beneficiary of Russian election interference, but in spite       of Ukrainian election interference aimed at helping his       opponent.        Second, agents and associates of President Trump who helped       carry out his agenda in Ukraine confirmed that his efforts to       pressure President Zelensky into announcing the desired       investigations were intended for his personal political       benefit rather than for a legitimate policy purpose. For       example, after speaking with President Trump, Ambassador       Sondland told a colleague that President Trump ``did not give       a [expletive] about Ukraine,'' and instead cared only about       ``big stuff'' that benefitted him personally ``like the Biden       investigation that Mr. Giuliani was pushing.'' \134\ And Mick       Mulvaney, President Trump's Acting Chief of Staff,       acknowledged to a reporter that there was a quid pro quo with       Ukraine involving the military aid, conceded that ``[t]here       is going to be political influence in foreign policy,'' and       stated, ``I have news for everybody: get over it.'' \135\        Third, the involvement of President Trump's personal       attorney, Mr. Giuliani--who has professional obligations to       the President but not the Nation--underscores that President       Trump sought the investigations for personal and political       reasons rather than legitimate foreign policy reasons. Mr.       Giuliani openly and repeatedly acknowledged that he was       pursuing the Ukrainian investigations to advance the       President's interests, stating: ``this isn't foreign       policy.'' \136\ Instead, Mr. Giuliani said that he was       seeking information that ``will be very, very helpful to my       client.'' \137\ Mr. Giuliani made similar representations to       the Ukrainian government. In a letter to President-elect       Zelensky, Mr. Giuliani stated that he ``represent[ed] him       [President Trump] as a private citizen, not as President of       the United States'' and was acting with the President's       ``knowledge and consent.'' \138\ President Trump placed Mr.       Giuliani at the hub of the pressure campaign on Ukraine, and       directed U.S. officials responsible for Ukraine to ``talk to       Rudy.'' \139\ Indeed, during their July 25 call, President       Trump pressed President Zelensky to speak with Mr. Giuliani       directly, stating: ``Rudy very much knows what's happening       and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that       would be great.'' \140\        Fourth, President Trump's pursuit of the sham       investigations marked a dramatic deviation from longstanding       bipartisan American foreign policy goals in Ukraine.       Legitimate investigations could have been recognized as an       anti-corruption foreign policy  [[Page S295]]       goal, but there was no factual basis for an investigation       into the Bidens or into supposed Ukrainian interference in       the 2016 election.\141\ To the contrary, the requested       investigations were precisely the type of political       investigations that American foreign policy dissuades other       countries from undertaking. That explains why the scheme to       obtain the announcements was pursued through the President's       chosen political appointees and his personal attorney; \142\       why Trump Administration officials attempted to keep the       scheme from becoming public due to its ``sensitive nature'';       \143\ why no credible explanation for the hold on security       assistance was provided even within the U.S. government;       \144\ why, over Defense Department objections, President       Trump and his allies violated the law by withholding the aid;       \145\ and why, after the scheme was uncovered, President       Trump falsely claimed that his pursuit of the investigations       did not involve a quid pro quo.\146\        Fifth, American and Ukrainian officials alike saw President       Trump's scheme for what it was: improper and political. As we       expect the testimony of Ambassador John Bolton would confirm,       President Trump's National Security Advisor stated that he       wanted no ``part of whatever drug deal'' President Trump's       agents were pursuing in Ukraine.\147\ Dr. Hill testified that       Ambassador Sondland was becoming involved in a ``domestic       political errand'' in pressing Ukraine to announce the       investigations.\148\ Jennifer Williams, an advisor to Vice       President Mike Pence, testified that the President's       solicitation of investigations was a ``domestic political       matter.'' \149\ Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the NSC's       Director for Ukraine, testified that ``[i]t is improper for       the President of the United States to demand a foreign       government investigate a U.S. citizen and a political       opponent.'' \150\ William Taylor, who took over as Charge       d'Affaires in Kyiv after President Trump recalled Ambassador       Yovanovitch, emphasized that ``I think it's crazy to withhold       security assistance for help with a political campaign.''       \151\ And George Kent, a State Department official, testified       that ``asking another country to investigate a prosecution       for political reasons undermines our advocacy of the rule of       law.'' \152\        Ukrainian officials also understood that President Trump's       corrupt effort to solicit the sham investigations would drag       them into domestic U.S. politics. In response to the       President's efforts, a senior Ukrainian official conveyed to       Ambassador Taylor that President Zelensky ``did not want to       be used as a pawn in a U.S. reelection campaign.'' \153\       Another Ukrainian official later stated that ``it's       critically important for the west not to pull us into some       conflicts between their ruling elites[.]'' \154\ And when       Ambassador Kurt Volker tried to warn President Zelensky's       advisor against investigating President Zelensky's former       political opponent--the prior Ukrainian president--the       advisor retorted, ``What, you mean like asking us to       investigate Clinton and Biden?'' \155\ David Holmes, a career       diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, highlighted this       hypocrisy: ``While we had advised our Ukrainian counterparts       to voice a commitment to following the rule of law and       generally investigating credible corruption allegations,''       U.S. officials were making ``a demand that President Zelensky       personally commit on a cable news channel to a specific       investigation of President Trump's political rival.'' \156\        Finally, there is no credible alternative explanation for       President Trump's conduct. It is not credible that President       Trump sought announcements of the investigations because he       was in fact concerned with corruption in Ukraine or burden-      sharing with our European allies, as he claimed after the       scheme was uncovered.\157\        Before news of former Vice President Biden's candidacy       broke, President Trump showed no interest in corruption in       Ukraine, and in prior years he approved military assistance       to Ukraine without controversy.\158\ After his candidacy was       announced, President Trump remained indifferent to anti-      corruption measures beyond the two investigations he was       demanding.\159\ When he first spoke with President Zelensky       on April 21, President Trump ignored the recommendation of       his national security advisors and did not mention corruption       at all--even though the purpose of the call was to       congratulate President Zelensky on a victory based on an       anti-corruption platform.\160\ President Trump's entire       policy team agreed that President Zelensky was genuinely       committed to reforms, yet President Trump refused a White       House meeting that the team advised would support President       Zelensky's anti-corruption agenda.\161\ President Trump's own       Department of Defense, in consultation with the State       Department, had certified in May 2019 that Ukraine satisfied       all anti-corruption standards needed to receive the       Congressionally appropriated military aid, yet President       Trump nevertheless withheld that vital assistance.\162\ He       recalled without explanation Ambassador Yovanovitch, who was       widely recognized as a champion in fighting corruption,\163\       disparaged her while praising a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor       general,\164\ and oversaw efforts to cut foreign programs       tasked with combating corruption in Ukraine and       elsewhere.\165\        Moreover, had President Trump truly sought to assist       Ukraine's anti-corruption efforts, he would have focused on       ensuring that Ukraine actually conducted investigations of       the purported issues he identified. But actual investigations       were never the point. President Trump was interested only in       the announcement of the investigations because that       announcement would accomplish his real goal--bolstering his       reelection efforts.\166\        President Trump's purported concern about sharing the       burden of assistance to Ukraine with Europe is equally       without basis. From the time OMB announced the illegal hold       until it was lifted, no credible reason was provided to       Executive Branch agencies for the hold, despite repeated       efforts by national security officials to obtain an       explanation.\167\ It was not until September-- approximately       two months after President Trump had directed the hold and       after the President had learned of the whistleblower       complaint--that the hold, for the first time, was attributed       to the President's concern about other countries not       contributing more to Ukraine.\168\ If the President was       genuinely concerned about burden-sharing, it makes no sense       that he kept his own Administration in the dark about the       issue for months, never made any contemporaneous public       statements about it, never ordered a review of burden-      sharing,\169\ never ordered his officials to push Europe to       increase their contributions,\170\ and then released the aid       without any change in Europe's contribution.\171\ The concern       about burden-sharing is an after-the-fact rationalization       designed to conceal President Trump's abuse of power.           C. President Trump Jeopardized U.S. National Interests         President Trump's efforts to solicit foreign interference       to help his reelection campaign is pernicious, but his       conduct is all the more alarming because it endangered U.S.       national security, jeopardized our alliances, and undermined       our efforts to promote the rule of law globally.        Ukraine is a ``strategic partner of the United States'' on       the front lines of an ongoing conflict with Russia.\172\ The       United States has approved military assistance to Ukraine       with bipartisan support since 2014, and that assistance is       critical to preventing Russia's expansion and       aggression. This military assistance--which President       Trump withheld in service of his own political interests--      ``saves lives'' by making Ukrainian resistance to Russia       more effective.\173\ It likewise advances American       national security interests because, ``[i]f Russia       prevails and Ukraine falls to Russian dominion, we can       expect to see other attempts by Russia to expand its       territory and influence.'' \174\ Indeed, the reason the       United States provides assistance to the Ukrainian       military is ``so that they can fight Russia over there,       and we don't have to fight Russia here.'' \175\ President       Trump's delay in providing the military assistance       jeopardized these national security interests and       emboldened Russia even though the funding was ultimately       released--particularly because the delay occurred ``when       Russia was watching closely to gauge the level of American       support for the Ukrainian Government.'' \176\ But for a       subsequent act of Congress, approximately $35 million of       military assistance to Ukraine would have lapsed and been       unavailable as a result of the President's abuse of       power.\177\        The White House meeting that President Trump promised       President Zelensky--but continues to withhold--would       similarly have signaled to Russia that the United States       stands behind Ukraine, showing ``U.S. support at the highest       levels.'' \178\ By refusing to hold this meeting, President       Trump denied Ukraine a showing of strength that could deter       further Russian aggression and help Ukraine negotiate a       favorable end to its war with Russia.\179\ The withheld       meeting also undercuts President Zelensky's domestic       standing, diminishing his ability to advance his ambitious       anti-corruption reforms.\180\        Equally troubling is that President Trump's scheme sent a       clear message to our allies that the United States may       capriciously withhold critical assistance for our President's       personal benefit, causing our allies to constantly ``question       the extent to which they can count on us.'' \181\ Because       American leadership depends on ``the power of our example and       the consistency of our purpose,'' President Trump's ``conduct       undermines the U.S., exposes our friends, and widens the       playing field for autocrats like President Putin.'' \182\ And       President Trump's use of official acts to pressure Ukraine to       announce politically motivated investigations harms our       credibility in promoting democratic values and the rule of       law in Ukraine and around the world. American credibility       abroad ``is based on a respect for the United States,'' and       ``if we damage that respect,'' American foreign policy cannot       do its job.\183\        President Trump abused the powers of his office to invite       foreign interference in an election for his own personal       political gain and to the detriment of American national       security interests. He abandoned his oath to faithfully       execute the laws and betrayed his public trust. President       Trump's misconduct presents a danger to our democratic       processes, our national security, and our commitment to the       rule of law. He must be removed from office.      II. The Senate Should Convict President Trump of Obstruction           of Congress        In exercising its responsibility to investigate and       consider the impeachment of a President of the United States,       the House is constitutionally entitled to the relevant       information from the Executive Branch concerning the       President's misconduct.\184\ The Framers, the courts, and       past Presidents have recognized that honoring Congress's  [[Page S296]]       right to information in an impeachment investigation is a       critical safeguard in our system of divided powers.\185\       Otherwise, a President could hide his own wrongdoing to       prevent Congress from discovering impeachable misconduct,       effectively nullifying Congress's impeachment power.\186\       President Trump's sweeping effort to shield his misconduct       from view and protect himself from impeachment thus works a       grave constitutional harm and is itself an impeachable       offense.   A. The House Is Constitutionally Entitled to the Relevant Information                         in an Impeachment Inquiry         The House has the power to issue subpoenas and demand       compliance in an impeachment investigation. The Supreme Court       has long recognized that, ``[w]ithout the power to       investigate--including of course the authority to compel       testimony, either through its own processes or through       judicial trial--Congress could be seriously handicapped in       its efforts to exercise its constitutional function wisely       and effectively.'' \187\ The Court has stressed that it is       the ``duty of all citizens'' and ``their unremitting       obligation to respond to subpoenas, to respect the dignity of       the Congress and its committees and to testify fully with       respect to matters within the province of proper       investigation.'' \188\ The Court has repeatedly emphasized       that Congress's ``power of inquiry--with process to enforce       it--is an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the       legislative function.'' \189\ Congress ``cannot legislate       wisely or effectively in the absence of information.'' \190\        This principle is most compelling when the House exercises       its ``sole Power of Impeachment.'' Congress's already       ``broad'' investigatory authority,\191\ and its need for       information, are at their apex in an impeachment inquiry. The       principle that the President cannot stand in the way of an       impeachment investigation is ``of great consequence''       because, as Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story long ago       explained, ``the president should not have the power of       preventing a thorough investigation of [his] conduct, or of       securing [himself] against the disgrace of a public       conviction by impeachment, if [he] should deserve it.'' \192\       A Presidential impeachment is ``a matter of the most critical       moment to the Nation'' and it is ``difficult to conceive of a       more compelling need than that of this country for an       unswervingly fair inquiry based on all the pertinent       information.'' \193\ The Supreme Court thus recognized nearly       140 years ago that where the House or Senate is determining a       ``question of . . . impeachment,'' there is ``no reason to       doubt the right to compel the attendance of witnesses, and       their answer to proper questions, in the same manner and by       the use of the same means that courts of justice can in like       cases.'' \194\        Like the Supreme Court, members of the earliest Congresses       understood that, without ``the right to inspect every paper       and transaction in any department . . . the power of       impeachment could never be exercised with any effect.'' \195\       Previous Presidents have acknowledged their obligation to       comply with an impeachment investigation, explaining that       such an inquiry ``penetrate[s] into the most secret recesses       of the Executive Departments'' and ``could command the       attendance of any and every agent of the Government, and       compel them to produce all papers, public or private,       official or unofficial, and to testify on oath to all facts       within their knowledge.'' \196\ That acknowledgement is a       matter of common sense. An impeachment inquiry cannot root       out bad actors if those same bad actors control the scope and       nature of the inquiry.        President Trump is an aberration among Presidents in       refusing any and all cooperation in a House impeachment       investigation. Even President Nixon produced numerous       documents in response to Congressional subpoenas and       instructed ``[a]ll members of the White House Staff . . .       [to] appear voluntarily when requested by the [House],'' to       ``testify under oath,'' and to ``answer fully all proper       questions'' \197\--consistent with the near uniform       cooperation of prior Executive Branch officials who had been       subject to impeachment investigations.\198\        Because President Nixon's production of records in response       to the House Judiciary Committee's inquiry was incomplete in       important respects, however, the Committee voted to adopt an       article of impeachment for his obstruction of the       inquiry.\199\ As the Committee explained, in refusing to       provide materials that the Committee ``deemed necessary'' to       the impeachment investigation, President Nixon had       ``substitute[ed] his judgment'' for that of the House and       interposed ``the powers of the presidency against the lawful       subpoenas of the House of Representatives, thereby assuming       to himself functions and judgments necessary to exercise the       sole power of impeachment vested by the Constitution in the       House.'' \200\ The Committee stated that it was not ``within       the power of the President to conduct an inquiry into his own       impeachment, to determine which evidence, and what version or       portion of that evidence, is relevant and necessary to such       an inquiry. These are matters which, under the Constitution,       the House has the sole power to determine.'' \201\ In the       face of Congress's investigation and the mounting evidence of       his misdeeds, President Nixon resigned before the House had       the chance to impeach him for this misconduct.   B. President Trump's Obstruction of the Impeachment Inquiry Violates                   Fundamental Constitutional Principles         The Senate should convict President Trump of Obstruction of       Congress as charged in the Second Article of Impeachment.       President Trump unilaterally declared the House's       investigation ``illegitimate.'' \202\ President Trump's White       House Counsel notified the House that ``President Trump       cannot permit his Administration to participate in this       partisan inquiry under these circumstances.'' \203\ President       Trump then directed his Administration categorically to       withhold documents and testimony from the House.        The facts are undisputed. As charged in the Second Article       of Impeachment, President Trump ``[d]irect[ed] the White       House to defy a lawful subpoena by withholding the production       of documents'' to the Committees; ``[d]irect[ed] other       Executive Branch agencies and offices to defy lawful       subpoenas and withhold the production of documents and       records from the Committees''; and ``[d]irected current and       former Executive Branch officials not to cooperate with the       Committees.'' \204\ In response to President Trump's       directives, OMB, the Department of State, Department of       Energy, and Department of Defense refused to produce any       documents to the House, even though witness testimony has       revealed that additional highly relevant records       exist.\205\ To date, the House Committees have not       received a single document or record from these       departments and agencies pursuant to subpoenas, which       remain in effect.        President Trump personally demanded that his top aides       refuse to testify in response to subpoenas, and nine       Administration officials followed his directive and continue       to defy subpoenas for testimony.\206\ For example, when the       Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena for Mick Mulvaney's       testimony, he produced a November 8 letter from the White       House stating: ``the President directs Mr. Mulvaney not to       appear at the Committee's scheduled deposition on November 8,       2019.'' \207\ When President Trump was unable to silence       witnesses, he resorted to tactics to penalize and intimidate       them. These efforts include President Trump's sustained       attacks on the anonymous whistleblower, and his public       statements designed to discourage witnesses from coming       forward and to embarrass those who did testify.\208\        Refusing to comply with a Congressional impeachment       investigation is not a constitutionally valid decision for a       President to make. President Trump's unprecedented ``complete       defiance of an impeachment inquiry . . . served to cover up       the President's own repeated misconduct and to seize and       control the power of impeachment.'' \209\ President Trump's       directive rejects one of the key features distinguishing our       Republic from a monarchy: that ``[t]he President of the       United States [is] liable to be impeached, tried, and, upon       conviction . . . removed.'' \210\ Allowing President Trump to       avoid conviction on the Second Article would set a dangerous       precedent for future Presidents to hide their misconduct from       Congressional scrutiny during an impeachment inquiry without       fear of accountability.        Notwithstanding President Trump's obstruction, the House       obtained compelling evidence that he abused his power. The       failure of President Trump's obstruction and attempted cover-      up, however, does not excuse his misconduct. There can be no       doubt that the withheld documents and testimony would provide       Congress with highly pertinent information about the       President's corrupt scheme. Indeed, witnesses have testified       about specific withheld records concerning President Trump's       July 25 call with President Zelensky and related       materials,\211\ and public reports have referred to       additional responsive documents, including ``hundreds of       documents that reveal extensive efforts to generate an after-      the-fact justification for'' withholding the security       aid.\212\       C. President Trump's Excuses for His Obstruction Are Meritless         President Trump has offered various unpersuasive excuses       for his blanket refusal to comply with the House's       impeachment inquiry. President Trump's refusal to provide       information is not a principled assertion of executive       privilege, but rather is a transparent attempt to cover-up       wrongdoing and amass power that the Constitution does not       give him, including the power to decide whether and when       Congress can hold him accountable.        First, while Congressional investigators often accommodate       legitimate Executive Branch interests, the President's       blanket directive to all Executive Branch agencies and       witnesses to defy Congressional subpoenas was not based on       any actual assertion of executive privilege or identification       of particular sensitive information.\213\ The White House       Counsel's letter alluded to ``long-established Executive       Branch confidentiality interests and privileges'' that the       State Department could theoretically invoke,\214\ and the       Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel preemptively       dismissed certain subpoenas as ``invalid'' on the ground that       responsive information was ``potentially protected by       executive privilege.'' \215\ But neither document conveyed an       actual assertion of executive privilege,\216\ which would       require, at a minimum, identification by the President of       particular communications or documents containing protected       material.\217\ The White House cannot justify a blanket       refusal to respond to Congressional subpoenas based on an       executive or other privilege it never in fact invoked.        Regardless, executive privilege is inapplicable here, both       because it may not be used  [[Page S297]]       to conceal wrongdoing--particularly in an impeachment       inquiry--and because the President and his agents have       already diminished any confidentiality interests by speaking       at length about these events in every forum except       Congress.\218\ President Trump has been impeached for       Obstruction of Congress not based upon discrete invocations       of privilege or immunity, but for his directive that the       Executive Branch categorically stonewall the House       impeachment inquiry by refusing to comply with all       subpoenas.\219\        To the extent President Trump claims that he has concealed       evidence to protect the Office of the President, the Framers       considered and rejected that defense. Several delegates at       the Constitutional Convention warned that the impeachment       power would be ``destructive of [the executive's]       independence.'' \220\ But the Framers adopted an impeachment       power anyway because, as Alexander Hamilton observed, ``the       powers relating to impeachments'' are ``an essential check in       the hands of [Congress] upon the encroachments of the       executive.'' \221\ The impeachment power does not exist to       protect the Presidency; it exists to protect the nation from       a corrupt and dangerous President like Donald Trump.        Second, President Trump has no basis for objecting to how       the House conducted its impeachment proceedings. The       Constitution vests the House with the ``sole Power of       Impeachment'' \222\ and the power to ``determine the Rules of       its Proceedings.'' \223\        The rights that President Trump has demanded have never       been recognized and have not been afforded in any prior       Presidential impeachment.\224\ President Trump has been       afforded protections equal to or greater than those afforded       Presidents Nixon and Clinton during their impeachment       proceedings in the House.\225\ Any claim that President Trump       was entitled to due process rights modeled on a criminal       trial during the entirety of the House impeachment inquiry       ignores both law and history. A House impeachment inquiry       cannot be compared to a criminal trial because the Senate,       not the House, possesses the ``sole Power to try       Impeachments.'' \226\ The Constitution does not entitle       President Trump to a separate, full trial first in the House.        Even indulging the analogy to a criminal trial, no person       appearing before a prosecutor or grand jury deciding whether       to bring charges would have the rights President Trump has       claimed. As the House Judiciary Committee Chairman observed       during Watergate, ``it is not a right but a privilege or a       courtesy'' for the President to participate through counsel       in House impeachment proceedings.\227\ President Trump's       demands are just another effort to obstruct the House in the       exercise of its constitutional duty.        Third, President Trump's assertion that his impeachment for       obstruction of Congress is invalid because the Committees did       not first seek judicial enforcement of their subpoenas       ignores again the Constitutional dictate that the House has       sole authority to determine how to proceed with an       impeachment. It also ignores President Trump's own arguments       to the federal courts.        President Trump is telling one story to Congress while       spinning a different tale in the courts. He is saying to       Congress that the Committees should have sued the Executive       Branch in court to enforce their subpoenas. But he has argued       to that court that Congressional Committees cannot sue the       Executive Branch to enforce their subpoenas.\228\ President       Trump cannot tell Congress that it must pursue him in court,       while simultaneously telling the courts that they are       powerless to enforce Congressional subpoenas.        President Trump's approach to the Judicial Branch thus       mirrors his obstruction of the Legislative Branch--in his       view, neither can engage in any review of his conduct. This       position conveys the President's dangerously misguided belief       that no other branch of government may check his power or       hold him accountable for abusing it.\229\ That belief is       fundamentally incompatible with our form of government.        Months or years of litigation over each of the House's       subpoenas is in any event no answer in this time-sensitive       inquiry. The House's subpoena to former White House Counsel       Don McGahn was issued in April 2019, but it is still winding       its way through the courts over President Trump's strong       opposition, even on an expedited schedule.\230\ Litigating       President Trump's direction that each subpoena be denied       would conflict with the House's urgent duty to act on the       compelling evidence of impeachable misconduct that it has       uncovered. Further delay could also compromise the integrity       of the 2020 election.        When the Framers entrusted the House with the sole power of       impeachment, they obviously meant to equip the House with the       necessary tools to discover abuses of power by the President.       Without that authority, the Impeachment Clause would fail as       an effective safeguard against tyranny. A system in which the       President cannot be charged with a crime, as the Department       of Justice believes, and in which he can nullify the       impeachment power through blanket obstruction, as President       Trump has done here, is a system in which the President is       above the law. The Senate should convict President Trump for       his categorical obstruction of the House's impeachment       inquiry and ensure that this President, and any future       President, cannot commit impeachable offenses and then avoid       accountability by covering them up.      III. The Senate Should Immediately Remove President Trump           From Office to Prevent Further Abuses        President Trump has demonstrated his continued willingness       to corrupt free and fair elections, betray our national       security, and subvert the constitutional separation of       powers--all for personal gain. President Trump's ongoing       pattern of misconduct demonstrates that he is an immediate       threat to the Nation and the rule of law. It is imperative       that the Senate convict and remove him from office now, and       permanently bar him from holding federal office.  A. President Trump's Repeated Abuse of Power Presents an Ongoing Threat                              to Our Elections         President Trump's solicitation of Ukrainian interference in       the 2020 election is not an isolated incident. It is part of       his ongoing and deeply troubling course of misconduct that,       as the First Article of Impeachment states, is ``consistent       with President Trump's previous invitations of foreign       interference in United States elections.'' \231\        These previous efforts include inviting Russian       interference in the 2016 Presidential election.\232\ As       Special Counsel Mueller concluded, the ``Russian government       interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and       systematic fashion.'' \233\ Throughout the 2016 election       cycle, the Trump Campaign maintained significant contacts       with agents of the Russian government who were offering       damaging information concerning then-candidate Trump's       political opponent, and Mr. Trump repeatedly praised--and       even publicly requested--the release of politically charged       Russian-hacked emails.\234\ The Trump Campaign welcomed       Russia's election interference because it ``expected it would       benefit electorally from information stolen and released       through Russian efforts.'' \235\        President Trump's recent actions confirm that public       censure is insufficient to deter him from continuing to       facilitate foreign interference in U.S. elections. In June       2019, President Trump declared that he sees ``nothing wrong       with listening'' to a foreign power that offers information       detrimental to a political adversary. In the President's       words: ``I think I'd take it.'' \236\ Asked whether such       information should be reported to law enforcement, President       Trump retorted: ``Give me a break, life doesn't work that       way.'' \237\        Only one day after Special Counsel Mueller testified to       Congress that the Trump Campaign welcomed and sought to       capitalize on Russia's efforts to damage the President's       political rival in 2016, President Trump spoke to President       Zelensky, pressuring Ukraine to announce investigations to       damage President Trump's political opponent in the 2020       election and undermine Special Counsel Mueller's       findings.\238\ President Trump still embraces that call as       both ``routine'' and ``perfect.'' \239\ President Trump's       conduct would have horrified the Framers of our republic.        In its findings, the Intelligence Committee emphasized the       ``proximate threat of further presidential attempts to       solicit foreign interference in our next election.'' \240\       That threat has not abated. In a sign that President Trump's       corrupt efforts to encourage interference in the 2020       election persist, he reiterated his desire for Ukraine to       investigate his political opponents even after the scheme was       discovered and the impeachment inquiry was announced. When       asked in October 2019 what he hoped President Zelensky would       do about ``the Bidens,'' President Trump answered that it was       ``very simple'' and he hoped Ukraine would ``start a major       investigation.'' \241\ Unsolicited, he added that ``China       should [likewise] start an investigation into the Bidens.''       \242\        President Trump has also continued to engage Mr. Giuliani       to pursue the sham investigations on his behalf.\243\ One day       after President Trump was impeached, Mr. Giuliani claimed       that he gathered derogatory evidence against Vice President       Biden during a fact-finding trip to Ukraine--a trip where he       met with a current Ukrainian official who attended a KGB       school in Moscow and has led calls in Ukraine to investigate       Burisma and the Bidens.\244\ During the trip, Mr. Giuliani       tweeted: ``The conversation about corruption in Ukraine was       based on compelling evidence of criminal conduct by then VP       Biden, in 2016, that has not been resolved and until it is       will be a major obstacle to the US assisting Ukraine with its       anti-corruption reforms.'' \245\ Not only was Mr. Giuliani       perpetuating the false allegations against the former Vice       President, but he was reiterating the threat that President       Trump had used to pressure President Zelensky to announce the       investigations: that U.S. assistance to Ukraine would be       withheld until Ukraine pursued the sham investigations. Mr.       Giuliani has stated that he and the President continue to be       ``on the same page.'' \246\ Ukraine, as well, understands       that Mr. Giuliani represents President Trump's       interests.\247\        President Trump's unrepentant embrace of foreign election       interference illustrates the threat posed by his continued       occupancy of the Office of the President. It also refutes the       assertion that the consequences of his misconduct should be       decided by the voters in the 2020 election. The aim of       President Trump's Ukraine scheme was to corrupt the integrity       of the 2020 election by enlisting a foreign power to give him       an unfair advantage--in short, to cheat. That threat persists       today.        B. President Trump's Obstruction of Congress Threatens Our                            Constitutional Order         President Trump's obstruction of the House's impeachment       inquiry intended to  [[Page S298]]       hold him accountable for his misconduct presents a serious       danger to our constitutional checks and balances.        President Trump has made clear that he refuses to accept       Congress's express--and exclusive--constitutional role in       conducting impeachments.\248\ He has thereby subverted the       Constitution that he pledged to uphold when he was       inaugurated on the steps of the Capitol. By his words and       deeds, President Trump has obstructed the House's impeachment       inquiry at every turn: He has dismissed impeachment as       ``illegal, invalid, and unconstitutional''; \249\ directed       the Executive Branch not to comply with House subpoenas for       documents and testimony; \250\ and intimidated and threatened       the anonymous intelligence community whistleblower as well as       the patriotic public servants who honored their subpoenas and       testified before the House.\251\        President Trump's obstruction is part of an ominous pattern       of efforts ``to undermine United States Government       investigations into foreign interference in United States       elections.'' \252\ Rather than assist Special Counsel       Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016       election and his own campaign's exploitation of that foreign       assistance, President Trump repeatedly used the powers of his       office to impede it. Among other actions, President Trump       directed the White House Counsel to fire the Special Counsel       and then create a false record of the firing, tampered with       witnesses in the Special Counsel's investigation, and       repeatedly and publicly attacked the legitimacy of the       investigation.\253\ President Trump has instructed the former       White House Counsel to defy a House Committee's subpoena for       testimony concerning these matters and the Department of       Justice has argued that the courts cannot even hear the       Committee's action to enforce its subpoena.\254\        President Trump's current obstruction of Congress is,       therefore, not the first time he has committed misconduct       concerning a federal investigation into election interference       and then sought to hide it. Allowing this pattern to continue       without repercussion would send the clear message that       President Trump is correct in his view that no governmental       body can hold him accountable for wrongdoing. That view is       erroneous and exceptionally dangerous.  C. The Senate Should Convict and Remove President Trump to Protect Our            System of Government and National Security Interests         The Senate should convict and remove President Trump to       avoid serious and long-term damage to our democratic values       and the Nation's security.        If the Senate permits President Trump to remain in office,       he and future leaders would be emboldened to welcome, and       even enlist, foreign interference in elections for years to       come. When the American people's faith in their electoral       process is shaken and its results called into question, the       essence of democratic self-government is called into doubt.        Failure to remove President Trump would signal that a       President's personal interests may take precedence over those       of the Nation, alarming our allies and emboldening our       adversaries. Our leadership depends on the power of our       example and the consistency of our purpose,'' but because of       President Trump's actions, ``[b]oth have now been opened to       question.'' \255\        Ratifying President Trump's behavior would likewise erode       longstanding U.S. anti-corruption policy, which encourages       countries to refrain from using the criminal justice system       to investigate political opponents. As many witnesses       explained, urging Ukraine to engage in ``selective       politically associated investigations or prosecutions''       undermines the power of America's example and our       longstanding efforts to promote the rule of law abroad.\256\        An acquittal would also provide license to President Trump       and his successors to use taxpayer dollars for personal       political ends. Foreign aid is not the only vulnerable source       of funding; Presidents could also hold hostage federal funds       earmarked for States--such as money for natural disasters,       highways, and healthcare--unless and until State officials       perform personal political favors. Any Congressional       appropriation would be an opportunity for a President to       solicit a favor for his personal political purposes--or for       others to seek to curry favor with him. Such an outcome would       be entirely incompatible with our constitutional system of       self-government.        President Trump has betrayed the American people and the       ideals on which the Nation was founded. Unless he is removed       from office, he will continue to endanger our national       security, jeopardize the integrity of our elections, and       undermine our core constitutional principles.

[In the Senate of the United States Sitting as a Court of Impeachment]               In re Impeachment of President Donald J. Trump  Statement of Material Facts--Attachment to the Trial Memorandum of the    United States House of Representatives in the Impeachment Trial of                         President Donald J. Trump                                 INTRODUCTION         The U.S. House of Representatives has adopted Articles of       Impeachment charging President Donald J. Trump with abuse of       office and obstruction of Congress. The House's Trial       Memorandum explains why the Senate should convict and remove       President Trump from office, and permanently bar him from       government service. The Memorandum relies on this Statement       of Material Facts, which summarizes key evidence relating to       the President's misconduct.        As further described below, and as detailed in House       Committee reports,\1\ President Trump used the powers of his       office and U.S. taxpayers' money to pressure a foreign       country, Ukraine, to interfere in the 2020 U.S. Presidential       election on his behalf. President Trump's goals--which became       known to multiple U.S. officials who testified before the       House--were simple and starkly political: he wanted Ukraine's       new President to announce investigations that would assist       his 2020 reelection campaign and tarnish a political       opponent, former Vice President Joseph Biden, Jr. As       leverage, President Trump illegally withheld from Ukraine       nearly $400 million in vital military and other security       assistance that had been appropriated by Congress, and an       official White House meeting that President Trump had       promised Volodymyr Zelensky, the newly elected President of       Ukraine. President Trump did this despite U.S. national       security officials' unanimous opposition to withholding the       aid from Ukraine, placing his own personal and political       interests above the national security interests of the United       States and undermining the integrity of our democracy.        When this scheme became known and Committees of the House       launched an investigation, the President, for the first time       in American history, ordered the categorical obstruction of       an impeachment inquiry. President Trump directed that no       witnesses should testify and no documents should be produced       to the House, a co-equal branch of government endowed by the       Constitution with the ``sole Power of Impeachment.'' \2\       President Trump's conduct--both in soliciting a foreign       country's interference in a U.S. election and then       obstructing the ensuing investigation into that       interference--was consistent with his prior conduct during       and after the 2016 election.                         STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS       I. President Trump's Abuse of Power   A. The President's Scheme To Solicit Foreign Interference in the 2020      Election From the New Ukrainian Government Began in Spring 2019         1. On April 21, 2019, Volodymyr Zelensky, a political       neophyte, won a landslide victory in Ukraine's Presidential       election.\3\ Zelensky campaigned on an anti-corruption       platform, and his victory reaffirmed the Ukrainian people's       strong desire for reform.\4\        2. When President Trump called to congratulate Zelensky       later that day, President Trump did not raise any concerns       about corruption in Ukraine, although his staff had prepared       written materials for him recommending that he do so, and the       White House call readout incorrectly indicated he did.\5\        3. During the call, President Trump promised President-      elect Zelensky that a high-level U.S. delegation would attend       his inauguration and told him, ``When you're settled in and       ready, I'd like to invite you to the White House.'' \6\        4. Both events would have demonstrated strong support by       the United States as Ukraine fought a war--and negotiated for       peace--with Russia. ``Russia was watching closely to gauge       the level of American support for the Ukrainian Government.''       \7\ A White House visit also would have bolstered Zelensky's       standing at home as he pursued his anti-corruption agenda.\8\        5. Following the April 21 call, President Trump asked Vice       President Mike Pence to lead the American delegation to       President Zelensky's inauguration. During his own call with       President-elect Zelensky on April 23, Vice President Pence       confirmed that he would attend the inauguration ``if the       dates worked out.'' \9\        6. On April 23, the media reported that former Vice       President Biden was going to enter the 2020 race for the       Democratic nomination for President of the United States.\10\        7. The next day, April 24, the State Department executed       President Trump's order to recall the U.S. ambassador to       Ukraine, Marie ``Masha'' Yovanovitch, who was a well-regarded       career diplomat and champion for anti-corruption reforms in       Ukraine.\11\        8. The removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch was the       culmination of a months-long smear campaign waged by the       President's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and other allies       of the President.\12\ The President also helped amplify the       smear campaign.\13\        9. Upon her return to the United States, Ambassador       Yovanovitch was informed by State Department officials that       there was no substantive reason or cause for her removal, but       that President Trump had simply ``lost confidence'' in       her.\14\        10. Mr. Giuliani later disclosed the true motive for       Ambassador Yovanovitch's removal: Mr. Giuliani ``believed       that [he] needed Yovanovitch out of the way'' because ``[s]he       was going to make the investigations difficult for       everybody.'' \15\        11. Mr. Giuliani was referring to the two politically       motivated investigations that President Trump solicited from       Ukraine in order to assist his 2020 reelection campaign: one       into former Vice President Biden and a Ukrainian gas company,       Burisma Holdings, on whose board Biden's son sat; \16\ the       other into a discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not       Russia, had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election to help       Hillary Clinton's campaign. One element of the latter       conspiracy theory was that CrowdStrike--a NASDAQ-listed       cybersecurity firm based in Sunnyvale, California, that the       President erroneously believed was owned by a Ukrainian       oligarch--had colluded with the Democratic National Committee       (DNC) to frame Russia and help the election campaign of       Hillary Clinton.\17\        12. There was no factual basis for either investigation. As       to the first, witnesses unanimously testified that there was       no credible evidence to support the allegations that, in late       2015, Vice President Biden corruptly encouraged Ukraine to       remove then-Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin because he was       investigating Burisma.\18\ Rather, Vice President Biden was       carrying out official U.S. policy--with bipartisan support       \19\--and promoting anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine       because Shokin was viewed by the United States, its European       partners, and the International Monetary Fund to be       ineffectual at prosecuting corruption and was himself       corrupt.\20\ In fact, witnesses unanimously testified that       the removal of Shokin made it more likely that Ukraine would       investigate corruption, including Burisma and its owner, not       less likely.\21\ The Ukrainian Parliament removed Shokin in       March 2016.\22\        13. As to the second investigation, the U.S. Intelligence       Community determined that Russia--not Ukraine--interfered in       the 2016 election.\23\ The Senate Select Committee on       Intelligence reached the same conclusion following its own       lengthy bipartisan investigation.\24\ Special Counsel Robert       Mueller, III, likewise concluded that the ``Russian       government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in       sweeping and systematic fashion.'' \25\ And FBI Director       Christopher Wray, a Trump appointee, recently confirmed that       law enforcement ``ha[s] no information that indicates that       Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election.''       \26\        14. As Dr. Fiona Hill--who served until July 2019 as the       Senior Director of European and Russian Affairs at the       National Security Council (NSC) under President Trump until       July 2019--testified, the theory of Ukrainian interference in       the 2016 election is a ``fictional narrative that is being       perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services       themselves'' to deflect from Russia's own culpability and to       drive a wedge between the United States and Ukraine.\27\ In       fact, shortly after the 2016 U.S. election, this conspiracy       theory was promoted by none other than President Vladimir       Putin himself.\28\ On May 3, 2019, shortly after President       Zelensky's election, President Trump and President Putin       spoke by telephone, including about the so-called ``Russian       Hoax.'' \29\        15. President Trump's senior advisors had attempted to       dissuade the President from promoting this conspiracy theory,       to no avail. Dr. Hill testified that President Trump's former       Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert and former National       Security Advisor H.R. McMaster ``spent a lot of time trying       to refute this [theory] in the first year of the       administration.'' \30\ Bossert later said the false narrative       about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election was ``not       only a conspiracy theory, it is completely debunked.'' \31\   B. The President Enlisted His Personal Attorney and U.S. Officials To              Help Execute the Scheme for His Personal Benefit         16. Shortly after his April 21 call with President       Zelensky, President Trump began to publicly press for the two       investigations he wanted Ukraine to pursue. On April 25--the       day that former Vice President Biden announced his candidacy       for the Democratic nomination for President--President Trump       called into Sean Hannity's prime time Fox News show.       Referencing alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016       election, President Trump said, ``It sounds like big stuff,''       and suggested that the Attorney General might       investigate.\32\  [[Page S301]]             17. On May 6, in a separate Fox News interview, President       Trump claimed Vice President Biden's advocacy for Mr.       Shokin's dismissal in 2016 was ``a very serious problem'' and       ``a major scandal, major problem.'' \33\        18. On May 9, the New York Times reported that Mr. Giuliani       was planning to travel to Ukraine to urge President Zelensky       to pursue the investigations.\34\ Mr. Giuliani acknowledged       that ``[s]omebody could say it's improper'' to pressure       Ukraine to open investigations that would benefit President       Trump, but he argued:        [T]his isn't foreign policy--I'm asking them to do an       investigation that they're doing already, and that other       people are telling them to stop. And I'm going to give them       reasons why they shouldn't stop it because that information       will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to       be helpful to my government.\35\        Ukraine was not, in fact, ``already'' conducting these       investigations. As described below, the Trump Administration       repeatedly tried but failed to get Ukrainian officials to       instigate these investigations. According to Mr. Giuliani,       the President supported his actions, stating that President       Trump ``basically knows what I'm doing, sure, as his       lawyer.'' \36\        19. IN a letter dated May 10, 2019, and addressed to       President-elect Zelensky, Mr. Giuliani wrote that he       ``represent[ed] him [President Trump] as a private citizen,       not as President of the United States.'' In his capacity as       ``personal counsel to President Trump, and with his knowledge       and consent,'' Mr. Giuliani requested a meeting with       President Zelensky the following week to discuss a ``specific       request.'' \37\        20. On the evening of Friday, May 10, however, Mr. Giuliani       announced that he was canceling his trip.\38\ He later       explained, ``I'm not going to go'' to Ukraine ``because I'm       walking into a group of people that are enemies of the       President.'' \39\        21. By the following Monday morning, May 13, President       Trump had ordered Vice President Pence not to attend       President Zelensky's inauguration in favor of a lower-ranking       delegation led by Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.\40\        22. The U.S. delegation--which also included Ambassador to       the European Union Gordon Sondland, Special Representative       for Ukraine Negotiations Ambassador Kurt Volker, and NSC       Director for Ukraine Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman--      returned from the inauguration convinced that President       Zelensky was genuinely committed to anti-corruption       reforms.\41\        23. At a meeting in the Oval Office on May 23, members of       the delegation relayed their positive impressions to       President Trump and encouraged him to schedule the promised       Oval Office meeting for President Zelensky. President Trump,       however, said he ``didn't believe'' the delegation's positive       assessment, claiming ``that's not what I hear'' from Mr.       Giuliani.\42\ The President cast his dim view of Ukraine in       personal terms, stating that Ukraine ``tried to take me       down'' during the 2016 election--an apparent reference to the       debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the       2016 election to help Hillary Clinton and harm his       campaign.\43\        24. Rather than commit to a date for an Oval Office meeting       with President Zelensky, President Trump directed the       delegation to ``[t]alk to Rudy, talk to Rudy.'' \44\       Ambassador Sondland testified that ``if [the delegation]       never called Rudy and just left it alone nothing would happen       with Ukraine,'' and ``if [the President] was going to have       his mind changed, that was the path.'' \45\ Following the May       23 meeting, Secretary Perry and Ambassadors Sondland and       Volker began to coordinate and work with Mr. Giuliani to       satisfy the President's demands.\46\        25. Mr. Giuliani is not a U.S. government official and has       never served in the Trump Administration. Rather, as he has       repeatedly made clear, his goal was to obtain ``information       [that] will be very, very helpful to my client''--President       Trump.\47\ Mr. Giuliani made clear to Ambassadors Sondland       and Volker, who were in direct communications with Ukrainian       officials, that a White House meeting would not occur until       Ukraine announced its pursuit of the two political       investigations.\48\        26. On June 17, Ambassador Bill Taylor, whom Secretary of       State Mike Pompeo had asked to replace Ambassador       Yovanovitch, arrived in Kyiv as the new Charge       d'Affaires.\49\        27. Ambassador Taylor quickly observed that there was an       ``irregular channel'' led by Mr. Giuliani that, over time,       began to undermine the official channel of U.S. diplomatic       relations with Ukraine.\50\ Ambassador Sondland similarly       testified that the agenda described by Mr. Giuliani became       more ``insidious'' over time.\51\ Mr. Giuliani would prove to       be, as the President's National Security Advisor Ambassador       John Bolton told a colleague, a ``hand grenade that was going       to blow everyone up.'' \52\  C. The President Froze Vital Military and Other Security Assistance for                                  Ukraine         28. Since 2014, Ukraine has been engaged in an ongoing       armed conflict with Russia in the Donbas region of eastern       Ukraine.\53\ Ukraine is a ``strategic partner of the United       States,'' and the United States has long supported Ukraine in       its conflict with Russia.\54\ As Ambassador Volker and       multiple other witnesses testified, supporting Ukraine is       ``critically important'' to U.S. interests, including       countering Russian aggression in the region.\55\        29. Ukrainians face casualties on a near-daily basis in       their ongoing conflict with Russia.\56\ Since 2014, Russian       aggression has resulted in more than 13,000 Ukrainian deaths       on Ukrainian territory,\57\ including approximately 3,331       civilians, and has wounded another 30,000 persons.\58\        30. Since 2014, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and       its annexation of the Crimean Peninsula, Congress has       allocated military and other security assistance funds to       Ukraine on a broad bipartisan basis.\59\ Since 2014, the       United States has provided approximately $3.1 billion in       foreign assistance to Ukraine: $1.5 billion in military and       other security assistance, and $1.6 billion in non-military,       non-humanitarian aid to Ukraine.\60\        31. The military assistance provided by the United States       to Ukraine ``saves lives'' by making Ukrainian resistance to       Russia more effective.\61\ It likewise advances U.S. national       security interests because, ``[i]f Russia prevails and       Ukraine falls to Russian dominion, we can expect to see other       attempts by Russia to expand its territory and influence.''       \62\ Indeed, the reason the United States provides assistance       to the Ukrainian military is ``so that they can fight Russia       over there, and we don't have to fight Russia here.'' \63\        32. The United States' European allies have similarly       provided political and economic support to Ukraine. Since       2014, the European Union (EU) has been the largest donor to       Ukraine.\64\ The EU has extended more macro-financial       assistance to Ukraine--approximately =3.3 billion--than to       any other non-EU country and has committed to extend another       =1.1 billion.\65\ Between 2014 and September 30, 2019, the EU       and the European financial institutions (including the       European Investment Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction       and Development, and others) committed over 15 billion in       grants and loans to support the reform process in       Ukraine.\66\ According to EU data, Germany contributed =786.5       million to Ukraine between 2014 and 2017; the United Kingdom       contributed =105.6 million; and France contributed =61.9       million over that same period (not including the amounts       these countries contribute through the EU).\67\        33. In 2017 and 2018, the United States provided       approximately $511 million and $359 million, respectively, in       foreign assistance to Ukraine, including military and other       security assistance.\68\ During those two years, President       Trump and his Administration allowed the funds to flow to       Ukraine unimpeded.\69\        34. For fiscal year 2019, Congress appropriated and       authorized $391 million in taxpayer-funded security       assistance to Ukraine: $250 million in funds administered by       the Department of Defense (DOD) and $115 million in funds       administered by the State Department, with another $26       million carried over from fiscal year 2018.\70\        35. DOD planned to use the funds to provide Ukraine with       sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, counter-      artillery radars, electronic warfare detection and secure       communications, and night vision equipment, among other       military equipment, to defend itself against Russian forces,       which have occupied part of eastern Ukraine since 2014.\71\       These purposes were consistent with the goals of Congress,       which had appropriated the funds administered by DOD under       the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) for the       purpose of providing ``training; equipment; lethal       assistance; logistics support, supplies and services;       sustainment; and intelligence support to the military and       national security forces of Ukraine, and . . . replacement of       any weapons or articles provided to the Government of       Ukraine.'' \72\        36. On June 18, 2019, after all Congressionally mandated       conditions on the DOD-administered aid--including       certification that Ukraine had adopted sufficient anti-      corruption reforms--were met, DOD issued a press release       announcing its intention to provide the $250 million in       security assistance to Ukraine.\73\        37. On June 19, the Office of Management and Budget 1(OMB)       received questions from President Trump about the funding for       Ukraine.\74\ OMB, in turn, made inquiries with DOD.\75\        38. On June 27, Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney       reportedly emailed his senior advisor Robert Blair, ``Did we       ever find out about the money for Ukraine and whether we can       hold it back?'' Mr. Blair responded that it would be       possible, but they should ``[e]xpect Congress to become       unhinged'' if the President held back the appropriated       funds.\76\        39. Around this time, despite overwhelming support for the       security assistance from every relevant Executive Branch       agency,\77\ and despite the fact that the funds had been       authorized and appropriated by Congress with strong       bipartisan support,\78\ the President ordered a hold on all       military and other security assistance for Ukraine.\79\        40. By July 3, OMB had blocked the release of $141 million       in State Department funds. By July 12, all military and other       security assistance for Ukraine had been blocked.\80\        41. On July 18, OMB announced to the relevant Executive       Branch agencies during a secure videoconference that       President Trump had ordered a hold on all Ukraine security       assistance.\81\ No explanation for the hold was provided.\82\        42. On July 25--approximately 90 minutes after President       Trump spoke by phone with President Zelensky--OMB's Associate       Director for National Security Programs, Michael  [[Page S302]]       Duffey, a political appointee, instructed DOD officials:       ``Based on guidance I have received and in light of the       Administration's plan to review assistance to Ukraine,       including the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, please       hold off on any additional DoD obligations of these funds,       pending direction from that process.'' \83\ He added: ``Given       the sensitive nature of the request, I appreciate your       keeping that information closely held to those who need to       know to execute the direction.'' \84\        43. In late July, the NSC convened a series of interagency       meetings during which senior Executive Branch officials       discussed the hold on security assistance.\85\ Over the       course of these meetings, a number of facts became clear: (1)       the President personally directed the hold through OMB; \86\       (2) no credible justification was provided for the hold; \87\       (3) with the exception of OMB, all relevant agencies       supported the Ukraine security assistance because, among       other things, it was in the national security interests of       the United States; \88\ and (4) there were serious concerns       about the legality of the hold.\89\        44. Although President Trump later claimed that the hold       was part of an effort to get European allies to share more of       the costs for security assistance for Ukraine, officials       responsible for the security assistance testified they had       not heard that rationale discussed in June, July, or August.       For example, Mark Sandy, OMB's Deputy Associate Director for       National Security Programs, who is responsible for DOD's       portion of the Ukraine security assistance, testified that       the European burden-sharing explanation was first provided to       him in September--following his repeated requests to learn       the reason for the hold.\90\ Deputy Assistant Secretary of       Defense Laura Cooper, whose responsibilities include the       Ukraine security assistance, testified that she had ``no       recollection of the issue of allied burden sharing coming       up'' in the three meetings she attended about the freeze on       security assistance, nor did she recall hearing about a lack       of funding from Ukraine's allies as a reason for the       freeze.\91\ Ms. Cooper further testified that there was no       policy or interagency review process relating to the Ukraine       security assistance that she ``participated in or knew of''       in August 2019.\92\ In addition, while the aid was being       withheld, Ambassador Sondland, the U.S. Ambassador to the EU,       was never asked to reach out to the EU or its member states       to ask them to increase their contributions to Ukraine.\93\        45. Two OMB career officials, including one of its legal       counsel, ultimately resigned, in part, over concerns about       the handling of the hold on security assistance.\94\ A       confidential White House review has reportedly ``turned up       hundreds of documents that reveal extensive efforts to       generate an after-the-fact justification'' for the hold.\95\        46. Throughout August, officials from DOD warned officials       from OMB that, as the hold continued, there was an increasing       risk that the funds for Ukraine would not be timely       obligated, in violation of the Impoundment Control Act of       1974.\96\ On January 16, 2020, the U.S. Government       Accountability Office (GAO) concluded that OMB had, in       fact, violated the Impoundment Control Act when it       withheld from obligation funds appropriated by Congress to       DOD for security assistance to Ukraine. GAO stated that       ``[f]aithful execution of the law does not permit the       President to substitute his own policy priorities for       those that Congress has enacted into law.'' \97\        47. In late August, Secretary of Defense Mike Esper,       Secretary of State Pompeo, and National Security Advisor       Bolton reportedly urged the President to release the aid to       Ukraine, advising the President that the aid was in America's       national security interest.\98\ On August 30, however, an OMB       official advised a Pentagon official by email that there was       a ``clear direction from POTUS to continue to hold.'' \99\        48. Contrary to U.S. national security interests--and over       the objections of his own advisors--President Trump continued       to withhold the funding to Ukraine through August and into       September, without any credible explanation.\100\      D. President Trump Conditioned a White House Meeting on Ukraine      Announcing It Would Launch Politically Motivated Investigations         49. Upon his arrival in Kyiv in June 2019, Ambassador       Taylor sought to schedule the promised White House meeting       for President Zelensky, which was ``an agreed-upon goal'' of       policymakers in Ukraine and the United States.\101\        50. As Ambassador Volker explained, a White House visit by       President Zelensky would constitute ``a tremendous symbol of       support'' for Ukraine and would ``enhance[] [President       Zelensky's] stature.'' \102\        51. Ambassador Taylor learned, however, that President       Trump ``wanted to hear from Zelensky,'' who had to ``make       clear'' to President Trump that he was not ``standing in the       way of investigations.' '' \103\ It soon became clear to       Ambassador Taylor and others that the White House meeting       would not be scheduled until the Ukraine committed to the       investigations of ``Burisma and alleged Ukrainian influence       in the 2016 elections.'' \104\        52. Ambassador Sondland was unequivocal in describing this       conditionality. He testified:        I know that members of this committee frequently frame       these complicated issues in the form of a simple question:       Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified previously with       regard to the requested White House call and the White House       meeting, the answer is yes.\105\        53. According to Ambassador Sondland, the public       announcement of the investigations--and not necessarily the       pursuit of the investigations themselves--was the price       President Trump sought in exchange for a White House meeting       with Ukrainian President Zelensky.\106\        54. Both Ambassadors Volker and Sondland explicitly       communicated this quid pro quo to Ukrainian government       officials. For example, on July 2, in Toronto, Canada,       Ambassador Volker conveyed the message directly to President       Zelensky and referred to the ``Giuliani factor'' in President       Zelensky's engagement with the United States.\107\ Ambassador       Volker told Ambassador Taylor that during the Toronto       conference, he counseled President Zelensky about how he       ``could prepare for the phone call with President Trump''--      specifically, that President Trump ``would like to hear about       the investigations.'' \108\        55. Ambassador Volker confirmed that, in ``a pull-aside''       meeting in Toronto, he ``advise[d] [President Zelensky] that       he should call President Trump personally because he needed       to . . . be able to convey to President Trump that he was       serious about fighting corruption, investigating things that       happened in the past and so forth.'' \109\ Upon hearing about       this discussion, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for       European and Eurasian Affairs George Kent told Ambassador       Volker that ``asking for another country to investigate a       prosecution for political reasons undermines our advocacy of       the rule of law.'' \110\        56. On July 10, at a meeting with Ukrainian officials in       Ambassador Bolton's office at the White House, Ambassador       Sondland was even more explicit about the quid pro quo. He       stated--in front of multiple witnesses, including two top       advisors to President Zelensky and Ambassador Bolton--that he       had an arrangement with Mr. Mulvaney to schedule the White       House visit after Ukraine initiated the ``investigations.''       \111\        57. In a second meeting in the White House Ward Room       shortly thereafter, ``Ambassador Sondland, in front of the       Ukrainians . . . was talking about how he had an agreement       with Chief of Staff Mulvaney for a meeting with the       Ukrainians if they were going to go forward with       investigations.'' \112\ More specifically, Lt. Col. Vindman       testified that Ambassador Sondland said ``[t]hat the       Ukrainians would have to deliver an investigation into the       Bidens.'' \113\        58. During that meeting, Dr. Hill and Lt. Col. Vindman       objected to Ambassador Sondland intertwining what Dr. Hill       later described as a ``domestic political errand'' with       official national security policy toward Ukraine.\114\        59. Following the July 10 meetings, Dr. Hill discussed what       had occurred with Ambassador Bolton, including Ambassador       Sondland's reiteration of the quid pro quo to the Ukrainians       in the Ward Room. Ambassador Bolton told her to ``go and tell       [the NSC Legal Advisor] that I am not part of whatever drug       deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this.'' \115\        60. Both Dr. Hill and Lt. Col. Vindman separately reported       Sondland's description of the quid pro quo during the July 10       meetings to NSC Legal Advisor, John Eisenberg, who said he       would follow up.\116\        61. After the July 10 meetings, Andriy Yermak, a top aide       to President Zelensky who was in the meetings, followed up       with Ambassador Volker by text message: ``Thank you for       meeting and your clear and very logical position . . . I feel       that the key for many things is Rudi [sic] and I [am] ready       to talk with him at any time.'' \117\        62. Over the next two weeks, Ambassadors Sondland and       Volker coordinated with Mr. Giuliani and senior Ukrainian and       American officials to arrange a telephone call between       President Trump and President Zelensky. They also worked to       ensure that, during that phone call, President Zelensky would       convince President Trump of his willingness to undertake the       investigations in order to get the White House meeting       scheduled.\118\        63. On July 19, Ambassador Volker had breakfast with Mr.       Giuliani at the Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C. After the       meeting, Ambassador Volker reported back to Ambassadors       Sondland and Taylor about his conversation with Mr. Giuliani,       stating, ``Most impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help       investigation--and address any specific personnel issues--if       there are any.'' \119\        64. The same day, Ambassador Sondland spoke with President       Zelensky and recommended that the Ukrainian leader tell       President Trump that he ``will leave no stone unturned''       regarding the investigations during the upcoming Presidential       phone call.\120\        65. Following his conversation with President Zelensky,       Ambassador Sondland emailed top Trump Administration       officials, including Secretary Pompeo, Mr. Mulvaney, and       Secretary Perry. Ambassador Sondland stated that President       Zelensky confirmed that he would ``assure'' President Trump       that ``he intends to run a fully transparent investigation       and will turn over every stone.' '' \121\        66. Secretary Perry responded to Ambassador Sondland's       email, ``Mick just confirmed the call being set up for       tomorrow by NSC.'' About an hour later, Mr. Mulvaney replied,       ``I asked NSC to set it up for tomorrow.'' \122\        67. According to Ambassador Sondland, this email--and other       correspondence with  [[Page S303]]       top Trump Administration officials--showed that his efforts       regarding Ukraine were not part of a rogue foreign policy. To       the contrary, Ambassador Sondland testified that ``everyone       was in the loop.'' \123\        68. The Ukrainians also understood the quid pro quo--and       the domestic U.S. political ramifications of the       investigations they were being asked to pursue. On July 20, a       close advisor to President Zelensky warned Ambassador Taylor       that the Ukrainian leader ``did not want to be used as a pawn       in a U.S. reelection campaign.'' \124\ The next day,       Ambassador Taylor warned Ambassador Sondland that President       Zelensky was ``sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously,       not merely as an instrument in Washington domestic,       reelection politics.'' \125\        69. Nevertheless, President Trump, directly and through his       hand-picked representatives, continued to press the Ukrainian       government for the announcement of the investigations,       including during President Trump's July 25 call with       President Zelensky.\126\     E. President Trump Directly Solicited Election Interference From                             President Zelensky         70. In the days leading up to President Trump's July 25       call with President Zelensky, U.S. polling data showed former       Vice President Biden leading in a head-to-head contest       against President Trump.\127\        71. Meanwhile, Ambassadors Sondland and Volker continued to       prepare President Zelensky and his advisors for the call with       President Trump until right before it occurred.        72. On the morning of July 25, Ambassador Sondland spoke       with President Trump in advance of his call with President       Zelensky. Ambassador Sondland then called Ambassador Volker       and left a voicemail.\128\        73. After receiving Ambassador Sondland's message,       Ambassador Volker sent a text message to President Zelensky's       aide, Mr. Yermak, approximately 30 minutes before the call:        Heard from White House--assuming President Z convinces       trump he will investigate/ ``get to the bottom of what       happened'' in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to       Washington. Good luck! \129\        74. In his public testimony, Ambassador Sondland confirmed       that Ambassador Volker's text message to Mr. Yermak       accurately summarized the directive he had received from       President Trump earlier that morning.\130\        75. During the roughly 30-minute July 25 call, President       Zelensky thanked President Trump for the ``great support in       the area of defense'' provided by the United States and       stated that Ukraine would soon be prepared to purchase       additional Javelin anti-tank missiles from the United       States.\131\        76. President Trump immediately responded with his own       request: ``I would like you to do us a favor though,'' which       was ``to find out what happened'' with alleged Ukrainian       interference in the 2016 election and to ``look into'' former       Vice President Biden's role in encouraging the removal of the       former Ukrainian prosecutor general.        77. Referencing Special Counsel Mueller's investigation       into Russian interference in the 2016 election, President       Trump told President Zelensky, ``[T]hey say a lot of it       started with Ukraine,'' and ``[w]hatever you can do, it's       very important that you do it if that's possible.'' \132\        78. President Trump repeatedly pressed the Ukrainian       President to consult with his personal lawyer, Mr. Giuliani,       as well as Attorney General William Barr, about the two       specific investigations.\133\ President Trump stated, ``Rudy       very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable       guy. If you could speak to him that would be great.'' \134\        79. President Zelensky agreed, referencing Mr. Giuliani's       back-channel role, noting that Mr. Yermak ``spoke with Mr.       Giuliani just recently and we are hoping very much that Mr.       Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet       once he comes to Ukraine.'' \135\        80. Later in the call, President Zelensky heeded the       directives he had received from Ambassadors Sondland and       Volker: he thanked President Trump for his invitation to the       White House and then reiterated that, ``[o]n the other       hand,'' he would ``ensure'' that Ukraine pursued       ``the investigation'' that President Trump had requested.       President Zelensky confirmed the investigations should be       done ``openly.'' \136\        81. During the call, President Trump also attacked       Ambassador Yovanovitch. He said, ``The former ambassador from       the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she       was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want       to let you know that.'' He later added, ``Well, she's going       to go through some things.'' President Trump also defended       then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko, who was       widely known to be corrupt.\137\        82. The President did not mention any other issues relating       to Ukraine, including concerns about Ukrainian corruption,       President Zelensky's anti-corruption reforms, or the ongoing       war with Russia. The President only identified two people in       reference to investigations: Vice President Biden and his       son.\138\        83. Listening to the call as it transpired, several White       House staff members became alarmed. Lt. Col. Vindman       immediately reported his concerns to NSC lawyers because, as       he testified, ``[i]t is improper for the President of the       United States to demand a foreign government investigate a       U.S. citizen and a political opponent.'' \139\        84. Jennifer Williams, an advisor to Vice President Pence,       testified that the call struck her as ``unusual and       inappropriate'' and that ``the references to specific       individuals and investigations, such as former Vice President       Biden and his son, struck me as political in nature.'' \140\       She believed President Trump's solicitation of an       investigation was ``inappropriate'' because it ``appeared to       be a domestic political matter.'' \141\        85. Timothy Morrison, Dr. Hill's successor as the NSC's       Senior Director for Europe and Russia and Lt. Col. Vindman's       supervisor, said that ``the call was not the full-throated       endorsement of the Ukraine reform agenda that I was hoping to       hear.'' \142\ He too reported the call to NSC lawyers,       worrying that the call would be ``damaging'' if leaked       publicly.\143\        86. In response, Mr. Eisenberg and his deputy, Michael       Ellis, tightly restricted access to the call summary, which       was placed on a highly classified NSC server even though it       did not contain any highly classified information.\144\        87. On July 26, the day after the call, Ambassador Sondland       had lunch with State Department aides in Kyiv, including       David Holmes, the Counselor for Political Affairs at the U.S.       Embassy in Kyiv. During the lunch, Ambassador Sondland called       President Trump directly from his cellphone. President Trump       asked Ambassador Sondland whether President Zelensky was       ``going to do the investigation.'' Ambassador Sondland stated       that President Zelensky was ``going to do it'' and would ``do       anything you ask him to.'' \145\        88. After the call, it was clear to Ambassador Sondland       that ``a public statement from President Zelensky''       committing to the investigations was a ``prerequisite'' for a       White House meeting.\146\ He told Mr. Holmes that President       Trump ``did not give a [expletive] about Ukraine.'' Rather,       the President cared only about ``big stuff'' that benefited       him personally, like ``the Biden investigation that Mr.       Giuliani was pushing,'' and that President Trump had directly       solicited during the July 25 call.\147\   F. President Trump Conditioned the Release of Security Assistance for   Ukraine, and Continued To Leverage a White House Meeting, To Pressure           Ukraine To Launch Politically Motivated Investigations         89. As discussed further below, following the July 25 call,       President Trump's representatives, including Ambassadors       Sondland and Volker, in coordination with Mr. Giuliani,       pressed the Ukrainians to issue a public statement announcing       the investigations. At the same time, officials in both the       United States and Ukraine became increasingly concerned about       President Trump's continuing hold on security       assistance.\148\        90. The Ukrainian government was aware of the hold by at       least late July, around the time of President Trump's July 25       call with President Zelensky. On the day of the call itself,       DOD officials learned that diplomats at the Ukrainian Embassy       in Washington, D.C., had made multiple overtures to DOD and       the State Department ``asking about security assistance.''       \149\        91. Around this time, two different officials at the       Ukrainian Embassy approached Ambassador Volker's special       advisor to ask her about the hold.\150\        92. By mid-August, before the hold was public, Lt. Col.       Vindman also received inquiries from the Ukrainian Embassy.       Lt. Col. Vindman testified that during this timeframe, ``it       was no secret, at least within government and official       channels, that security assistance was on hold.'' \151\        93. The former Ukrainian deputy foreign minister, Olena       Zerkal, has acknowledged that she became aware of the hold on       security assistance no later than July 30 based on a       diplomatic cable--transmitted the previous week--from       Ukrainian officials in Washington, D.C.\152\ She said that       President Zelensky's office had received a copy of the cable       ``simultaneously.'' \153\ Ms. Zerkal further stated that       President Zelensky's top advisor, Andriy Yermak, told her       ``to keep silent, to not comment without permission'' about       the hold or about when the Ukrainian government became aware       of it.\154\        94. In early August, Ambassadors Sondland and Volker, in       coordination with Mr. Giuliani, endeavored to pressure       President Zelensky to make a public statement announcing the       investigations. On August 10--in a text message that showed       the Ukrainians' understanding of the quid pro quo--President       Zelensky's advisor, Mr. Yermak, told Ambassador Volker that,       once a date was set for the White House meeting, he would       ``call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and       outlining vision for the reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship,       including among other things Burisma and election meddling in       investigations[.]'' \155\        95. On August 11, Ambassador Sondland emailed two State       Department officials, one of whom acted as a direct line to       Secretary Pompeo, to inform them about the agreement for       President Zelensky to issue a statement that would include an       announcement of the two investigations. Ambassador Sondland       stated that he expected a draft of the statement to be       ``delivered for our review in a day or two[,]'' and that he       hoped the statement would ``make the boss [i.e., President       Trump] happy enough to authorize an invitation'' for a White       House meeting.\156\        96. On August 12, Mr. Yermak texted Ambassador Volker an       initial draft of the statement. The draft referred to ``the       problem of  [[Page S304]]       interference in the political processes of the United       States,'' but it did not explicitly mention the two       investigations that President Trump had requested in the July       25 call.\157\        97. The next day, Ambassadors Volker and Sondland discussed       the draft statement with Mr. Giuliani, who told them, ``If       [the statement] doesn't say Burisma and 2016, it's not       credible[.]'' \158\ As Ambassador Sondland would later       testify, ``Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the       President of the United States, and we knew these       investigations were important to the President.'' \159\        98. Ambassadors Volker and Sondland relayed this message to       Mr. Yermak and sent him a revised statement that included       explicit references to ``Burisma and the 2016 U.S.       elections.'' \160\        99. In light of President Zelensky's anti-corruption       agenda, Ukrainian officials resisted issuing the statement in       August and, as a result, there was no movement toward       scheduling the White House meeting.\161\        100. Meanwhile, there was growing concern about President       Trump's continued hold on the security assistance for       Ukraine. The hold remained in place through August, against       the unanimous judgment of American national security       officials charged with overseeing U.S.-Ukraine policy. For       example, during a high-level interagency meeting in late       July, officials unanimously advocated for releasing the       hold--with the sole exception of OMB, which was acting under       ``guidance from the President and from Acting Chief of Staff       Mulvaney to freeze the assistance.'' \162\ But even officials       within OMB had internally recommended that the hold be       removed because ``assistance to Ukraine is consistent with       [U.S.] national security strategy,'' provides the ``benefit .       . . of opposing Russian aggression,'' and is backed by       ``bipartisan support.'' \163\        101. Without an explanation for the hold, and with       President Trump already conditioning a White House visit on       the announcement of the investigations, it became       increasingly apparent to multiple witnesses that the security       assistance was being withheld in order to pressure Ukraine to       announce the investigations. As Ambassador Sondland       testified, President Trump's effort to condition release of       the security assistance on an announcement of the       investigations was as clear as ``two plus two equals four.''       \164\        102. On August 22, Ambassador Sondland emailed Secretary       Pompeo in an effort to ``break the logjam'' on the security       assistance and the White House meeting. He proposed that       President Trump should arrange to speak to President Zelensky       during an upcoming trip to Warsaw, during which President       Zelensky could ``look [President Trump] in the eye and tell       him'' he was prepared ``to move forward publicly . . . on       those issues of importance to Potus and to the U.S.''--i.e.,       the announcement of the two investigations.\165\        103. On August 28, news of the hold was publicly reported       by Politico.\166\        104. As soon as the hold became public, Ukrainian officials       expressed significant concern to U.S. officials.\167\ They       were deeply worried not only about the practical impact that       the hold would have on efforts to fight Russian aggression,       but also about the symbolic message the now-publicized lack       of support from the Trump Administration sent to the Russian       government, which would almost certainly seek to exploit any       real or perceived crack in U.S. resolve toward Ukraine. Mr.       Yermak and other Ukrainian officials told Ambassador Taylor       that they were ``desperate'' and would be willing to travel       to Washington to raise with U.S. officials the importance of       the assistance.\168\ The recently appointed Ukrainian       prosecutor general later remarked, ``It's critically       important for the west not to pull us into some conflicts       between their ruling elites[.]'' \169\        105. On September 1--within days of President Trump       rejecting the request from Secretaries Pompeo and Esper and       Ambassador Bolton to release the hold \170\--Vice President       Pence met with President Zelensky in Warsaw, Poland after       President Trump cancelled his trip.\171\        106. In advance of this meeting, Ambassador Sondland told       Vice President Pence that he ``had concerns that the delay in       aid had become tied to the issue of investigations.'' \172\       Sondland testified that Vice President Pence ``nodded like,       you know, he heard what I said, and that was pretty much       it.'' \173\        107. During the meeting that followed, which Ambassador       Sondland also attended, ``the very first question'' that       President Zelensky asked Vice President Pence related to the       status of U.S. security assistance.\174\ President Zelensky       emphasized that ``the symbolic value of U.S. support in terms       of security assistance . . . was just as valuable to the       Ukrainians as the actual dollars.'' \175\ He also voiced       concern that ``any hold or appearance of reconsideration of       such assistance might embolden Russia to think that the       United States was no longer committed to Ukraine.'' \176\        108. Vice President Pence told President Zelensky that he       would speak with President Trump that evening. Although Vice       President Pence did speak with President Trump, the President       still did not lift the hold.\177\        109. Following the meeting between Vice President Pence and       President Zelensky, Ambassador Sondland pulled aside       President Zelensky's advisor, Mr. Yermak, to explain that       ``the resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until       Ukraine took some kind of action on [issuing a] public       statement'' about the investigations.\178\        110. Immediately following that conversation, Ambassador       Sondland walked over to Mr. Morrison, who had been standing       across the room observing their interactions. Ambassador       Sondland told Mr. Morrison that ``what he had communicated       [to Mr. Yermak] was that . . . what could help [Ukraine] move       the aid was if the prosecutor general would go to the mike       [sic] and announce that he was opening'' the       investigations.\179\        111. Later that day, Mr. Morrison reported this       conversation to Ambassador Bolton, who advised him to ``stay       out of it'' and to brief the NSC's lawyers. Mr. Morrison       subsequently reported the conversation to Mr. Eisenberg.\180\        112. Mr. Morrison also informed Ambassador Taylor about his       conversation with Ambassador Sondland. Ambassador Taylor was       ``alarmed by what Mr. Morrison told [him] about the Sondland-      Yermak conversation.'' \181\ He followed up by texting       Ambassador Sondland, ``Are we now saying that security       assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on       investigations?'' Ambassador Sondland responded, ``Call me.''       \182\        113. Ambassadors Sondland and Taylor then spoke by       telephone. Ambassador Sondland again relayed what he told Mr.       Yermak and explained that he had made a ``mistake'' in       telling Ukrainian officials that only the White House meeting       was conditioned on a public announcement of the       investigations. He clarified that ``everything''--the White       House meeting and security assistance for Ukraine--was       conditioned on the announcement of the investigations.\183\       Ambassador Sondland explained to Ambassador Taylor that       ``President Trump wanted President Zelensky in a public box,       by making a public statement about ordering such       investigations.'' \184\        114. On September 7, President Trump and Ambassador       Sondland spoke by telephone.\185\ As Ambassador Sondland       relayed later that day during a call with Mr. Morrison,       President Trump told him ``that there was no quid pro quo,       but President Zelensky must announce the opening of the       investigations and he should want to do it.'' \186\        115. Mr. Morrison conveyed the substance of the September 7       call between President Trump and Ambassador Sondland to       Ambassador Taylor. Mr. Morrison said that the call had given       him ``a sinking feeling'' because he feared the security       assistance would not be released before September 30, the end       of the fiscal year, and because he ``did not think it was a       good idea for the Ukrainian President to . . . involve       himself in our politics.'' \187\ At Ambassador Bolton's       direction, Mr. Morrison reported Ambassador Sondland's       description of the President's statements to the NSC       lawyers.\188\        116. The next day, September 8, Ambassador Sondland       confirmed in a phone call with Ambassador Taylor that he had       spoken to President Trump and that ``President Trump was       adamant that President Zelensky himself had to'' announce the       investigations publicly.\189\        117. Ambassador Sondland also told Ambassador Taylor that       he had passed President Trump's message directly to President       Zelensky and Mr. Yermak and had told them that ``although       this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelensky did not       clear things up in public, we would be at a stalemate''--      meaning ``Ukraine would not receive the much-needed military       assistance.'' \190\        118. Early the next morning, on September 9, Ambassador       Taylor texted Ambassadors Sondland and Volker: ``As I said on       the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance       for help with a political campaign.'' \191\        119. The Ukrainians succumbed to the pressure. In early       September, President Zelensky agreed to do a televised       interview, during which he would publicly announce the       investigations. The Ukrainians made arrangements for the       interview to occur on CNN later in September.\192\        120. The White House subsequently confirmed that the       release of the security assistance had been conditioned on       Ukraine's announcement of the investigations. During a White       House press conference on October 17, Acting Chief of Staff       Mulvaney acknowledged that he had discussed security       assistance with the President and that the President's       decision to withhold it was directly tied to his desire that       Ukraine investigate alleged Ukrainian interference in the       2016 U.S. election.\193\        121. After a reporter attempted to clarify this explicit       acknowledgement of a ``quid pro quo,'' Mr. Mulvaney replied,       ``We do that all the time with foreign policy.'' He added,       ``I have news for everybody: get over it. There is going to       be political influence in foreign policy.'' \194\        122. Multiple foreign policy and national security       officials testified that the pursuit of investigations into       the Bidens and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016       election was not part of official U.S. policy.\195\ Instead,       as Dr. Hill described, these investigations were part of a       ``domestic political errand'' of President Trump.\196\ Mr.       Kent further explained that urging Ukraine to engage in       ``selective politically associated investigations or       prosecutions'' undermines our longstanding efforts to promote       the rule of law abroad.\197\        123. Ambassador Volker, in response to an inquiry from       President Zelensky's advisor, Mr. Yermak, confirmed that the       U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) did not make an official       request for Ukraine's assistance in these       investigations.\198\  [[Page S305]]             124. Within hours after the White House publicly released a       record of the July 25 call, DOJ itself confirmed in a       statement that no such request was ever made:        The President has not spoken with the Attorney General       about having Ukraine investigate anything related to former       Vice President Biden or his son. The President has not asked       the Attorney General to contact Ukraine--on this or any other       matter. The Attorney General has not communicated with       Ukraine--on this or any other subject.\199\    G. President Trump Was Forced to Lift the Hold but Has Continued to           Solicit Foreign Interference in the Upcoming Election         125. As noted above, by early September 2019, President       Zelensky had signaled his willingness to announce the two       investigations to secure a White House meeting and the       security assistance. He was scheduled to make the       announcement during a CNN interview later in September, but       other events intervened.\200\        126. On September 9, the House Permanent Select Committee       on Intelligence, the Committee on Oversight and Reform, and       the Committee on Foreign Affairs announced a joint       investigation into the scheme by President Trump ``to       improperly pressure the Ukrainian government to assist the       President's bid for reelection.'' \201\ The same day, the       Committees sent document production and preservation requests       to the White House and the State Department.\202\        127. NSC staff members believed that the Congressional       investigation ``might have the effect of releasing the hold''       on Ukraine military assistance, because it would have been       ``potentially politically challenging'' to ``justify that       hold.'' \203\        128. Later that day, the Inspector General of the       Intelligence Community (ICIG) wrote to the Chairman and       Ranking Member of the Intelligence Committee notifying them       that a whistleblower had filed a complaint on August 12 that       the ICIG had determined to be both an ``urgent concern'' and       ``credible.'' The ICIG did not disclose the contents of the       complaint.\204\        129. The ICIG further stated that the Acting Director of       National Intelligence (DNI) had taken the unprecedented step       of withholding the whistleblower complaint from       Congress.\205\ It was later revealed that the Acting DNI had       done so as a result of communications with the White House       and the Department of Justice.\206\ The next day, September       10, Chairman Schiff wrote to Acting DNI Joseph Maguire to       express his concern about the Acting DNI's ``unprecedented       departure from past practice'' in withholding the       whistleblower complaint and observed that the ``failure to       transmit to the Committee an urgent and credible       whistleblower complaint, as required by law, raises the       prospect that an urgent matter of a serious nature is being       purposefully concealed from the Committee.'' \207\        130. The White House was aware of the contents of the       whistleblower complaint since at least August 26, when the       Acting DNI informed the White House Counsel's Office of the       complaint.\208\ White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and Mr.       Eisenberg reportedly briefed President Trump on the       whistleblower complaint in late August and discussed whether       they had to give it to Congress.\209\        131. On September 11--two days after the ICIG notified       Congress of the whistleblower complaint and the three House       Committees announced their investigation--President Trump       lifted the hold on security assistance. As with the       implementation of the hold, no credible reason was provided       for lifting the hold.\210\ At the time of the release, there       had been no discernible changes in international assistance       commitments for Ukraine or Ukrainian anti-corruption       reforms.\211\        132. Because of the hold the President placed on security       assistance for Ukraine, DOD was unable to spend approximately       $35 million--or 14 percent--of the funds appropriated by       Congress for fiscal year 2019.\212\        133. Congress was forced to pass a new law to extend the       funding in order to ensure the full amount could be used by       Ukraine to defend itself.\213\ Still, by early December 2019,       Ukraine had not received approximately $20 million of the       military assistance.\214\        134. Although the hold was lifted, the White House still       had not announced a date for President Zelensky's meeting       with President Trump, and there were indications that       President Zelensky's interview with CNN would still       occur.\215\        135. On September 18, a week before President Trump was       scheduled to meet with President Zelensky on the sidelines of       the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Vice President Pence       had a telephone call with President Zelensky. During the       call, Vice President Pence ``ask[ed] a bit more about . . .       how Zelensky's efforts were going.'' \216\ Additional details       about this call were provided to the House by Vice President       Pence's advisor, Jennifer Williams, but were classified by       the Office of the Vice President.\217\ Despite repeated       requests, the Vice President has refused to declassify Ms.       Williams' supplemental testimony.        136. On September 18 or 19, at the urging of Ambassador       Taylor,\218\ President Zelensky cancelled the CNN       interview.\219\        137. To date, almost nine months after the initial       invitation was extended by President Trump on April 21, a       White House meeting for President Zelensky has not       occurred.\220\ Since the initial invitation, President Trump       has met with more than a dozen world leaders at the       White House, including a meeting in the Oval Office with       the Foreign Minister of Russia on December 10.\221\        138. Since lifting the hold, and even after the House       impeachment inquiry was announced on September 24, President       Trump has continued to press Ukraine to investigate Vice       President Biden and alleged 2016 election interference by       Ukraine.\222\        139. On September 24, in remarks at the opening session of       the U.N. General Assembly, President Trump stated: ``What Joe       Biden did for his son, that's something they [Ukraine] should       be looking at.'' \223\        140. On September 25, in a joint public press availability       with President Zelensky, President Trump stated that ``I want       him to do whatever he can'' in reference to the investigation       of the Bidens.\224\ The same day, President Trump denied that       his pursuit of the investigation involved a quid pro       quo.\225\        141. On September 30, during remarks at the swearing-in of       the new Labor Secretary, President Trump stated: ``Now, the       new President of Ukraine ran on the basis of no corruption. .       . . But there was a lot of corruption having to do with the       2016 election against us. And we want to get to the bottom of       it, and it's very important that we do.'' \226\        142. On October 3, when asked by a reporter what he had       hoped President Zelensky would do following their July 25       call, President Trump responded: ``Well, I would think that,       if they were honest about it, they'd start a major       investigation into the Bidens. It's a very simple answer.''       \227\ The President also suggested that ``China should start       an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in       China is just about as bad as what happened with--with       Ukraine.\228\        143. On October 4, President Trump equated his interest in       ``looking for corruption'' to the investigation of two       particular subjects: the Bidens and alleged Ukrainian       interference in the 2016 election. He told reporters:        What I want to do--and I think I have an obligation to do       it, probably a duty to do it: corruption--we are looking for       corruption. When you look at what Biden and his son did, and       when you look at other people--what they've done. And I       believe there was tremendous corruption with Biden, but I       think there was beyond--I mean, beyond corruption--having to       do with the 2016 campaign, and what these lowlifes did to so       many people, to hurt so many people in the Trump campaign--      which was successful, despite all of the fighting us. I mean,       despite all of the unfairness.\229\        When asked by a reporter, ``Is someone advising you that it       is okay to solicit the help of other governments to       investigate a potential political opponent?,'' Trump replied       in part, ``Here's what's okay: If we feel there's corruption,       like I feel there was in the 2016 campaign--there was       tremendous corruption against me--if we feel there's       corruption, we have a right to go to a foreign country.''       \230\        144. As the House's impeachment inquiry unfolded, Mr.       Giuliani, on behalf of the President, also continued to urge       Ukraine to pursue the investigations and dig up dirt on       former Vice President Biden. Mr. Giuliani's own statements       about these efforts further confirm that he has been working       in furtherance of the President's personal and political       interests.\231\        145. During the first week of December, Mr. Giuliani       traveled to Kyiv and Budapest to meet with both current and       former Ukrainian government officials,\232\ including a       current Ukrainian member of Parliament who attended a KGB       school in Moscow and has led calls to investigate Burisma and       the Bidens.\233\ Mr. Giuliani also met with the corrupt       former prosecutor generals, Viktor Shokin and Yuriy Lutsenko,       who had promoted the false allegations underlying the       investigations President Trump wanted.\234\ Mr. Giuliani told       the New York Times that in meeting with Ukrainian officials       he was acting on behalf of his client, President Trump:       ``[L]ike a good lawyer, I am gathering evidence to defend my       client against the false charges being leveled against him.''       \235\        146. During his trip to Ukraine, on December 5, Mr.       Giuliani tweeted: ``The conversation about corruption in       Ukraine was based on compelling evidence of criminal conduct       by then VP Biden, in 2016, that has not been resolved and       until it is will be a major obstacle to the U.S. assisting       Ukraine with its anti-corruption reforms.'' \236\ Not only       was Mr. Giuliani perpetuating the false allegations against       Vice President Biden, but he was reiterating the threat that       President Trump had used to pressure President Zelensky to       announce the investigations: that U.S. assistance to Ukraine       could be in jeopardy until Ukraine investigated Vice       President Biden.        147. Mr. Giuliani told the Wall Street Journal that when he       returned to New York on December 7, President Trump called       him as his plane was still taxiing down the runway. `` `What       did you get?' he said Mr. Trump asked. `More than you can       imagine,' Mr. Giuliani replied.'' \237\        148. Later that day, President Trump told reporters that he       was aware of Mr. Giuliani's efforts in Ukraine and believed       that Mr. Giuliani wanted to report the information he'd       gathered to the Attorney General and Congress.\238\        149. On December 17, Mr. Giuliani confirmed that President       Trump has been ``very supportive'' of his continuing efforts       to dig up dirt on Vice President Biden in Ukraine and that       they are ``on the same page.'' \239\  [[Page S306]]             150. Such ongoing efforts by President Trump, including       through his personal attorney, to solicit an investigation of       his political opponent have undermined U.S. credibility. On       September 14, Ambassador Volker advised Mr. Yermak against       the Zelensky Administration conducting an investigation into       President Zelensky's own former political rival, former       Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. When Ambassador Volker       raised concerns about such an investigation, Mr. Yermak       retorted, ``What, you mean like asking us to investigate       Clinton and Biden?'' \240\ Ambassador Volker offered no       response.\241\        151. Mr. Holmes, a career diplomat, highlighted this       hypocrisy: ``While we had advised our Ukrainian counterparts       to voice a commitment to following the rule of law and       generally investigating credible corruption allegations,''       U.S. officials were making ``a demand that President Zelensky       personally commit on a cable news channel to a specific       investigation of President Trump's political rival.'' \242\       H. President Trump's Conduct Was Consistent with His Previous           Invitations of Foreign Interference in U.S. Elections         152. President Trump's efforts to solicit Ukraine's       interference in the 2020 U.S. Presidential election to help       his own reelection campaign were consistent with his prior       solicitation and encouragement of Russia's interference in       the 2016 election, when the Trump Campaign ``expected it       would benefit electorally from information stolen and       released through Russian efforts.'' \243\        153. As a Presidential candidate, Mr. Trump repeatedly       sought to benefit from Russia's actions to help his campaign.       For example, during a public rally on July 27, 2016, then-      candidate Trump declared: ``Russia, if you're listening, I       hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing''       from opposing candidate Hillary Clinton's personal       server.\244\ Within hours, Russian hackers targeted Clinton's       personal office for the first time.\245\        154. Days earlier, WikiLeaks had begun releasing emails and       documents that were stolen by Russian military intelligence       services in order to damage the Clinton campaign.\246\       WikiLeaks continued releasing stolen documents through       October 2016.\247\ Then-candidate Trump repeatedly applauded       and sought to capitalize on WikiLeaks's releases of these       stolen documents, even after Russia's involvement was heavily       reported by the press.\248\ Members of the Trump Campaign       also planned messaging and communications strategies around       releases by WikiLeaks.\249\ In the last month of the       campaign, then-candidate Trump publicly referred to the       emails hacked by Russia and disseminated by WikiLeaks over       150 times.\250\        155. Multiple members of the Trump Campaign used additional       channels to seek Russia's assistance in obtaining damaging       information about Clinton. For example, senior       representatives of the Trump Campaign--including the       Campaign's chairman and the President's son--met with a       Russian attorney in June 2016 who had offered to provide       damaging information about Clinton from the Russian       government.\251\ A foreign policy advisor to the Trump       Campaign also met repeatedly with people connected to the       Russian government and their associates, one of whom claimed       to have ``dirt'' on Clinton in the form of ``thousands of       emails.'' \252\        156. Even after Special Counsel Mueller released his       report, President Trump confirmed his willingness to benefit       from foreign election interference. When asked during a       televised interview in June 2019 whether he would accept       damaging information from a foreign government about a       political opponent, the President responded, ``I think I'd       take it.'' \253\ President Trump declared that he sees       ``nothing wrong with listening'' to a foreign power that       offers information detrimental to a political adversary.\254\       Asked whether such an offer of information should be reported       to law enforcement, President Trump retorted: ``Give me a       break, life doesn't work that way.'' \255\ Just weeks later,       President Trump froze security assistance to Ukraine as his       agents were pushing that country to pursue investigations       that would help the President's reelection campaign.\256\        157. In addition, President Trump's request for the       investigations on the July 25 call with President Zelensky       took place one day after former Special Counsel Mueller       testified before the House Judiciary Committee and the House       Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence about the findings       of his investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016       Presidential election and President Trump's efforts to       undermine that investigation.\257\ During his call with       President Zelensky, President Trump derided former Special       Counsel Mueller's ``poor performance'' in his July 24       testimony and speculated that ``that whole nonsense . . .       started with Ukraine.'' \258\      II. President Trump's Obstruction of Congress        158. President Trump ordered categorical obstruction of the       impeachment inquiry undertaken by the House under Article I       of the Constitution, which vests the House with the ``sole       Power of Impeachment.'' \259\                A. The House Launched an Impeachment Inquiry         159. During the 116th Congress, a number of Committees of       the House have undertaken investigations into allegations of       misconduct by President Trump and his Administration,       including to determine whether to recommend articles of       impeachment.\260\        160. As discussed above, on September 9, the Intelligence       Committee and the Committees on Oversight and Reform and       Foreign Affairs announced they would conduct a joint       investigation into the President's scheme to pressure Ukraine       to announce the politically motivated investigations.\261\        161. Given the gravity of the allegations that President       Trump was soliciting foreign interference in the upcoming       2020 election, Speaker Nancy P. Pelosi announced on September       24 that the House was ``moving forward with an official       impeachment inquiry.'' \262\ Speaker Pelosi directed the       Committees to ``proceed with their investigations under that       umbrella of [an] impeachment inquiry.'' \263\        162. On October 31, the House enacted a resolution       confirming the Committees' authority to conduct the       impeachment inquiry and adopting procedures governing the       inquiry.\264\        163. The procedures adopted by the House afforded       procedural privileges to the President that were equivalent       to, or in some instances exceeded, those afforded during       prior impeachment inquiries.\265\ Transcripts of all witness       interviews and depositions were released to the public, and       President Trump was offered--but refused--multiple       opportunities to have his counsel participate in proceedings       before the Judiciary Committee, including by cross-examining       witnesses and presenting evidence.\266\     B. President Trump Ordered Categorical Obstruction of the House's                            Impeachment Inquiry         164. Even before the House launched its impeachment inquiry       into President Trump's misconduct concerning Ukraine, he       rejected Congress's Article I investigative and oversight       authority, proclaiming, ``[W]e're fighting all the       subpoenas,'' \267\ and ``I have an Article II, where I have       the right to do whatever I want as president.'' \268\        165. In response to the House impeachment inquiry regarding       Ukraine, the Executive Branch categorically refused to       provide any requested documents or information at President       Trump's direction.        166. On September 9, 2019, three House Committees sent a       letter to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone requesting six       categories of documents relevant to the Ukraine investigation       by September 16.\269\ When the White House did not respond,       the Committees sent a follow-up letter on September 24.\270\        167. Instead of responding directly to the Committees, the       President publicly declared the impeachment inquiry ``a       disgrace,'' and stated that ``it shouldn't be allowed'' and       that ``[t]here should be a way of stopping it.'' \271\        168. When the White House still did not respond to the       Committees' request, the Committees issued a subpoena       compelling the White House to turn over documents.\272\        169. The President's response to the House's inquiry--sent       by Mr. Cipollone on October 8 sought to accomplish the       President's goal of ``stopping'' the House's investigation.       Mr. Cipollone wrote ``on behalf of President Donald J.       Trump'' to notify Congress that ``President Trump cannot       permit his Administration to participate in this partisan       inquiry under these circumstances.'' \273\        170. Despite the Constitution's placement of the ``sole       Power'' of impeachment in the House, Mr. Cipollone's October       8 letter opined that the House's inquiry was       ``constitutionally invalid,'' ``lack[ed] . . . any basis,''       ``lack[ed] the necessary authorization for a valid       impeachment,'' and was merely ``labeled . . . as an       `impeachment inquiry.' '' \274\        171. The letter's rhetoric aligned with the President's       public campaign against the impeachment inquiry, which he has       branded ``a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the       People,'' \275\ an ``unconstitutional abuse of power,'' \276\       and an ``open war on American Democracy.'' \277\        172. Although President Trump has categorically sought to       obstruct the House's impeachment inquiry, he has never       formally asserted a claim of executive privilege as to any       document or testimony. Mr. Cipollone's October 8 letter       refers to ``long-established Executive Branch confidentiality       interests and privileges'' but the President did not actually       assert executive privilege.\278\ Similarly, a Department of       Justice Office of Legal Counsel November 1, 2019 opinion only       recognized that information responsive to the subpoenas was       ``potentially protected by executive privilege.'' \279\        173. In addition, the President and his agents have spoken       at length about these events to the press and on social       media. Since the impeachment inquiry was announced on       September 24, the President has made numerous public       statements about his communications with President Zelensky       and his decision-making relating to the hold on security       assistance.\280\        174. The President's agents have done the same. For       example, on October 16, Secretary Perry gave an interview to       the Wall Street Journal. During the interview, Secretary       Perry stated that after the May 23 meeting at which President       Trump refused to schedule a White House meeting with       President Zelensky, Secretary Perry ``sought out Rudy       Giuliani this spring at President Trump's direction to       address Mr. Trump's concerns about alleged Ukrainian       corruption.'' \281\ During a phone call with Secretary Perry,       Mr. Giuliani said, ``Look, the president is really concerned       that there are people in Ukraine  [[Page S307]]       that tried to beat him during this presidential election. . .       . He thinks they're corrupt and . . . that there are still       people over there engaged that are absolutely corrupt.''       \282\        175. On October 17, Acting Chief of Staff Mulvaney       acknowledged during a White House press conference that he       discussed security assistance with the President and that the       President's decision to withhold it was directly tied to his       desire that Ukraine investigate alleged Ukrainian       interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\283\        176. On December 3, 2019, the Intelligence Committee       transmitted a detailed nearly 300-page report documenting its       findings about this scheme and about the related       investigation into it, to the Judiciary Committee.\284\ The       Judiciary Committee held public hearings evaluating the       constitutional standard for impeachment and the evidence       against President Trump--in which the President's counsel was       invited to participate, but declined--and then reported two       Articles of Impeachment to the House.\285\        177. The President maintained his obstructionist position       throughout this process, declaring the House's investigation       ``illegitimate'' in a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi on       December 17, 2019.\286\ President Trump further attempted to       undermine the House's inquiry by dismissing impeachment as       ``illegal, invalid, and unconstitutional'' \287\ and by       intimidating and threatening an anonymous Intelligence       Community whistleblower as well as the patriotic public       servants who honored their subpoenas and testified before the       House.\288\        178. On December 18, 2019, the House voted to impeach       President Trump and adopted two Articles of Impeachment.\289\  C. Following President Trump's Directive, the Executive Branch Refused               to Produce Requested and Subpoenaed Documents         179. Adhering to President Trump's directive, every       Executive Branch agency that received an impeachment inquiry       request or subpoena defied it.\290\        180. House Committees issued document requests or subpoenas       to the White House, the Office of the Vice President, OMB,       the Department of State, DOD, and the Department of       Energy.\291\        181. In its response, the Office of the Vice President       echoed Mr. Cipollone's assertions that the impeachment       inquiry was procedurally invalid,\292\ while agencies such as       OMB and DOD expressly cited the President's directive.\293\        182. The Executive Branch has refused to produce any       documents in response to the Committees' valid, legally       binding subpoenas, even though witness testimony has revealed       that highly relevant records exist.\294\        183. Indeed, by virtue of President Trump's order, not a       single document has been produced by the White House, the       Office of the Vice President, OMB, the Department of State,       DOD, or the Department of Energy in response to 71 specific,       individualized requests or demands for records in their       possession, custody, or control. These agencies and offices       also blocked many current and former officials from producing       records to the Committees.\295\        184. Certain witnesses, however, defied the President's       order and identified the substance of key documents. For       example, Lt. Col. Vindman described a ``Presidential Decision       Memo'' he prepared in August that conveyed the ``consensus       views'' among foreign policy and national security officials       that the hold on aid to Ukraine should be released.\296\       Other witnesses identified additional documents that the       President and various agencies were withholding from Congress       that were directly relevant to the impeachment inquiry.\297\        185. Some responsive documents have been released by the       State Department, DOD, and OMB pursuant to judicial orders       issued in response to lawsuits filed under the Freedom of       Information Act (FOIA).\298\ Although limited in scope and       heavily redacted, these FOIA productions confirm that the       Trump Administration is withholding highly pertinent       documents from Congress without any valid legal basis.\299\   D. President Trump Ordered Top Aides Not to Testify, Even Pursuant to                                  Subpoena         186. President Trump directed government witnesses to       violate their legal obligations and defy House subpoenas--      regardless of their offices or positions. In some instances,       the President personally directed that senior aides defy       subpoenas on the ground that they are ``absolutely immune''       from compelled testimony.\300\ Other officials refused to       appear ``as directed by'' Mr. Cipollone's October 8       letter.\301\ Still others refused to appear because--      consistent with the House Deposition Rules drafted by the       then-majority Republicans--agency counsel was not permitted       in the depositions.\302\        187. This Administration-wide effort to prevent witnesses       from providing testimony was coordinated and comprehensive.       In total, twelve current or former Administration officials       refused to testify as part of the House's impeachment inquiry       into the Ukrainian matter, nine of whom did so in defiance of       duly authorized subpoenas.\303\ House Committees advised such       witnesses that their refusal to testify may be used as an       adverse inference against the President.\304\ Nonetheless--      despite being instructed by senior political appointees not       to cooperate with the House's impeachment inquiry, in       directives that frequently cited or enclosed copies of Mr.       Cipollone's October 8 letter \305\--many current and       former officials complied with their legal obligations to       appear for testimony.        188. House Committees conducted depositions or transcribed       interviews of seventeen witnesses.\306\ All members of the       Committees--as well as staff from the Majority and the       Minority--were permitted to attend. The Majority and Minority       were allotted an equal amount of time to question       witnesses.\307\        189. In late November 2019, twelve of these witnesses       testified in public hearings convened by the Intelligence       Committee, including three witnesses called by the       Minority.\308\        190. Unable to silence certain witnesses, President Trump       resorted to intimidation tactics to penalize them.\309\ He       also levied sustained attacks on the anonymous       whistleblower.\310\   E. President Trump's Conduct Was Consistent with His Previous Efforts   to Obstruct Investigations into Foreign Interference in U.S. Elections         191. President Trump's obstruction of the House's       impeachment inquiry was consistent with his previous efforts       to undermine Special Counsel Mueller's investigation of       Russia's interference in the 2016 election and of the       President's own misconduct.        192. President Trump repeatedly used his powers of office       to undermine and derail the Mueller investigation,       particularly after learning that he was personally under       investigation for obstruction of justice.\311\ Among other       things, President Trump ordered White House Counsel Don       McGahn to fire Special Counsel Mueller; \312\ instructed Mr.       McGahn to create a record and issue statements falsely       denying this event; \313\ sought to curtail Special Counsel       Mueller's investigation in a manner exempting his own prior       conduct; \314\ and tampered with at least two key       witnesses.\315\ President Trump has since instructed McGahn       to defy a House Committee's subpoena for testimony, and his       DOJ has erroneously argued that the courts can play no role       in enforcing Congressional subpoenas.\316\        193. Special Counsel Mueller's investigation--like the       House's impeachment inquiry--sought to uncover whether       President Trump coordinated with a foreign government in       order to obtain an improper advantage during a Presidential       election.\317\ And the Mueller investigation--like the       House's impeachment inquiry--exposed President Trump's       eagerness to benefit from foreign election interference.\318\       In the former instance, the President used his powers of       office to undermine an investigation conducted by officials       within the Executive Branch.\319\ In the latter, he attempted       to block the United States House of Representatives from       exercising its ``sole Power of Impeachment'' assigned by the       Constitution. In both instances, President Trump obstructed       investigations into foreign election interference to hide his       own misconduct.        1. See Report of the H.

Regardless of the date,       Ambassador Sondland did not contest telling both Mr. Morrison       and Ambassador Taylor--both of whom took contemporaneous       notes--of a conversation he had with the President that       reaffirmed Ambassador Sondland's understanding that President       Zelensky had to make a public statement announcing the       investigations in order to obtain the White House meeting and       security assistance.

The incidents were often carried out through       one-on-one meetings in which the President sought to use his       official power outside of usual channels. These actions       ranged from efforts to remove the Special Counsel and to       reverse the effect of the Attorney General's recusal; to the       attempted use of official power to limit the scope of the       investigation; to direct and indirect contacts with witnesses       with the potential to influence their testimony.'' Id., Vol.       II at 157.              [In Proceedings Before the United States Senate]               Trial Memorandum of President Donald J. Trump                              EXECUTIVE SUMMARY         The Articles of Impeachment now before the Senate are an       affront to the Constitution and to our democratic       institutions. The Articles themselves--and the rigged process       that brought them here--are a brazenly political act by House       Democrats that must be rejected. They debase the grave power       of impeachment and disdain the solemn responsibility that       power entails. Anyone having the most basic respect for the       sovereign will of the American people would shudder at the       enormity of casting a vote to impeach a duly elected       President. By contrast, upon tallying their votes, House       Democrats jeered until they were scolded into silence by the       Speaker. The process that brought the articles here violated       every precedent and every principle of fairness followed in       impeachment inquiries for more than 150 years. Even so, all       that House Democrats have succeeded in proving is that the       President did absolutely nothing wrong.        After focus-group testing various charges for weeks, House       Democrats settled on two flimsy Articles of Impeachment that       allege no crime or violation of law whatsoever--much less       ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' as required by the       Constitution. They do not remotely approach the       constitutional threshold for removing a President from       office. The diluted standard asserted here would permanently       weaken the Presidency and forever alter the balance among the       branches of government in a manner that offends the       constitutional design established by the Founders. House       Democrats jettisoned all precedent and principle because       their impeachment inquisition was never really about       discovering the truth or conducting a fair investigation.       Instead, House Democrats were determined from the outset to       find some way--any way--to corrupt the extraordinary power of       impeachment for use as a political tool to overturn the       result of the 2016 election and to interfere in the 2020       election. All of this is a dangerous perversion of the       Constitution that the Senate should swiftly and roundly       condemn.      I. The articles fail because they do not identify any           impeachable offense  A. House Democrats' Theory of ``Abuse of Power'' Is Not an Impeachable                                  Offense         House Democrats' novel theory of ``abuse of power''       improperly supplants the standard of ``high Crimes and       Misdemeanors'' with a made-up theory that would permanently       weaken the Presidency by effectively permitting impeachments       based merely on policy disagreements.        1. By limiting impeachment to cases of ``Treason, Bribery,       or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' \1\ the Framers       restricted impeachment to specific offenses against ``already       known and established law.'' \2\ That was a deliberate choice       designed to constrain the impeachment power. In keeping with       that restriction, every prior presidential impeachment in our       history has been based on alleged violations of existing       law--indeed, criminal law.\3\ House Democrats' newly invented       ``abuse of power'' theory collapses at the threshold because       it fails to allege any violation of law whatsoever.        2. House Democrats' concocted theory that the President can       be impeached for taking permissible actions if he does them       for what they believe to be the wrong reasons would also       expand the impeachment power beyond constitutional bounds. It       would allow a hostile House to attack almost any presidential       action by challenging a President's subjective motives.       Worse, House Democrats' methods for identifying supposedly       illicit motives ignore the constitutional structure of our       government. As proof of improper motive, they claim that the       President supposedly ``disregarded United States foreign       policy towards Ukraine,'' \4\ that he was ``briefed on       official policy'' \5\ but chose to ignore it, and that he       ``ignored, defied, and confounded every office and agency       within the Executive Branch.'' \6\ These assertions are       preposterous and dangerous. They misunderstand the assignment       of power under the Constitution and the very concept of       democratic accountability. Article II states that ``[t]he       executive Power shall be vested in a President.'' \7\ It is       the President who defines foreign policy, not the unelected       bureaucrats who are his subordinates. Any theory of an       impeachable offense that turns on ferreting out supposedly       ``constitutionally improper'' \8\ motives by measuring the       President's policy decisions against a purported interagency       consensus \9\ is both fundamentally anti-democratic and an       absurdly impermissible inversion of the constitutional       structure.    B. House Democrats' Theory of ``Obstruction of Congress'' Is Not an                            Impeachable Offense         House Democrats' ``obstruction of Congress'' claim is       frivolous and dangerous. House Democrats propose removing the       President from office because he asserted legal rights and       privileges of the Executive Branch against defective       subpoenas--based on advice from the Department of Justice.       Accepting that theory would do lasting damage to the       separation of powers.     1. President Trump properly asserted executive branch prerogatives         Contrary to the mistaken charge that the President lacked       ``lawful cause or excuse'' to resist House Democrats'       subpoenas,\10\ the President acted only after securing advice       from the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel       (OLC) and based on established legal principles or       immunities.        a. Several Executive Branch officials refused to comply       with subpoenas purportedly issued pursuant to an       ``impeachment inquiry'' before the House had authorized any       such inquiry, because, as OLC advised, the subpoenas were       unauthorized and had no legal force.\11\        b. The President directed three of his most senior advisers       not to comply with subpoenas seeking their testimony because       they are immune from compelled testimony before Congress.       Through administrations of both political parties, OLC ``has       repeatedly provided for nearly five decades'' that ``Congress       may not constitutionally compel the President's senior       advisers to testify about their official duties.'' \12\ In       the Clinton administration, for example, Attorney General       Janet Reno explained that ``the immunity such [immediate]       advisers enjoy from testimonial compulsion by a congressional       committee is absolute and may not be overborne by competing       congressional interests.'' \13\        c. Under the President's supervision, Executive Branch       officials were directed not to comply with subpoenas because       the committees seeking their testimony refused to allow them       to be accompanied by agency counsel. OLC concluded that the       committees ``may not bar agency counsel from assisting an       executive branch witness without contravening the legitimate       prerogatives of the Executive Branch,'' and that attempting       to enforce a subpoena while barring agency counsel ``would be       unconstitutional.'' \14\    2. Defending the separation of powers is not an impeachable offense         Contrary to House Democrats' claims, asserting legal rights       and constitutional privileges of the Executive Branch is not       ``obstruction.''        a. In a government of laws, asserting legal defenses cannot       be treated as obstruction; it is a fundamental right. As the       Supreme Court has instructed: ``[F]or an agent of the State       to pursue a course of action whose objective is to penalize a       person's reliance on his legal rights is `patently       unconstitutional.' '' \15\ The same principles apply in       impeachment. During the Clinton impeachment, Harvard Law       Professor Laurence Tribe put it this way:        The allegations that invoking privileges and otherwise       using the judicial system to shield information . . . is an       abuse of power that should lead to impeachment and removal       from office is not only frivolous, but also dangerous.\16\        In 1998, now-Chairman Jerrold Nadler agreed that a       president cannot be impeached for asserting a legal       privilege: ``[T]he use of a legal privilege is not illegal or       impeachable by itself, a legal privilege, executive       privilege.'' \17\ And Chairman Adam Schiff has turned the law       on its head with his unprecedented claim that it is       ``obstruction'' for any official to assert rights that       might prompt House committees even ``to consider       litigation'' to establish the validity of their subpoenas       in court.\18\        b. Where, as here, the principles the President invoked are       critical for preserving Executive Branch prerogatives,       treating the assertion of privileges as ``obstruction'' would       do permanent damage to the separation of powers--among all       three branches. House Democrats have essentially announced       that they may treat any resistance to their demands as       ``obstruction'' without taking any steps to resolve their       dispute with the President. Accepting that unprecedented       approach would fundamentally damage the separation of powers       by making the House itself the sole judge of its authority.       It would permit Congress to threaten every President with       impeachment merely for protecting the prerogatives of the       Presidency. As Professor Jonathan Turley testified before the       House Judiciary Committee: ``Basing impeachment on this       obstruction theory would itself be an abuse of power . . . by       Congress.'' \19\        c. At bottom, the ``obstruction'' charge asks the Senate to       remove a duly elected President from office because he acted       on the advice of the Department of Justice concerning his       legal and constitutional rights as President. Stating that       proposition exposes it as frivolous. The Framers restricted       impeachment to reach only egregious conduct that endangers       the Constitution. A difference of legal opinion over whether       subpoenas are enforceable cannot be dressed up to approach       that level. As Edmund Randolph explained in the Virginia       ratifying convention, ``No man ever thought of impeaching a       man for an opinion.'' \20\  [[Page S314]]           II. The impeachment inquiry in the House was irredeemably           flawed     A. House Democrats' Inquiry Violated All Precedent and Due Process         1. The process that resulted in these Articles of       Impeachment was flawed from the start. Since the Founding of       the Republic, the House has never launched an impeachment       inquiry against a President without a vote of the full House       authorizing it. And there is good reason for that. No       committee can investigate pursuant to powers assigned by the       Constitution to the House--including the ``sole Power of       Impeachment'' \21\--unless the House has voted to delegate       authority to the committee.\22\ Here, it was emblematic of       the lack of seriousness that characterized this whole process       that House Democrats cast law and history aside and started       their purported inquiry with nothing more than a press       conference.\23\ On that authority alone, they issued nearly       two dozen subpoenas that OLC determined were unauthorized and       invalid.\24\ The full House did not vote to authorize the       inquiry until five weeks later when it adopted House       Resolution 660 on October 31, 2019. That belated action was a       telling admission that the process was unauthorized.        2. Next, House Democrats concocted an unheard of procedure       that denied the President any semblance of fair process. The       proceedings began with secret hearings in a basement bunker       before three committees under the direction of Chairman       Schiff of the House Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence (HPSCI). The President was denied any right to       participate at all. He was denied the right to have counsel       present, to cross examine witnesses, to call witnesses, and       to see and present evidence. Meanwhile, House Democrats       selectively leaked distorted versions of the secret testimony       to compliant members of the press, who happily fed the public       a false narrative about the President.        Then, House Democrats moved on to a true show trial as they       brought their hand-picked witnesses, whose testimony had       already been set in private, before the cameras to present       prescreened testimony to the public. There, before HPSCI,       they continued to deny the President any rights. He could not       be represented by counsel, could not present evidence or       witnesses, and could not cross examine witnesses.        This process not only violated every precedent from the       Nixon and Clinton impeachment inquiries, it violated every       principle of justice and fairness known to our legal       tradition. For more than 250 years, the common law system has       regarded cross-examination as the ``greatest legal engine       ever invented for the discovery of truth.'' \25\ House       Democrats denied the President that right and every other       right because they were not interested in the truth. Their       only interest was securing an impeachment, and they knew that       a fair process could not get them there.        When the impeachment stage-show moved on to the Judiciary       Committee, House Democrats again denied the President his       rights. The Committee had already decided to forego fact-      finding and to adopt the one-sided record from HPSCI's ex       parte hearings. Worse, Speaker Nancy Pelosi had already       instructed the Committee to draft articles of impeachment.       The only role for the Committee was to ram through the       articles to secure a House vote by Christmas.\26\ There could       not have been a more blatant admission that evidence did not       matter, the process was rigged, and impeachment was a pre-      ordained result.        All of this reflected shameful hypocrisy from House       Democrat leaders, who for decades had insisted on the       importance of due process protections in an impeachment       inquiry. Chairman Nadler himself has explained that a House       impeachment inquiry ``demands a rigorous level of due       process.'' \27\ Specifically, he explained that ``due process       mean[s] . . . the right to confront the witnesses against       you, to call your own witnesses, and to have the assistance       of counsel.'' \28\ Here, however, all due process rights were       denied to the President.        3. Chairman Schiff's hearings were fatally defective for       another reason--Schiff himself was instrumental in helping to       create the story behind them. This inquiry centered on the       President's conversation on July 25, 2019, with the President       of Ukraine. That call became a matter of public speculation       after a so-called whistleblower relayed a distorted, second-      hand version of the call to the Inspector General of the       Intelligence Community (ICIG). Before laundering his       distortions through the ICIG, the same person secretly shared       his false account with Chairman Schiff's HPSCI staff and       asked ``for guidance.'' \29\ After initially lying about it,       Chairman Schiff was forced to admit that his staff had       conferred with the so-called whistleblower before he filed       his complaint. But the entirety of the role that Chairman       Schiff and his staff played in orchestrating the complaint       that launched this entire farce remains shrouded in secrecy       to this day--Chairman Schiff himself shut down every effort       to inquire into it.        4. The denial of basic due process rights to the President       is such a fundamental error infecting the House proceedings       that the Senate could not possibly rely upon the corrupted       House record to reach a verdict of conviction. Any such       record is tainted, and any reliance on a record created       through the wholesale denial of due process rights would be       unconstitutional. Nor is it the Senate's role to remedy the       House's errors by providing a ``do-over'' and developing the       record itself.         B. House Democrats' Goal Was Never to Ascertain the Truth         House Democrats resorted to these unprecedented procedures       because the goal was never to get to the truth. The goal was       to impeach the President, no matter the facts.        House Democrats' impeachment crusade started the day the       President took office. As Speaker Pelosi confirmed in       December 2019, her party's quest to impeach the President had       already been ``going on for 22 months . . . [t]wo and a half       years, actually.'' \30\ The moment the President was sworn       in, The Washington Post reported that partisans had launched       a campaign to impeach him.\31\ The current proceedings began       with a complaint prepared with the assistance of a lawyer who       declared in 2017 that he would use ``impeachment'' to effect       a ``coup.'' \32\        House Democrats originally pinned their impeachment hopes       on the lie that the Trump Campaign had colluded with Russia       during the 2016 election. That fixation brought the country       the Mueller investigation. But after almost two years, $32       million, 2,800 subpoenas, and nearly 500 search warrants       \33\--along with incalculable damage to the Nation--the       Mueller investigation thoroughly disproved Democrats' Russian       collusion delusion. To make matters worse, we now know       that the Mueller investigation (and its precursor,       Crossfire Hurricane) also brought with it shocking abuses       in the use of FISA orders to spy on American citizens and       a major-party presidential campaign--including omissions       and even outright lies to the Foreign Intelligence       Surveillance Court and the fabrication of evidence by a       committed partisan embedded in the FBI.        House Democrats could not tolerate the findings of the       Mueller Report debunking the collusion myth. Instead, they       launched hearings and issued subpoenas straining to find       wrongdoing where Special Counsel Mueller and the Department       of Justice had found none. And they launched new       investigations, trying to rummage through the President's tax       returns and pushing fishing expeditions everywhere in the       hope that they might find something. No other President in       history has been subjected to a comparable barrage of       investigations, subpoenas, and lawsuits, all in service of an       insatiable partisan desire to find some way to remove him       from office.        When those proceedings went nowhere, House Democrats seized       on the next vehicle that could be twisted to carry their       impeachment dream: a perfectly appropriate telephone call       between President Trump and the President of Ukraine. House       Democrats have pursued their newly concocted charges for two       reasons. First, they have been obsessed for years with       overturning the 2016 election. Radical left Democrats have       never been able to come to grips with losing the election,       and impeachment provides them a way to nullify the judgment       of the tens of millions of voters who rejected their       candidate. Second, they want to use impeachment to interfere       in the 2020 election. It is no accident that the Senate is       being asked to consider a presidential impeachment during an       election year. Put simply, Democrats have no response to the       President's record of achievement in restoring prosperity to       the American economy, rebuilding America's military, and       confronting America's adversaries abroad. Instead, they are       held hostage by a radical left wing that has foisted on their       party an agenda of socialism at home and appeasement abroad       that Democrat leaders know the American people will never       accept. For the Democrats, impeachment became an electoral       imperative. Congressman Al Green summarized that thinking       best: ``[I]f we don't impeach the [P]resident, he will get       re-elected.'' \34\ In their scorched-earth campaign against       the President, House Democrats view impeachment merely as the       continuation of politics by other means.        The result of House Democrats' pursuit of their       obsessions--and their willingness to sacrifice every       precedent and every principle standing in their way--is       exactly what the Framers warned against: a wholly partisan       impeachment. These articles were adopted without a single       Republican vote. Indeed, there was bipartisan opposition to       them.\35\        Democrats used to recognize that the momentous act of       overturning a national election by impeaching a President       should never be done on a partisan basis. As Chairman Nadler       explained:        There must never be a narrowly voted impeachment or an       impeachment supported by one of our major political parties       and opposed by another. Such an impeachment will produce       divisiveness and bitterness in our politics for years to       come, and will call into question the very legitimacy of our       political institutions.\36\        Senator Patrick Leahy agreed: ``A partisan impeachment       cannot command the respect of the American people. It is no       more valid than a stolen election.'' \37\ Chairman Nadler,       again, acknowledged that merely ``hav[ing] the votes'' and       ``hav[ing] the muscle'' in the House, without ``the       legitimacy of a national consensus,'' is just an attempted       ``partisan coup d'etat.'' \38\ Just last year, even Speaker       Pelosi acknowledged that an impeachment ``would have to be so       clearly bipartisan in terms of acceptance of it.'' \39\ All       of these prior invocations of principle have now been       abandoned, adding to the wreckage littering the wake of House       Democrats' impeach-at-all-costs strategy.  [[Page S315]]           III. Article I fails because House Democrats have no evidence           to support their claims    A. The Evidence Shows That the President Did Not Condition Security       Assistance or a Presidential Meeting on Announcements of Any                               Investigations         House Democrats have falsely charged that the President       supposedly conditioned military aid or a presidential meeting       on Ukraine's announcing a specific investigation. Yet despite       running an entirely ex parte, one-sided process to gather       evidence, House Democrats do not have a single witness who       claims, based on direct knowledge, that the President ever       actually imposed such a condition. Several undisputed, core       facts make clear that House Democrats' charges are baseless.        1. In an unprecedented display of transparency, the       President released the transcript of his July 25 call with       President Volodymyr Zelensky, and it shows that the President       did nothing wrong. The Department of Justice reviewed the       transcript months ago and rejected the suggestion by the ICIG       (based on the whistleblower's distorted account) that the       call might have raised an election-law violation.\40\        2. President Zelensky, his Foreign Minister, and other       Ukrainian officials have repeatedly said there was no quid       pro quo and no pressure placed on them by anyone.        3. President Zelensky, his senior advisers, and House       Democrats' own witnesses have all confirmed that Ukraine's       senior leaders did not even know the aid was paused until       after a Politico article was published on August 28, 2019--      over a month after the July 25 call and barely two weeks       before the aid was released on September 11.        4. House Democrats' case rests almost entirely on: (i)       statements from Ambassador to the European Union Gordon       Sondland that he had come to believe (before talking to the       President) that the aid and a meeting were ``likely'' linked       to investigations; and (ii) hearsay and speculation from       others echoing Sondland second- or third-hand. But Sondland       admitted that he was only ``presuming'' a link.\41\ He stated       unequivocally that he has no evidence ``[o]ther than [his]       own presumption'' that President Trump connected releasing       the aid to investigations, and he agreed that ``[n]o one on       this planet told [him] that Donald Trump was tying aid to       investigations.'' \42\ Similarly, as for a link between a       meeting and investigations, Sondland admitted that he was       speculating about that as well, based on hearsay.\43\ When       asked if ``the President ever [told him] personally about any       preconditions for anything''--i.e., for aid or a meeting--      Sondland responded, ``No.'' \44\ And when Ambassador Kurt       Volker, the special envoy who had actually been negotiating       with the Ukrainians, was asked if the President ever withheld       a meeting to pressure the Ukrainians, he said: ``The answer       to the question is no.'' \45\ ``[T]here was no linkage like       that.'' \46\        The only two people with statements on record who spoke       directly to the President on the matter--Sondland and Senator       Ron Johnson--directly contradicted House Democrats' false       allegations. Sondland testified that when he asked the       President what he wanted, the President stated unequivocally:       ``I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.'' \47\ Similarly,       Senator Johnson related that, when he asked the President if       there was any linkage between investigations and the aid, the       President responded: ``(Expletive deleted)--No way. I would       never do that.'' \48\        5. The military aid flowed on September 11, 2019, and a       presidential meeting was first scheduled for September 1 and       then took place on September 25, 2019, all without the       Ukrainian government having done anything about       investigations.        6. The undisputed reality is that U.S. support for Ukraine       against Russia has increased under President Trump. President       Trump provided Ukraine Javelin anti-tank missiles to use       against Russia after President Obama refused to provide that       assistance. President Trump also imposed heavy sanctions on       Russia, for which President Zelensky thanked him.\49\ A       parade of State Department and National Security Council       (NSC) career officials universally acknowledged that       President Trump's policy was stronger in support of Ukraine       against Russia than his predecessor's. Ambassador Yovanovitch       testified that ``our policy actually got stronger'' under       President Trump,\50\ and Ambassador Taylor agreed that aid       under President Trump was a ``substantial improvement'' over       the previous administration, largely because ``this       administration provided Javelin anti-tank weapons,'' which       ``are serious weapons'' that ``will kill Russian tanks.''       \51\        The evidence shows that President Trump had legitimate       concerns about corruption and burden-sharing with our       allies--two consistent themes in his foreign policy. When his       concerns had been addressed, the aid was released on       September 11 without any action concerning investigations.       Similarly, a bilateral meeting with President Zelensky was       first scheduled for September 1 in Warsaw and, after       rescheduling due to Hurricane Dorian, took place on September       25 in New York, again, all without the Ukrainians doing       anything related to investigations.        As Professor Turley summed it up, this impeachment       ``stand[s] out among modern impeachments as the shortest       proceeding, with the thinnest evidentiary record, and the       narrowest grounds ever used to impeach a president.'' \52\ It       is a constitutional travesty.  B. House Democrats Rest on the False Premise that There Could Have Been      No Legitimate Reason To Mention 2016 or the Biden-Burisma Affair         The charges in Article I are further flawed because they       rest on the mistaken premise that it would have been       illegitimate for the President to mention to President       Zelensky either (i) possible Ukrainian interference in the       2016 election; or (ii) an incident in which then-Vice       President Biden had forced the dismissal of a Ukrainian       prosecutor. House Democrats acknowledge that, even under       their theory of ``abuse of power,'' they must establish (in       their words) that these matters were ``bogus'' or ``sham       investigations'' \53\--that the only reason for raising them       would have been ``to obtain an improper personal political       benefit.'' \54\ But that is obviously false. Even if the       President had raised those issues, there were legitimate       reasons to do so.        1. Uncovering potential foreign interference in U.S.       elections is always a legitimate goal, whatever the source of       the interference and whether or not it fits with Democrats'       preferred narrative about 2016. House Democrats' assertion       that asking historical questions about the last election       somehow equates to securing ``improper interference'' in the       next election is nonsensical. Asking about the past cannot be       twisted into interference in a future election. Even if facts       uncovered about conduct in the last election were to have       some impact on the next election, uncovering historical facts       is not improper interference. Nor can House Democrats self-      servingly equate asking any questions about Ukraine with       advocating that Ukraine, instead of Russia, interfered in       2016.\55\ Actors in more than one country can interfere in an       election at the same time, in different ways and for       different purposes. And there has been plenty of public       reporting to give reason to be suspicious about many       Ukrainians' conduct in 2016. Even one of House Democrats' own       star witnesses, Dr. Fiona Hill, acknowledged that Ukrainian       officials ``bet on Hillary Clinton winning the election,''       and that ``they were trying to curry favor with the Clinton       campaign'' including by ``trying to collect information . . .       on Mr. Manafort and on other people as well.'' \56\ All of       that--and more--provides legitimate grounds for inquiry.        2. It also would have been legitimate to mention the Biden-      Burisma affair. Public reports indicate that then-Vice       President Biden threatened withholding U.S. loan guarantees       to secure the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor even though       Biden was, at the time, operating under what appeared to be,       at the very least, a serious conflict of interest. The       prosecutor reportedly had been investigating Burisma--a       Ukrainian energy company notorious for corruption--and       Biden's son, Hunter, was sitting on Burisma's board.\57\       Unless being son of the Vice President counted, Hunter had no       apparent qualifications to merit that seat, or to merit being       compensated (apparently) more richly than board members at       Fortune 100 energy giants like ConocoPhillips.\58\ In fact,       numerous career State Department and NSC employees agreed       that Hunter Biden's connection with Burisma created, at a       minimum, the appearance of a conflict of interest,\59\ and       The Washington Post reported as early as 2014 that ``[t]he       appointment of the [V]ice [P]resident's son to a Ukrainian       oil board looks nepotistic at best, nefarious at worst.''       \60\ More than one official raised the issue with the Vice       President's office at the time, but the Vice President took       no action in response.\61\        On those facts, it would have been appropriate to raise       this incident with President Zelensky. Ukraine cannot rid       itself of corruption if its prosecutors are always stymied.       Here, public reports suggested that Vice President Biden       played a role in derailing a legitimate inquiry while under a       monumental conflict of interest. If Biden were not running       for President, House Democrats would not argue that merely       raising the incident would have been improper. But former       Vice President Biden did not immunize his past conduct (or       his son's) from all scrutiny simply by declaring his       candidacy for the presidency.        Importantly, even under House Democrats' theory, mentioning       the matter to President Zelensky would have been entirely       justified as long as there was a basis to think that would       advance the public interest. To defend merely asking a       question, the President would not have to show that Vice       President Biden (or his son) actually committed any       wrongdoing. By contrast, under their own theory of the case,       to show ``abuse of power,'' the House Managers would have to       prove that the inquiry could have no public purpose       whatsoever. They have no such evidence. The record shows it       would have been legitimate to mention the Biden-Burisma       affair.      IV. The articles are structurally deficient and can only           result in acquittal        The articles are also defective because each charges       multiple different acts as possible grounds for conviction.       The problem with offering such a menu of options is that, for       a valid conviction, the Constitution requires two-thirds of       Senators present to agree on the specific basis for       conviction. A vote on these articles, however, cannot ensure       that a two-thirds majority agreed on a particular ground for       conviction. Instead, such a vote could reflect an       amalgamation of votes resting on several different theories,       no single one of which would have garnered two-thirds support       if it had been presented separately. This structural       deficiency cannot be remedied by dividing the different       allegations within each article for voting, because  [[Page S316]]       that is prohibited under Senate rules.\62\ The only       constitutional option is for the Senate to reject the       articles as framed and acquit the President.        The Framers foresaw that the House might at times fall prey       to tempestuous partisan tempers. Alexander Hamilton       recognized that ``the persecution of an intemperate or       designing majority in the House of Representatives'' was a       real danger in impeachments,\63\ and Jefferson acknowledged       that impeachment provided ``the most formidable weapon for       the purposes of dominant faction that ever was contrived.''       \64\ That is why the Framers entrusted the trial of       impeachments to the Senate. As Justice Story explained, the       Framers saw the Senate as a tribunal ``removed from popular       power and passions . . . and from the more dangerous       influence of mere party spirit,'' and guided by ``a deep       responsibility to future times.'' \65\ Now, perhaps as never       before, it is essential for the Senate to fulfill the role       Hamilton envisioned for it as a ``guard[] against the danger       of persecution, from the prevalency of a factious spirit'' in       the House.\66\        The Senate should speedily reject these deficient Articles       of Impeachment and acquit the President. The only threat to       the Constitution that House Democrats have brought to light       is their own degradation of the impeachment process and       trampling of the separation of powers. Their fixation on       damaging the President has trivialized the momentous act of       impeachment, debased the standards of impeachable conduct,       and perverted the power of impeachment by turning it into a       partisan, election-year political tool. The consequences of       accepting House Democrats' diluted standards for impeachment       would reverberate far beyond this election year and do       lasting damage to our Republic. As Senator Lyman Trumbull,       one of the seven Republican Senators who crossed the aisle to       vote against wrongfully convicting President Andrew Johnson,       explained: ``Once [we] set the example of impeaching a       President for what, when the excitement of the hour shall       have subsided, will be regarded as insufficient causes . . .       no future President will be safe . . . . [A]nd what then       becomes of the checks and balances of the Constitution, so       carefully devised and so vital to its perpetuity? They are       all gone.'' \67\ It is the solemn duty of this body to be       the bulwark of the Constitution protecting against exactly       this result.        Enough of the Nation's time and resources have been wasted       on House Democrats' partisan obsessions. The Senate should       bring a decisive end to these excesses so that Congress can       get back to its real job: working together with the President       to improve the lives of all Americans.                                  STANDARDS         The extraordinary process invoked by House Democrats under       Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution is not the       constitutionally preferred means to determine who should lead       our country. It is a mechanism of last resort, reserved for       exceptional circumstances--not present here--in which a       President has engaged in unlawful conduct that strikes at the       core of our constitutional system of government.      A. The Senate Must Decide All Questions of Law and Fact.        The Constitution makes clear that an impeachment by the       House of Representatives is nothing more than an accusation.       The Articles of Impeachment approved by the House come to the       Senate with no presumption of regularity in their favor. On       each of the two prior occasions that the House adopted       articles of impeachment against a President, the Senate       refused to convict on them. Indeed, the Framers wisely       forewarned that the House could impeach for the wrong       reasons.\68\ That is why the Constitution entrusts the Senate       with the ``sole Power to try all Impeachments.'' \69\ Under       that charge, it is the Senate's constitutional duty to decide       for itself all matters of law and fact bearing upon this       trial.\70\ These decisions include whether the accusation       presented by House Democrats even rises to the level of       describing an impeachable offense, the standard of proof that       House Democrats must meet to prove their case, and whether       they have met this burden. As Rep. John Logan, a House       manager in President Johnson's impeachment trial, explained       ``all questions of law or of fact are to be decided in these       proceedings by the final vote'' \71\ of the Senate, and ``in       determining this general issue Senators must consider the       sufficiency or insufficiency in law or in fact of every       article of accusation.'' \72\      B. An Impeachable Offense Requires a Violation of Established           Law that Inflicts Sufficiently Egregious Harm on the           Government that It Threatens to Subvert the Constitution.        The President of the United States occupies a unique       position in the structure of our government. He is chosen       directly by the People through a national election to be the       head of an entire branch of government and Commander-in-Chief       of the armed forces and is entrusted with enormous       responsibilities for setting policies for the Nation. Whether       Congress should supplant the will expressed by tens of       millions of voters by removing the President from office is a       question of breathtaking gravity. Approaching that question       requires a clear understanding of the limits the Constitution       places on what counts--and what does not count--as an       impeachable offense.           1. Text and Drafting History of the Impeachment Clause         Fearful that the power of impeachment might be abused, and       recognizing that constitutional protections were required for       the Executive, the Framers crafted a limited power of       impeachment.\73\ The Constitution restricts impeachment to       enumerated offenses: ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes       and Misdemeanors.'' \74\ Treason and bribery are well defined       offenses and are not at issue in this case. The operative       text here is the more general phrase ``other high Crimes and       Misdemeanors.'' The structure and language of the clause--the       use of the adjective ``other'' to describe ``high Crimes and       Misdemeanors'' in a list immediately following the specific       offenses ``Treason'' and ``Bribery''--calls for applying the       ejusdem generis canon of interpretation. This canon instructs       that `` `[w]here general words follow specific words in a       statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to       embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects       enumerated by the preceding specific words.'' \75\ Under that       principle, ``other high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' must be       understood to have the same qualities--in terms of       seriousness and their effect on the functioning of       government--as the crimes of ``Treason'' and ``Bribery.''       \76\        Treason is defined specifically in the Constitution and       ``consist[s] only in levying War against [the United States],       or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and       Comfort.'' \77\ This offense is ``a crime against and       undermining the very existence of the Government.'' \78\       Bribery, like treason, is a serious offense against the       government that subverts the proper functioning of the state.       Blackstone, a ``dominant source of authority'' for the       Framers,\79\ called bribery an ``offense against public       justice.'' \80\ Professor Akhil Amar describes bribery as       ``secretly bending laws to favor the rich and powerful'' and       contends that in this context it ``involves official       corruption of a highly malignant sort, threatening the very       soul of a democracy committed to equality under the law.''       \81\ According to Professor Philip Bobbitt, ``[l]ike treason,       the impeachable offense of bribery . . . must be an act that       actually threatens the constitutional stability and security       of the State.'' \82\ The text of the Constitution thus       indicates that the ``other'' crimes and misdemeanors that       qualify as impeachable offenses must be sufficiently       egregious that, like treason and bribery, they involve a       fundamental betrayal that threatens to subvert the       constitutional order of government.        Treason and bribery are also, of course, offenses defined       by law. Each of the seven other references in the       Constitution to impeachment also supports the conclusion that       impeachments must be evaluated in terms of offenses against       settled law: The Constitution refers to ``Conviction'' for       impeachable offenses twice \83\ and ``Judgment in Cases of       Impeachment.'' \84\ It directs the Senate to ``try all       Impeachments'' \85\ and requires the Chief Justice's       participation when the President is ``tried.'' \86\ And it       implies impeachable offenses are ``Crimes'' and ``Offenses''       in the Jury Trial Clause and the Pardon Clause,       respectively.\87\ These are all words that indicate       violations of established law.        The use of the term ``high'' in the Impeachment Clause is       also significant, and was clearly deliberate. Under English       common law, ``high'' indicated crimes against the state;       Blackstone defined ``high treason'' to include only offenses       against ``the supreme executive power, or the king and his       government,'' calling it the ``highest civil crime.'' \88\        In addition, ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' had a       technical meaning in English law,\89\ and there is evidence       that the Framers were aware of this ``limited,'' ``technical       meaning.'' \90\ In England, ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors''       referred to offenses that could be the subject of impeachment       in parliament. No less an authority than Blackstone, however,       made clear that ``an impeachment before the lords by the       commons of Great Britain, in parliament, is a prosecution of       the already known and established law.'' \91\ As a result,       nothing in the Constitution's use of the term ``other high       Crimes and Misdemeanors'' suggests that impeachment under the       Constitution could reach anything other than a known offense       defined in existing law.        Significantly, the records of the Constitutional Convention       also make clear that, in important respects, the Framers       intended the scope of impeachable offenses under the       Constitution to be much narrower than under English practice.       When the draft Constitution had limited the grounds for       impeachment to ``Treason, or bribery,'' \92\ George Mason       argued that the provision was too narrow because ``[a]ttempts       to subvert the Constitution may not be Treason'' and that the       clause ``will not reach many great and dangerous offenses.''       \93\ He proposed the addition of ``maladministration,'' \94\       which had been a ground for impeachment in English practice.       Madison opposed that change on the ground that ``[s]o vague a       term'' would make the President subject to ``a tenure during       [the] pleasure of the Senate,'' \95\ and the Convention       agreed on adding ``other high crimes & misdemeanors''       instead.\96\        By rejecting ``maladministration,'' the Framers       significantly narrowed impeachment under the Constitution and       made clear that mere differences of opinion, unpopular policy       decisions, or perceived misjudgments cannot constitutionally       be used as the basis for impeachment. Indeed, at various       earlier points during the Convention, drafts of the       Constitution had included as grounds for impeachment       ``malpractice or neglect of  [[Page S317]]       duty'' \97\ and ``neglect of duty [and] malversation,'' \98\       but the Framers rejected all of these formulations. The       ratification debates confirmed the point that differences of       opinion or differences over policy could not justify       impeachment. James Iredell warned delegates to North       Carolina's ratifying convention that ``[a] mere difference of       opinion might be interpreted, by the malignity of party, into       a deliberate, wicked action,'' \99\ and thus should not       provide the basis for impeachment. And Edmund Randolph       pointed out in the Virginia ratifying convention that ``[n]o       man ever thought of impeaching a man for an opinion.'' \100\        Taken together, the text, drafting history, and debates       surrounding the Constitution make several points clear.       First, the debates ``make quite plain that the Framers, far       from proposing to confer illimitable power to impeach and       convict, intended to confer a limited power.'' \101\ As       Senator Leahy has put it, ``[t]he Framers purposely       restrained the Congress and carefully circumscribed [its]       power to remove the head of the co-equal Executive Branch.''       \102\        Second, the terminology of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors''       makes clear that an impeachable offense must be a violation       of established law. The Impeachment Clause did not confer       upon Congress a roving license to make up new standards of       conduct for government officials and to permit removal from       office merely on a conclusion that conduct was ``bad'' if       there was not an existing law that it violated.        Third, by establishing that ``other'' impeachable offenses       must fall in the same class as the specific offenses of       ``treason'' and ``bribery,'' the Framers intended to       establish a requirement of particularly egregious conduct       threatening the constitutional order to justify impeachment.       Justice Story recognized impeachment was ``intended for       occasional and extraordinary cases'' only.\103\ For Professor       Bobbitt, ``[a]n impeachable offense is one that puts the       Constitution in jeopardy.'' \104\ Removal of the freely       elected President of the United States based on any lesser       standard would violate the plan of the Founders, who built       our government on the principle it would ``deriv[e] [its]       just powers from the consent of the governed.'' \105\       2. The President's Unique Role in Our Constitutional Structure         For at least two reasons, the President's unique role in       our constitutional structure buttresses the conclusion that       offenses warranting presidential impeachment must involve       especially egregious conduct that threatens to subvert the       constitutional order of government.        First, conviction of a President raises particularly       profound issues under our constitutional structure because it       means overturning the democratically expressed will of the       people in the only national election in which all eligible       citizens participate. The impeachment power permits the       possibility that ``the legislative branch [will] essentially       cancel[] the results of the most solemn collective act of       which we as a constitutional democracy are capable: the       national election of a President.''\106\        As even the House Managers have acknowledged, ``the issue''       in a presidential impeachment trial ``is whether to overturn       the results of a national election, the free expression of       the popular will of the American people.'' \107\ That step       can be justified only by an offense crossing an exceptional       threshold. As Chairman Nadler has put it, ``[w]e must not       overturn an election and remove a President from office       except to defend our system of government or our       constitutional liberties against a dire threat . . . .''       \108\ Especially where the American people are already       starting the process of voting for candidates for the next       presidential election, removing a President from office and       taking that decision away from the people requires meeting an       extraordinarily high standard. As then-Senator Biden       confirmed during President Clinton's trial, ``to remove a       duly elected president will unavoidably harm our       constitutional structure'' and ``[r]emoving the President       from office without compelling evidence would be historically       anti-democratic.'' \109\        Any lesser standard would be inconsistent with the unique       importance of the President's role in the structure of the       government, the profound disruption and danger of uncertainty       that attend to removing a president from office, and the       grave implications of negating the will of the people       expressed in a national election.        Second, because the President himself is vested with the       authority of an entire branch of the federal government, his       removal would cause extraordinary disruption to the Nation.       Article II, Section 1 declares in no uncertain terms that       ``[t]he executive Power shall be vested in a President of the       United States of America.'' \110\ As Justice Breyer has       explained, ``Article II makes a single President responsible       for the actions of the Executive Branch in much the same way       that the entire Congress is responsible for the actions of       the Legislative Branch, or the entire Judiciary for those of       the Judicial Branch.'' \111\ As a result, ``the application       of the Impeachment Clause to the President of the United       States involves the uniquely solemn act of having one branch       essentially overthrow another.'' \112\ It also carries the       risk of profound disruption for the operation of the federal       government.        As ``the chief constitutional officer of the Executive       branch,'' the President is ``entrusted with supervisory and       policy responsibilities of utmost discretion and       sensitivity.'' \113\ Because he is assigned responsibility to       ``take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,'' \114\ all       federal law enforcement depends, ultimately, on the direction       of the President. In addition, he is the Commander-in-Chief       of the armed forces \115\ and ``the sole organ of the federal       government in the field of international relations.'' \116\       The foreign policy of the Nation is determined primarily by       the President. His removal would necessarily create       uncertainty and pose unique risks for U.S. interests around       the globe. As OLC put it, removal of the President would be       ``politically and constitutionally a traumatic event,'' \117\       and Senator Bob Graham rightly called it ``one of the most       disruptive acts imaginable in a democracy'' during President       Clinton's trial.\118\                  3. Practice Under the Impeachment Clause         The practical application of the Impeachment Clause by       Congress supports the conclusion that an impeachable offense       requires especially egregious conduct that threatens the       constitutional order and, specifically, that it requires a       violation of established law. The extraordinary threshold       required for impeachment is evidenced by the fact that, in       over two centuries under our Constitution, the House has       impeached a President only twice. In each case, moreover, the       Senate found the charges brought by the House insufficient to       warrant removal from office.        In addition, until now, even in the articles of impeachment       that the Senate found insufficient, the House has never       impeached a President on charges that did not include a       violation of established law. President Clinton was impeached       on charges that included perjury and obstruction of       justice, both felonies under federal law.\119\ Similarly,       in the near-impeachment of President Nixon, the articles       of impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee       included multiple violations of law.\120\ Article I       alleged obstruction of justice.\121\ And Article II       asserted numerous legal breaches.\122\        The impeachment of Andrew Johnson proves the same point. In       1867, the House Judiciary Committee recommended articles of       impeachment against President Johnson. The articles, however,       did not allege any violation of law. Largely as a result of       that fact, the Committee could not secure approval for them       from a majority of the House. The minority report from the       Committee arguing against adoption of the articles of       impeachment explained that ``[t]he House of Representatives       may impeach a civil officer, but it must be done according to       law. It must be for some offence known to the law, and not       created by the fancy of the members of the House.'' \123\       Rep. James F. Wilson argued the position of the minority       report on the House floor, explaining that ``no civil officer       of the United States can be lawfully impeached except for a       crime or misdemeanor known to the law.'' \124\ As one       historian has explained, ``[t]he House had refused to impeach       Andrew Johnson . . . at least in part because many       representatives did not believe he had committed a specific       violation of law.'' \125\ It was only after President Johnson       violated the Tenure of Office Act, a law passed by Congress,       that he was successfully impeached.\126\        Even if judicial impeachments have been based on charges       that do not involve a criminal offense or violation of       statute,\127\ that would provide no sound basis for diluting       the standards for presidential impeachment. Textually, the       Constitution's Good Behavior Clause alters the standard for       the impeachment of judges.\128\ In addition, for all the       reasons outlined above, the President's unique role in the       constitutional structure sets him apart and warrants more       rigorous standards for impeachment. ``When Senators remove       one of a thousand federal judges (or even one of nine       justices), they are not transforming an entire branch of       government. But that is exactly what happens when they oust       America's one and only President, in whom all executive power       is vested by the first sentence of Article II.'' \129\ Unlike       a presidential impeachment inquiry, impeachment of a federal       judge ``does not paralyze the Nation'' or cast doubt on the       direction of the country's domestic and foreign policy.\130\       Similarly, ``[t]he grounds for the expulsion of the one       person elected by the entire nation to preside over the       executive cannot be the same as those for one member of the       almost four-thousand-member federal judiciary.'' \131\ Thus,       as then-Senator Biden recognized: ``The constitutional       scholarship overwhelmingly recognizes that the fundamental       structural commitment to a separation of powers requires [the       Senate] to view the President as different than a Federal       judge.'' \132\ Indeed, ``our history establishes that, as       applied, the constitutional standard for impeaching the       President has been distinctive, and properly so.'' \133\   C. The Senate Cannot Convict Unless It Finds that the House Managers        Have Proved an Impeachable Offense Beyond a Reasonable Doubt         Given the profound implications of removing a duly elected       president from office, an exceptionally demanding standard of       proof must apply in a presidential impeachment trial.\134\       Senators should convict on articles of impeachment against a       President only if they find that the House Managers have       carried their burden of proving that the President committed       an impeachable offense beyond a reasonable doubt.        As Senator Russ Feingold recognized in the Clinton       impeachment, ``[i]n making a decision of this magnitude, it       is best not to err  [[Page S318]]       at all. If we must err, however, we should err on the side of       . . . respecting the will of the people.'' \135\ Democrat and       Republican Senators alike applied the beyond a reasonable       doubt standard during President Clinton's impeachment       trial.\136\ As Senator Barbara Mikulski put it then: ``The       U.S. Senate must not make the decision to remove a President       based on a hunch that the charges may be true. The strength       of our Constitution and the strength of our Nation dictate       that [the Senate] be sure--beyond a reasonable doubt.'' \137\  D. The Senate May Not Consider Allegations Not Charged in the Articles                               of Impeachment         Under the Constitution, the House is given the ``sole Power       of Impeachment'' and the Senate is given the ``sole Power to       try all Impeachments.'' \138\ An impeachment is literally a       ``charge'' of particular wrongdoing.\139\ Thus, under the       division of responsibility in the Constitution, the Senate       can conduct a trial solely on the charges specified in       articles of impeachment approved by a vote of the House and       presented to the Senate. The Senate cannot expand the scope       of a trial to consider mere assertions appearing in House       reports that the House did not include in the articles of       impeachment submitted to a vote. Similarly, House Managers       trying the case in the Senate must be confined to the       specific conduct alleged in the Articles approved by the       House.        These restrictions follow both from the plain terms of the       Constitution limiting the Senate to trying an ``impeachment''       framed by the House and from elementary principles of due       process. ``[T]he senator's role is solely one of acting on       the accusations (Articles of Impeachment) voted by the House       of Representatives. The Senate cannot lawfully find the       president guilty of something not charged by the House, any       more than a trial jury can find a defendant guilty of       something not charged in the indictment.'' \140\ ``No       principle of procedural due process is more clearly       established than that notice of the specific charge, and a       chance to be heard in a trial of the issues raised by that       charge, if desired, are among the constitutional rights of       every accused.'' \141\ As the Supreme Court has explained, it       has been the rule for over 130 years that ``a court cannot       permit a defendant to be tried on charges that are not made       in the indictment against him.'' \142\ Doing so is ``fatal       error.'' \143\        Under the same principles of due process, the Senate must       similarly refuse to consider any uncharged allegations as a       basis for conviction.                              PROCEDURAL HISTORY         House Democrats have focused these proceedings on a       telephone conversation between President Trump and President       Zelensky of Ukraine on July 25, 2019.\144\ At some unknown       time shortly after that call, a staffer in the Intelligence       Community (IC)--who had no first-hand knowledge of the call--      approached the staff of Chairman Adam Schiff on the House       Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) raising       complaints about the call.\145\ Although it is known that       Chairman Schiff's staff provided the IC staffer some       ``guidance,'' \146\ the extent of the so-called       whistleblower's coordination with Chairman Schiff's staff       remains unknown to this day.        The IC staffer retained counsel, including an attorney who       had announced just days after President Trump took office       that he supported a ``coup'' and ``rebellion'' to remove the       President from office.\147\        On August 12, 2019, the IC staffer filed a complaint about       the July 25 telephone call with the Inspector General of the       IC.\148\ The Inspector General found that there was ``some       indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of [the so-      called whistleblower] in favor of a rival political       candidate.'' \149\        On September 24, 2019, Speaker Nancy Pelosi unilaterally       announced at a press conference that ``the House of       Representatives is moving forward with an official       impeachment inquiry'' \150\ based on the anonymous complaint       about the July 25 telephone call. There was no vote by the       House to authorize such an inquiry.        On September 25, pursuant to a previous announcement,\151\       the President declassified and released the complete record       of the July 25 call.\152\        On September 26, HPSCI held its first hearing regarding the       so-called whistleblower complaint.\153\ And just one week       later, on October 3, Chairman Schiff began a series of       secret, closed-door hearings regarding the complaint.\154\       The President and his counsel were not permitted to       participate in any of these proceedings.        On October 31, after five weeks of hearings, House       Democrats finally authorized an impeachment inquiry when the       full House voted to approve House Resolution 660.\155\ By its       terms, the Resolution did not purport to retroactively       authorize investigative efforts before October 31.\156\        On November 13, HPSCI held the first of seven public       hearings featuring some of the witnesses who had already       testified in secret. At this stage, too, the President and       his counsel were denied any opportunity to participate. HPSCI       released a report on December 3, 2019.\157\        On December 4, the House Judiciary Committee held its first       hearing, which featured four law professors, three of whom       were selected by Democrats.\158\        The next day, December 5, Speaker Pelosi announced the       outcome of the Judiciary Committee's proceedings and directed       Chairman Jerrold Nadler to draft articles of       impeachment.\159\        On December 9, four days after Speaker Pelosi announced       that articles of impeachment would be drafted, the Judiciary       Committee held its second and last hearing, which featured       presentations solely from staff members from HPSCI and the       Judiciary Committee.\160\ The House Judiciary Committee did       not hear from any fact witnesses at any time.        On December 10, Chairman Jerrold Nadler offered two       articles of impeachment for the Judiciary Committee's       consideration,\161\ and the Committee approved the articles       on December 13 on a party-line vote.\162\        On December 18, a mere 85 days after the press conference       purportedly launching the inquiry, House Democrats completed       the fastest presidential impeachment inquiry in history and       adopted the Articles of Impeachment over bipartisan       opposition.\163\        House Democrats justified their unseemly haste by claiming       they had to move forward ``without delay'' because the       President would allegedly ``continue to threaten the Nation's       security, democracy, and constitutional system if he is       allowed to remain in office.'' \164\ In a remarkable       reversal, however, as soon as they had voted, they decided       that there was no urgency at all. House Democrats took a       leisurely four weeks to complete the ministerial act of       transmitting the articles to the Senate--more than three       times longer than the entire length of proceedings before the       House Judiciary Committee.        The Senate now has the ``sole Power to try'' the Articles       of Impeachment transmitted by the House.\165\   The Articles Should be Rejected and the President Should Immediately be                                 Acquitted.       I. The Articles Fail to State Impeachable Offenses as a           Matter Of Law.   A. House Democrats' Novel Theory of ``Abuse of Power'' Does Not State  an Impeachable Offense and Would Do Lasting Damage to the Separation of                                   Powers         House Democrats' novel conception of ``abuse of power'' as       a supposedly impeachable offense is constitutionally       defective. It supplants the Framers' standard of ``high       Crimes and Misdemeanors'' \166\ with a made-up theory that       the President can be impeached and removed from office under       an amorphous and undefined standard of ``abuse of power.''       The Framers adopted a standard that requires a violation of       established law to state an impeachable offense. By contrast,       in their Articles of Impeachment, House Democrats have not       even attempted to identify any law that was violated.       Moreover, House Democrats' theory in this case rests on the       radical assertion that the President could be impeached and       removed from office entirely for his subjective motives--that       is, for undertaking permissible actions for supposedly       ``forbidden reasons.'' \167\ That unprecedented test is so       flexible it would vastly expand the impeachment power beyond       constitutional limits and would permanently weaken the       Presidency by effectively permitting impeachments based on       policy disagreements.        House Democrats cannot salvage their unprecedented ``abuse       of power'' standard with fuzzy claims that the Framers       particularly intended impeachment to address ``foreign       entanglements'' and ``corruption of elections.'' \168\ Those       assertions are makeweights that distort history and add no       legitimacy to the radical theory of impeachment based on       subjective motive alone.        Under the Constitution, impeachable offenses must be       defined under established law. And they must be based on       objective wrongdoing, not supposed subjective motives dreamt       up by a hostile faction in the House and superimposed onto a       President's entirely lawful conduct.       1. House Democrats' Novel Theory of ``Abuse of Power'' as an      Impeachable Offense Subverts Constitutional Standards and Would                     Permanently Weaken the Presidency         House Democrats' theory that the President can be impeached       and removed from office under a vaguely defined concept of       ``abuse of power'' would vastly expand the impeachment power       beyond the limits set by the Constitution and should be       rejected by the Senate.  (a) House Democrats' made-up ``abuse of power'' standard fails to state    an impeachable offense because it does not rest on violation of an                              established law         House Democrats' claim that the Senate can remove a       President from office for running afoul of some ill-defined       conception of ``abuse of power'' finds no support in the text       or history of the Impeachment Clause. As explained       above,\169\ by limiting impeachment to cases of ``Treason,       Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' \170\ the       Framers restricted impeachment to specific offenses against       ``already known and established law.'' \171\  That was a       deliberate choice designed to constrain the power of       impeachment.\172\ Restricting impeachment to offenses       established by law provided a crucial protection for the       independence of the Executive from what James Madison called       the ``impetuous vortex'' of legislative power.\173\ As many       constitutional scholars have recognized, ``the Framers were       far more concerned with protecting the presidency from the       encroachments of Congress . . . than they were  [[Page S319]]       with the potential abuse of executive power.'' \174\ The       impeachment power necessarily implicated that concern. If the       power were too expansive, the Framers feared that the       Legislative Branch may ``hold [impeachments] as a rod over       the Executive and by that means effectually destroy his       independence.'' \175\ One key voice at the Constitutional       Convention, Gouverneur Morris, warned that, as they crafted a       mechanism to make the President ``amenable to Justice,'' the       Framers ``should take care to provide some mode that will not       make him dependent on the Legislature.'' \176\ To limit the       impeachment power, Morris argued that only ``few'' ``offences       . . . ought to be impeachable,'' and the ``cases ought to be       enumerated & defined.'' \177\        Indeed, the debates over the text of the Impeachment Clause       particularly reveal the Framers' concern that ill-defined       standards could give free rein to Congress to utilize       impeachment to undermine the Executive. As explained       above,\178\ when ``maladministration'' was proposed as a       ground for impeachment, it was rejected based on Madison's       concern that ``[s]o vague a term will be equivalent to a       tenure during [the] pleasure of the Senate.'' \179\ Madison       rightly feared that a nebulous standard could allow Congress       to use impeachment against a President based merely on policy       differences, making it function like a parliamentary no-      confidence vote. That would cripple the independent Executive       the Framers had crafted and recreate the Parliamentary system       they had expressly rejected. Circumscribing the impeachment       power to reach only existing, defined offenses guarded       against such misuse of the authority.\180\        As Luther Martin, who had been a delegate at the       Constitutional Convention, summarized the point at the       impeachment trial of Justice Samuel Chase in 1804, ``[a]dmit       that the House of Representatives have a right to impeach for       acts which are not contrary to law, and that thereon the       Senate may convict and the officer be removed, you leave your       judges and all your other officers at the mercy of the       prevailing party.'' \181\ The Framers prevented that       dangerous result by limiting impeachment to defined offenses       under the law.        House Democrats cannot reconcile their amorphous ``abuse of       power'' standard with the constitutional text simply by       asserting that, ``[t]o the founding generation, abuse of       power was a specific, well-defined offense.'' \182\ In fact,       they conspicuously fail to provide any citation for that       assertion. Nowhere have they identified any contemporaneous       definition delimiting this purportedly ``well-defined''       offense.        Nor can House Democrats shore up their theory by invoking       English practice.\183\ According to House Democrats, 400       years of parliamentary history suggests that the particular       offenses charged in English impeachments can be abstracted       into several categories of offenses, including one involving       abuse of power.\184\ From there, they jump to the conclusion       that ``abuse of power'' itself can be treated as an offense       and that any fact pattern that could be described as showing       abuse of power can be treated as an impeachable offense. But       that entire methodology is antithetical to the approach the       Framers took in defining the impeachment power. The Framers       sought to confine impeachable offenses within known bounds to       protect the Executive from arbitrary exercises of power by       Congress. Indeed, the Framers expressly rejected vague       standards such as ``maladministration'' that had been used in       England in order to constrain the impeachment power within       defined limits. Deriving general categories from ancient       English cases and using those categories as the labels for       new, more nebulously defined purported ``offenses'' is       precisely counter to the Framers' approach. As the Republican       minority on the House Judiciary Committee in the Nixon       impeachment inquiry explained, ``[t]he whole tenor of the       Framers' discussions, the whole purpose of their many careful       departures from English impeachment practice, was in the       direction of limits and of standards.'' \185\        House Democrats' theory also has no grounding in the       history of presidential impeachments. Until now, the House of       Representatives has never impeached a President of the United       States without alleging a violation of law--indeed, a crime.       The articles of impeachment against President Clinton       specified charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, both       felonies under federal law.\186\ In the Nixon impeachment       inquiry, the articles approved by the House Judiciary       Committee accused the President of obstructing justice, among       multiple other violations of the law.\187\ And as explained       above,\188\ the impeachment of President Johnson provides the       clearest evidence that a presidential impeachment requires       alleged violations of existing law. When the House Judiciary       Committee recommended impeaching Johnson in 1867 based on       allegations that included no violations of law, the House       rejected the recommendation.\189\ A majority in the House was       persuaded by the arguments of the minority on the Judiciary       Committee, who argued that ``[t]he House of Representatives       may impeach a civil officer, but it must be done according to       law. It must be for some offence known to the law, and not       created by the fancy of the members of the House.'' \190\       Congress did not impeach President Johnson until the       following year, when he was impeached for violating the       Tenure of Office Act.\191\ The history of presidential       impeachments provides no support for House Democrats' vague       ``abuse of power'' charge.     (b) House Democrats' unprecedented theory of impeachable offenses      defined by subjective intent alone would permanently weaken the                                 presidency         House Democrats' conception of ``abuse of power'' is       especially dangerous because it rests on the even more       radical claim that a President can be impeached and removed       from office solely for doing something he is allowed to do,       if he did it for the ``wrong'' subjective reasons. Under this       view, impeachment can turn entirely on ``whether the       President's real reasons, the ones actually in his mind at       the time, were legitimate.'' \192\ That standard is so       malleable that it would permit a partisan House--like this       one--to attack virtually any presidential decision by       questioning a President's motives. By eliminating any       requirement for wrongful conduct, House Democrats have       tried to make thinking the wrong thoughts an impeachable       offense.        House Democrats' theory of impeachment based on subjective       motive alone is unworkable and constitutionally       impermissible.        First, by making impeachment turn on nearly impossible       inquiries into the subjective intent behind entirely lawful       conduct, House Democrats' standard would open virtually every       presidential decision to partisan attack based on questioning       a President's motives. As courts have repeatedly observed,       ``[i]nquiry into the motives of elected officials can be both       difficult and undesirable, and such inquiry should be avoided       when possible.'' \193\ Thus, for example, courts will not       invalidate laws within Congress's constitutional authority       based on allegations about legislators' motives.\194\ As       constitutional historian Raoul Berger has observed, this       principle ``is equally applicable to executive action within       statutory or constitutional limits.'' \195\ Even House       Democrats' own expert, Professor Michael Gerhardt, has       previously explained (in defending the Obama Administration       against charges of abuse of power) that ``the President has       the ability to . . . strongly push back against any inquiry       into either the motivations or support for his actions.''       \196\        The Framers did not intend to expand the impeachment power       infinitely by allowing Congress to attack objectively lawful       presidential conduct based solely on unwieldy inquiries into       subjective intent. Under the Framers' plan, impeachment was       intended to apply to objective wrongdoing as identified by       offenses defined under existing law. As noted above, the       Framers rejected maladministration as a ground for       impeachment precisely because it was ``[s]o vague a term.''       \197\ Instead, they settled on ``high Crimes and       Misdemeanors,'' \198\ as a term with a ``limited and       technical meaning.'' \199\ ``[H]igh Crimes and       Misdemeanors,'' as well as ``Treason'' and ``Bribery,'' \200\       all denote objectively wrongful conduct as defined by       existing law. Each of the seven other references in the       Constitution to impeachment also supports the conclusion that       impeachments must be evaluated in terms of offenses against       settled law: The Constitution refers to ``Conviction'' for       impeachable offenses twice \201\ and ``Judgment in Cases of       Impeachment.'' \202\ It directs the Senate to ``try all       Impeachments'' \203\ and requires the Chief Justice's       participation when the President is ``tried.'' \204\ And it       implies impeachable offenses are ``Crimes'' and ``Offenses''       in the Jury Trial Clause and the Pardon Clause,       respectively.\205\ These are all words that indicate       violations of established law. The Framers' words limited the       impeachment power and, in particular, sought to ensure that       impeachment could not be used to attack a President based on       mere policy differences.        Given their apprehensions about misuse of the impeachment       power, it is inconceivable that the Framers crafted a purely       intent-based impeachment standard. Such a standard would be       so vague and malleable that entirely permissible actions       could lead to impeachment of a President (and potentially       removal from office) based solely on a hostile Congress's       assessment of the President's subjective motives. If that       were the rule, any President's political opponents could take       virtually any of his actions, mischaracterize his motives       after the fact, and misuse impeachment as a tool for       political opposition instead of as a safeguard against       egregious presidential misconduct.\206\ As Republicans on the       House Judiciary Committee during the Nixon impeachment       inquiry rightly explained, ``[a]n impeachment power exercised       without extrinsic and objective standards would be tantamount       to the use of bills of attainder and ex post facto laws,       which are expressly forbidden by the Constitution and are       contrary to the American spirit of justice.'' \207\        House Democrats justify their focus on subjective motives       based largely on a cherry-picked snippet from a statement       James Iredell made in the North Carolina ratification       debates.\208\ Iredell observed that ``the President would be       liable to impeachment [if] . . . he had acted from some       corrupt motive or other.'' \209\ But nothing in that general       statement suggests that Iredell--let alone the Framers or the       hundreds of delegates who ratified the Constitution in the       states--subscribed to House Democrats' current theory       treating impeachment as a roving license for Congress to       attack a President's lawful actions based on subjective       motive alone. To the contrary, in the very same speech,       Iredell himself warned against the dangers of allowing       impeachment based on assessments of subjective motive. He       explained that there would often be divisions  [[Page S320]]       between political parties and that, due to a lack of       ``charity,'' each might often ``attribute every opposition''       to its own views ``to an ill motive.'' \210\ In that       environment, he warned, ``[a] mere difference of opinion       might be interpreted, by the malignity of party, into a       deliberate, wicked action.'' \211\ That, he argued, should       not be a basis for impeachment.\212\        House Democrats' assertions that past presidential       impeachments provide support for their made-up impeachment-      based-on-subjective-motives-alone theory are also wrong.\213\       Contrary to their claims, neither the Nixon impeachment       inquiry nor the impeachment of President Johnson supports       their assertions.        In the Nixon impeachment inquiry, none of the articles       recommended by the House Judiciary Committee was labeled       ``abuse of power'' or framed the charge in those terms. And       it is simply wrong to say that the theory underlying the       proposed articles was that President Nixon had taken       permissible actions with the wrong subjective motives.       Article I alleged President Nixon obstructed justice, a clear       violation of law.\214\ And Article II asserted numerous       breaches of the law. It claimed that President Nixon       ``violat[ed] the constitutional rights of citizens,''       ``contraven[ed] the laws governing agencies of the executive       branch,'' and ``authorized and permitted to be maintained a       secret investigative unit within the office of the President       . . . which unlawfully utilized the resources of the Central       Intelligence Agency, [and] engaged in covert and unlawful       activities.'' \215\ Those allegations did not turn on       describing permissible conduct that had simply been done with       the wrong subjective motives.\216\ Instead, they charged       unlawful conduct.\217\        House Democrats' reliance on the Johnson impeachment fares       no better. According to House Democrats, the Johnson       impeachment supports their concocted impeachment-based-on-      subjective-motives theory under the following tortured logic:       The articles of impeachment actually adopted by the House       charged the violation of the Tenure of Office Act.\218\ But       that was not the ``real'' reason the House sought to remove       President Johnson. The real reason was that he had undermined       Reconstruction. And, in House Democrats' view, his improper       desire to thwart Reconstruction was actually a better reason       to impeach him.\219\ For support, House Democrats cite a       recent book co-authored by one of their own staffers (Joshua       Matz) and Laurence Tribe.\220\ This is nonsense. Nothing in       the Johnson impeachment involved charging the President with       taking objectively permissible action for the wrong       subjective reasons. Johnson was impeached for violating a law       passed by Congress.\221\ Moreover, President Johnson was       acquitted, despite whatever subjective motives he might have       had. House Democrats cannot conjure a precedent out of thin       air by simply imagining that the Johnson impeachment articles       said something other than what they said.\222\        If the Johnson impeachment established any precedent       relevant here, it is that the House refused to impeach the       President until he clearly violated the letter of the law. As       one historian has explained, despite widespread anger among       Republicans about President Johnson's actions undermining       Reconstruction, until Johnson violated the Tenure of Office       Act, ``[t]he House had refused to impeach [him] . . . at       least in part because many representatives did not believe he       had committed a specific violation of law.'' \223\        Second, House Democrats' theory raises particular dangers       because it makes ``personal political benefit'' one of the       ``forbidden reasons'' for taking government action.\224\       Under that standard, a President could potentially be       impeached and removed from office for taking any action with       his political interests in view. In a representative       democracy, however, elected officials almost always consider       the effect that their conduct might have on the next       election. And there is nothing wrong with that.        By making ``personal political gain'' an illicit motive for       official action, House Democrats' radical theory of       impeachment would permit a partisan Congress to remove       virtually any President by questioning the extent to which       his or her action was motivated by electoral considerations       rather than the ``right'' policy motivation. None of this has       any basis in the constitutional text, which specifies       particular offenses as impeachable conduct. Just as       importantly, under such a rule, impeachments would turn on       unanswerable questions that ultimately reduce to policy       disputes--exactly what the Framers saw as an impermissible       basis for impeachment. For example, if it is impeachable       conduct to act with too much of a view toward electoral       results, how much of a focus on electoral results is too       much, even assuming that Congress could accurately       disaggregate a President's actual motives? And how does one       measure presidential motives against some unknowable standard       of the ``right'' policy result uninfluenced by considerations       of political gain? That question, of course, quickly boils       down to nothing more than a dispute about the ``right''       policy in the first place. None of this provides any       permissible basis for impeaching a President.        Third, aptly demonstrating why all of this leads to       unconstitutional results, House Democrats have invented       standards for identifying supposedly illicit presidential       motives that turn the Constitution upside down. According to       House Democrats, they can show that President Trump acted       with illicit motives because, in their view, the President       supposedly ``disregarded United States foreign policy towards       Ukraine,'' \225\ ignored the ``official policy'' \226\ that       he had been briefed on, and ``ignored, defied, and confounded       every agency within the Executive Branch'' with his decisions       on Ukraine.\227\ These assertions are preposterous and       dangerous. They fundamentally misunderstand the assignment of       power under the Constitution.        Article II of the Constitution states that ``the executive       Power shall be vested in a President''--not Executive Branch       staff.\228\ The vesting of the Executive Power in the       President makes him ``the sole organ of the nation in its       external relations, and its sole representative with foreign       nations.'' \229\ He sets foreign policy for the Nation, and       in ``this vast external realm,'' the ``President alone has       the power to speak . . . as a representative of the nation.''       \230\ The Constitution assigns him control over foreign       policy precisely to ensure that the Nation speaks with one       voice.\231\ His decisions are authoritative regardless of the       judgments of the unelected bureaucrats participating in an       inter-agency process that exists solely to facilitate his       decisions, not to make decisions for him. Any theory of an       impeachable offense that turns on ferreting out supposedly       ``constitutionally improper'' motives by measuring the       President's policy decisions against a purported       ``interagency consensus'' formed by unelected staff is a       transparent and impermissible inversion of the constitutional       structure.        It requires no leap of imagination to see the absurd       consequences that would follow from House Democrats' theory.       Imagine a President who, in an election year, determined to       withdraw troops from an overseas deployment to have them home       by Christmas. Should hostile lawmakers be able to seek       impeachment and claim proof of ``illicit motive'' because an       alleged ``interagency consensus'' showed that the ``real''       national security interests of the United States required       keeping those troops in place? Manufacturing an impeachment       out of such an assertion ought to be dismissed out of hand.        House Democrats' abuse-of-power theory is also profoundly       anti-democratic. In assigning the Executive Power to the       President, the Constitution ensures that power is exercised       by a person who is democratically responsible to the people       through a quadrennial election.\232\ This ensures that the       people themselves will regularly and frequently have a say in       the direction of the Nation's policy, including foreign       policy. As a result, removing a President on the ground that       his foreign policy decisions were allegedly based on       ``illicit motives''--because they failed to conform to a       purported ``consensus'' of career bureaucrats--would       fundamentally subvert the democratic principles at the core       of our Constitution.        This very impeachment shows how anti-democratic House       Democrats' theory really is. Millions of Americans voted for       President Trump precisely because he promised to disrupt the       foreign policy status quo. He promised a new, ``America       First'' foreign policy that many in the Washington       establishment derided. And the President has delivered,       bringing fresh and successful approaches to foreign policy in       a host of areas, including relations with NATO, China,       Israel, and North Korea. In particular, with respect to       Ukraine and elsewhere, his foreign policy has focused on       ensuring that America does not shoulder a disproportionate       burden for various international missions, that other       countries do their fair share, and that taxpayer dollars are       not squandered. House Democrats' theory that a purported       inter-agency ``consensus'' among career bureaucrats can be       used to show improper motive is an affront to the tens of       millions of American citizens who voted for President Trump's       foreign policy and not a continuation of the Washington       establishment's policy preferences.   2. House Democrats' assertions that the framers particularly intended        impeachment to guard against ``foreign entanglements'' and      ``corruption'' of elections are makeweights that distort history         House Democrats try to shore up their made-up theory of       abuse of power by pretending that anything related to what       they call ``foreign entanglements'' or elections strikes at       the core of impeachment.\233\ This novel accounting of the       concerns animating the impeachment power conveniently allows       House Democrats to claim that their allegations just happen       to raise the perfect storm of impeachable conduct, as if       their accusations show that ``President Trump has realized       the Framers' worst nightmare.'' \234\ That is preposterous on       its face. The Framers were concerned about the possibility of       treason and the danger that foreign princes with vast       treasuries at their disposal might actually buy off the Chief       Executive of a fledgling, debt-ridden republic situated on       the seaboard of a vast wilderness continent--most of which       was still claimed by European powers eager to advance their       imperial interests. Their worst nightmare was not the       President of the United States-as-superpower having an       innocuous conversation with the leader of a comparatively       small European republic and disclosing the conversation for       all Americans to see.        To peddle their distortion of history, House Democrats       cobble together snippets from the Framers' discussions on       various different subjects and try to portray them as if  [[Page S321]]       they define the contours of impeachable offenses. As       explained above, the Framers intended a limited impeachment       power. But when House Democrats find the Framers raising       concerns about any risks to the new government, they leap to       the conclusion that those concerns must identify impeachable       offenses. Such transparently results-driven historical       analysis is baseless and provides no support for House       Democrats' drive to remove the President.        First, House Democrats mangle history in offering ``foreign       entanglements'' as a type of impeachable offense. Their       approach confuses two different concepts--entangling the       country in alliances and fears of foreign governments buying       influence--to create a false impression that there is       something insidious about anything involving a foreign       connection that should make it a particularly ripe ground for       impeachment.        When the Framers spoke about foreign ``entanglements'' they       had a particular danger in mind. That was the danger of the       young country becoming ensnared in alliances that would       draw it into conflicts between European powers. When       President Washington asserted that ``history and       experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most       baneful foes of republican government,'' he was not       warning about Chief Executives meriting removal from       office.\235\ He was advocating for neutrality in American       foreign policy, and in particular, with respect to       Europe.\236\ One of President Washington's most       controversial decisions was establishing American       neutrality in the escalating war between Great Britain and       revolutionary France.\237\ He then used his Farewell       Address to argue against ``entangl[ing] [American] peace       and prosperity in the toils of European ambition,       rivalship, interest, humor [and] caprice.'' \238\ Again,       he was warning about the United States being drawn into       foreign alliances that would trap the young country in       disputes between European powers. House Democrats' false       allegations here have nothing to do with the danger of a       foreign entanglement as the Founders understood that term,       and the admonitions from the Founding era they cite are       irrelevant.\239\        The Framers were also concerned about the distinct problem       of foreign attempts to interfere in the governance of the       United States.\240\ But on that score, they identified       particular concerns based on historical examples and       addressed them specifically. They were concerned about       officials being bought off by foreign powers. Gouverneur       Morris articulated this concern: ``Our Executive . . . may be       bribed by a greater interest to betray his trust; and no one       would say that we ought to expose ourselves to the danger of       seeing the first Magistrate in foreign pay without being able       to guard [against] it by displacing him.'' \241\ He       specifically mentioned the bribe King Louis XIV of France had       paid to King Charles II of England to influence English       policy.\242\ This is why ``Bribery'' and ``Treason'' were       made impeachable offenses. The Framers also addressed the       danger of foreign inducements directed at the President by       barring his acceptance of ``any present, Emolument, Office,       or Title'' in the Foreign Emoluments Clause.\243\ House       Democrats' Articles of Impeachment make no allegations under       any of these specific offenses identified in the       Constitution.        In the end, House Democrats' ahistorical arguments rest on       a non sequitur. They essentially argue that because the       Framers showed concern about the Nation being betrayed in       these specific provisions, any accusations that relate to       foreign influence must equally amount to impeachable conduct.       That simply does not follow. To the contrary, since the       Framers made specific provisions for the types of foreign       interference they feared, there is no reason to think that       the Impeachment Clause must be stretched and contorted to       reach other conduct simply because it has to do with       something foreign. The Framers' approach to treason, in       particular, suggests that House Democrats' logic is wrong.       The Framers defined treason in the Constitution to limit       it.\244\ Nothing about their concern for limiting treason       suggests that a general concern about foreign betrayal should       be used as a ratchet to expand the scope of the Impeachment       Clause and make it infinitely malleable so that all charges       cast in the vague language of ``foreign entanglements''       should automatically state impeachable conduct.        Second, House Democrats point to the Founders' concerns       that a President might bribe electors to stay in office.\245\       But that specific concern does not mean, as they claim, that       anything to do with an election was a central concern of       impeachment and that impeachment is the tool the Framers       created to deal with it. The historical evidence shows the       Framers had a specific concern with presidential candidates       bribing members of the Electoral College.\246\ That concern       was addressed by the clear terms of the Constitution, which       made ``Bribery'' a basis for impeachment.\247\ Nothing in       House Democrats' sources suggests that simply because one       grave form of corruption related to elections became a basis       for impeachment, then any accusations of any sort related to       elections necessarily must fall within the ambit of       impeachable conduct. That is simply an invention of the House       Democrats.   B. House Democrats' Charge of ``Obstruction'' Fails Because Invoking      Constitutionally Based Privileges and Immunities to Protect the             Separation of Powers Is Not an Impeachable Offense         House Democrats' charge of ``obstruction'' is both       frivolous and dangerous. At the outset, the very suggestion       that President Trump has somehow ``obstructed'' Congress is       preposterous. The President has been extraordinarily       transparent about his interactions with President Zelensky.       Immediately after questions arose, President Trump took the       unprecedented step of declassifying and releasing the full       record of his July 25 telephone call, and he later released       the transcript of an April 21, 2019 call as well. It is well       settled that the President has a virtually absolute right to       maintain the confidentiality of his diplomatic communications       with foreign leaders.\248\ And keeping such communications       confidential is essential for the effective conduct of       diplomacy, because it ensures that foreign leaders will be       willing to talk candidly with the President. Nevertheless,       after weighing such concerns, the President determined that       complete transparency was important in this case, and he       released both call records so that the American people could       judge for themselves exactly what he said to the President of       Ukraine. That should have put an end to this inquiry before       it began. The President was not ``obstructing'' when he       freely released the central piece of evidence in this case.        The President also was not ``obstructing'' when he rightly       decided to defend established Executive Branch       confidentiality interests, rooted in the separation of       powers, against unauthorized efforts to rummage through       Executive Branch files and to demand testimony from some of       the President's closest advisers. As the Supreme Court has       explained, the privilege protecting the confidentiality of       presidential communications ``is fundamental to the operation       of Government and inextricably rooted in the separation of       powers under the Constitution.'' \249\ For future occupants       of the Office of President, it was essential for the       President, like past occupants of the Office, to protect       Executive Branch confidentiality against House Democrats'       overreaching intrusions.        The President's proper concern for requiring the House to       proceed by lawful measures and for protecting long-settled       Executive Branch confidentiality interests cannot be twisted       into an impeachable offense. To the contrary, House       Democrats' charge of ``obstruction'' comes nowhere close to       the constitutional standard. It does not charge any violation       of established law. More important, it is based on the       fundamentally mistaken premise that the President can be       removed from office for invoking established legal defenses       and immunities against defective subpoenas from House       committees.        The President does not commit ``obstruction'' by asserting       legal rights and privileges.\250\ And House Democrats turn       the law on its head with their unprecedented claim that it is       ``obstruction'' for anyone to assert rights that might       require the House to try to establish the validity of its       subpoenas in court.\251\ House Democrats' radical theories       are especially misplaced where, as here, the legal principles       invoked by the President and other Administration officials       are critical for preserving the separation of powers--and       based on advice from the Department of Justice's Office of       Legal Counsel.        Treating a disagreement regarding constitutional limits on       the House's authority to compel documents or testimony as an       impeachable offense would do permanent damage to the       Constitution's separation of powers and our structure of       government. It would allow the House of Representatives to       declare itself supreme and turn any disagreement with the       Executive over informational demands into a purported basis       for removing the President from office. As Professor Turley       has explained, ``Basing impeachment on this obstruction       theory would itself be an abuse of power . . . by Congress''       \252\  1. President Trump acted properly--and upon advice from the Department   of Justice--by asserting established legal defenses and immunities to   resist legally defective demands for information from House committees         House Democrats' purported ``obstruction'' charge is based       on three actions by the President or Executive Branch       officials acting under his authority, each of which was       entirely proper and taken only after securing advice from       OLC.  (a) Administration officials properly refused to comply with subpoenas                  that lacked authorization from the House         It was entirely proper for Administration officials to       decline to comply with subpoenas issued pursuant to a       purported ``impeachment inquiry'' before the House of       Representatives had authorized any such inquiry. No House       committee can issue subpoenas pursuant to the House's       impeachment power without authorization from the House       itself. On precisely that basis, OLC determined that all       subpoenas issued before the adoption of House Resolution 660       on October 31, 2019, purportedly to advance an ``impeachment       inquiry,'' were unauthorized and invalid.\253\ Numerous       witness subpoenas and all of the document subpoenas cited in       Article II are invalid for this reason alone. These invalid       subpoenas imposed no legal obligation on the recipients, and       it was entirely lawful for the recipients not to comply with       them.\254\ The belated adoption of House Resolution 660 on       October 31 to authorize the inquiry essentially conceded that       a vote was required and did nothing to remedy the inquiry's       invalid beginnings.  [[Page S322]]         (i) A delegation of authority from the House is required before any        committee can investigate pursuant to the impeachment power         No committee can exercise authority assigned by the       Constitution to the House absent a clear delegation of       authority from the House itself.\255\ The Constitution       assigns the ``sole Power of Impeachment'' \256\ to the House       as a chamber--not to individual Members or subordinate units.       Assessing the validity of a committee's inquiry and subpoenas       thus requires ``constru[ing] the scope of the authority which       the House of Representatives gave to'' the committee.\257\       Where a committee cannot demonstrate that its inquiries have       been authorized by an affirmative vote of the House assigning       the committee authority, the committee's actions are ultra       vires, and its subpoenas have no force.\258\        To pursue an ``impeachment inquiry,'' and to compel       testimony and the production of documents for such an       inquiry, the committee must be authorized to conduct an       inquiry pursuant to the House's impeachment power. That power       is distinct from the power to legislate assigned to Congress       in Article I, Section 1. Congress's power to investigate in       support of its power to legislate is limited to inquiring       into topics ``on which legislation could be had.'' \259\ An       impeachment inquiry is not subject to the same constraint. An       impeachment inquiry does not aid Congress in considering       legislation, but instead requires reconstructing past events       to examine the conduct of specific persons. That differs from       the forward-looking nature of any legislative       investigation.\260\ Given these differences, a committee       seeking to investigate pursuant to the impeachment power must       show that the House has actually authorized the committee to       use that specific power.        The Speaker of the House cannot treat the House's       constitutional power as her own to distribute to committees       based on nothing more than her own say-so. That would       exacerbate the danger of a minority faction invoking the       power of impeachment to launch disruptive inquiries without       any constitutional legitimacy from a majority vote in the       House. It would also permit a minority to seize the House's       formidable investigative powers to pursue divisive       investigations for partisan purposes that a House majority       might not be willing to authorize. House Democrats have not       identified any credible support for their theory of       authorization by press conference.\261\  (ii) Nothing in existing House rules authorized any committee to pursue                           an impeachment inquiry         Nothing in the House Rules adopted at the beginning of this       Congress delegated authority to pursue an impeachment inquiry       to any committee. In particular, Rule X, which defines each       committee's jurisdiction, makes clear that it addresses only       committees' ``legislative jurisdiction''--not       impeachment.\262\ Rule X does not assign any committee any       authority whatsoever with respect to impeachment. It does not       even mention impeachment. And that silence is not accidental.       Rule X devotes more than 2,000 words to describing the       committees' areas of jurisdiction in detail. The six       committees that Speaker Pelosi instructed to take part in the       purported impeachment inquiry here have their jurisdiction       defined down to the most obscure legislative issues, ranging       from the Judiciary Committee's jurisdiction over ``[s]tate       and territorial boundary lines'' \263\ to the Oversight       Committee's responsibility for ``[h]olidays and       celebrations.'' \264\ But Rule X does not assign any       committee authority regarding impeachment. Neither does Rule       XI's grant of specific investigative powers, such as the       power to hold hearings and to issue subpoenas. Each       committee's specific investigative powers under Rule XI are       restricted to Rule X's jurisdictional limits \265\--which do       not include impeachment.\266\        Rule X's history confirms that the absence of any reference       to ``impeachment'' was deliberate. When the House considered       a number of proposals between 1973 and 1974 to transfer power       from the House to committees and to remake committee       jurisdiction, the House specifically rejected an initial       proposal that would have added ``impeachments'' to the       Judiciary Committee's jurisdiction.\267\ Instead, the House       amended the rules to provide standing authorization for       committees to use investigatory powers only pursuant to their       legislative jurisdiction \268\ (previously, for example, a       separate House vote was required to delegate subpoena       authority to a particular committee for a particular       topic).\269\ Thus, after these amended rules were adopted,       committees were able to begin investigations within their       legislative jurisdiction and issue subpoenas without securing       House approval, but that resolution did not authorize self-      initiated impeachment inquiries. Indeed, it was precisely       because ``impeachment was not specifically included within       the jurisdiction of the House Judiciary Committee'' that       then-Chairman Peter Rodino announced that the ``Committee on       the Judiciary will have to seek subpoena power from the       House'' for the Nixon impeachment inquiry.\270\ The House       majority, minority, and Parliamentarian, as well as the       Department of Justice, all agreed on this point.\271\  (iii) More than 200 years of precedent confirm that the House must vote                      to begin an impeachment inquiry         Historical practice confirms the need for a House vote to       launch an impeachment inquiry. Since the Founding of the       Republic, the House has never undertaken the solemn       responsibility of a presidential impeachment inquiry without       first authorizing a particular committee to begin the       inquiry. That has also been the House's nearly unbroken       practice for every judicial impeachment for two hundred       years.        In every prior presidential impeachment inquiry, the House       adopted a resolution explicitly authorizing the committee to       conduct the investigation before any compulsory process was       used.\272\ In President Clinton's impeachment, the House       Judiciary Committee explained that the resolution was a       constitutional requirement ``[b]ecause impeachment is       delegated solely to the House of Representatives by the       Constitution'' and thus ``the full House of Representatives       should be involved in critical decision making regarding       various stages of impeachment.'' \273\ As the Judiciary       Committee Chairman explained during President Nixon's       impeachment, an ``authoriz[ation] . . . resolution has always       been passed by the House'' for an impeachment inquiry and       ``is a necessary step.'' \274\ Thus, he recognized that,       without authorization from the House, ``the committee's       subpoena power [did] not now extend to impeachment.'' \275\       Indeed, with respect to impeachments of judges or lesser       officers in the Executive Branch, the requirement that the       full House pass a resolution authorizing an impeachment       inquiry traces back to the first impeachments under the       Constitution.\276\        That historical practice has continued into the modern era,       in which there have been only three impeachments that did not       begin with a House resolution authorizing an inquiry. Each of       those three outliers involved impeachment of a lower court       judge during a short interlude in the 1980s.\277\ Those       outliers provide no precedent for a presidential impeachment.       To paraphrase the Supreme Court, ``when considered against       200 years of settled practice, we regard these few scattered       examples as anomalies.'' \278\ In addition, as explained       above,\279\ ``[t]he impeachment of a federal judge does not       provide the same weighty considerations as the impeachment of       a president.'' \280\ Setting aside these three outliers,       precedent shows that a House vote is required to initiate an       impeachment inquiry for judges and subordinate executive       officials. At least the same level of process must be used to       begin the far more serious process of inquiring into       impeachment of the President.  (iv) The Subpoenas Issued Before House Resolution 660 Were Invalid and         Remain Invalid Because the Resolution Did Not Ratify Them         The impeachment inquiry was unauthorized and all the       subpoenas issued by House committees in pursuit of the       inquiry were therefore invalid. OLC reached the same       conclusion.\281\ The vast bulk of the proceedings in the       House were thus founded on the use of unlawful process to       compel testimony. Until now, House Democrats have       consistently agreed that a vote by the House is required to       authorize an impeachment inquiry. In 2016, House Democrats on       the Judiciary Committee agreed that ``[i]n the modern era,       the impeachment process begins in the House of       Representatives only after the House has voted to authorize       the Judiciary Committee to investigate whether charges are       warranted.'' \282\ As current Judiciary Committee member Rep.       Hank Johnson said in 2016, ``[t]he impeachment process cannot       begin until the 435 Members of the House of Representatives       adopt a resolution authorizing the House Judiciary Committee       to conduct an independent investigation.'' \283\ As Chairman       Nadler put it, an impeachment inquiry without a House vote is       ``an obvious sham'' and a ``fake impeachment,'' \284\ or as       House Manager Rep. Hakeem Jeffries explained, it is ``a       political charade,'' ``a sham,'' and ``a Hollywood-style       production.'' \285\        These invalid subpoenas remain invalid today. House       Resolution 660 merely directed the six investigating       committees to ``continue their ongoing investigations'' \286\       and did not even purport to ratify retroactively the nearly       two dozen invalid subpoenas issued before it was       adopted,\287\ as OLC has explained.\288\ The House knows how       to use language effectuating ratification when it wants to--      indeed, it used such language less than six months ago in a       resolution that ``ratifie[d] . . . all subpoenas previously       issued'' by a committee.\289\ The omission of anything       similar from House Resolution 660 means that subpoenas issued       before House Resolution 660 remain invalid, and the entire       fact-gathering process pursuant to those subpoenas was ultra       vires.        Contrary to false claims from House Democrats, the       President did not ``declare[] himself above impeachment,''       reject ``any efforts at accommodation or compromise,'' or       declare ``himself and his entire branch of government exempt       from subpoenas issued by the House.'' \290\ The White House       simply made clear that Administration officials should not       participate in House Democrats' inquiry ``under these       circumstances''--meaning a process that was unauthorized       under the House's own rules and suffered from the other       serious defects.\291\ The President's counsel also made it       clear that, if the investigating committees sought to proceed       under their oversight authorities, the White House stood       ``ready to engage in that process as [it] ha[s] in the past,       in a manner consistent with well-established bipartisan       constitutional protections.'' \292\ It was Chairman  [[Page S323]]       Schiff and his colleagues who refused to engage in any       accommodation process with the White House.    (b) The President Properly Asserted Immunity of His Senior Advisers                   From Compelled Congressional Testimony         The President also properly directed his senior advisers       not to testify in response to subpoenas.\293\ Those subpoenas       suffered from a separate infirmity: they were unenforceable       because the President's senior advisers are immune from       compelled testimony before Congress.\294\ Consistent with the       longstanding position of the Executive Branch, OLC advised       the Counsel to the President that those senior advisers (the       Acting Chief of Staff, the Legal Advisor to the National       Security Council, and the Deputy National Security Advisor)       were immune from the subpoenas issued to them.\295\        Across administrations of both political parties, OLC ``has       repeatedly provided for nearly five decades'' that ``Congress       may not constitutionally compel the President's senior       advisers to testify about their official duties.'' \296\ For       example, President Obama asserted the same immunity for a       senior adviser in 2014.\297\ Similarly, during the Clinton       administration, Attorney General Janet Reno opined that       ``immediate advisers'' to the President are immune from being       compelled to testify before Congress, and that the ``the       immunity such advisers enjoy from testimonial compulsion by a       congressional committee is absolute and may not be overborne       by competing congressional interests.'' \298\ She explained       that ``compelling one of the President's immediate advisers       to testify on a matter of executive decision-making would . .       . raise serious constitutional problems, no matter what the       assertion of congressional need.'' \299\        This immunity exists because senior advisers ``function as       the President's alter ego.'' \300\ Allowing Congress to       summon the President's senior advisers would be tantamount to       permitting Congress to subpoena the President, which would be       intolerable under the Constitution: ``Congress may no more       summon the President to a congressional committee room than       the President may command Members of Congress to appear at       the White House.'' \301\        In addition, immunity is essential to protect the       President's ability to secure candid and confidential advice       and have frank discussions with his advisers. It thus serves,       in part, to protect the same interests that underlie       Executive Privilege.\302\ As the Supreme Court has explained,       the protections for confidentiality embodied in the doctrine       of Executive Privilege are ``fundamental to the operation of       Government and inextricably rooted in the separation of       powers under the Constitution.'' \303\ The subpoenas issued       to the President's senior advisers in this inquiry       necessarily implicated three core areas of Executive       Privilege--presidential communications, national security and       foreign policy information, and deliberative process.        First, one of the House Democrats' obvious objectives was       to find out about presidential communications. The document       subpoena sent to Acting White House Chief of Staff Mulvaney,       for instance, sought materials reflecting the President's       discussions with advisers,\304\ and Chairman Schiff's report       specifically identified documents that House Democrats       sought, including ``briefing materials for President Trump,''       a ``presidential decision memo,'' and presidential call       records.\305\        Courts have long recognized constitutional limits on       Congress's ability to obtain presidential communications. As       the Supreme Court has explained, executive decisionmaking       requires the candid exchange of ideas, and ``[h]uman       experience teaches that those who expect public dissemination       of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for       appearances and for their own interests to the detriment of       the decisionmaking process.'' \306\ Protecting the       confidentiality of communications ensures the President's       ability to receive candid advice.\307\        Second, there can be no dispute that the matters at issue       here implicate national security and foreign policy. As       Deputy National Security Adviser Kupperman has explained,       House Democrats were ``seeking testimony relating to       confidential national security communications concerning       Ukraine.'' \308\ But OLC has established that ``immunity is       particularly justified'' where a senior official's ``duties       concern national security'' or ``relations with a foreign       government'' \309\--subject areas where the President's       authority is at its zenith under the Constitution.\310\ As       the Supreme Court explained in United States v. Nixon, the       ``courts have traditionally shown the utmost deference to       Presidential responsibilities'' for foreign policy and       national security, and claims of privilege in this area thus       receive a higher degree of deference than invocations of ``a       President's generalized interest in confidentiality.'' \311\        The House's inquiry involved communications with a foreign       leader and the development of foreign policy toward a foreign       country. There are few areas where the President's powers       under the Constitution are greater and his obligation to       protect internal Executive Branch deliberations more       profound.        Third, House Democrats were seeking deliberative process       information. For instance, the committees requested White       House documents reflecting internal deliberations about       foreign aid, the delegation to President Zelensky's       inauguration, and potential meetings with foreign       leaders.\312\ Courts have long recognized that the       ``deliberative process privilege'' applies across the       Executive Branch and protects ``materials that would reveal       advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations       comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions       and policies are formulated.'' \313\ The privilege prevents       ``injury to the quality of agency decisions by allowing       government officials freedom to debate alternative approaches       in private,'' \314\ and the privilege has been consistently       recognized by administrations of both political parties.\315\     (c) Administration officials properly instructed employees not to     testify before committees that improperly excluded agency counsel         Subpoenas for testimony from other Executive Branch       officials suffered from a distinct flaw. They impermissibly       demanded that officials testify without agency counsel       present.\316\ OLC has determined that congressional       committees ``may not bar agency counsel from assisting an       executive branch witness without contravening the legitimate       prerogatives of the Executive Branch,'' and that attempting       to enforce a subpoena while barring agency counsel ``would be       unconstitutional.'' \317\ As OLC explained, that principle       applies in the context of the House's purported impeachment       inquiry just as it applies in more routine congressional       oversight requests.\318\        The requirement for congressional committees to permit       agency counsel to attend depositions of Executive Branch       officials is firmly grounded in the President's       constitutional authorities ``to protect privileged       information from disclosure'' and to ``control the activities       of subordinate officials within the Executive Branch.'' \319\       As OLC has explained, without the assistance of agency       counsel, an Executive Branch employee might not be able to       determine when a question invaded a privileged area.\320\ It       is the vital role of agency counsel to ensure that       constitutionally based confidentiality interests are       protected. Congressional rules do not override these       constitutional principles, and there is no legitimate reason       for House Democrats to seek to deprive these officials of the       assistance of appropriate counsel.\321\        The important role of agency counsel in congressional       inquiries has been recognized by administrations of both       political parties. During the Obama Administration, for       instance, OLC stated that exclusion of agency counsel ``could       potentially undermine the Executive Branch's ability to       protect its confidentiality interests in the course of the       constitutionally mandated accommodation process, as well as       the President's constitutional authority to consider and       assert executive privilege where appropriate.'' \322\        Requiring agency counsel to be present when Executive       Branch employees testify does not raise any insurmountable       problems for congressional information gathering. To the       contrary, as recently as April 2019, the House Committee on       Oversight and Government Reform and the Trump Administration       were able to work out an accommodation that satisfied both an       information request and the need to have agency counsel       present for an interview. In that case, after initially       threatening contempt proceedings over a dispute, the late       Chairman Elijah Cummings allowed White House attorneys to       attend a transcribed interview of the former Director of the       White House Personnel Security Office.\323\ House Democrats       could have eliminated a significant legal defect in their       subpoenas simply by following Chairman Cummings' example.       They did not take this step, so the Administration properly       accepted the advice of OLC that House Democrats' actions were       unconstitutional and directed witnesses not to appear without       agency counsel present.        2. Asserting legal defenses and immunities grounded in the     constitution's separation of powers is not an impeachable offense         House Democrats' theory that it is ``obstruction'' for the       President to assert legal rights--especially rights and       immunities grounded in the separation of powers--turns the       law on its head and would do permanent damage to the       structure of our government.    (a) Asserting Legal Defenses and Privileges Is Not ``Obstruction.''         Under fundamental principles of our legal system, asserting       legal defenses cannot be labeled unlawful ``obstruction.'' In       a government of laws, asserting legal defenses is a       fundamental right. As the Supreme Court has explained:       ``[F]or an agent of the State to pursue a course of action       whose objective is to penalize a person's reliance on his       legal rights is `patently unconstitutional.' '' \324\ As       Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe correctly explained in       1998, the same basic principles apply in impeachment:        The allegations that invoking privileges and otherwise       using the judicial system to shield information . . . is an       abuse of power that should lead to impeachment and removal       from office is not only frivolous, but also dangerous.\325\        Similarly, in 1998, now-Chairman Nadler of the House       Judiciary Committee agreed that a president cannot be       impeached for asserting a legal privilege. As he put it,       ``the use of a legal privilege is not illegal or impeachable       by itself, a legal privilege, executive privilege.'' \326\        House Democrats, however, ran roughshod over these       principles. They repeatedly threatened Executive Branch       officials with obstruction charges if the officials dared to  [[Page S324]]       assert legal rights against defective subpoenas. They claimed       that any ``failure or refusal to comply with [a] subpoena,       including at the direction or behest of the President or       others at the White House, shall constitute evidence of       obstruction.'' \327\ Even worse, Chairman Schiff made the       remarkable claim that any action ``that forces us to       litigate or have to consider litigation, will be       considered further evidence of obstruction of justice.''       \328\ Those assertions turn core principles of the law       inside out.   (b) House Democrats' Radical Theory of ``Obstruction'' Would Do Grave                     Damage to the Separation of Powers         More important, in the context of House demands for       information from the Executive Branch, House Democrats'       radical theory that asserting legal privileges should be       treated immediately as impeachable ``obstruction'' would do       lasting damage to the separation of powers.        The Legislative and Executive Branches have frequently       clashed on questions of constitutional interpretation,       including on issues surrounding congressional demands for       information, since the very first presidential       administration.\329\ Such interbranch conflicts are not       evidence of an impeachable offense. To the contrary, they are       part of the constitutional design. The Founders anticipated       that the branches might have differing interpretations of the       Constitution and might come into conflict. As Madison       explained, ``the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial       departments . . . must, in the exercise of its functions, be       guided by the text of the Constitution according to its own       interpretation of it.'' \330\ Friction between the branches       on such points is part of the separation of powers at       work.\331\        When the Legislative and Executive Branches disagree about       their constitutional duties with respect to sharing       information, the proper and historically accepted solution is       not an article of impeachment. Instead, it is for the       branches to engage in a constitutionally mandated       accommodation process in an effort to resolve the       disagreement.\332\ As courts have explained, this       ``[n]egotiation between the two branches'' is ``a dynamic       process affirmatively furthering the constitutional scheme.''       \333\        Where the accommodation process fails, Congress has other       tools at its disposal to address a disagreement with the       Executive. Historically, the House has held Executive Branch       officials in contempt.\334\ The process of holding a formal       vote of the House on a contempt resolution ensures that the       House itself examines the subpoena in question and weighs in       on launching a full-blown confrontation with the Executive       Branch.\335\ In addition, in recent times, the House of       Representatives has taken the view that it may sue in court       to obtain a judicial determination of the validity of its       subpoenas and an injunction to enforce them.\336\        In this case, if House Democrats had actually been       interested in securing information (rather than merely adding       a phony count to their impeachment charge sheet), the proper       course would have been to engage with the Administration in       one or more of these mechanisms for resolving the interbranch       conflict.\337\ House Democrats rejected any effort to pursue       any of these avenues. Instead, they simply announced that       constitutional accommodation, contempt, and litigation were       all too inconvenient for their politically driven timetable       and that they must impeach the President immediately.\338\        Permitting that approach and treating the President's       response to the subpoenas as an impeachable offense would do       grave damage to the separation of powers. Suggesting that       every congressional demand for information must automatically       be obeyed on pain of impeachment would undermine the       foundational premise that the Legislative and Executive       Branches are coequal branches of the government, neither of       which is subservient to the other. As Madison explained,       where the Executive and the Legislative Branches come into       conflict ``neither of them, it is evident, can pretend to an       exclusive or superior right of settling the boundaries       between their respective powers.'' \339\ That is why the       courts have insisted on an accommodations process by which       the two branches work to reach a compromise in which the       interest of each branch is addressed.\340\ House Democrats,       by contrast, have declared the House supreme not only over       the Executive Branch, but also over the Judicial Branch, by       baldly proclaiming that, whenever a committee chairman       invokes the possibility of impeachment, the House itself is       the sole judge of its own powers, because (in their view)       ``the Constitution gives the House the final word.'' \341\        House Democrats' theory is unprecedented and dangerous for       our structure of government. There is no reason to believe       that the House, acting as judge in its own case, will       properly acknowledge limits on its own powers. That is       evident from numerous cases in which courts have refused to       enforce congressional subpoenas because they are invalid or       overbroad.\342\ More important, the House Democrats' theory       means that the House could dangle the threat of impeachment       over every congressional demand for information. Trivializing       impeachment in this manner would functionally transform our       government into precisely the type of parliamentary system       the Framers rejected.        In his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee,       Professor Turley rightly pointed out that, by ``claiming       Congress can demand any testimony or documents and then       impeach any president who dares to go to the courts,'' House       Democrats were advancing a position that was ``entirely       untenable and abusive [of] an impeachment.'' \343\ Other       scholars agree. In the Clinton impeachment, for example,       Professor Susan Low Bloch testified that ``impeaching a       president for invoking lawful privileges is a dangerous and       ominous precedent.'' \344\        In the past, the House itself has agreed and has recognized       that a President cannot be impeached for asserting a       privilege. For example, the House Judiciary Committee       rejected as a ground for impeachment the allegation that       President Clinton had ``frivolously and corruptly asserted       executive privilege'' in connection with a criminal       investigation.\345\ Although the Committee believed that       ``the President ha[d] improperly exercised executive       privilege,'' \346\ it nevertheless determined that this was       not an ``impeachable offense[].'' \347\ Similarly, over 175       years ago, the House rejected an attempt to impeach President       Tyler ``for abusing his powers based on his refusals to share       with the House inside details on whom he was considering to       nominate to various confirmable positions and his vetoing of       a wide range of Whig-sponsored legislation.'' \348\        If House Democrats' unprecedented theory of ``obstruction       of Congress'' were correct, virtually every President could       have been impeached. Throughout our history, Presidents have       refused to share information with Congress. For example, when       Congress investigated Operation Fast and Furious during the       last administration, President Obama invoked Executive       Privilege with respect to documents responsive to a       congressional subpoena.\349\ Instead of a rash rush to       impeachment, House Republicans secured a favorable court       ruling on President Obama's assertion of privilege.\350\       President Trump's actions are entirely consistent with such       steps taken by his predecessors. As Professor Turley       explained, ``[i]f this Committee elects to seek impeachment       on the failure to yield to congressional demands in an       oversight or impeachment investigation, it will have to       distinguish a long line of cases where prior presidents       sought . . . [judicial] review while withholding witnesses       and documents.'' \351\        House Democrats fare no better in claiming that President       Trump announced a more ``categorical'' refusal to cooperate       with House demands than any past president.\352\ That claim       misunderstands the law and misrepresents both the President's       conduct and history. On the law, there is nothing       impermissible about asserting rights consistently and       ``categorically.'' There is no requirement for a President to       cede Executive Branch confidentiality interests some of the       time lest he be too ``categorical'' in their defense. On the       facts, the President did not issue a categorical refusal. As       noted above, the Counsel to the President made clear to House       Democrats that, if they sought to pursue regular oversight,       the Administration would ``stand ready to engage in that       process as we have in the past, in a manner consistent with       well-established bipartisan constitutional protections.''       \353\ It was House Democrats who refused to engage in the       accommodation process. And as for history, past Presidents--      such as Presidents Truman, Coolidge, and Jackson--did       announce categorical refusals to cooperate at all with       congressional inquiries.\354\ None was impeached as a result.        Contrary to House Democrats' assertions, it also makes no       difference that the subpoenas here were purportedly issued as       part of an impeachment inquiry.\355\ The defenses and       immunities the President has asserted are grounded in the       separation of powers and protect confidentiality interests       that are vital for the functioning of the Executive Branch.       Those defenses and immunities do not disappear the instant       the House opens an impeachment inquiry. Just as with the       judicial need for evidence in a criminal trial, the House's       interest in investigating does not mean Executive Privilege       goes away; instead, ``it is necessary to resolve those       competing interests in a manner that preserves the essential       functions of each branch.'' \356\ If anything, the       interbranch conflict inherent in an impeachment inquiry       heightens the need for scrupulous adherence to principles       preserving each branch's mechanisms for protecting its own       legitimate sphere of authority.        House Democrats' insistence that the Constitution assigns       the House the ``sole Power of Impeachment'' \357\ does       nothing to advance their argument. That provision simply       makes clear that the power of impeachment is assigned to the       House and not anywhere else. It does not make the power of       impeachment a paramount authority that sweeps away the       constitutionally based privileges of other branches.\358\ The       fundamental Madisonian principle that each branch must place       checks on the others--that ``[a]mbition must be made to       counteract ambition''--continues to apply even when the House       invokes the power of impeachment.\359\ The mere fact that       impeachment provides an ultimate check on the Executive does       not mean the Framers made it a blank check for the House to       expand its power without limit.        OLC has determined that Executive Privilege principles       continue to apply in an impeachment inquiry.\360\ And       scholars agree that Presidents may assert privileges in       response to demands for information in an impeachment       inquiry, as Executive Privilege is ``essential to the . . .       dignified conduct of the presidency and to the free flow of       candid advice to the President.'' \361\        None of the excuses House Democrats have offered justifies       their unprecedented leap to  [[Page S325]]       impeachment while bypassing any effort either to seek       constitutionally mandated accommodations or to go to court.       Their claim that there was no time is no justification.\362\       As Professor Turley has explained, ``[t]he decision to adopt       an abbreviated schedule for the investigation and not to seek       to compel such testimony [in court] is a strategic choice of       the House leadership. It is not the grounds for an       impeachment.'' \363\ Nor is their claim about urgency       credible. The only constraint on timing here came from House       Democrats' self-imposed deadline to ensure that this       impeachment charade would not drag on into the Democratic       primary season. They also showed no urgency when they waited       four weeks to send the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate.       If House Democrats had cared about constitutional precedent,       they would have adhered to the ordinary timetable for       something as momentous as a presidential impeachment and       would have taken the time to work out disputes with the       Executive Branch on subpoenas. House Democrats arbitrarily       decided to skip that step.        Next, Democrats falsely claim that that ``the House has       never before relied on litigation to compel witness testimony       or the production of documents in a Presidential impeachment       proceeding.'' \364\ But the House has filed such lawsuits,       including just last year. In one case, the House made a court       filing asserting that its impeachment inquiry entitled it to       certain grand jury information on the same day the House       Judiciary Committee issued its report.\365\ And in another       case purportedly based on an impeachment inquiry, House       Democrats recently argued that, when at an impasse, disputes       with the Executive Branch can ``only be resolved by the       courts.'' \366\ These filings are flatly inconsistent with       House Democrats' position here, where they claim that any       impasse should lead to impeachment.        Lastly, House Democrats also find no support for their       theory of ``obstruction'' in the Clinton and Nixon       impeachment proceedings.\367\ To the contrary, the Clinton       proceedings establish conclusively that there is no plausible       basis for an article of impeachment based on the assertion of       rights and privileges. In 1997 and 1998, there had been       numerous court rulings rejecting various assertions of       Executive Privilege by President Clinton.\368\ The House       Judiciary Committee concluded that Clinton's assertions of       Executive Privilege were frivolous, especially because they       related to ``purely private'' matters--not official       actions.\369\ Nevertheless, the Committee decided that the       assertions of privilege did not constitute an ``impeachable       offense[].'' \370\        Nothing from the Nixon impeachment proceedings supports       House Democrats either. The record there included evidence       that, as part of efforts to cover up the Watergate break-in,       the President had (among other things): provided information       from the Department of Justice to subjects of criminal       investigations to help them evade justice; used the FBI,       Secret Service, and Executive Branch personnel to conduct       illegal electronic surveillance; and illegally attempted to       secure access to tax return information in order to influence       individuals.\371\ Moreover, the Committee had transcripts of       tapes on which the President discussed asserting privileges,       not to protect governmental decision making, but solely to       stymie the investigation into the break-in.\372\ It was only       in that context that the House Judiciary Committee narrowly       recommended an article of impeachment asserting that       President Nixon had ``failed without lawful cause or excuse       to produce papers and things'' sought by Congress.\373\ There       is nothing remotely comparable in this case. Among other       things, every step the Trump Administration has taken has       been well-founded in law and supported by the opinion of the       Department of Justice. Moreover, the subpoenas here attempted       to probe into matters involving the conduct of foreign       relations--matters squarely at the core of Executive       Privilege where the President's powers and need to preserve       confidentiality are at their apex.   (c) The President cannot be removed from office based on a difference                              in legal opinion         House Democrats' reckless ``obstruction'' theory is further       flawed because it asks the Senate to remove a duly elected       President from office based on differences of legal opinion       in which the President acted on the advice of OLC. As       explained above, the Framers restricted impeachment to remedy       solely egregious conduct that endangers the constitutional       structure of government. No matter how House Democrats try to       dress up their claim, a difference of legal opinion over an       assertion of grounds to resist subpoenas does not rise to       that level. The Framers themselves recognized that       differences of opinion could not justify impeachment. As       Edmund Randolph explained in the Virginia ratifying       convention, ``[n]o man ever thought of impeaching a man for       an opinion.'' \374\        Until now, that principle has prevailed, as the House has       expressly rejected attempts to impeach presidents based on       legal disputes over assertions of privilege. As noted above,       in the Clinton impeachment, the House Judiciary Committee       rejected a draft article alleging that President Clinton had       ``frivolously and corruptly asserted executive privilege.''       \375\ Even though the Committee concluded that ``the       President ha[d] improperly exercised executive privilege,''       \376\ it decided that this was not an ``impeachable       offense[].'' \377\ The Committee concluded it did not have       ``the ability to second guess the rationale behind the       President or what was in his mind in asserting that executive       privilege'' and it ``ought to give . . . the benefit of the       doubt [to the President] in the assertion of executive       privilege.'' \378\ As the Committee recognized, members of       Congress need not agree that a President's assertion of a       privilege or immunity is correct to recognize that making the       assertion of legal privileges itself an impeachable offense       is a dangerous and unwarranted step.        The House took a similar view in rejecting an attempt to       impeach President Tyler in 1843 when he refused congressional       demands for information. As Professor Gerhardt has explained:        Tyler's attempts to protect and assert what he regarded as       the prerogatives of his office were a function of his       constitutional and policy judgments; they might have been       wrong-headed or even poorly conceived (at least in the view       of many Whigs in Congress), but they were not malicious       efforts to abuse or expand his powers. . . .\379\        President Trump's resistance to congressional subpoenas       here was similarly ``a function of his constitutional and       policy judgments.'' As the House recognized in the cases of       President Tyler and President Clinton, divergent views on       such matters cannot possibly be sufficient to remove a duly       elected president from office. And that is especially the       case here, where President Trump's actions were expressly       based on advice from the Department of Justice.      II. The Articles Resulted from an Impeachment Inquiry that           Violated All Precedent and Denied the President           Constitutionally Required Due Process.        Three defects make the House's purported impeachment       inquiry irredeemably flawed. First, as the Department of       Justice advised at the time, the House's investigating       committees compelled testimony and documents by issuing       subpoenas that were invalid when issued and are invalid       today. See Parts I.B.1(a), II.A. Second, the impeachment       inquiry failed to provide due process to the President as       required by the Constitution. See Part II.B. Contrary to       150 years of precedent, the House excluded the President       from the process, denying him any right to participate or       defend himself. House Democrats only pretended to provide       the President any rights after the entire factual record       had been compiled in ex parte hearings and after Speaker       Pelosi had predetermined the result by instructing the       Judiciary Committee to draft articles of impeachment.       Third, the House's factual investigation was supervised by       an interested fact witness, Chairman Schiff, who--after       falsely denying it--admitted that his staff had been in       contact with the whistleblower and had given him guidance.       See Part II.C. These three fundamental errors infected the       underpinnings of this trial, and the Senate cannot       constitutionally rely upon House Democrats' tainted record       to reach any verdict other than acquittal. See Part II.D.       Nor is it the Senate's role to give House Democrats a       ``do-over'' to develop the record anew in the Senate.       These errors require rejecting the Articles and acquitting       the President.  A. The Purported Impeachment Inquiry Was Unauthorized at the Outset and      Compelled Testimony Based on Nearly Two Dozen Invalid Subpoenas         It is emblematic of the rush to judgment throughout the       House's slap-dash impeachment inquiry that Chairman Schiff's       investigating committees began issuing subpoenas and       compelling testimony when they plainly had no authority to do       so. The House committees built their one-sided record by       purporting to compel testimony and documents using nearly two       dozen subpoenas ``[p]ursuant to the House of Representatives'       impeachment inquiry.'' \380\ But their only authority was       Speaker Pelosi's announcement at a press conference on       September 24, 2019. As a result, the inquiry and the almost       two dozen subpoenas issued before October 31, 2019 came       before the House delegated any authority under its ``sole       Power of Impeachment'' to any committee.\381\ As OLC       summarized:        The Constitution vests the ``sole Power of Impeachment'' in       the House of Representatives. U.S. Const. art. I, Sec. 2, cl.       5. For precisely that reason, the House itself must authorize       an impeachment inquiry, as it has done in virtually every       prior impeachment investigation in our Nation's history,       including every one involving a President. A congressional       committee's ``right to exact testimony and to call for the       production of documents'' is limited by the ``controlling       charter'' the committee has received from the House. United       States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41, 44 (1953). Yet the House, by       its rules, has authorized its committees to issue subpoenas       only for matters within their legislative jurisdiction.       Accordingly, no committee may undertake the momentous move       from legislative oversight to impeachment without a       delegation by the full House of such authority.\382\        Thus, as explained above, all subpoenas issued before the       adoption of House Resolution 660 on October 31, 2019,       purportedly to advance an ``impeachment inquiry,'' were       unauthorized and invalid.   B. House Democrats' Impeachment Inquiry Deprived the President of the          Fundamentally Fair Process Required by the Constitution         The next glaring defect in House Democrats' impeachment       proceedings was the wholly unfair procedures used to conduct       the  [[Page S326]]       inquiry and compile the record. The Constitution requires       that something as momentous as impeaching the President be       done in a fundamentally fair way. Both the Due Process Clause       and separation of powers principles require the House to       provide the President with fair process and an opportunity to       defend himself. Every modern presidential impeachment       inquiry--and every impeachment investigation for the last 150       years--has expressly preserved the accused's rights to a       fundamentally fair process and ensured a balanced development       of the evidence. These included the rights to cross-examine       witnesses, to call witnesses, to be represented by counsel at       all hearings, to make objections relating to the examination       of witnesses or the admissibility of evidence, and to respond       to evidence and testimony received. There is no reason to       think that the Framers designed a mechanism for the       profoundly disruptive act of impeaching the President that       could be accomplished through any unfair and arbitrary means       that the House might invent.\383\    1. The Text and Structure of the Constitution Demand that the House       Ensure Fundamentally Fair Procedures in an Impeachment Inquiry              (a) The Due Process Clause Requires Fair Process         The federal Due Process Clause broadly states that ``[n]o       person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property,       without due process of law'' \384\ and applies to every part       of the federal government. In any proceeding that may lead to       deprivation of a protected interest, it requires fair       procedures commensurate with the interests at stake.\385\       There is no exemption from the clause for Congress. Thus, for       example, the Supreme Court has held that due process       protections apply to congressional investigations and provide       witnesses in such investigations certain rights.\386\       Congress's ``power to investigate, broad as it may be, is       also subject to recognized limitations''--including those       ``found in the specific individual guarantees of the Bill of       Rights.'' \387\ It would be anomalous if the Due Process       Clause applied to investigations conducted under Congress's       legislative power--which aim merely to gather information for       legislation--but somehow did not apply to impeachment       investigations aimed at stripping individuals of their       government positions. An impeachment investigation against       the President potentially seeks to charge the President with       ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,''       \388\ and to strip the President of both (1) his       constitutionally granted right to ``hold his Office during       the Term of Four years,'' \389\ and (2) his eligibility to       ``hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under       the United States,'' \390\ including to be re-elected as       President.\391\        Those actions plainly involve deprivations of property and       liberty interests protected by the Due Process Clause.\392\       As a threshold matter, it is settled law that even the lowest       level ``public employees who can be discharged only for cause       have a constitutionally protected property interest in their       tenure and cannot be fired without due process.'' \393\       Nothing in the Constitution suggests that the impeachment       process for addressing charges crossing the extraordinarily       high threshold of ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes       and Misdemeanors'' \394\ should involve less fair process       than what the Constitution requires for every lower-level       federal employee. The Constitution also explicitly gives the       President (and every individual) a protected liberty interest       in eligibility for election to the Office of President--so       long as the individual meets the qualifications       established by the Constitution.\395\ Finally, every       federal officer has a protected liberty interest in his       reputation that would be directly impaired by impeachment       charges.\396\ Impeachment by the House alone has an impact       warranting the protections of due process.\397\ The       House's efforts to deprive the President of these       constitutionally protected property and liberty interests       necessarily implicate the Due Process Clause. The fact       that impeachment is a constitutionally prescribed       mechanism for removing federal officials from office does       not make it any the less a mechanism affecting rights       within the ordinary ambit of the clause.        The gravity of the deprivation at stake in an impeachment--      especially a presidential impeachment--buttresses the       conclusion that some due process limitations must apply. It       would be incompatible with the Framers' understanding of the       ``delicacy and magnitude of a trust which so deeply concerns       the political reputation and existence of every man engaged       in the administration of public affairs'' \398\ to think that       they envisioned a system in which the House was free to       devise any arbitrary or unfair mechanism it wished for       impeaching individuals. The Supreme Court has described due       process as ``the protection of the individual against       arbitrary action.'' \399\ There is no reason to think that       protection was not intended to extend to impeachments.        Similarly, the momentous impact of a presidential       impeachment on the operation of the government suggests that       the drafters of the Constitution expected the process to be       governed by procedures that would ensure a fair assessment of       evidence. The Bill of Rights guarantees due process, not out       of an abstract, academic interest in process as an end in       itself, but rather due to a belief, deeply rooted in the       Anglo-American system of law, that procedural protections       reduce the chances of erroneous decision-making.\400\ The       Framers surely did not intend to approve a process for       determining impeachments that would be wholly cut loose from       all traditional mechanisms deemed essential in our legal       heritage for discovering the truth.        The sole judicial opinion to reach the question held that       the Due Process Clause applies to impeachment       proceedings.\401\ In Hastings v United States, the district       court held that the Due Process Clause imposes an independent       constitutional constraint on how the Senate exercises its       ``sole Power to try all Impeachments.'' \402\ In 1974, the       Department of Justice suggested the same view, opining that       ``[w]hether or not capable of judicial enforcement, due       process standards would seem to be relevant to the manner of       conducting an impeachment proceeding'' in the House--      including ``the ability of the President to be represented at       the inquiry of the House Committee, to cross-examine       witnesses, and to offer witnesses and evidence,'' completely       separate from the trial in the Senate.\403\             (b) The Separation of Powers Requires Fair Process         A proper respect for the head of a co-equal branch of the       government also requires that the House use procedures that       are not arbitrary and that are designed to permit the fair       development of evidence. The Framers intended the impeachment       power to be limited to ``guard[] against the danger of       persecution, from the prevalency of a factious spirit.''       \404\ The Constitution places the power of impeachment in the       entire House precisely to ensure that a majority of the       elected representatives of the people decide to move an       impeachment forward. That design would be undermined if a       House vote were shaped by an investigatory process so       lopsided that it effectively empowered only one faction to       develop evidence and foreclosed the ability of others--      including the accused--to develop the facts. Rather than       promoting deliberation by a majority of the people's       representatives, that approach would foster precisely the       factionalism that the Framers foresaw as one of the greatest       dangers in impeachments. ``By forcing the House and Senate to       act as tribunals rather than merely as legislative bodies,       the Framers infused the process with notions of due process       to prevent impeachment from becoming a common tool of party       politics.'' \405\        The need for fair process as a reflection of respect for       the separation of powers is further buttressed by the unique       role of the President in the constitutional structure. As       explained above,\406\ ``presidential impeachments are       qualitatively different from all others'' because they       overturn a national election and risk grave disruption of the       government.\407\ It is unthinkable that a process carrying       such grave risks for the Nation should not be regulated by       any constitutional limits. And the need for fair process is       even more critical where, as here, impeachment turns on how       the President has exercised authorities within his exclusive       constitutional sphere. The President is ``the constitutional       representative of the United States in its dealings with       foreign nations.'' \408\ Preserving the President's ability       to carry out this constitutional function requires that he be       provided fair process and an opportunity to defend himself in       any investigation into how he has exercised his authority to       conduct foreign affairs. Otherwise, a partisan faction could       smear the President with one-sided allegations with no       opportunity for the President to respond. That would threaten       to ``undermine the President's capacity'' for ``effective       diplomacy'' and ``compromise the very capacity of the       President to speak for the Nation with one voice in dealing       with other governments.'' \409\  (c) The House's Sole Power of Impeachment and Power to Determine Rules  of Its Own Proceedings Do Not Eliminate the Constitutional Requirement                               of Due Process         Nothing in the House's ``sole Power of Impeachment'' \410\       and power to ``determine the Rules of its Proceedings'' \411\       undermines the House's obligation to use fundamentally fair       procedures in impeachment. Those provisions simply mean that       the House, and no other entity, has these powers. The Supreme       Court has made clear that independent constitutional       constraints limit otherwise plenary powers committed to one       of the political branches.\412\ For example, even though       ``[t]he [C]onstitution empowers each house to determine its       rules of proceedings,'' each House ``may not by its rules       ignore constitutional restraints or violate fundamental       rights.'' \413\ Similarly, the doctrine of Executive       Privilege, which is rooted in the separation of powers,       constrains Congress's exercise of its constitutionally       assigned powers. A congressional committee cannot simply       demand access to information protected by Executive       Privilege. Instead, if it can get access to such information       at all, it must show that the information ``is demonstrably       critical to the responsible fulfillment of the Committee's       functions.'' \414\ The House could not evade that constraint       by invoking its plenary authority to ``determine the Rules of       its Proceedings'' \415\ and adopting a rule allowing its       committees to override Executive Privilege.\416\ Executive       Privilege, which is itself grounded in the Constitution,       similarly constrains the House's ability to demand       information pursuant to its ``sole Power of Impeachment.''       \417\        Nixon v. United States, in any case, does not suggest       otherwise.\418\ Nixon addressed whether the use of a       committee to take evidence in a Senate impeachment trial       violated the direction in the Constitution that the Senate  [[Page S327]]       shall have ``sole Power to try all Impeachments.'' \419\ The       Court held that the challenge presented a non-justiciable       political question \420\--specifically, that ``[i]n the case       before us, there is no separate provision of the Constitution       that could be defeated by allowing the Senate final authority       to determine the meaning of the word `try' in the Impeachment       Trial Clause.'' \421\ But Nixon did not hold that all       questions related to impeachment are non-justiciable \422\ or       that there are no constitutional constraints on impeachment.       To the contrary, the Court ``agree[d] with Nixon that courts       possess power to review either legislative or executive       action that transgresses identifiable textual limits,''       but merely concluded ``that the word `try' in the       Impeachment Trial Clause does not provide an identifiable       textual limit on the authority which is committed to the       Senate.'' \423\ More importantly, the justiciability of       such questions is irrelevant. Constitutional obligations       need not be enforceable by the judiciary to exist and       constrain the political branches. As Madison explained,       ``as the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial departments       of the United States are co-ordinate, and each equally       bound to support the Constitution, it follows that each       must in the exercise of its functions, be guided by the       text of the Constitution according to its own       interpretation of it.'' \424\ Particularly in the       impeachment context, ``we have to divest ourselves of the       common misconception that constitutionality is discussable       or determinable only in the courts, and that anything is       constitutional which a court cannot or will not overturn.       . . . Congress's responsibility to preserve the forms and       the precepts of the Constitution is greater, rather than       less, when the judicial forum is unavailable, as it       sometimes must be.'' \425\ A holding that a particular       question is a non-justiciable political question leaves       that question to the political branches to use       ``nonjudicial methods of working out their differences''       \426\ and does not relieve the House of its constitutional       obligation.      2. The House's Consistent Practice of Providing Due Process in    Impeachment Investigations for the Last 150 Years Confirms that the                     Constitution Requires Due Process         Historical practice provides a gloss on the requirements of       the Constitution and strongly confirms that House impeachment       investigations must adhere to basic forms of due process.       ``In separation-of-powers cases, th[e] [Supreme] Court has       often put significant weight upon historical practice.''       \427\ As James Madison explained, it ``was foreseen at the       birth of the Constitution, that difficulties and differences       of opinion might occasionally arise in expounding terms [and]       phrases necessarily used in such a charter . . . and that it       might require a regular course of practice to liquidate [and]       settle the meaning of some of them.'' \428\ The Constitution       ``contemplates that practice will integrate the dispersed       powers [of the federal government] into a workable       government.'' \429\ The Supreme Court has thus explained that       historical practice reflects ``an admissible view of the       Constitution,'' \430\ and ``consistent congressional practice       requires our respect.'' \431\ Although constitutional       requirements governing House impeachment proceedings may have       been unsettled when the Constitution was adopted, by the       1870s consistent practice in the House (unbroken since then)       gave meaning to the Constitution and settled the minimum       procedures that must be afforded for a fair impeachment       inquiry.        The Framers, who debated impeachment with reference to the       contemporaneous English impeachment of Warren Hastings,\432\       knew that ``the House of Commons did hear the accused, and       did permit him to produce testimony, before they voted an       impeachment against him.'' \433\ And practice in the United       States rapidly established that the accused in an impeachment       must be allowed fair process. Although a few early       impeachment investigations were ex parte,\434\ the House       provided the accused with notice and an opportunity to be       heard in the majority of cases starting as early as       1818.\435\        By Judge Peck's impeachment in 1830, House Members,       explicitly acknowledging that ``it was obvious that it had       not yet been settled by precedent,'' had an extensive debate       to ``settle[]'' ``[t]he practice in cases of impeachments, so       far as regards the proceedings in this House.'' \436\ Judge       Peck had asked for the House to give him the ability to       submit a ``written exposition of the whole case, embracing       both the facts and the law, and give him, also, process to       call his witnesses from Missouri in support of his       statements.'' \437\ The Judiciary Committee Chairman, James       Buchanan, pointed out that ``in the case of Warren Hastings''       in England, ``the House of Commons did hear the accused, and       did permit him to produce testimony, before they voted an       impeachment against him.'' \438\ Mr. Ingersoll explained       that, in a prior impeachment inquiry against Vice President       Calhoun, ``a friend of the Vice President had been permitted       to appear, and represent him throughout the whole       investigation,'' that ``[w]itnesses, also, had been examined       on the part of the accused,'' and that ``witnesses in favor       of the Vice President had been examined, as well as against       him, and that his representative had been allowed to present       before the committee through every stage of the       examination.'' \439\ He noted that ``[t]he committee at that       time took some pains to ascertain what was the proper mode of       proceeding, and they became satisfied that the party accused       had, in these preliminary proceedings, a right to be thus       heard.'' \440\ Mr. Pettis similarly concluded that ``[t]he       request of the Judge is supported by the whole train of       English decisions in cases of a like kind'' and that he       should be given those rights here as well.\441\ The debate       was thus settled in favor of due process rights for Judge       Peck.\442\        By at least the 1870s, despite some unsettled practice in       the interim, the House Judiciary Committee concluded that an       opportunity for the ``accused by himself and his counsel [to]       be heard'' had ``become the established practice of the       [Judiciary Committee] in cases of impeachment'' and thus       ``deemed it due to the accused that he should have'' due       process.\443\ That ``established practice'' has been followed       in every House impeachment investigation for the past 150       years \444\ and has provided a fixed meaning for the       constitutional requirements governing House impeachment       proceedings.\445\ The fact that the House has not followed a       perfectly consistent practice dating all the way back to       1789, or that there were early outliers, is irrelevant.\446\        The House's Parliamentarian acknowledges that while ``the       committee sometimes made its inquiry ex parte'' in ``earlier       practice'' before the 1870s, the practice dating to the 1870s       ``is to permit the accused to testify, present witnesses,       cross-examine witnesses, and be represented by counsel.''       \447\ Current House Democrats are already on record agreeing       that due process protections apply in the House's impeachment       inquiries. Chairman Nadler has admitted that ``[t]he power of       impeachment is a solemn responsibility, assigned to the House       by the Constitution,'' and ``[t]hat responsibility demands a       rigorous level of due process.'' \448\ He has rightly       acknowledged, expressly in the context of impeachment, that       ``[t]he Constitution guarantees the right of anyone who is       accused of any wrongdoing, and fundamental fairness       guarantees the right of anyone, to have the right to confront       the witness against him.'' \449\ Rep. Hank Johnson--a current       Judiciary Committee member--has similarly recognized that       ``[t]here is a reason for a careful process when it comes to       the most drastic action of impeachment; it is called due       process.'' \450\        The two modern presidential impeachment inquiries also       abundantly confirm the due process protections that apply to       the accused in an impeachment inquiry. In fact, every       President who has asked to participate in an impeachment       investigation has been afforded extensive rights to do       so.\451\ The House Judiciary Committee adopted explicit       procedures to provide Presidents Clinton and Nixon with       robust opportunities to defend themselves, including the       rights ``to attend all hearings, including any held in       executive session''; ``respond to evidence received and       testimony adduced by the Committee''; ``submit written       requests'' for ``the Committee to receive additional       testimony or other evidence''; \452\ ``question any witness       called before the Committee''; and raise ``[o]bjections       relating to the examination of witnesses, or to the       admissibility of testimony and evidence.'' \453\ President       Clinton was given access to the grand-jury evidence that       underpinned the Starr report.\454\ The Committee also ensured       that the minority could fully participate in the       investigation and hearings, including by submitting evidence,       objecting to witness examination and evidence, and exercising       co-equal subpoena authority to issue a subpoena subject to       overruling by the full Committee.\455\ Both Presidents       were thus able to present robust defenses before the       Committee.\456\ Indeed, President Clinton's counsel gave       an opening statement, the President called 14 expert       witnesses over two days, and the President's counsel also       gave a closing statement \457\ and cross-examined the       witnesses, including ``question[ing] Judge Starr for an       hour.'' \458\ In this impeachment inquiry, the House       Intelligence Committee fulfilled the investigatory role       that the House Judiciary Committee filled in prior       impeachments, and thus, these rights should have been       available in the proceedings before the Intelligence       Committee.   3. The President's Counsel Must Be Allowed To Be Present at Hearings,         See and Present Evidence, and Cross-Examine All Witnesses         The exact contours of the procedural protections required       during an impeachment investigation must, of course, be       adapted to the nature of that proceeding. The hallmarks of a       full blown trial are not required, but procedures must       reflect, at a minimum, basic protections that are essential       for ensuring a fair process that is designed to get at the       truth.        The Supreme Court's ``precedents establish the general rule       that individuals must receive notice and an opportunity to be       heard before the Government deprives them'' of a       constitutionally protected interest.\459\ That means, at a       minimum, that the evidence must be disclosed to the accused,       and the accused must be permitted an opportunity to test and       respond to the evidence--particularly through ``[t]he rights       to confront and cross-examine witnesses,'' which ``have long       been recognized as essential to due process.'' \460\ For 250       years, ``the policy of the Anglo-American system of evidence       has been to regard the necessity of testing by cross-      examination as a vital feature of the law.'' \461\ Cross-      examination is ``the greatest legal engine ever invented for       the discovery of  [[Page S328]]       truth,'' \462\ ``shed[ding] light on the witness' perception,       memory and narration'' \463\ and ``expos[ing]       inconsistencies, incompleteness, and inaccuracies in his       testimony.'' \464\ Thus, ``[i]n almost every setting where       important decisions turn on questions of fact, due process       requires an opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse       witnesses.'' \465\ It is unthinkable that the Framers,       steeped in the history of Anglo-American jurisprudence, would       create a system that would allow the Chief Executive and       Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces to be impeached based       on a process that developed evidence without providing any of       the elementary procedures that the common law developed over       centuries for ensuring the proper testing of evidence in an       adversarial process.        The most persuasive source indicating what the Constitution       requires in an impeachment investigation is the record of the       House's own past practice, as explained above.\466\ The due       process rights consistently afforded by the House to the       accused for the past 150 years have generally included the       right to appear and to be represented by counsel at all       hearings, to have access to and respond to the evidence, to       submit evidence and testimony, to question witnesses and       object to evidence, and to make opening statements and       closing arguments.\467\ Chairman Nadler, Chairman Schiff,       other House Democrats, and then-Representative Schumer have       repeatedly confirmed these procedural requirements.\468\    4. The House Impeachment Inquiry Failed to Provide the Due Process     Demanded by the Constitution and Generated a Fundamentally Skewed              Record That Cannot Be Relied Upon in the Senate         Despite clear precedent mandating due process for the       accused in any impeachment inquiry--and especially in a       presidential impeachment inquiry--House Democrats concocted a       wholly unprecedented three-stage process in this case that       denied the President fair process at every step of the way.       Indeed, because the process started without any actual       authorization from the House, committees initially made up       the process as they went along. In the end, all three phases       of the House's inquiry failed to afford the President even       the most rudimentary procedures demanded by the Constitution,       fundamental fairness, and over 150 years of precedent.            (a) Phase I: Secret Hearings in the Basement Bunker         The first phase involved secret proceedings in a basement       bunker where the President was not given any rights at all.       This phase consisted of depositions taken by joint hearings       of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence       (HPSCI), the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the       House Committee on Oversight and Reform. To ensure there       would be no transparency for the President or the American       people, depositions were conducted in a facility designed for       securing highly classified information--even though all of       the depositions were ``conducted entirely at the unclassified       level.'' \469\ The President was denied any opportunity to       participate. He was denied the right to have counsel present.       He was denied the right to cross-examine witnesses, call       witnesses, and present evidence. He was even denied the right       to have Executive Branch counsel present during depositions       of Executive Branch officials, thereby undermining any       ability for the President to protect longstanding       constitutional privileges over Executive Branch       information.\470\ Members in the Republican minority on the       investigating committees could not provide a counterweight to       remedy the lack of process for the President. They were       denied subpoena authority to call witnesses, and they were       blocked even from asking questions that would ensure a       balanced development of the facts. For example, Chairman       Schiff repeatedly shut down any line of questioning that       would have exposed personal self-interest, prejudice, or bias       of the whistleblower.\471\        Finally, House Democrats made clear that the proceedings'       secrecy was just a partisan stratagem. Daily leaks describing       purported testimony of witnesses were calculated to present       the public with a distorted view of what was taking place       behind closed doors and further the narrative that the       President had done something wrong.\472\        House Democrats' assertions that the basement Star Chamber       hearings were justified because the House ``serves in a role       analogous to a grand jury and prosecutor'' \473\ are       baseless. The House's unbroken practice of providing due       process over the last 150 years confirms that the House is       not merely a grand jury.\474\ Chairman Nadler, other House       Democrats, and then-Representative Schumer rejected such       analogies as a ``cramped view of the appropriate role of the       House [that] finds no support in the Constitution and is       completely contrary to the great weight of historical       precedent.'' \475\ The Judiciary Committee's own impeachment       consultant and staff have rejected ``[g]rand jury analogies''       as ``badly misplaced when it comes to impeachment.'' \476\        More importantly, the narrow rationales that justify       limiting procedural protections in grand juries simply do not       apply here.\477\ For example, it is primarily grand jury       secrecy--not the preliminary nature of grand jury proceedings       in developing the basis for a charge--that ``justif[ies] the       limited procedural safeguards available to . . . persons       under investigation.'' \478\ That secrecy, in turn, promotes       two primary objectives. It allows an investigation to proceed       without notice to those under suspicion and thus may further       the investigation.\479\ In addition, a ``cornerstone''       of grand jury secrecy is the policy of protecting the       public reputations of those who may be investigated but       never charged.\480\        Neither rationale applied to Chairman Schiff's proceedings       for a straightforward reason: in relevant respects, the       proceedings were entirely public. Chairman Schiff made no       secret that the target of his investigation was President       Trump. He and his colleagues held news conferences to       announce that fact, and they leaked information intended to       damage the President from their otherwise secret       hearings.\481\ In addition, the exact witness list with the       dates, times, and places of witness testimony were announced       to the world long in advance of each hearing. And witnesses'       opening statements, as well as slanted summaries of their       testimony, were selectively leaked to the press in real time.       The entire direction of the investigation, as well as       specific testimony, was thus telegraphed to the world. These       acts would have violated federal criminal law if grand jury       rules had applied.\482\        It is also well settled that the one-sided procedures       employed by Chairman Schiff were not designed to be the best       mechanism for getting at the truth. Grand jury procedures       have never been justified on the theory that they are well       adapted for uncovering ultimate facts. To the contrary, as       explained above, the Anglo-American legal system has long       recognized that ``adversarial testing,'' particularly cross-      examination, ``will ultimately advance the public interest in       truth and fairness.'' \483\ Those essential procedural rights       are no less necessary in impeachment proceedings unless one       adopts the counterintuitive assumption that the Framers did       not intend an impeachment inquiry to use any of the familiar       mechanisms developed over centuries in the common law to get       at the truth.         (b) Phase II: The Public, Ex Parte Show Trial Before HPSCI         After four weeks of secret--and wholly unauthorized--      hearings, House Democrats finally introduced a resolution to       have the House authorize an impeachment inquiry and to set       procedures for it. House Resolution 660, however, merely       compounded the fundamentally unfair procedures from the       secret cellar hearings by subjecting the President to a       second round of ex parte hearings before Chairman Schiff's       committee. The only difference was that this second round       took place in public.\484\ Thus, after screening witnesses'       testimony behind closed doors, Chairman Schiff moved on to a       true show trial--a stage-managed inquisition in front of the       cameras, choreographed with pre-screened testimony to build a       narrative aiming at a pre-determined result. The President       was still denied any opportunity to participate, to cross-      examine witnesses, to present witnesses or evidence, or to       protect constitutionally privileged Executive Branch       information by having agency counsel present. All of this was       directly contrary to the rules that had governed the Nixon       and Clinton impeachment inquiries. There, the President had       been allowed to cross-examine any fact witnesses called by       the committee.\485\ In addition, the President had been       permitted to call witnesses, and the ranking member on the       investigating committee had been permitted co-equal subpoena       authority.\486\      (c) Phase III: The Ignominious Rubber Stamp from the Judiciary                                 Committee         The House Committee on the Judiciary simply rubber-stamped       the ex parte record compiled by Chairman Schiff and, per the       Speaker's direction, relied on it to draft articles of       impeachment. Under House Resolution 660, it was only during       this third phase that the President was even nominally       allowed a chance to participate and some rudimentary elements       of process.\487\ With fact-finding already over, there was no       meaningful way to allow the President to use those rights for       a balanced factual inquiry. Instead, the Judiciary Committee       doubled down on using the skewed, one-sided record developed       by Chairman Schiff. Thus, the only procedural protections       that House Resolution 660 provided the President were       inadequate from the outset because they came far too late in       the proceedings to be effective. Procedural protections such       as cross-examination are essential as the factual record is       being developed. Providing process only after the record has       been compiled and after charges are being drafted can do       little to remedy the distortions built into the record. Here,       most witnesses testified twice under oath on the same       topics--once in a secret rehearsal to preview their       testimony, and again in public--without any cross-examination       by the President's counsel. Locking witnesses into their       stories by having them testify twice vastly reduces the       benefit of cross-examination. Any deviation from prior       testimony potentially exposes a witness to a double perjury       charge, and, worse, the prior ex parte testimony becomes       fixed in each witness's mind in place of actual memory.        While it would have been next to impossible for a       proceeding before the Judiciary Committee to remedy the       defects in the prior two rounds of hearings, Chairman Nadler       had no interest in even attempting to do that. His only       interest was following marching orders to report articles of       impeachment to the House so they could be voted on before       Christmas. Thus, he repeatedly provided vague and inadequate       notice about what proceedings were planned until he       ultimately  [[Page S329]]       informed the President that he had no plans for any       evidentiary hearings at all.        For example, on November 26, 2019--two days before       Thanksgiving--Chairman Nadler informed the President and the       Ranking Member that the Judiciary Committee would hold a       hearing on December 4 vaguely limited to ``the historical and       constitutional basis of impeachment.'' \488\ The Chairman       provided no further information about the hearing, including       the identities of the witnesses, but nonetheless required the       President to indicate whether he wished to participate by       Sunday, December 1. Every aspect of the planning for this       hearing departed from the Clinton and Nixon precedents. The       Committee afforded the President no scheduling input, no       meaningful information about the hearing, and so little time       to prepare that it effectively denied the Administration a       fair opportunity to participate. The Committee ultimately       announced the identities of the witnesses less than two days       before the hearing.\489\ For a similar hearing with scholars       in the Clinton impeachment, the Committee provided two-and-a-      half weeks' notice to prepare and scheduled the hearing on a       date suggested by the President's attorneys.\490\ President       Trump understandably declined to participate in that biased       constitutional law seminar because he could not ``fairly be       expected to participate in a hearing while the witnesses are       yet to be named and while it remains unclear whether the       Judiciary Committee will afford the President a fair process       through additional hearings.'' \491\        Meanwhile, in a separate letter on November 29, 2019,       Chairman Nadler asked the President to specify, by December       6, how he would participate in future undefined       ``proceedings'' and which ``privileges'' in the Judiciary       Committee's Impeachment Procedures the President's counsel       would seek to exercise.\492\ At the same time, he gave no       indication as to what these ``proceedings'' would involve,       what subjects they would address, whether witnesses would be       heard (or who they would be), or when any hearings would be       held.\493\ To inform the President's decision, the       President's counsel asked Chairman Nadler for information       about the ``scope and nature of the proceedings'' he planned,       including topics of hearings, whether he intended ``to allow       for fact witnesses to be called,'' and whether he would allow       ``the President's counsel the right to cross examine fact       witnesses.'' \494\ The President's counsel even offered to       meet with Chairman Nadler to discuss a plan for upcoming       hearings.\495\ All to no avail--Chairman Nadler did not even       bother to respond.        And the Judiciary Committee continued to hide the ball.       Throughout the week of December 2, the President's counsel       were in contact with Committee counsel trying to get answers       concerning what hearings were planned, so that the President       could determine whether and how to participate. But all that       Committee staff were authorized to convey was: (i) a hearing       on an unknown topic had been publicly announced for December       9; (ii) before that hearing, the Committee might be issuing       two additional reports (one based on the December 4       constitutional law seminar and one dredging up unspecified       aspects of Special Counsel Mueller's report); and (iii) they       would not have an answer to any other questions about the       subjects of the December 9 hearing or whether any other       hearings would be scheduled until after the close of business       on Thursday, December 5.        On the morning of December 5, Speaker Pelosi instructed the       Judiciary Committee to begin drafting articles of impeachment       before the Committee had received any presentation on the       HPSCI report, heard any fact witness, or heard a single word       from the President in his defense.\496\ Later that day,       Committee counsel informed the President's counsel that--      other than a report addressing the meaning of ``high Crimes       and Misdemeanors'' based on the December 4 constitutional law       seminar and other than a hearing on December 9 involving a       presentation of the HPSCI majority and minority reports       solely by staff--there were no immediate plans to issue any       other reports or have any other hearings.        Meanwhile, Chairman Nadler was also playing hide-the-ball       with the minority members of his own Committee. The       Committee's Ranking Member, Doug Collins, sent at least seven       letters to Chairman Nadler trying to find out about the       process the Committee would follow and requesting specific       rights to ensure a balanced presentation of the law and       facts, including requesting witnesses.\497\ Chairman Nadler       simply ignored them. He offered only an after-the-fact       response \498\ that denied his request for witnesses in part       on the misleading claim that ``the President is not       requesting any witnesses,'' when it was Chairman Nadler who       had refused to commit to allowing the President to call       witnesses in the first place.\499\        As a backdrop to all of this, Chairman Nadler had       threatened to invoke the unprecedented provision of the       Committee's Impeachment Inquiry Procedures Pursuant to House       Resolution 660 that allowed him to deny the President any due       process rights if the President continued to assert       longstanding privileges and immunities to protect Executive       Branch information and to challenge the validity of the       investigating committees' subpoenas.\500\ This approach also       departed from all precedent in the Clinton and Nixon       proceedings.\501\ Even though both Presidents had asserted       numerous privileges, the Judiciary Committee never       contemplated that offering the opportunity to present a       defense and to have a fair hearing should be conditioned on       forcing the President to abandon the longstanding       constitutional rights and privileges of the Executive Branch.       The Supreme Court has already addressed such Catch-22 choices       and has made clear that it is ``intolerable that one       constitutional right should have to be surrendered in order       to assert another.'' \502\ Conditioning access to basic       procedural rights on an agreement to waive other fundamental       rights is the same as denying procedural rights altogether.        As a result, by the December 6 deadline, the President had       been left with no meaningful choice at all. The Committee was       already under instructions to draft articles of impeachment       before hearing any evidence; Chairman Nadler had kept the       President in the dark until the last minute about how and       when the Committee would proceed; and Committee counsel had       finally confirmed that the Committee's plan was to hear       solely a staff presentation of the HPSCI report and not to       hold any other hearings. It was abundantly clear that, if the       President asked to present or cross examine any witnesses,       any future hearings would merely be window-dressing designed       to place a veneer of fair process on a stage-managed show       trial already hurtling toward a preordained result. The       President would not be given any meaningful opportunity to       question fact witnesses or otherwise respond to the one-sided       factual record transmitted by HPSCI. The Judiciary       Committee's assertion that the President ``could have had his       counsel make a presentation of evidence or request that other       witnesses be called'' \503\ is thus entirely disingenuous.       Under those circumstances, the President determined that he       would not condone House Democrats' violations of due       process--and that he would not lend legitimacy to their       unprecedented procedures--by participating in their show       trial.        Chairman Nadler ultimately refused to allow the Committee       to hear from a single fact witness or hear any evidence       first-hand. He also blatantly violated House Rules by       refusing to allow the minority to have a minority hearing       day.\504\ Instead, the Judiciary Committee simply relied on       the ex parte evidence gathered by Chairman Schiff's show       trial with no procedural protections at all. And there could       be no clearer admission that the evidence simply did not       matter than Speaker Pelosi's instruction to begin drafting       articles of impeachment before the Committee had even heard       any evidence whatsoever.\505\        All of this conduct highlights rank hypocrisy by Chairman       Nadler, who, during the Clinton impeachment, decried the fact       that there had been ``no witness called in front of this       committee against the President'' and declared it ``a failure       of the Chairman of this committee that we are going to       consider voting impeachment, having heard no witnesses       whatsoever against the President.'' \506\ Then, Chairman       Nadler argued that the Judiciary Committee cannot simply       receive a report compiled by another entity (there, the       Independent Counsel) and proceed to judgment. That, in his       words, ``would be to say that the role of this committee of       the House is a mere transmission belt or rubber stamp,''       \507\ and would ``conclude the inquiry expeditiously, but not       fairly, and not without trashing the Constitution and every       principle of due process and fundamental fairness that we       have held sacred since the Magna Carta.'' \508\ House       Democrats on the Judiciary Committee made the same point just       a few years ago in 2016: ``[i]n all modern cases, the       Committee has conducted an independent, formal investigation       into the charges underlying a resolution of impeachment--      again, even when other authorities and other congressional       committees have already investigated the underlying issue.''       \509\        The House's constitutionally deficient proceedings have so       distorted the factual record compiled in the House that it       cannot constitutionally be relied upon for the Senate to       reach any verdict other than acquittal.     C. The House's Inquiry Was Irredeemably Defective Because It Was  Presided Over by an Interested Fact Witness Who Lied About Contact with              the Whistleblower Before the Complaint Was Filed         The House's entire factual investigation was carefully       orchestrated--and restricted--by an interested fact witness:       Chairman Schiff. His repeated falsehoods about the President       leave him with no credibility whatsoever. In March 2017,       Chairman Schiff lied, announcing that he already had evidence       that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.\510\ That was       proved false when the Mueller Report was released and the       entire Russian hoax Chairman Schiff had been peddling was       disproved.        In this proceeding, Chairman Schiff violated basic fairness       by overseeing and prosecuting the proceedings while secretly       being a witness in the case. Before public release of the       whistleblower complaint, when asked whether he had ``heard       from the whistleblower,'' Chairman Schiff falsely denied       having ``heard from the whistleblower,'' saying: ``We have       not spoken directly with the whistleblower. We would like to       . . . But yes, we would love to talk directly with the       whistleblower.'' \511\ As multiple media outlets concluded,       that statement was ``flat-out false'' \512\--a ``[w]hopper''       of a lie that earned ``four Pinnochios'' from The Washington       Post \513\--because it ``wrongly implied the committee had       not been contacted'' by the whistleblower before the       complaint was filed.\514\ Subsequent reporting showed that       Chairman Schiff's staff had not only had  [[Page S330]]       contact with the whistleblower, but apparently played some       still-unverified role in advising the whistleblower before       the complaint was filed.\515\ And Chairman Schiff began the       hearings in this matter by lying once again and reading a       fabricated version of the President's telephone conversation       with President Zelensky to the American people.\516\        Given the role that Chairman Schiff and his staff       apparently played in advising the whistleblower, Chairman       Schiff made himself a fact witness in these proceedings. The       American people understand that Chairman Schiff cannot       covertly assist with the submission of a complaint, mislead       the public about his involvement, and then pretend to be a       neutral ``investigator.'' No wonder Chairman Schiff       repeatedly denied requests to subpoena the whistleblower and       shut down any questions that he feared might identify the       whistleblower. Questioning the whistleblower would have       exposed before the American people the role Chairman Schiff       and his staff had in concocting the very complaint they       purported to be investigating.       D. The Senate May Not Rely on a Factual Record Derived from a              Procedurally Deficient House Impeachment Inquiry         The Senate may not rely on a corrupted factual record       derived from constitutionally deficient proceedings to       support a conviction of the President of the United States.       Nor is it the Senate's role to attempt to remedy the House's       errors by providing a ``do-over'' to develop the record anew       in the Senate. In the courts, comparable fundamental errors       underpinning the foundations of a case would require throwing       the case out. The denial of ``basic protections'' of due       process ``necessarily render[s]'' a proceeding       ``fundamentally unfair,'' precluding it from ``reliably       serv[ing] its function as a vehicle for determination of       guilt or innocence.'' \517\ A ``proceeding infected with       fundamental procedural error, like a void judicial judgment,       is a legal nullity.'' \518\ That is why, for example,       criminal indictments may not proceed to trial when they       result from ``fundamental'' errors that cause ``the       structural protections of the grand jury [to] have been so       compromised as to render the proceedings fundamentally       unfair.'' \519\ The same principles should apply in the       impeachment trial context. The Senate cannot rely on a record       developed in a hopelessly defective House proceeding to       convict the President.    E. House Democrats Used an Unprecedented and Unfair Process Because   Their Goal to Impeach at Any Cost Had Nothing To Do with Finding the                                   Truth         House Democrats' impeachment inquiry was never a quest for       the truth. Instead it was an inquisition in pursuit of an       offense to justify a pre-ordained outcome--impeaching       President Trump by any means necessary. The procedural       protections that the House has afforded to the accused in       every impeachment for the last 150 years were incompatible       with that agenda. Ensuring a fair process that uses time-      tested methods for getting at the truth--like adversarial       cross examination of witnesses by counsel for the accused--      takes time and it also risks undermining the accusers'       preferred version of the facts. But House Democrats had no       time. By September 2019, when the President released the       transcript of his telephone call with President Zelensky, the       2020 campaign for the presidency was already well underway,       and they needed a fast and tightly controlled process that       would yield their political goal: impeachment by Christmas.        In fact, House Democrats have been on a crusade to impeach       the President since the moment he took office three years       ago. As Speaker Pelosi recently confirmed, her party's quest       for impeachment had ``been going on for 22 months . . . [t]wo       and a half years, actually.'' \520\ The moment that the       President was sworn in, two liberal advocacy groups launched       a campaign to impeach him.\521\ The current proceedings began       with a complaint prepared with the assistance of a lawyer who       declared in 2017 that he was already planning to use       ``impeachment'' to effect a ``coup.'' \522\ The first       resolution proposing articles of impeachment against       President Trump was filed before he had been in office for       six months.\523\ As soon as Democrats gained control of the       House in the 2018 midterm elections, they made clear that       they would stop at nothing to impeach the President. Rep.       Rashida Tlaib, for example, announced in January 2019:       ``[W]e're going to go in there and we're gonna impeach the       motherf****r.'' \524\        Over the past three years, House Democrats have filed at       least eight resolutions to impeach the President, alleging a       vast range of preposterous purported offenses. They have       repeatedly charged the President with obstruction of justice       in connection with the Mueller investigation \525\--an       allegation that the Department of Justice resoundingly       rejected.\526\ One resolution sought to impeach the President       for protecting national security by restricting U.S. entry by       nationals of eight countries \527\--an action upheld by the       Supreme Court.\528\ Another tried to impeach the President       for publishing disparaging tweets about Democrat House       members in response to their own attacks on the       President.\529\ Still another gathered a hodge-podge of       absurd charges, including failing to nominate persons to fill       vacancies and insulting the press.\530\        In this case, House Democrats ran the fastest presidential       impeachment fact-finding on record. They raced through their       entire process in less than three months from the beginning       of their fact-finding investigation on September 24, 2019 to       the adoption of articles on December 18--meeting their       deadline of impeachment by Christmas. That rushed three-month       process stands apart from every prior presidential       impeachment--the fastest of which took place after a fact-      finding period nearly four times as long. Independent Counsel       Ken Starr received authorization to investigate the charges       that led to President Clinton's impeachment in January       1998,\531\ almost a full year before the House impeached       President Clinton in December 1998.\532\ Congress began       investigating President Nixon's conduct in February       1973,\533\ more than one year before July 1974, when the       House Judiciary Committee voted to recommend articles of       impeachment.\534\ The investigation into President Johnson       also exceeded 12 months. Except for a two-month break between       a vote rejecting articles of impeachment in 1867 and the       authorization of a second impeachment inquiry,\535\ President       Johnson's impeachment was investigated over 14 months from       January 1867 \536\ to the adoption of articles of impeachment       in March 1868.\537\ The two inquiries were closely       related,\538\ and one article of impeachment was carried over       from the first impeachment inquiry.\539\ The Democrats' need       for speed only underscores that, unlike prior impeachments,       these proceedings were never about conducting a serious       inquiry into the truth.        Although they tried everything, Democrats pinned their       impeachment dreams primarily on the Mueller investigation and       their dogmatic faith in the myth that President Trump--or at       least his campaign--was somehow in league with Russia. After       $32 million, 2,800 subpoenas, nearly 500 search warrants, 230       orders for communications records, and 500 witness       interviews, that inquisition disproved the myth of collusion       between the President or his campaign and Russia. As the       Mueller Report informed the public, Special Counsel Mueller       and his team of investigators and FBI agents could not find       any evidence of collusion between the Trump Campaign and the       Russian government.\540\ While the Mueller investigation was       pending, though, Chairman Schiff flatly lied to the American       people, telling them that he was privy to `` `more than       circumstantial evidence' that the President's associates       colluded with Russia.'' \541\ He played up the Mueller       investigation, promising that it would show wrongdoing ``of a       size and scope probably beyond Watergate.'' \542\        The damage caused by Democrats' Russian collusion delusion       stretches far beyond anything directly attributable to the       Mueller investigation. The Mueller investigation itself was       triggered by an FBI investigation, known as Crossfire       Hurricane, that involved gross abuses of FBI investigative       tools--including FISA orders and undercover agents. The FBI       abused its extraordinary authorities to spy on American       citizens and a major-party presidential campaign.\543\       According to a report from the Inspector General of the       Department of Justice, these abuses included ``multiple       instances'' of factual assertions to the FISA court that were       knowingly ``inaccurate, incomplete, or unsupported by       appropriate documentation'' \544\--in other words, lies to       the FISA court. One FBI official, who openly advocated for       ``resistance'' against the President, even fabricated       evidence to persuade the FISA court to maintain surveillance       on an American citizen connected with the Trump       Campaign.\545\ Tellingly, the Inspector General could not       rule out the possibility that Crossfire Hurricane was       corrupted by political bias, because the FBI could not       provide ``satisfactory explanations'' for the extraordinary       litany of errors and abuses that plagued the investigation       from its inception--all of which indicated bias against the       President.\546\        Despite all of this, House Democrats have refused to accept       the conclusions of the Mueller Report. They held hearings and       issued subpoenas hoping to uncover collusion where Mueller       had found none. Failing that, they tried to keep the       impeachment flame alive by manufacturing an obstruction       charge--even though the Department of Justice had already       rejected such a claim.\547\ They embarked on new fishing       expeditions, such as demanding the President's tax returns,       investigating the routine Executive Branch practice of       granting case-by-case exceptions to the President's       voluntarily undertaken ethics guidelines, and the costs of       the July 4 ``Salute to America'' event--all in the hope that       rummaging through those records might give them some new       basis for attacking the President.        Democrats have been fixated on impeachment and Russia for       the past three years for two reasons. First, they have never       accepted the results of the 2016 election and have been       consumed by an insatiable need to justify their continued       belief that President Trump could not ``really'' have won.       Long before votes had been cast, Democrats had taken it as an       article of faith that Hillary Clinton would be the next       President. House Democrats' impeachment and Russia obsessions       thus stem from a pair of false beliefs held as dogma: that       Donald Trump should not be President and that he is President       only by virtue of foreign interference.        The second reason for Democrats' fixations is that they       desperately need an illegitimate boost for their candidate in       the 2020 election, whoever that may be. Put simply, Democrats       have no response to the President's record of achievement in       restoring growth and prosperity to the American economy,       rebuilding America's military, and confronting America's       adversaries abroad. They have no policies and no ideas to       compete against that.  [[Page S331]]       Instead, they are held hostage by a radical left wing that       has foisted on the party a radical agenda of socialism at       home and appeasement abroad that Democrat leaders know the       American people will never accept. For Democrats, President       Trump's record of success made impeachment an electoral       imperative. As Congressman Al Green explained it: ``if we       don't impeach the [P]resident, he will get re-elected.''       \548\        The result of House Democrats' relentless pursuit of their       obsessions--and their willingness to sacrifice every       precedent, every principle, and every procedural right       standing in their way--is exactly what the Framers warned       against: a wholly partisan impeachment. The Articles of       Impeachment now before the Senate were adopted without a       single Republican vote. Indeed, the only bipartisan aspect of       these articles was congressional opposition to their       adoption.\549\        Democrats used to recognize that the momentous act of       overturning a national election by impeaching a President       should never take place on a partisan basis, and that       impeachment should not be used as a partisan tool in       electoral politics. As Chairman Nadler explained in 1998:        The effect of impeachment is to overturn the popular will       of the voters. We must not overturn an election and remove a       President from office except to defend our system of       government or our constitutional liberties against a dire       threat, and we must not do so without an overwhelming       consensus of the American people. There must never be a       narrowly voted impeachment or an impeachment supported by one       of our major political parties and opposed by another. Such       an impeachment will produce divisiveness and bitterness in       our politics for years to come, and will call into question       the very legitimacy of our political institutions.\550\        Senator Leahy agreed: ``A partisan impeachment cannot       command the respect of the American people. It is no more       valid than a stolen election.'' \551\ Chairman Schiff       likewise recognized that a partisan impeachment would be       ``doomed for failure,'' adding that there was ``little to be       gained by putting the country through that kind of wrenching       experience.'' \552\ Earlier last year even Speaker Pelosi       acknowledged that, ``before I think we should go down any       impeachment path,'' it ``would have to be so clearly       bipartisan in terms of acceptance of it.'' \553\        Now, however, House Democrats have completely abandoned       those principles and placed before the Senate Articles of       Impeachment that are partisan to their core. In their rush to       impeach the President before Christmas, Democrats allowed       speed and political expediency to conquer fairness and truth.       As Professor Turley explained, this impeachment ``stand[s]       out among modern impeachments as the shortest proceeding,       with the thinnest evidentiary record, and the narrowest       grounds ever used to impeach a president.'' \554\ And as the       vote closed, House Democrats could not contain their glee.       Several Democrats clapped; others cheered; and still others       raised exclamations of joy on the floor of the House of       Representatives--until the Speaker shamed them into       silence.\555\        The Framers foresaw clearly the possibility of such an       improper, partisan use of impeachment. As Hamilton       recognized, impeachment could be a powerful tool in the hands       of determined ``pre-existing factions.'' \556\ The Framers       fully recognized that ``the persecution of an intemperate or       designing majority in the House of Representatives'' was a       real danger.\557\ That is why they chose the Senate as the       tribunal for trying impeachments. Further removed from the       politics of the day than the House, they believed the Senate       could mitigate the ``danger that the decision'' to remove a       President would be based on the ``comparative strength of       parties'' rather ``than by the real demonstrations of       innocence or guilt.'' \558\ The Senate would thus ``guard[]       against the danger of persecution, from the prevalency of a       factious spirit'' in the House.\559\ It now falls to the       Senate to fulfill the role of guardian that the Framers       envisioned and to reject these wholly insubstantial Articles       of Impeachment that have been propelled forward by nothing       other than partisan enmity toward the President.      III. Article I Fails Because the Evidence Disproves House           Democrats' Claims        Despite House Democrats' unprecedented, rigged process, the       record they compiled clearly establishes that the President       did nothing wrong.        This entire impeachment charade centers on a telephone call       that President Trump had with President Zelensky of Ukraine       on July 25, 2019. There is no mystery about what happened on       that call, because the President has been completely       transparent: he released a transcript of the call months ago.       And that transcript shows conclusively that the call was       perfectly appropriate. Indeed, the person on the other end of       the call, President Zelensky, has confirmed in multiple       public statements that the call was perfectly normal. Before       they had even seen the transcript, though, House Democrats       concocted all their charges based on distortions peddled by a       so-called whistleblower who had no first-hand knowledge of       the call. And contrary to their claims, the transcript proves       that the President did not seek to use either security       assistance or a presidential meeting as leverage to pressure       Ukrainians to announce investigations on two subjects: (i)       possible Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election; or (ii)       an incident in which then-Vice President Biden had forced the       dismissal of a Ukrainian anti-corruption prosecutor who       reportedly had been investigating a company (Burisma) that       paid Biden's son, Hunter, to sit on its board.\560\ The       President did not even mention the security assistance on the       call, and he invited President Zelensky to the White House       without any condition whatsoever. When the President released       the transcript of the call on September 25, 2019, it cut the       legs out from under all of House Democrats' phony claims       about a quid pro quo. That should have ended this entire       matter.        Nevertheless, House Democrats forged ahead, determined to       gin up some other evidence to prop up their false narrative.       But even their rigged process failed to yield the evidence       they wanted. Instead, the record affirmatively refutes House       Democrats' claims. In addition to the transcript, the central       fact in this case is this: there are only two people who have       made statements on the record who say they spoke directly to       the President about the heart of this matter--Ambassador       Gordon Sondland and Senator Ron Johnson. And they both       confirmed that the President stated unequivocally that he       sought nothing and no quid pro quo of any kind from Ukraine.       House Democrats' claims are built entirely on speculation       from witnesses who had no direct knowledge about anything and       who never even spoke to the President about this matter.        House Democrats' charges also rest on the fundamentally       mistaken premise that it would have been illegitimate for the       President to ask President Zelensky about either: (i)       Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election or (ii) the       Biden-Burisma affair. That is obviously wrong. Asking another       country to examine potential interference in a past U.S.       election is always permissible. Similarly, it would not have       been improper for the President to ask the Ukrainians about       an incident in which Vice President Biden had threatened       withholding U.S. loan guarantees to secure the dismissal of a       prosecutor when Biden had been operating under, at the very       least, the appearance of a serious conflict of interest.   A. The Evidence Refutes Any Claim That the President Conditioned the  Release of Security Assistance on an Announcement of Investigations by                                  Ukraine         The evidence squarely refutes the made-up claim that the       President leveraged security assistance in exchange for       Ukraine announcing an investigation into either interference       in the 2016 election or the Biden-Burisma affair.    1. The July 25 Call Transcript Shows the President Did Nothing Wrong         The most important piece of evidence demonstrating the       President's innocence is the transcript of the President's       July 25 telephone call with President Zelensky. In an       unprecedented act of transparency, the President made that       transcript public months ago.\561\ President Trump did not       even mention the security assistance on the call, and he       certainly did not make any connection between the assistance       and any investigation. Instead, the record shows that he       raised two issues that are entirely consistent with both his       authority to conduct foreign relations and his longstanding       concerns about how the United States spends taxpayers' money       on foreign aid: burden-sharing and corruption.        Burden-sharing has been a consistent theme of the       President's foreign policy,\562\ and he raised burden-sharing       directly with President Zelensky, noting that ``Germany does       almost nothing for you'' and ``[a] lot of the European       countries are the same way.'' \563\ President Zelensky       acknowledged that European countries should be Ukraine's       biggest partner, but they surprisingly were not.\564\        President Trump also raised concerns about corruption. He       first raised these concerns in connection with reports of       Ukrainian actions in the 2016 presidential election. Numerous       media outlets have reported that Ukrainian officials took       steps to influence and interfere in the 2016 election to       undermine then-candidate Trump, and three Senate committee       chairmen are currently investigating this interference.\565\       President Trump raised ``this whole situation'' and noted       particularly that President Zelensky was ``surrounding       [him]self with some of the same people.'' \566\ President       Zelensky responded by noting that he had recalled the       Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States--an individual who       had sought to influence the U.S. election by authoring an       anti-Trump op-ed.\567\ As Democrats' witness Dr. Hill       testified, many officials in the State Department and NSC       were similarly concerned about individuals surrounding       Zelensky.\568\        The President also mentioned an incident involving then-      Vice President Joe Biden and a corruption investigation       involving Burisma.\569\ In that incident, a corruption       investigation involving Burisma had reportedly been stopped       after Vice President Biden threated to withhold one billion       dollars in U.S. loan guarantees unless the Ukrainian       government fired a prosecutor.\570\ At the time, Vice       President Biden's son, Hunter, was sitting on the Burisma's       board of directors.\571\ The fired prosecutor reportedly had       been investigating Burisma at the time.\572\ In fact, on July       22, 2019--just days before the July 25 call--The Washington       Post reported that the prosecutor ``said he believes his       ouster was because of his interest in [Burisma]'' and ``[h]ad       he remained in his post. . .he would have questioned Hunter  [[Page S332]]       Biden.'' \573\ The incident raised important issues for anti-      corruption efforts in Ukraine, as it raised at least the       possibility that a U.S. official may have been involved in       derailing a legitimate investigation of a foreign sovereign.        As these examples show, President Trump raised corruption       issues with President Zelensky. House Democrats' claim that       he did not address corruption because the incidents he raised       were ``not part of any official briefing materials or talking       points'' is nonsense.\574\ President Trump spoke       extemporaneously and used specific examples rather than       following boilerplate talking points proposed by the       NSC.\575\ That is the President's prerogative. He is not       bound to raise his concerns with a foreign leader in the       terms a staffer placed on a briefing card.        More important, President Zelensky has publicly confirmed       that he understood President Trump to be talking precisely       about corruption. On the call, President Zelensky       acknowledged that the incidents President Trump had raised       highlighted ``the issue of making sure to restore the       honesty.'' \576\ As President Zelensky later explained, he       understood President Trump to be saying ``we are tired of any       corruption things.'' \577\ President Zelensky explained that       his response was essentially, ``[w]e are not corrupt.'' \578\        In contrast to the explicit discussions about burden-      sharing and corruption, there was no discussion of the paused       security assistance on the July 25 call. To fill that gap,       House Democrats seize on President Zelensky's statement that       Ukraine was ``almost ready to buy more Javelins,'' and       President Trump's subsequent turn of the conversation as he       said, ``I would like you to do us a favor though because our       country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about       it.'' \579\ According to House Democrats, that sequence alone       somehow linked the security assistance to a ``favor'' for       President Trump relating to ``his reelection efforts.'' \580\       That is nonsense.        First, President Trump asked President Zelensky to ``do us       a favor,'' and he made clear that ``us'' referred to ``our       country'' as he put it, ``because our country has been       through a lot.'' \581\ Second, nothing in the flow of the       conversation suggests that the President was drawing a       connection between the Javelin sales and the next topics he       turned to.\582\ The President was clearly transitioning to a       new subject. Third, as Democrats' own witnesses conceded,       Javelins are not part of the security assistance that had       been temporarily paused.\583\ Accordingly, House Democrats'       assertion that ``President Trump froze'' Javelin sales       ``without explanation'' is demonstrably false.\584\ Fourth,       the President frequently uses variations of the phrase ``do       us a favor'' in the context of international diplomacy, and       the ``favors'' have nothing to do with the President's       personal interests.\585\ The President cannot be removed from       office because House Democrats deliberately misconstrue one       of his commonly used phrases.        Notably, multiple government officials were on the July 25       call, and only one of them--NSC Director for European Affairs       Alexander Vindman--raised any concerns at the time about the       substance of it.\586\ His concerns were based primarily on       policy disagreements and a misplaced belief that the       President of the United States should have deferred to him on       matters of foreign relations. Lt. Col. Vindman testified that       he had ``deep policy concerns'' \587\ about Ukraine retaining       bipartisan support,\588\ but he ultimately conceded that the       President not a staffer like him sets policy.\589\        Mr. Morrison, Lt. Col. Vindman's supervisor, affirmed that       ``there was nothing improper that occurred during the call.''       \590\ Similarly, National Security Advisor to the Vice       President Keith Kellogg said that he ``heard nothing wrong or       improper on the call.'' \591\   2. President Zelensky and Other Senior Ukrainian Officials Confirmed       There Was No -Quid Pro Quo and No Pressure on Them Concerning                               Investigations         The Ukrainian government also made clear that President       Trump did not connect security assistance and investigations       on the call. The Ukrainians' official statement did not       reflect any such link,\592\ and President Zelensky has been       crystal clear about this in his public statements. He has       explained that he ``never talked to the President from the       position of a quid pro quo'' \593\ and stated that they did       not discuss the security assistance on the call at all.\594\       Indeed, President Zelensky has confirmed several separate       times that his communications with President Trump were       ``good'' and ``normal,'' and ``no one pushed me.'' \595\ The       day after the call, President Zelensky met with Ambassador       Volker, Ambassador Sondland, and Ambassador Taylor in Kyiv.       Ambassador Volker reported that the Ukrainians ``thought [the       call] went well.'' \596\ Likewise, Ambassador Taylor reported       that President Zelensky stated that he was ``happy with the       call.'' \597\ And Ms. Croft, who met with President       Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Bohdan the day after the       call, heard from Bohdan that the call ``was a very good call,       very positive, they had good chemistry.'' \598\        Other high ranking Ukrainian officials confirmed that they       never perceived a connection between security assistance and       investigations. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko       stated his belief that ``there was no pressure,'' \599\ he       has ``never seen a direct link between investigations and       security assistance,'' and ``there was no clear connection       between these events.'' \600\ Similarly, when President       Zelensky's adviser, Andriy Yermak, was asked if ``he had ever       felt there was a connection between the U.S. military aid and       the requests for investigations,'' he was ``adamant'' that       ``[w]e never had that feeling'' and ``[w]e did not have the       feeling that this aid was connected to any one specific       issue.'' \601\  3. President Zelensky and Other Senior Ukrainian Officials Did Not Even             Know That the Security Assistance Had Been Paused         House Democrats' theory is further disproved because the       evidence shows that President Zelensky and other senior       Ukrainian officials did not even know that the aid had been       paused until more than a month after the July 25, 2019 call,       when the pause was reported in Politico at the end of       August.\602\ The Ukrainians could not have been pressured       by a pause on the aid they did not even know about.        The uniform and uncontradicted testimony from American       officials who actually interacted with President Zelensky and       other senior Ukrainian officials was that they had no reason       to think that Ukraine knew of the pause until more than a       month after the July 25 call. Ambassador Volker testified       that he ``believe[s] the Ukrainians became aware of the delay       on August 29 and not before.'' \603\ Ambassador Taylor agreed       that, to the best of his knowledge, ``nobody in the Ukrainian       Government became aware of a hold on military aid until . . .       August 29th.'' \604\ Mr. Morrison concurred, testifying that       he had ``no reason to believe the Ukrainians had any       knowledge of the review until August 28, 2019.'' \605\ Deputy       Assistant Secretary Kent and Ambassador Sondland agreed.\606\        Public statements from high-level Ukrainian officials have       confirmed the same point. For example, adviser to President       Zelensky Andriy Yermak told Bloomberg that President Zelensky       and his key advisers learned of the pause only from the       Politico article.\607\ And then-Foreign Minister Pavlo       Klimkin learned of the pause in the aid ``by reading a news       article,'' and Deputy Minister of Defense Oleh Shevchuk       learned ``through media reports.'' \608\        Further confirmation that the Ukrainians did not know about       the pause comes from the fact that the Ukrainians did not       raise the security assistance in any of the numerous high-      level meetings held over the summer--something Yermak told       Bloomberg they would have done had they known.\609\ President       Zelensky did not raise the issue in meetings with Ambassador       Taylor on either July 26 or August 27.\610\ And Volker--who       was in touch with the highest levels of the Ukrainian       government--explained that Ukrainian officials ``would       confide things'' in him and ``would have asked'' if they had       any questions about the aid.\611\ Things changed, however,       within hours of the publication of the Politico article, when       Yermak, a top adviser to President Zelensky, texted       Ambassador Volker to ask about the report.\612\        The House Democrats' entire theory falls apart because       President Zelensky and other officials at the highest levels       of the Ukrainian government did not even know about the       temporary pause until shortly before the President released       the security assistance. As Ambassador Volker said: ``I don't       believe . . . they were aware at the time, so there was no       leverage implied.'' \613\ These facts alone vindicate the       President.       4. House Democrats Rely Solely on Speculation Built on Hearsay         House Democrats' charge is further disproved by the       straightforward fact that not a single witness with actual       knowledge ever testified that the President suggested any       connection between announcing investigations and security       assistance. Assumptions, presumptions, and speculation based       on hearsay are all that House Democrats can rely on to spin       their tale of a quid pro quo.        House Democrats' claims are refuted first and foremost by       the fact that there are only two people with statements on       record who spoke directly with the President about the       matter--and both have confirmed that the President expressly       told them there was no connection whatsoever between the       security assistance and investigations. Ambassador Sondland       testified that he asked President Trump directly about these       issues, and the President explicitly told him that he did not       want anything from Ukraine:        I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.       Tell Zelensky to do the right thing . . . .\614\        Similarly, Senator Ron Johnson has said that he asked the       President ``whether there was some kind of arrangement where       Ukraine would take some action and the hold would be       lifted,'' and the answer was clear and ``[w]ithout       hesitation'': ``(Expletive deleted)--No way. I would never do       that.'' \615\        Although he did not speak to the President directly,       Ambassador Volker also explained that President Trump never       linked security assistance to investigations, and the       Ukrainians never indicated that they thought there was any       connection:        [Q.] Did the President of the United States ever say to you       that he was not going to allow aid from the United States to       go to [ ] Ukraine unless there were investigations into       Burisma, the Bidens, or the 2016 elections?        [A.] No, he did not.        [Q.] Did the Ukrainians ever tell you that they understood       that they would not get a  [[Page S333]]       meeting with the President of the United States, a phone call       with the President of the United States, military aid or       foreign aid from the United States unless they undertook       investigations of Burisma, the Bidens, or the 2016 elections?        [A.] No, they did not.\616\        Against all of that unequivocal testimony, House Democrats       base their case entirely on witnesses who offer nothing but       speculation. Worse, it is speculation that traces back to one       source: Sondland. Other witnesses repeatedly invoked things       that Ambassador Sondland had said in a chain of hearsay that       would never be admitted in any court. For example, Chairman       Schiff's leading witness, Ambassador Taylor, acknowledged       that, to the extent he thought there was a connection between       the security assistance and investigations, his information       came entirely from things that Sondland said--or (worse)       second-hand accounts of what Morrison told Taylor that       Sondland had said.\617\ Similarly, Morrison testified that he       ``had no reason to believe that the release of the security-      sector assistance might be conditioned on a public statement       reopening the Burisma investigation until [his] September 1,       2019, conversation with Ambassador Sondland.'' \618\        Sondland, however, testified unequivocally that ``the       President did not tie aid to investigations.'' Instead, he       acknowledged that any link that he had suggested was based       entirely on his own speculation, unconnected to any       conversation with the President:        [Q.] What about the aid? [Ambassador Volker] says that they       weren't tied, that the aid was not tied --        [A.] And I didn't say they were conclusively tied either. I       said I was presuming it.        [Q.] Okay. And so the President never told you they were       tied.        [A.] That is correct.        [Q.] So your testimony and [Ambassador Volker's] testimony       is consistent, and the President did not tie aid to       investigations.        [A.] That is correct.\619\        Indeed, Sondland testified that he did ``not recall any       discussions with the White House on withholding U.S. security       assistance from Ukraine in return for assistance with the       President's 2020 reelection campaign.'' \620\ And he       explained that he ``did not know (and still do[es] not       know) when, why, or by whom the aid was suspended,'' so he       just ``presumed that the aid suspension had become linked       to the proposed anti-corruption statement.'' \621\ In his       public testimony alone, Sondland used variations of       ``presume,'' ``assume,'' ``guess,'' or ``speculate'' over       thirty times. When asked if he had any ``testimony [] that       ties President Trump to a scheme to withhold aid from       Ukraine in exchange for these investigations,'' he stated       that he has nothing ``[o]ther than [his] own       presumption,'' and he conceded that ``[n]o one on this       planet told [him] that Donald Trump was tying aid to       investigations.'' \622\ House Democrats' assertion that       ``President Trump made it clear to Ambassador Sondland--      who conveyed this message to Ambassador Taylor--that       everything was dependent on such an announcement [of       investigations],'' simply misrepresents the       testimony.\623\        5. The Security Assistance Flowed Without Any Statement or                          Investigation by Ukraine         The made-up narrative that the security assistance was       conditioned on Ukraine taking some action on investigations       is further disproved by the straightforward fact that the aid       was released on September 11, 2019, without the Ukrainians       taking any action on investigations. President Zelensky never       made a statement about investigations, nor did anyone else in       the Ukrainian government. Instead, the evidence confirms that       the decision to release the aid was based on entirely       unrelated factors. See infra Part III.B. The paused aid,       moreover, was entirely distinct from U.S. sales of Javelin       missiles and thus had no effect on the supply of those arms       to Ukraine.\624\   6. President Trump's Record of Support for Ukraine Is Beyond Reproach         Part of House Democrats' baseless charge is that the       temporary pause on security assistance somehow ``compromised       the national security of the United States'' by leaving       Ukraine vulnerable to Russian aggression.\625\ The record       affirmatively disproves that claim. In fact, Chairman       Schiff's hearings established beyond a doubt that the Trump       Administration has been a stronger, more reliable friend to       Ukraine than the prior administration. Ambassador Yovanovitch       testified that ``our policy actually got stronger'' under       President Trump, largely because, unlike the Obama       administration, ``this administration made the decision to       provide lethal weapons to Ukraine'' to help Ukraine fend off       Russian aggression.\626\ Yovanovitch explained that ``we all       felt [that] was very significant.'' \627\ Ambassador Taylor       similarly explained that the aid package provided by the       Trump Administration was a ``substantial improvement'' over       the policy of the prior administration, because ``this       administration provided Javelin antitank weapons,'' which       ``are serious weapons'' that ``will kill Russian tanks.''       \628\ Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent agreed that Javelins       ``are incredibly effective weapons at stopping armored       advance, and the Russians are scared of them,'' \629\ and       Ambassador Volker explained that ``President Trump approved       each of the decisions made along the way,'' and as a result,       ``America's policy towards Ukraine strengthened.'' \630\ As       Senator Johnson has noted, President Trump capitalized on a       longstanding congressional authorization that President Obama       did not: ``In 2015, Congress overwhelmingly authorized $300       million of security assistance to Ukraine, of which $50       million was to be available only for lethal defensive       weaponry. The Obama administration never supplied the       authorized lethal defensive weaponry, but President Trump       did.'' \631\        Thus, any claim that President Trump put the security of       Ukraine at risk is flatly incorrect. The pause on security       assistance (which was entirely distinct from the Javelin       sales) was lifted by the end of the fiscal year, and the aid       flowed to Ukraine without any preconditions. Ambassador       Volker testified that the brief pause on releasing the aid       was ``not significant.'' \632\ And Under Secretary of State       for Political Affairs David Hale explained that ``this [was]       future assistance. . . . not to keep the army going now,''       disproving the false claim made by House Democrats that the       pause caused any harm to Ukraine over the summer.\633\ In       fact, according to Oleh Shevchuk, the Ukrainian Deputy       Minister of Defense who oversaw U.S. aid shipments, ``the       hold came and went so quickly'' that he did not notice any       change.\634\     B. The Administration Paused Security Assistance Based on Policy         Concerns and Released It After the Concerns Were Satisfied         What the evidence actually shows is that President Trump       had legitimate policy concerns about foreign aid. As Under       Secretary Hale explained, foreign aid to all countries was       undergoing a systematic review in 2019. As he put it, ``the       administration did not want to take a, sort of, business-as-      usual approach to foreign assistance, a feeling that once a       country has received a certain assistance package . . . it's       something that continues forever.'' \635\ Dr. Hill confirmed       this review and explained that ``there had been a directive       for whole-scale review of our foreign policy, foreign policy       assistance, and the ties between our foreign policy       objectives and the assistance. This had been going on       actually for many months.'' \636\        With regard to Ukraine, witnesses testified that President       Trump was concerned about corruption and whether other       countries were contributing their share.      1. Witnesses Testified That President Trump Had Concerns About                           Corruption in Ukraine         Contrary to the bald assertion in the House Democrats'       trial brief that ``[b]efore news of former Vice President       Biden's candidacy broke, President Trump showed no interest       in corruption in Ukraine,'' \637\ multiple witnesses       testified that the President has long had concerns about this       issue. Dr. Hill, for instance, testified that she ``think[s]       the President has actually quite publicly said that he was       very skeptical about corruption in Ukraine. And, in fact,       he's not alone, because everyone has expressed great concerns       about corruption in Ukraine.'' \638\ Similarly, Ambassador       Yovanovitch testified that ``we all'' had concerns about       corruption in Ukraine and noted that President Trump       delivered an anti-corruption message to former Ukraine       President Petro Poroshenko in their first meeting in the       White House on June 20, 2017.\639\ NSC Senior Director       Morrison confirmed that he ``was aware that the President       thought Ukraine had a corruption problem, as did many others       familiar with Ukraine.'' \640\ And Ms. Croft also heard the       President raise the issue of corruption directly with then-      President Poroshenko of Ukraine during a bilateral meeting at       the United Nations General Assembly in September 2017.\641\       She also understood the President's concern ``[t]hat Ukraine       is corrupt'' because she had been ``tasked[] and retasked''       by then-National Security Advisor General McMaster ``to write       [a] paper to help [McMaster] make the case to the President''       in connection with prior security assistance.\642\        Concerns about corruption in Ukraine were also entirely       justified. As Dr. Hill affirmed, ``eliminating corruption in       Ukraine was one of, if [not] the central, goals of U.S.       foreign policy'' in Ukraine.\643\ Virtually every witness       agreed that confronting corruption should be at the forefront       of U.S. policy with respect to Ukraine.\644\     2. The President Had Legitimate Concerns About Foreign Aid Burden-                Sharing, Including With Regard to Ukraine         President Trump also has well-documented concerns regarding       American taxpayers being forced to cover the cost of foreign       aid while other countries refuse to pitch in. In fact,       ``another factor in the foreign affairs review'' discussed by       Under Secretary Hale was ``appropriate burden sharing.''       \645\ The President's 2018 Budget discussed this precise       issue:        The Budget proposes to reduce or end direct funding for       international programs and organizations whose missions do       not substantially advance U.S. foreign policy interests. The       Budget also renews attention on the appropriate U.S. share       of international spending at the United Nations, at the       World Bank, and for many other global issues where the       United States currently pays more than its fair       share.\646\        Burden-sharing was reemphasized in the President's 2020       budget when it advocated for reforms that would ``prioritize       the efficient use of taxpayer dollars and increased burden-      sharing to rebalance U.S. contributions to international       organizations.'' \647\        House Democrats wrongly claim that ``[i]t was not until       September . . . that the hold, for the first time, was       attributed to the President's concern about other countries       not contributing more to Ukraine'' \648\ and  [[Page S334]]       that President Trump ``never ordered a review of burden-      sharing.'' \649\ These assertions are demonstrably false.        Mr. Morrison testified that he was well aware of the       President's ``skeptical view'' \650\ on foreign aid generally       and Ukrainian aid specifically. He affirmed that the       President was ``trying to scrutinize [aid] to make sure the       U.S. taxpayers were getting their money's worth'' and       explained that the President ``was concerned that the United       States seemed to--to bear the exclusive brunt of security       assistance to Ukraine. He wanted to see the Europeans step up       and contribute more security assistance.'' \651\        There is other evidence as well. In a June 24 email with       the subject line ``POTUS follow up,'' a Department of Defense       official relayed several questions from a meeting with the       President, including ``What do other NATO members spend to       support Ukraine?'' \652\ Moreover, as discussed above,       President Trump personally raised the issue of burden-sharing       with President Zelensky on July 25.\653\ Senator Johnson       similarly related that the President had shared concerns       about burden-sharing with him. He recounted an August 31       conversation in which President Trump described discussions       he would have with Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany.       According to Senator Johnson, President Trump explained:       ``Ron, I talk to Angela and ask her, `Why don't you fund       these things,' and she tells me, `Because we know you will.'       We're schmucks, Ron. We're schmucks.'' \654\ And Ambassador       Taylor testified that, when the Vice President met with       President Zelensky on September 1, the Vice President       reiterated that ``President Trump wanted the Europeans to do       more to support Ukraine.'' \655\        President Trump's burden-sharing concerns were entirely       legitimate. The evidence shows that the United States pays       more than its fair share for Ukrainian assistance. As Deputy       Assistant Secretary Cooper testified, ``U.S. contributions       [to Ukraine] are far more significant than any individual       country'' and ``EU funds tend to be on the economic side,''       rather than for ``defense and security.'' \656\ Even       President Zelensky noted in the July 25 call that the       Europeans were not helping Ukraine as much as they should and       certainly not as much as the United States.\657\       3. Pauses on Foreign Aid Are Often Necessary and Appropriate.         Placing a temporary pause on aid is not unusual. Indeed,       the President has often paused, re-evaluated, and even       canceled foreign aid programs. For example:        In September 2019, the Administration announced that it was       withholding over $100 million in aid to Afghanistan over       concerns about government corruption.\658\        In August 2019, President Trump announced that the       Administration and Seoul were in talks to ``substantially''       increase South Korea's share of the expense of U.S. military       support for South Korea.\659\        In June, President Trump cut or paused over $550 million in       foreign aid to El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala because       those countries were not fairly sharing the burdens of       preventing mass migration to the United States.\660\        In or around June, the Administration temporarily paused       $105 million in military aid to Lebanon. The Administration       lifted the hold in December, with one official explaining       that the Administration ``continually reviews and thoroughly       evaluates the effectiveness of all United States foreign       assistance to ensure that funds go toward activities that       further U.S. foreign policy and national security       interests.'' \661\        In September 2018, the Administration cancelled $300       million in military aid to Pakistan because it was not       meeting its counter-terrorism obligations.\662\        Indeed, Under Secretary Hale agreed that ``aid has been       withheld from several countries across the globe for various       reasons, and, in some cases, for reasons that are still       unknown just in the past year.'' \663\ Dr. Hill similarly       explained that ``there was a freeze put on all kinds of aid       and assistance because it was in the process at the time of       an awful lot of reviews of foreign assistance.'' \664\ She       added that, in her experience, ``stops and starts [are]       sometimes common . . . with foreign assistance'' and that       ``OMB [Office of Management and Budget] holds up dollars all       the time,'' including in the past for dollars going to       Ukraine.\665\ Similarly, Ambassador Volker affirmed that aid       gets ``held up from time-to-time for a whole assortment of       reasons,'' and explained that ``[i]t's something that had       happened in [his] career in the past.'' \666\        4. The aid was released after the President's concerns were       addressed.        To address President Trump's concerns about corruption and       burden-sharing, a temporary pause was placed on the aid to       Ukraine. Mr. Morrison testified that ``OMB represented that .       . . the President was concerned about corruption in Ukraine,       and he wanted to make sure that Ukraine was doing enough to       manage that corruption.'' \667\ And OMB Deputy Associate       Director for National Security Mark Sandy testified that he       understood the pause to have been a result of the President's       ``concerns about the contribution from other countries to       Ukraine.'' \668\        Over the course of the summer and early September, two       series of developments helped address the President's       concerns:        First, President Zelensky secured a majority in the       Ukrainian parliament and was able to begin reforms under his       anti-corruption agenda. As Mr. Morrison explained, when       Zelensky was first elected, there was real ``concern about       whether [he] would be a genuine reformer'' and ``whether he       would genuinely try to root out corruption.'' \669\ It was       also unclear whether President Zelensky's party would ``be       able to get a workable majority in the Ukrainian Parliament''       to implement the corruption reforms he promised.\670\ It was       only later in the summer that President's Zelensky's party       won a majority in the Rada--the Ukrainian parliament. As Mr.       Morrison testified, on ``the opening day of the [new] Rada,''       the Ukrainians worked through ``an all-night session'' to       move forward with concrete reforms.\671\ Indeed, Mr. Morrison       and Ambassador Bolton were in Kyiv on August 27, and Mr.       Morrison ``observed that everybody on the Ukrainian side of       the table was exhausted, because they had been up for days       working on . . . reform legislation.'' \672\ President       Zelensky ``named a new prosecutor general''--a reform that       the NSC was ``specifically interested in.'' \673\ He also       ``had his party introduce a spate of legislative reforms, one       of which was particularly significant,'' namely, ``stripping       Rada members of their parliamentary immunity.''       \674\ Additionally, the High Anti-Corruption Court of       Ukraine commenced its work on September 5, 2019.\675\        As a result of these developments, Mr. Morrison affirmed       that by Labor Day there had been ``definitive developments''       to ``demonstrate that President Zelensky was committed to the       issues he campaigned on.\676\        Second, the President heard from multiple parties about       Ukraine, including trusted advisers. Senator Johnson has said       that he spoke to the President on August 31 urging release of       the security assistance. Senator Johnson has stated that the       President told him then that, as to releasing the aid,       ``[w]e're reviewing it now, and you'll probably like my final       decision.'' \677\ On September 3, 2019, Senators Johnson and       Portman, along with other members of the Senate's bipartisan       Ukraine Caucus, wrote to the President concerning the status       of the aid,\678\ and on September 5 the Chairman and Ranking       Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee followed suit       with another letter.\679\        Most significantly, Mr. Morrison testified that the Vice       President advised the President that the relationship with       Zelensky ``is one that he could trust.'' \680\ The Vice       President had met with President Zelensky in Warsaw on       September 1 and had heard firsthand that the new Ukrainian       administration was taking concrete steps to address       corruption and burden-sharing. On corruption reform,       President Zelensky ``stated his strong commitment'' and       shared ``some of the things he had been doing,'' specifically       what his party had done in the ``2 or 3 days'' since the new       parliament had been seated.\681\ Morrison testified that, on       burden-sharing, ``President Zelensky agreed with Vice       President Pence that the Europeans should be doing more'' and       ``related to Vice President Pence conversations he'd been       having with European leaders about getting them to do more.''       \682\        Moreover, on September 11, 2019, the President heard       directly from Senator Portman.\683\ Mr. Morrison testified       that Senator Portman made ``the case . . . to the President       that it was the appropriate and prudent thing to do'' to lift       the pause on the aid.\684\ He testified that the Vice       President (who had just returned from Europe on September 6)       and Senator Portman thus ``convinced the President that the       aid should be disbursed immediately'' \685\--and the       temporary pause was lifted after the meeting.\686\    C. The Evidence Refutes House Democrats' Claim that President Trump      Conditioned a Meeting with President Zelensky on Investigations         Lacking any evidence to show a connection between releasing       the security assistance and investigations, House Democrats       fall back on the alternative theory that President Trump used       a bilateral meeting as leverage to pressure Ukraine to       announce investigations. But no witness with any direct       knowledge supported that claim either. It is undisputed that       a bilateral presidential-level meeting was scheduled for       September 1 in Warsaw and then took place in New York City on       September 25, 2019,\687\ without Ukraine saying or doing       anything related to investigations.          1. A Presidential Meeting Occurred Without Precondition         Contrary to House Democrats' claims, the evidence shows       that a bilateral meeting between President Trump and       President Zelensky was scheduled without any connection to       any statement about investigations.        Mr. Morrison--whose ``responsibilities'' included       ``help[ing] arrange head of state visits to the White House       or other head of state meetings'' \688\--testified that he       was trying to schedule a meeting without any restrictions       related to investigations. He testified that he understood       that arranging ``the White House visit'' was a ``do-out''       that ``came from the President'' on the July 25 call,\689\       and he moved forward with a scheduling proposal.\690\ He       worked with Ambassador Taylor and the NSC's Senior Director       responsible for visits to ``determine dates that would be       mutually agreeable to President Trump and President       Zelensky.'' \691\ But due to competing scheduling requests,       ``it became clear that the earliest opportunity for the two       Presidents to meet would be in Warsaw'' at the beginning of       September.\692\ In other words, Mr. Morrison made it clear       that he  [[Page S335]]       was trying to schedule the meeting in the ordinary course. He       did not say that anyone told him to delay scheduling the       meeting until President Zelensky had made some announcement       about investigations. Instead, he explained that, after the       July 25 call, he understood that it was the President's       direction to schedule a visit, and he proceeded to execute       that direction.        Ultimately, the notion that a bilateral meeting between       President Trump and President Zelensky was conditioned on a       statement about investigations is refuted by one       straightforward fact: a meeting was planned for September 1,       2019 in Warsaw without the Ukrainians saying a word about       investigations. As Ambassador Volker testified,       Administration officials were ``working on a bilateral       meeting to take place in Warsaw on the margins of the       commemoration on the beginning of World War II.'' \693\       Indeed, by mid-August, U.S. officials expected the meeting to       occur,\694\ and the Ukrainian government was making       preparations.\695\ As it turned out, President Trump had to       stay in the U.S. because Hurricane Dorian rapidly intensified       to a Category 5 hurricane, so he sent the Vice President to       Warsaw in his place.\696\        Even that natural disaster did not put off the meeting       between the Presidents for long. They met at the next       earliest possible date--September 25, 2019, on the sidelines       of the United Nations General Assembly. President Zelensky       confirmed that there were no preconditions for this       meeting.\697\ Nor was there anything unusual about the       meeting occurring in New York rather than Washington. As       Ambassador Volker verified, ``these meetings between       countries sometimes take a long time to get scheduled'' and       ``[i]t sometimes just doesn't happen.'' \698\        House Democrats cannot salvage their claim by arguing that       the high-profile meeting in New York City did not count and       that only an Oval Office meeting would do. Dr. Hill explained       that what mattered was a bilateral presidential meeting, not       the location of the meeting:        [I]t wasn't always a White House meeting per se, but       definitely a Presidential-level, you know, meeting with       Zelensky and the President. I mean, it could've taken place       in Poland, in Warsaw. It could've been, you know, a proper       bilateral in some other context. But in other words, a White       House-level Presidential meeting.\699\        The Ukrainians had such a meeting scheduled for September 1       in Warsaw (until Hurricane Dorian disrupted plans), and the       meeting took place on September 25 in New York--all without       anyone making any statement about investigations.    2. No Witness With Direct Knowledge Testified that President Trump            Conditioned a Presidential Meeting on Investigations         House Democrats' tale of a supposed quid pro quo involving       a presidential meeting is further undermined by the fact that       it rests entirely on mere speculation, hearsay, and innuendo.       Not a single witness provided any first-hand evidence that       the President ever linked a presidential meeting to       announcing investigations.        Once again, House Democrats' critical witness--Sondland--      actually destroys their case. He is the only witness who       spoke directly to President Trump on the subject. And       Sondland testified that, when he broadly asked the President       what he wanted from Ukraine, the President answered       unequivocally: ``I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I       just want Zelensky to do the right thing, to do what he ran       on.'' \700\        Sondland clearly stated that ``the President never       discussed'' a link between investigations and a White House       meeting,\701\ and Sondland's mere presumptions about such a       link are not evidence. As he put it, the most he could do is       ``repeat . . . what [he] heard through Ambassador Volker from       Giuliani,'' \702\ who, he ``presumed,'' spoke to the       President on this issue.\703\ But Ambassador Volker testified       unequivocally that there was no connection between the       meeting and investigations:        Q. Did President Trump ever withhold a meeting with       President Zelensky or delay a meeting with President Zelensky       until the Ukrainians committed to investigate the allegations       that you just described concerning the 2016 Presidential       election?        A. The answer to the question is no, if you want a yes-or-      no answer. But the reason the answer is no is we did have       difficulty scheduling a meeting, but there was no linkage       like that.        Q. You said that you were not aware of any linkage between       the delay in the Oval Office meeting between President Trump       and President Zelensky and the Ukrainian commitment to       investigate the two allegations as you described them,       correct?        A. Correct.\704\        Sondland confirmed the same point. When asked if ``the       President ever [told him] personally about any preconditions       for anything,'' Sondland responded, ``No.'' \705\ And when       asked if the President ever ``told [him] about any       preconditions for a White House meeting,'' he again       responded, ``[p]ersonally, no.'' \706\ No credible testimony       has been advanced supporting House Democrats' claim of a quid       pro quo.  D. House Democrats' Charges Rest on the False Premise That There Could      Have Been No Legitimate Purpose To Ask President Zelensky About  Ukrainian Involvement in the 2016 Election and the Biden-Burisma Affair         The charges in Article I are further flawed because they       rest on the transparently erroneous proposition that it would       have been illegitimate for the President to mention two       matters to President Zelensky: (i) possible Ukrainian       interference in the 2016 election; and (ii) an incident in       which then-Vice President Biden forced the dismissal of a       Ukrainian anti-corruption prosecutor who reportedly had been       investigating Burisma. House Democrats' characterizations of       the President's conversation are false. Moreover, as House       Democrats frame their charges, to prove the element of       ``corrupt motive'' at the heart of Article I, they must       establish (in their own words) that the only reason for       raising those matters would have been ``to obtain an improper       personal political benefit.'' \707\ And as they cast their       case, any investigation into those matters would have been       ``bogus'' or a ``sham'' because, according to House       Democrats, neither investigation would have been ``premised       on any legitimate national security or foreign policy       interest.'' \708\ That is obviously incorrect.        It would have been entirely proper for the President to ask       President Zelensky to find out about any role that Ukraine       played in the 2016 presidential election. Uncovering       potential foreign interference in U.S. elections is always a       legitimate goal. Similarly, it also would have been proper to       ask about an incident in which Vice President Biden actually       leveraged the threat of withholding one billion dollars in       U.S. loan guarantees to secure the dismissal of a Ukrainian       prosecutor who was reportedly investigating Burisma--at a       time when his son, Hunter, was earning vast sums for sitting       on Burisma's board.\709\ House Democrats' own witnesses       established ample justification for asking questions about       the Biden-Burisma affair, as they acknowledged that Vice       President Biden's conduct raises, at the very least, the       appearance of a conflict of interest.\710\      1. It Was Entirely Appropriate for President Trump To Ask About            Possible Ukrainian Interference in the 2016 Election         House Democrats' theory that it would have been improper       for President Trump to ask President Zelensky about any role       that Ukraine played in interfering with the 2016 election       makes no sense. Uncovering any form of foreign interference       in a U.S. presidential election is squarely a matter of       national interest. In this case, moreover, there is abundant       information already in the public domain suggesting that       Ukrainian officials systematically sought to interfere in the       2016 election to support one candidate: Hillary Clinton.        To give just a few examples, a former Democratic National       Committee (DNC) consultant, Alexandra Chalupa, admitted to a       reporter that Ukraine's embassy in the United States was       ``helpful'' in her efforts to collect dirt on President       Trump's then-campaign manager, Paul Manafort.\711\ As       Politico reported, ``Chalupa said the [Ukrainian] embassy       also worked directly with reporters researching Trump,       Manafort and Russia to point them in the right directions.''       \712\ A former political officer in that embassy also claimed       the Ukrainian government coordinated directly with the DNC to       assist the Clinton campaign in advance of the 2016       presidential election.\713\ And Nellie Ohr, a former       researcher for the firm that hired a foreign spy to produce       the Steele Dossier, testified to Congress that Serhiy       Leshchenko, then a member of Ukraine's Parliament, also       provided her firm with information as part of the firm's       opposition research on behalf of the DNC and the Clinton       Campaign.\714\ Even high-ranking Ukrainian government       officials played a role. For example, Arsen Avakov, Ukraine's       Minister of Internal Affairs, called then-candidate Trump       ``an even bigger danger to the US than terrorism.'' \715\        At least two news organizations conducted their own       investigations and concluded Ukraine's government sought to       interfere in the 2016 election. In January 2017, Politico       concluded that ``Ukrainian government officials tried to help       Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning       his fitness for office.'' \716\ And on the other side of the       Atlantic, a separate investigation by The Financial Times       confirmed Ukrainian election interference. The newspaper       found that opposition to President Trump led ``Kiev's wider       political leadership to do something they would never have       attempted before: intervene, however indirectly, in a US       election.'' \717\ These efforts were designed to undermine       Trump's candidacy because, as one member of the Ukrainian       parliament put it, the majority of Ukrainian politicians were       ``on Hillary Clinton's side.'' \718\        Even one of House Democrats' own witnesses, Dr. Hill,       acknowledged that some Ukrainian officials ``bet on Hillary       Clinton winning the election,'' and so it was ``quite       evident'' that ``they were trying to curry favor with the       Clinton campaign,'' including by ``trying to collect       information . . . on Mr. Manafort and on other people as       well.'' \719\        If even a fraction of all this is true, Ukrainian       interference in the 2016 election is squarely a matter of       national interest. It is well settled that the United States       has a ``compelling interest . . . in limiting the       participation of foreign citizens in activities of American       democratic self-government, and in thereby preventing foreign       influence over the U.S. political process.'' \720\ Congress       has forbidden foreigners' involvement in American       elections.\721\ And President Trump made clear more than a       year ago that ``the United States will not tolerate any form       of foreign meddling in our elections'' during his       Administration.\722\ Even Chairman Schiff is on  [[Page S336]]       record agreeing that the Ukrainian efforts to aid the Clinton       campaign described above would be ``problematic,'' if       true.\723\        A request for Ukraine's assistance in this case also would       have been particularly appropriate because the Department of       Justice had already opened a probe on a similar subject       matter to examine the origins of foreign interference in the       2016 election that led to the false Russian-collusion       allegations against the Trump Campaign. In May of last year,       Attorney General Barr publicly announced that he had       appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead a review of the       origins and conduct of the Department of Justice's Russia       investigation and targeting of members of the Trump campaign,       including any potential wrongdoing.\724\ As of October, it       was publicly revealed that aspects of the probe had shifted       to a criminal investigation.\725\ As the White House       explained when the President announced measures to ensure       cooperation across the federal government with Mr. Durham's       probe, his investigation will ``ensure that all Americans       learn the truth about the events that occurred, and the       actions that were taken, during the last Presidential       election and will restore confidence in our public       institutions.'' \726\        Asking for foreign assistance is also routine. Such       requests for cooperation are common and take many different       forms, both formal and informal.\727\ Requests can be made       pursuant to a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, and the U.S.       has such a treaty with Ukraine that specifically authorizes       requests for cooperation.\728\ There can also be informal       requests for assistance.\729\ Because the President is the       Chief Executive and chief law enforcement officer of the       federal government--as well as the ``sole organ of the       federal government in the field of international relations''       \730\--requesting foreign assistance is well within his       ordinary role.        Given the self-evident national interest at stake in       identifying any Ukrainian role in the 2016 election, House       Democrats resort to distorting the President's words. They       strain to recast his request to uncover historical truth       about the last election as if it were something relevant only       for the President's personal political interest in the next       election. Putting words in the President's mouth, House       Democrats pretend that, because the President mentioned a       hacked DNC server, he must have been pursuing a claim that       Ukraine ``rather than Russia'' had interfered in the 2016       election \731\--and that assertion, they claim, was relevant       solely for boosting President Trump's 2020 presidential       campaign. But that convoluted chain of reasoning is       hopelessly flawed.        To start, simply asking about any Ukrainian involvement in       the 2016 election--including with respect to hacking a DNC       server--does not imply that Russia did not attempt to       interfere with the 2016 election. It is entirely possible       that foreign nationals from more than one country sought to       interfere in our election by different means (or coordinated       means), and for different reasons. Uncovering all the facts       about any interference benefits the United States by laying       bare all foreign attempts to meddle in our elections. And if       the facts uncovered end up having any influence on the 2020       election, that would not be improper. House Democrats cannot       place an inquiry into historical facts off limits based on       fears that the facts might harm their interests in the next       election.        In addition, House Democrats have simply misrepresented       President Trump's words. The President did not ask narrowly       about a DNC server alone, but rather raised a whole       collection of issues related to the 2016 election. President       Trump introduced the topic by noting that ``our country has       been through a lot,'' \732\ which referred to the entire       Mueller investigation and false allegations about the Trump       Campaign colluding with Russia. He then broadly expressed       interest in ``find[ing] out what happened with this whole       situation'' with Ukraine.\733\ After mentioning a DNC server,       the President made clear that he was casting a wider net as       he said that ``[t]here are a lot of things that went on'' and       again indicated that he was interested in ``the whole       situation.'' \734\ He then noted his concern that President       Zelensky was ``surrounding [him]self with some of the same       people.'' \735\ President Zelensky clearly understood this to       be a reference to Ukrainian officials who had sought to       undermine then-candidate Trump during the campaign, as he       responded by immediately noting that he ``just recalled our       ambassador from [the] United States.'' \736\ That ambassador,       of course, had penned a harsh, undiplomatic op-ed criticizing       then-candidate Trump, and it had been widely reported that a       DNC operative met with Ukrainian embassy officials during the       campaign to dig up information detrimental to President       Trump's campaign.\737\        Notably, Democrats have not always believed that asking       Ukraine for assistance in uncovering foreign election       interference constituted a threat to the Republic. To the       contrary, in 2018, three Democratic Senators--Senators       Menendez, Leahy, and Durbin--asked Ukraine to cooperate with       the Mueller investigation and ``strongly encourage[d]'' then-      Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko to ``halt any efforts to       impede cooperation.'' \738\ Not a single Democrat in either       house has called for sanctions against them. Nothing that       President Trump said went further than the senators' request,       and efforts to claim that it was somehow improper are rank       hypocrisy.  2. It Would Have Been Appropriate for President Trump To Ask President                  Zelensky About the Biden-Burisma Affair         House Democrats' theory that there could not have been any       legitimate basis for a President of the United States to       raise the Biden-Burisma affair with President Zelensky is       also wrong. The following facts have been publicly reported:        Burisma is a Ukrainian energy company with a reputation for       corruption. Lt. Col. Vindman called it a ``corrupt entity.''       \739\ It was founded by a corrupt oligarch, Mykola       Zlochevsky, who has been under several investigations for       money laundering.\740\        Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kent testified that       Burisma's reputation was so poor that he dissuaded the United       States Agency for International Development (USAID) from co-      sponsoring an event with Burisma. He testified that he did       not think co-sponsorship with a company of Burisma's       reputation was ``appropriate for the U.S. Government.'' \741\        In April 2014, Hunter Biden was recruited to sit on       Burisma's board.\742\ At that time, his father had just been       made the ``public face of the [Obama] administration's       handling of Ukraine,'' \743\ and Britain's Serious Fraud       Office (SFO) had just recently frozen $23 million in accounts       linked to Zlochevsky as part of a money-laundering       investigation.\744\ Zlochesvsky fled Ukraine sometime in       2014.\745\        Hunter Biden had no known qualifications for serving on       Burisma's board of directors, and just two months before       joining the board, he had been discharged from the Navy       Reserve for testing positive for cocaine on a drug test.\746\       He himself admitted in a televised interview that he would       not have gotten the board position ``if [his] last name       wasn't Biden.'' \747\        Nevertheless, Hunter Biden was paid more than board members       at energy giants like ConocoPhillips.\748\        Multiple witnesses said it appeared that Burisma hired       Hunter Biden for improper reasons.\749\        Hunter's role on the board raised red flags in several       quarters. Chris Heinz, the step-son of then-Secretary of       State John Kerry, severed his business relationship with       Hunter, citing Hunter's ``lack of judgment'' in joining the       Burisma board as ``a major catalyst.'' \750\        Contemporaneous press reports openly speculated that       Hunter's role with Burisma might undermine U.S. efforts--led       by his father--to promote an anti-corruption message in       Ukraine.\751\ Indeed, The Washington Post reported that       ``[t]he appointment of the vice president's son to a       Ukrainian oil board looks nepotistic at best, nefarious at       worst.'' \752\        Within the Obama Administration, Hunter's position caused       the special envoy for energy policy, Amos Hochstein, to       ``raise[] the matter with Biden.'' \753\ Deputy Assistant       Secretary of State Kent testified that he, too, voiced       concerns with Vice President Biden's office.\754\        In fact, every witness who was asked agreed that Hunter's       role created at least the appearance of a conflict of       interest for his father.\755\        On February 2, 2016, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General       obtained a court order to seize Zlochevsky's property.\756\        According to press reports, Vice President Biden then spoke       with Ukraine's President Poroshenko three times by telephone       on February 11, 18, and 19, 2016.\757\        Vice President Biden has openly bragged that, around that       time, he threatened President Poroshenko that he would       withhold one billion dollars in U.S. loan guarantees unless       the Ukrainians fired the Prosecutor General who was       investigating Burisma.\758\        Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent testified that the       Prosecutor General's removal ``became a condition of the loan       guarantee.'' \759\        On March 29, 2016, Ukraine's parliament dismissed the       Prosecutor General.\760\ In September 2016, a Kiev court       cancelled an arrest warrant for Zlochevsky.\761\        In January 2017, Burisma announced that all cases against       the company and Zlochevsky had been closed.\762\        On these facts, it would have been wholly appropriate for       the President to ask President Zelensky about the whole       Biden-Burisma affair. The Vice President of the United       States, while operating under an apparent conflict of       interest, had possibly used a billion dollars in U.S. loan       guarantees to force the dismissal of a prosecutor who may       have been pursuing a legitimate corruption investigation. In       fact, on July 22, 2019--just days before the July 25 call--      The Washington Post reported that the fired prosecutor ``said       he believes his ouster was because of his interest in       [Burisma]'' and ``[h]ad he remained in his post . . . he       would have questioned Hunter Biden.'' \763\ Even if the Vice       President's motives were pure, the possibility that a U.S.       official used his position to derail a meritorious       investigation made the Biden-Burisma affair a legitimate       subject to raise. Indeed, any President would have wanted to       make clear both that the United States was not placing any       inquiry into the incident off limits and that, in the future,       there would be no efforts by U.S. officials do something as       ``horrible'' as strong-arming Ukraine into dropping       corruption investigations while operating under an obvious       conflict of interest.\764\        As the transcript shows, President Zelensky recognized       precisely the point. He responded to President Trump by       noting that ``[t]he issue of the investigation of the case is       actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty[.]''       \765\  [[Page S337]]         It is absurd for House Democrats to argue that any       reference to the Biden-Burisma affair had no purpose other       than damaging the President's potential political opponent.       The two participants on the call--the leaders of two       sovereign nations--clearly understood the discussion to       advance the U.S. foreign policy interest in ensuring that       Ukraine's new President felt free, in President Zelensky's       words, to ``restore the honesty'' to corruption       investigations.\766\        Moreover, House Democrats' accusations rest on the false       and dangerous premise that Vice President Biden somehow       immunized his conduct (and his son's) from any scrutiny by       declaring his run for the presidency. There is no such rule       of law. It certainly was not a rule applied when President       Trump was a candidate. His political opponents called for       investigations against him and his children almost       daily.\767\ Nothing in the law requires the government to       turn a blind eye to potential wrongdoing based on a person's       status as a candidate for President of the United States. If       anything, the possibility that Vice President Biden may       ascend to the highest office in the country provides a       compelling reason for ensuring that, when he forced Ukraine       to fire its Prosecutor General, his family was not corruptly       benefitting from his actions.        Importantly, mentioning the whole Biden-Burisma affair       would have been entirely justified as long as there was a       reasonable basis to think that looking into the matter would       advance the public interest. To defend merely asking a       question, the President would not bear any burden of showing       that Vice President Biden (or his son) actually committed any       wrongdoing.        By contrast, under their own theory of the case, for the       House Managers to carry their burden of proving that merely       raising the matter was ``illegitimate,'' they would have to       prove that raising the issue could have no legitimate purpose       whatsoever. Their theory is obviously false. And especially       on this record, the House Managers cannot possibly carry that       burden, because no such definitive proof exists. Nobody, not       even House Democrats' own witnesses, could testify that the       Bidens' conduct did not at least facially raise an appearance       of a conflict of interest. And while House Democrats       repeatedly insist that any suggestions that Vice President       Biden or his son did anything wrong are ``debunked conspiracy       theories'' and ``without merit,'' \768\ they lack any       evidence to support those bald assertions, because they       have steadfastly cut off any real inquiry into the Bidens'       conduct. For example, they have refused to call Hunter       Biden to testify.\769\ Instead, they have been adamant       that Americans must simply accept the diktat that the       Bidens' conduct could not possibly have been part of a       course of conduct in which the Office of the Vice       President was misused to protect the financial interests       of a family member.        The Senate cannot accept House Democrats' mere say-so as       proof. Especially in the context of this wholly partisan       impeachment, House Democrats' assurance of, ``trust us,       there's nothing to see here,'' is not a permissible       foundation for building a case to remove a duly elected       President from office--especially given Chairman Schiff's       track record for making false claims in order to damage the       President.\770\      IV. The Articles Are Structurally Deficient and Can Only           Result in Acquittal        The Articles also suffer from a fatal structural defect.       Put simply, the articles are impermissibly duplicitous--that       is, each article charges multiple different acts as possible       grounds for sustaining a conviction.\771\ The problem with an       article offering such a menu of options is that the       Constitution requires two-thirds of Senators present to agree       on the specific basis for conviction. A vote on a duplicitous       article, however, could never provide certainty that a two-      thirds majority had actually agreed upon a ground for       conviction. Instead, such a vote could be the product of an       amalgamation of votes resting on several different theories,       no single one of which would have garnered two-thirds support       if it had been presented separately. Accordingly, duplicitous       articles like those exhibited here are facially       unconstitutional.    A. The Constitution Requires Two-Thirds of Senators To Agree on the     Specific Act that Is the Basis for Conviction and Thus Prohibits                            Duplicitous Articles         In impeachment trials, the Constitution mandates that ``no       Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two       thirds of the Members present.'' \772\ That provision       requires two-thirds agreement on the specific act that       warrants conviction. That is why the Senate has repeatedly       made clear in prior impeachments that acquittal is required       when duplicitous articles are presented.        In the Clinton impeachment,\773\ for example, Senator Carl       Levin explained his vote to acquit by pointing out that the       House had ``made a significant and irreparable mistake in the       actual drafting of the articles.'' \774\ Because each article       alleged multiple acts of wrongdoing, it would be       ``impossible'' ever to determine ``whether a two-thirds       majority of the Senate actually agreed on a particular       allegation.'' \775\ Senator Charles Robb echoed those       concerns, explaining that ``the unconstitutional bundling of       charges'' in these articles ``violates this constitutional       requirement'' of two-thirds agreement to convict.\776\ As he       pointed out, because Article II, in particular, ``contain[ed]       7 subparts each alleging a separate act of obstruction of       justice, the bundling of these allegations would allow       removal of the President if only 10 Senators agreed on each       of the 7 separate subparts.'' \777\ Senator Chris Dodd       agreed, explaining that ``[t]his smorgasbord approach to the       allegations'' was a threshold legal flaw that even called for       dismissal outright and pointed to the ``deeply troubling       prospect'' of ``convict[ing] and remov[ing] without two-      thirds of the Senate agreeing on precisely what [the       President] did wrong.'' \778\        The Senate similarly rejected a duplicitous article against       President Andrew Johnson. That article alleged that Johnson       had declared in a speech that the Thirty-Ninth Congress was       not lawful and that he committed three different acts in       pursuit of that declaration.\779\ In opposing the article,       Senator John Henderson emphasized ``the great difficulty''       presented by the omnibus article in ascertaining ``what it       really charges.'' \780\ Senator Garrett Davis similarly       complained that the allegations were apparently ``drawn with       studied looseness, duplicity, and vagueness, as with the       purpose to mislead'' and should have ``been separately'' and       ``distinctly stated.'' \781\        The Senate has also rejected unconstitutionally duplicitous       articles of impeachment against judges. In the impeachment of       Judge Nixon, for example, Senator Frank Murkowski rejected       the ``the omnibus nature of article III,'' which charged the       judge with making multiple different false statements, and he       ``agree[d] with the argument that the article could easily be       used to convict Judge Nixon by less than the super majority       vote required by the Constitution.'' \782\ Senator Herbert       Kohl explained why this defect was fatal: ``The House is       telling us that it's OK to convict Judge Nixon on [the       article] even if we have different visions of what he did       wrong. But that's not fair to Judge Nixon, to the Senate, or       to the American people.'' \783\             B. The Articles Are Unconstitutionally Duplicitous         Here, each Article is impermissibly duplicitous. Each       Article presents a smorgasbord of multiple, independent acts       as possible bases for conviction. Under the umbrella charge       of ``abuse of power,'' Article I offers Senators a menu of at       least four different bases for conviction: (1) ``corruptly''       requesting that Ukraine announce an investigation into the       Biden-Burisma affair; (2) ``corruptly'' requesting that       Ukraine announce an investigation into alleged Ukrainian       interference in the 2016 election; (3) ``corrupt[ly]''       conditioning the release of Ukraine's security assistance on       these investigations; and (4) ``corrupt[ly]'' conditioning a       White House meeting on these investigations.\784\ Article II       similarly invites Senators to pick and choose among at least       10 different bases for obstruction including: (1) directing       the White House and agencies, ``without lawful cause or       excuse,'' not to produce documents in response to a       congressional subpoena; or (2) directing one or more of nine       different individuals, ``without lawful cause or excuse,''       not to testify in response to a congressional subpoena.\785\        As a result, the Articles invite the danger of an       unconstitutional conviction if less than two-thirds of       Senators agree that any particular act was an abuse of power       or obstruction. With at least four independent bases alleged       for abuse of power, Article I invites conviction if as few as       18 Senators agree that any one alleged act occurred and       constituted an abuse of power.        The deficiency in the articles cannot be remedied by       dividing the articles, because that is prohibited.\786\ The       only constitutional option is to reject the articles and       acquit the President.                                  CONCLUSION         The Articles of Impeachment presented by House Democrats       are constitutionally deficient on their face. The theories       underpinning them would do lasting damage to the separation       of powers under the Constitution and to our structure of       government. The Articles are also the product of an       unprecedented and unconstitutional process that denied the       President every basic right guaranteed by the Due Process       Clause and fundamental principles of fairness. These Articles       reflect nothing more than the ``persecution of an intemperate       or designing majority in the House of Representatives'' \787\       that the Framers warned against. The Senate should reject the       Articles of Impeachment and acquit the President immediately.            Respectfully submitted,      Jay Alan Sekulow,        Counsel to President Donald J.

Alexander Hamilton's description in Federalist No. 65       does not support House Democrats' theory of a vague abuse-of-      power offense. In an often-cited passage, Hamilton observed       that the subjects of impeachment are ``offenses which proceed       from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from       the abuse or violation of some public trust.'' The Federalist       No. 65, at 396 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed.,       1961). Hamilton was merely noting fundamental characteristics       common to impeachable offenses--that they involve (or       ``proceed from'') misconduct in public office or abuse of       public trust. He was no more saying that ``abuse or violation       of some public trust'' provided, in itself, the definition of       a chargeable offense than he was saying that ``misconduct of       public men'' provided such a definition.        181.

He had been charged with purported       offenses that turned largely on claims that he had misapplied       the law in his rulings while sitting as a circuit justice.       See William H. Rehnquist, Grand Inquests 76-77, 114 (1992).       His acquittal has been credited with having ``a profound       effect on the American judiciary,'' because the Senate's       rejection of the charges was widely viewed as       ``safeguard[ing] the independence'' of federal judges.

The offense of bribery, of course, involves an element       of intent, and thus requires some evaluation of the accused's       motivations and state of mind. See 4 Blackstone, Commentaries       *139 (``BRIBERY . . . is when a judge, or other person       concerned in the administration of justice, takes any undue       reward to influence his behavior in his office.''). There is       a wide gulf, however, between proving a specific offense such       as bribery that involves wrongful conduct along with the       requisite intent and House Democrats' radical theory that any       lawful action may be treated as an impeachable offense based       on a characterization of subjective intent alone.        207.

This concealment required perjury,       destruction of evidence, obstruction of justice--all of which       are crimes.'' Id. at 33-34.        215. Id. at 3. While the House Judiciary Committee's report       described Article II generally as involving ``abuse of the       powers of the office of President,'' id. at 139, it is       significant that the actual charge the Judiciary Committee       specified in the recommended article of impeachment was not       framed in terms of that amorphous concept. To the contrary,       the article of impeachment itself charged unlawful actions       and dropped the vague terminology of ``abuse of power.''        216. The third recommended article charged President Nixon       with defying congressional subpoenas ``without lawful cause       or excuse'' and asserted that the President had violated the       assignment of the ``sole power of impeachment'' to the House       by resisting subpoenas. Id. at 4. It also provides no       precedent for House Democrats' abuse-of-power theory.        217. See, e.g., Debate on Articles of Impeachment: Hearings       Before the H.R. Comm. on the Judiciary, 93d Cong. 412 (1974)       (statement of Rep.

Even the source they cite undermines House Democrats'       theories. Tribe and Matz explain that one of the most       important lessons from Johnson's impeachment is ``it really       does matter which acts are identified in articles of       impeachment'' and that impeachment proceedings are       ``technical and legalistic.''

Even if President       Johnson's impeachment did support House Democrats' novel       theory--which it does not--it does not provide a model to be       emulated. As House Democrats' hand-picked expert, Professor       Michael Gerhardt, has explained, the Johnson impeachment is a       ``dubious precedent'' because it is ``widely regarded as       perhaps the most intensely partisan impeachment rendered by       the House''--at least until now.

Gerhardt, The       Federal Impeachment Process 179 (3d ed. 2019); see also       Berger, supra note 174, at 295 (``The impeachment and trial       of Andrew Johnson, to my mind, represent a gross abuse of the       impeachment process. . . .''); Jonathan Turley, Democrats       Repeat Failed History with Mad Dash to Impeach Donald Trump,       The Hill (Dec. 17, 2019), https://perma.cc/4Y3X-FCBW (``The       Johnson case has long been widely regarded as the very       prototype of an abusive impeachment. . . . Some critics have       actually cited Johnson as precedent to show that impeachment       can be done on purely political grounds. In other words, the       very reason the Johnson impeachment is condemned by history       is now being used today as a justification to dispense with       standards and definitions of impeachable acts.'').        224.

Senate Select Comm. on Presidential Campaign       Activities v. Nixon, 498 F.2d 725, 732 (D.C. Cir. 1974).        261. Nothing in the recent decision in In re Application of       Committee on the Judiciary establishes that a committee can       pursue an investigation pursuant to the impeachment power       without authorization by a vote from the House. See__F. Supp.       3d__, 2019 WL 5485221, at *26-28 (D.D.C. Oct. 25, 2019). Any       such discussion was dicta. The question before the court was       whether a particular Judiciary Committee inquiry was being       conducted ``preliminarily to'' an impeachment trial in the       Senate, a question that the court viewed as depending on the       inquiry's ``purpose'' and whether it could lead to such a       trial--``not the source of authority Congress acts under.''       Id. at *28 n.37. In any event, the court's analysis was       flawed.        First, the court, like the Committees, misread a House       annotation to Jefferson's Manual. See, e.g., Letter from       Elijah E. Cummings, Chairman, House Oversight Committee, et       al., to John Michael Mulvaney, Acting White House Chief of       Staff, at 2 (Oct. 4, 2019). The language quoted by the court       states that ``various events have been credited with setting       an impeachment in motion.'' H. Doc. 114-192, 114th Cong.       Sec. 603 (2017). But that does not mean that any of these       ``various events'' automatically confers authority on a       committee to begin an impeachment inquiry. It merely       acknowledges the historical fact that there is more than one       way the House may receive information that may prompt the       House to then authorize a committee to pursue an impeachment       investigation.        Second, the court misread III Hinds' Precedents Sec. 2400       as showing that ``a resolution `authoriz[ing]' HJC `to       inquire into the official conduct of Andrew Johnson' was       passed after HJC `was already considering the subject.' ''       Id. at *27. That section discusses two House votes on two       separate resolutions that occurred weeks apart. The House       first voted to authorize the Johnson inquiry (which the court       missed), and it then voted to refer a second matter (the       resolution cited by the court), which touched upon President       Johnson's impeachment, ``to the Committee on the Judiciary,       which was already considering the subject.'' III Hinds'       Precedents Sec. 2400. The court also misread the Nixon       precedent as involving an ``investigation well before the       House passed a resolution authorizing an impeachment       inquiry.'' In re Application of the Comm. on the Judiciary,       2019 WL 5485221, at *27. But that pre-resolution work did not       involve any exercise of the House's impeachment power and was       instead limited to preliminary, self-organizing work       conducting ``research into the constitutional issue of       defining the grounds for impeachment'' and ``collecting and       sifting the evidence available in the public domain.'' Staff       of H.R. Comm. on the Judiciary, Constitutional Grounds for       Presidential Impeachment, 93d Cong. 1-3 (Comm. Print 1974).       The Chairman of the Committee himself acknowledged that, to       actually launch an inquiry, a House resolution ``is a       necessary step.'' 120 Cong. Rec. 2351 (Feb. 6, 1974 statement       of Rep. Rodino).        Third, the court misread House Resolution 430, which was       adopted on June 11, 2019. The court plucked out language from       the resolution granting the Judiciary Committee ``any and all       necessary authority under Article I of the Constitution,'' as       if to suggest that the Judiciary Committee could, under that       grant, initiate an impeachment inquiry. In re Application of       Comm. on Judiciary, 2019 WL 5485221, at *29 (quoting H.R.       Res. 430, 116th Cong. (2019)). But House Resolution 430 is       actually much more narrow. After providing certain       authorizations for filing lawsuits, the resolution simply       gave committees authority to pursue litigation effectively by       providing that, ``in connection with any judicial proceeding       brought under the first or second resolving clauses, the       chair of any standing or permanent select committee       exercising authority thereunder has any and all necessary       authority under Article I of the Constitution.'' H.R Res. 430       (emphasis added). Simply by providing authority to pursue       lawsuits, House Resolution 430 did not authorize any       committee to initiate an impeachment investigation.        262.

Rule XI.2(m)(1) (limiting the power to hold       hearings and issue subpoenas to ``the purpose of carrying out       any of [the committee's] functions and duties under this rule       and rule X (including any matters referred to it under clause       2 of rule XII)'').        266. The mere referral of an impeachment resolution by       itself could not authorize a committee to begin an       impeachment inquiry. The ``Speaker's referral authority under       Rule XII is . . . limited to matters within a committee's       Rule X legislative jurisdiction'' and ``may not expand the       jurisdiction of a committee by referring a bill or resolution       falling outside the committee's Rule X legislative       authority.''

Rule XII.2(a); 18 Deschler's       Precedents of the House of Representatives, app. at 578       (1994) (Deschler's Precedents). If a mere referral could       authorize an impeachment inquiry, then a single House member       could trigger the delegation of the House's ``sole Power of       Impeachment'' to a committee and thus, for the House's most       serious investigations, end-run Rule XI.1(b)(1)'s limitation       of committee investigations to the committees' jurisdiction       under Rule X.        267.

In some cases before       1870, such as the impeachment of Judge Pickering, the House       relied on information presented directly to the House to       impeach an official before conducting an inquiry, and then       authorized a committee to draft specific articles of       impeachment and exercise investigatory powers. III Hinds'       Precedents Sec. 2321.

These aberrations are still distinguishable       because the House adopted resolutions authorizing subpoenas       for depositions during the impeachment investigations of       Judges Nixon and Hastings, see H.R. Res. 562, 100th Cong.       (1988); H.R. Res. 320, 100th Cong. (1987), and the Judiciary       Committee apparently did not issue any subpoenas in Judge       Claiborne's impeachment inquiry.        278. NLRB v.

Although the committees also referred to their       oversight and legislative jurisdiction in issuing these       subpoenas, the committees cannot ``leverage their oversight       jurisdiction to require the production of documents and       testimony that the committees avowedly intended to use for an       unauthorized impeachment inquiry.'' Id. at 32-33. These       ``assertion[s] of dual authorities'' were merely ``token       invocations of `oversight and legislative jurisdiction,' ''       without ``any apparent legislative purpose.'' Id. The       committees transmitted the subpoenas ``[p]ursuant to the       House['s] impeachment inquiry,'' admitted that documents       would ``be collected as part of the House's impeachment       inquiry,'' and confirmed that they would be ``shared among       the Committees, as well as with the Committee on the       Judiciary as appropriate''--all to be used in the impeachment       inquiry.

As the Minority Views on the House Judiciary       Committee's Report in the Nixon proceedings pointed out, it       is important to have a body other than the committee that       issued a subpoena evaluate the subpoena before there is a       move to contempt. ``[I]f the Committee were to act as the       final arbiter of the legality of its own demand, the result       would seldom be in doubt. . . . It is for the reason just       stated that, when a witness before a Congressional Committee       refuses to give testimony or produce documents, the Committee       cannot itself hold the witness in contempt. . . . Rather, the       established procedure is for the witness to be given an       opportunity to appear before the full House or Senate, as the       case may be, and give reasons, if he can, why he should not       be held in contempt.'' H.R. Rep. No. 93-1305, at 484 (1974)       (Minority Views); see also id. at 516 (additional views of       Rep. William Cohen).        336. As examples of such lawsuits, see Compl., Comm. on       Oversight and Gov't Reform v. Holder, No. 1:12-cv-1332       (D.D.C. August 13, 2012), ECF No. 1 (suing to enforce       subpoenas in the Fast and Furious investigation during the       Obama Administration); Compl., Comm. on the Judiciary v.       McGahn, No. 19-cv-2379 (D.D.C. Aug. 7, 2019), ECF No. 1.       Additionally, for Senate subpoenas, Congress has       affirmatively passed legislation creating subject matter       jurisdiction in federal court to hear such cases. See 28       U.S.C. Sec. 1365 (2018). The Trump Administration, like the       Obama Administration, has taken the position that a suit by a       congressional committee attempting to enforce a subpoena       against an Executive Branch official is not a justiciable       controversy in an Article III court. See Comm. on Oversight &       Gov't Reform v. Holder, 979 F. Supp. 2d 1, 9-10 (D.D.C. 2013)       (``The defendant . . . maintains that Article III of the       Constitution actually prohibits the Court from exercising       jurisdiction over what he characterizes as `an inherently       political dispute.' ''). The House of Representatives,       however, has taken the opposite view. See Pl.'s Opp'n to       Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss, Comm. on Oversight & Gov't Reform v.       Holder, No. 12-cv-1332 (D.D.C. Nov. 21, 2012), ECF No. 17.       Unless and until the justiciability question is resolved by       the Supreme Court, the House cannot simultaneously (i) insist       that the courts may decide whether any particular refusal to       comply with a congressional committee's demand for       information was legally proper and (ii) claim that the House       can treat resistance to any demand for information from       Congress as a ``high crime and misdemeanor'' justifying       impeachment without securing any judicial determination that       the Executive Branch's action was improper.        337.

See supra Part I.B.1(a).        356. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 707.        357. See, e.g., Trial Mem. of the U.S. House of       Representatives at 33-34; HJC Report at 136-37.        358. House Democrats' reliance on Kilbourn v. Thompson is       misplaced. Kilbourn merely states that, when conducting an       impeachment inquiry, the House or Senate may ``compel the       attendance of witnesses, and their answer to proper       questions, in the same manner and by the use of the same       means that courts of justice can in like cases.' '' Trial       Mem. of the U.S. House of Representatives at 32 (quoting       Kilbourn, 103 U.S. 168, 190 (1880)). But constitutionally       based privileges apply in ``courts of justice,'' so Kilbourn       does not foreclose the assertion of privileges and immunities       in impeachment proceedings. Regardless, the statement quoted       by House Democrats is dictum and, therefore, not binding.       Additionally, House Democrats point to an 1846 statement by       President Polk to support the proposition that ``[p]revious       Presidents have acknowledged their obligation to comply with       an impeachment investigation.'' Id. at 32-33. OLC has       clarified that, when read in context, President Polk's       statement actually ``acknowledg[es] the continued       availability of executive privilege'' because President Polk       explained that ``even in the impeachment context, the       Executive branch would adopt all wise precautions to prevent       the exposure of all such matters the publication of which       might injuriously affect the public interest, except so far       as this might be necessary to accomplish the great ends of       public justice.'

Impeachment is not just a political process       unconstrained by law. ``The subjects of [an impeachment       trial] are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct       of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or       violation of some public trust''--that is, ``POLITICAL, as       they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the       society itself.'' The Federalist No. 65, at 396 (Alexander       Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). But ``Hamilton didn't       say the process of impeachment is entirely political. He said       the offense has to be political.'' Alan M. Dershowitz,       Hamilton Wouldn't Impeach Trump, Wall St. J. (Oct. 9, 2019),       https://perma.cc/97PH-QPGT (emphasis in original).       ``Hamilton's description in Federalist 65 should not be taken       to mean that impeachments have a conventional political       nature, unmoored from traditional criminal process.'' J.       Richard Broughton, Conviction, Nullification, and the Limits       of Impeachment As Politics, 68 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 275, 288       (2017). Federalist No. 65 goes to ``pains to show that the       Senate can act in `their judicial character as a `court for       the trial of impeachments,'' and ``[t]he entire essay is an       attempt to show that the Senate can overcome its political       nature as an elected body .  .  . and act as a proper court       for the trial of impeachments.' '' Charles L. Black, Jr. &       Philip Bobbitt, Impeachment: A Handbook 102 (2018) (emphasis       in original). Hamilton emphasized that impeachment and       removal of ``the accused'' must be based on partially legal       considerations involving ``real demonstrations of innocence       or guilt'' rather than purely political factors like ``the       comparative strength of parties.'' Id. at 102-03 (quoting The       Federalist No. 65). Thus, ``one should not diminish the       significance of impeachment's legal aspects, particularly as       they relate to the formalities of the criminal justice       process. It is a hybrid of the political and the legal, a       political process moderated by legal  [[Page S346]]       formalities .  .  .  .'' Broughton, supra note 383, at 289.        384.

Proceedings of       the U.S. Senate in the Trial of Impeachment of Harold       Louderback, U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of  [[Page S353]]       California, 73d Cong., 839-40 (1933) (statement of Sen.       Josiah Bailey).        Although the Senate has convicted a few lower court judges       on duplicitous articles, those convictions provide no       precedent to follow here. First, no duplicity objection       appears to have been timely raised in those cases before the       votes on conviction, and thus the Senate never squarely faced       and decided the issue. See, e.g., 80 Cong. Rec. 5606 (1936)       (parliamentary inquiry based on duplicity raised only by a       Senator after Judge Ritter was convicted).        Second, far from being examples to follow, these judges'       convictions only illustrate the constitutional danger of       umbrella charges, which allow the form of the articles chosen       by the House, rather than actual guilt or innocence, to       determine conviction. Judge Ritter, for example, was charged       with discrete impeachable acts in separate articles, with a       catch-all article combining all of the prior articles tacked       on. He was acquitted on each separate article, but convicted       on the catch-all article that amounted to a charge of       ``general misbehavior.'' Id. at 5202-06.        Third, that the Senate may have convicted a few lower court       judges on duplicitous articles is hardly precedent to be       followed in a presidential impeachment. See supra Standards       Part B.3.        784. H.R. Res. 755 art. I.        785. H.R. Res. 755 art. II.        786. Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate when       Sitting on Impeachment Trials, Rule XXIII (``An article of       impeachment shall not be divisible for the purpose of voting       thereon at any time during the trial.''). The committee       report accompanying this rule made clear that the ``more       familiar'' practice was to ``embod[y] an impeachable offense       in an individual article'' rather than relying on broad,       potentially duplicitous articles.

APPENDIX A   MEMORANDUM OF JULY 25, 2019 TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN PRESIDENT                       TRUMP AND PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY                    Memorandum of Telephone Conversation       Subject: Telephone Conversation with President Zelensky of           Ukraine.      Participants: President Zelensky of Ukraine. Notetakers: The           White House Situation Room.      Date, Time and Place: July 25, 2019, 9:03-9:33 a.m. EDT,           Residence.         The President: Congratulations on a great victory. We all       watched from the United States and you did a terrific job.       The way you came from behind, somebody who wasn't given much       of a chance, and you ended up winning easily. It's a       fantastic achievement. Congratulations.        President Zelensky : You are absolutely right Mr .       President. We did win big and we worked hard for this. We       worked a lot but I would like to confess to you that I had an       opportunity to learn from you. We used quite a few of your       skills and knowledge and were able to use it as an example       for our elections and yes it is true that these were unique       elections. We were in a unique situation that we were able to       achieve a unique success. I'm able to tell you the following;       the first time, you called me to congratulate me when I won       my presidential election, and the second time you are now       calling me when my party won the parliamentary election. I       think I should run more often so you can call me more often       and we can talk over the phone more often.        The President: [laughter] That's a very good idea. I think       your country is very happy about that.        President Zelensky: Well yes, to tell you the truth, we are       trying to work hard because we wanted to drain the swamp here       in our country. We brought in many many new people. Not the       old politicians, not the typical politicians, because we want       to have a new format and a new type of government. You are a       great teacher for us and in that.        The President: Well it's very nice of you to say that. I       will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of       effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European       countries are doing and they should be helping you more than       they are. Germany does almost nothing for you. All they do is       talk and I think it's something that you should really ask       them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks       Ukraine, but she doesn't do anything. A lot of the European       countries are the same way so I think it's something you want       to look at but the United States has been very very good to       Ukraine. I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily       because things are happening that are not good but the United       States has been very very good to Ukrane.        President Zelensky: Yes you are absolutely right. Not only       100%, but actually 1000% and I can tell you the following; I       did talk to Angela Merkel and I did meet with her. I also met       and talked with Macron and I told them that they are not       doing quite as much as they need to be doing on the issues       with the sanctions. They are not enforcing the sanctions.       They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine.       It turns out that even though logically, the European Union       should be our biggest partner but technically the United       States is a much bigger partner than the European Union and       I'm very grateful to you for that because the United States       is doing quite a lot for Ukraine. Much more than the European       Union especially when we are talking about sanctions against       the Russian Federation. I would also like to thank you for       your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to       continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are       almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for       defense purposes.

The President: I would like you to do us a favor though       because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows       a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened       with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike.       . . I guess you have one of your wealthy people. . . The       server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things       that went on, the whole situation. I think you're surrounding       yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have       the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like       you to get to the bottom of it As you saw yesterday, that       whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man       named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they       say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do,       it's very important that you do it if that's possible.        President Zelensky: Yes it is very important for me and       everything that you just mentioned earlier. For me as a       President, it is very important and we are open for any       future cooperation. We are ready to open a new page on       cooperation in relations between the United States and       Ukraine. For that purpose, I just recalled our ambassador       from United States and he will be replaced by a very       competent and very experienced ambassador who will work hard       on making sure that our two nations are getting closer. I       would also like and hope to see him having your trust and       your confidence and have personal relatives with you so we       can cooperate even more so. I will personally tell you that       one of my assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently       and we are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to       travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine.       I just wanted to assure you once again that you have nobody       but friends around us. I will make sure that I surround       myself with he best and most experienced people. I also       wanted to tell you that we are friends. We are great friends       and you Mr. President have friends in our country so we can       continue our strategic partnership. I also plan to surround       myself with great people and in addition to that       investigation, I guarantee as the President of Ukraine that       all the investigations will be done openly and candidly. That       I can assure you.        The President: Good because I heard you had a prosecutor       who was very good and he was shut down and that's really       unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they       shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad       people involved. Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He       was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would       like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with       the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what's happening       and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that       would be great. The former ambassador from the United States,       the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with       in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know       that. The other thing. There's a lot of talk about Biden's       son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people       want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the       Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging       that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. .       . It sounds horrible to me.        President Zelensky: I wanted to tell you about the       prosecutor. First of all I understand and I'm knowledgeable       about the situation. Since we have won the absolute majority       in our Parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100%       my person, my candidate, who will be approved by the       parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September.       He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the       company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of the       investigation of the case is actually the issue of making       sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and       will work on the investigation of the case. On top of that, I       would kindly ask you if you have any additional information       that you can provide to us, it would be very helpful for the       investigation to make sure that we administer justice in our       country with regard to the Ambassador to the United States       from Ukraine as far as I recall her name was Ivanovich. It       was great that you were the first one who told me that she       was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100%. Her       attitude towards me was far from the best as she admired the       previous President and she was on his side. She would not       accept me as a new President well enough.        The President: Well, she's going to go through some things.       I will have Mr.  [[Page S354]]       Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney       General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it. I'm       sure you will figure it out. I heard the prosecutor was       treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor so good       luck with everything. Your economy is going to get better and       better I predict. You have a lot of assets. It's a great       country. I have many Ukrainian friends, their incredible       people.        President Zelensky: I would like to tell you that I also       have quite a few Ukrainian friends that live in the United       States. Actually last time I traveled to the United States, I       stayed in New York near Central Park and I stayed at the       Trump Tower. I will talk to them and I hope to see them again       in the future. I also wanted to thank you for your invitation       to visit the United States, specifically Washington DC. On       the other hand, I also want to ensure you that we will be       very serious about the case and will work on the       investigation. As to the economy, there is much potential for       our two countries and one of the issues that is very       important for Ukraine is energy independence. I believe we       can be very successful and cooperating on energy independence       with United States. We are already working on cooperation. We       are buying American oil but I am very hopeful for a future       meeting. We will have more time and more opportunities to       discuss these opportunities and get to know each other       better. I would like to thank you very much for your support        The President: Good. Well, thank you very much and I       appreciate that. I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr       to call. Thank you. Whenever you would like to come to the       White House, feel free to call. Give us a date and we'll work       that out. I look forward to seeing you.        President Zelensky: Thank you very much. I would be very       happy to come and would be happy to meet with you personally       and get to know you better. I am looking forward to our       meeting and I also would like to invite you to visit Ukraine       and come to the city of Kyiv which is a beautiful city. We       have a beautiful country which would welcome you. On the       other hand, I believe that on September 1 we will be in       Poland and we can meet in Poland hopefully. After that, it       might be a very good idea for you to travel to Ukraine. We       can either take my plane and go to Ukraine or we can take       your plane, which is probably much better than mine.        The President: Okay, we can work that out. I look forward       to seeing you in Washington and maybe in Poland because I       think we are going to be there at that time.        President Zelensky: Thank you very much Mr. President.        The President: Congratulations on a fantastic job you've       done. The whole world was watching. I'm not sure it was so       much of an upset but congratulations.        President Zelensky: Thank you Mr. President bye-bye.

MEMORANDUM FOR PAT A. CIPOLLONE COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT       Re: House Committees' Authority to Investigate for           Impeachment        On September 24, 2019, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi       ``announc[ed]'' at a press conference that ``the House of       Representatives is moving forward with an official       impeachment inquiry'' into the President's actions and that       she was ``directing . . . six Committees to proceed with''       several previously pending ``investigations under that       umbrella of impeachment inquiry.'' \1\ Shortly thereafter,       the House Committee on Foreign Affairs issued a subpoena       directing the Secretary of State to produce a series of       documents related to the recent conduct of diplomacy between       the United States and Ukraine. See Subpoena of the Committee       on Foreign Affairs (Sept. 27, 2019). In an accompanying       letter, three committee chairmen stated that their committees       jointly sought these documents, not in connection with       legislative oversight, but ``[p]ursuant to the House of       Representatives' impeachment inquiry.'' \2\ In the following       days, the committees issued subpoenas to the Acting White       House Chief of Staff, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary       of Energy, and several others within the Executive Branch.        Upon the issuance of these subpoenas, you asked whether       these committees could compel the production of documents and       testimony in furtherance of an asserted impeachment inquiry.       We advised that the committees lacked such authority because,       at the time the subpoenas were issued, the House had not       adopted any resolution authorizing the committees to conduct       an impeachment inquiry. The Constitution vests the ``sole       Power of Impeachment'' in the House of Representatives. U.S.       Const. art. I, Sec. 2, cl. 5. For precisely that reason, the       House itself must authorize an impeachment inquiry, as it has       done in virtually every prior impeachment investigation in       our Nation's history, including every one involving a       President. A congressional committee's ``right to exact       testimony and to call for the production of documents'' is       limited by the ``controlling charter'' the committee has       received from the House. United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S.       41, 44 (1953). Yet the House, by its rules, has authorized       its committees to issue subpoenas only for matters within       their legislative jurisdiction. Accordingly, no committee may       undertake the momentous move from legislative oversight to       impeachment without a delegation by the full House of such       authority.        We are not the first to reach this conclusion. This was the       position of the House in the impeachments of Presidents Nixon       and Clinton. In the case of President Nixon, following a       preliminary inquiry, the House adopted a formal resolution as       a ``necessary step'' to confer the ``investigative powers''       of the House ``to their full extent'' upon the Judiciary       Committee. 120 Cong. Rec. 2350-51 (1974) (statement of Rep.       Rodino); see H.R. Res. 803, 93d Cong. (1974). As the House       Parliamentarian explained, it had been ``considered necessary       for the House to specifically vest the Committee on the       Judiciary with the investigatory and subpena power to conduct       the impeachment investigation.'' 3 Lewis Deschler, Deschler's       Precedents of the United States House of Representatives ch.       14, Sec. 5.2, at 2172 (1994) (Parliamentarian's Note).\3\ The       House followed the same course in the impeachment of       President Clinton. After reviewing the Independent Counsel's       referral, the Judiciary Committee ``decided that it must       receive authorization from the full House before proceeding       on any further course of action.'' H.R. Rep. No. 105-795, at       24 (1998). The House again adopted a resolution authorizing       the committee to issue compulsory process in support of an       impeachment investigation. See H.R. Res. 581, 105th Cong.       (1998). As Representative John Conyers summarized in 2016:       ``According to parliamentarians of the House past and       present, the impeachment process does not begin until the       House actually votes to authorize [a] Committee to       investigate the charges.'' \4\        In marked contrast with these historical precedents, in the       weeks after the Speaker's announcement, House committees       issued subpoenas without any House vote authorizing them to       exercise the House's authority under the Impeachment Clause.       The three committees justified the subpoenas based upon the       Rules of the House, which authorize subpoenas for matters       within a committee's jurisdiction. But the Rules assign only       ``legislative jurisdiction[ ]'' and ``oversight       responsibilities'' to the committees. H.R. Rules, 116th       Cong., Rule X, cl. 1 (Jan. 11, 2019) (``Committees and their       legislative jurisdictions''), cl. 2 (``General oversight       responsibilities''); see also H.R. Rule X, cls.  [[Page S355]]       3(m), 11. The House's legislative power is distinct from its       impeachment power. Compare U.S. Const. art. I. Sec. 1, with       id. art. I, Sec. 2, cl. 5. Although committees had that same       delegation during the Clinton impeachment and a materially       similar one during the Nixon impeachment, the House       determined on both occasions that the Judiciary Committee       required a resolution to investigate. Speaker Pelosi       purported to direct the committees to conduct an ``official       impeachment inquiry,'' but the House Rules do not give the       Speaker any authority to delegate investigative power. The       committees thus had no delegation authorizing them to issue       subpoenas pursuant to the House's impeachment power.        In the face of objections to the validity of the committee       subpoenas that were expressed by the Administration, by       ranking minority members in the House, and by many Senators,       among others, on October 31, 2019, the House adopted       Resolution 660, which ``directed'' six committees ``to       continue their ongoing investigations'' as part of the       ``existing House of Representatives inquiry into whether       sufficient grounds exist'' to impeach President Trump. H.R.       Res. 660, 116th Cong. Sec. 1 (2019). Resolution 660's       direction, however, was entirely prospective. The resolution       did not purport to ratify any previously issued subpoenas or       even make any mention of them. Accordingly, the pre-October       31 subpoenas, which had not been authorized by the House,       continued to lack compulsory force.\5\                                     I.         Since the start of the 116th Congress, some members of       Congress have proposed that the House investigate and impeach       President Trump. On January 3, 2019, the first day of the new       Congress, Representative Brad Sherman introduced a resolution       to impeach ``Donald John Trump, President of the United       States, for high crimes and misdemeanors.'' H.R. Res. 13,       116th Cong. (2019). The Sherman resolution called for       impeachment based upon the President's firing of the Director       of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James Comey. See id.       Consistent with settled practice, the resolution was referred       to the Judiciary Committee. See H.R. Doc. No. 115-177,       Jefferson's Manual Sec. 605, at 324 (2019).        The Judiciary Committee did not act on the Sherman       resolution, but it soon began an oversight investigation into       related subjects that were also the focus of a Department of       Justice investigation by Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller,       III. On March 4, 2019, the committee served document requests       on the White House and 80 other agencies, entities, and       individuals, ``unveil[ing] an investigation . . . into the       alleged obstruction of justice, public corruption, and other       abuses of power by President Trump, his associates, and       members of his Administration.'' \6\ Those document requests       did not mention impeachment.        After the Special Counsel finished his investigation, the       Judiciary Committee demanded his investigative files,       describing its request as an exercise of legislative       oversight authority. See Letter for William P. Barr, Attorney       General, from Jerrold Nadler, Chairman, Committee on the       Judiciary, U.S. House of Representatives at 3 (May 3, 2019)       (asserting that ``[t]he Committee has ample jurisdiction       under House Rule X(l) to conduct oversight of the Department       [of Justice], undertake necessary investigations, and       consider legislation regarding the federal obstruction of       justice statutes, campaign-related crimes, and special       counsel investigations, among other things''). The       committee's subsequent letters and public statements likewise       described its inquiry as serving a ``legislative purpose.''       E.g., Letter for Pat Cipollone, White House Counsel, from       Jerrold Nadler, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S.       House of Representatives at 3-6 (May 16, 2019) (describing       the ``legislative purpose of the Committee's investigation''       (capitalization altered)).        Over time, the Judiciary Committee expanded the description       of its investigation to claim that it was considering       impeachment. The committee first mentioned impeachment in a       May 8, 2019 report recommending that the Attorney General be       held in contempt of Congress. In a section entitled       ``Authority and Legislative Purpose,'' the committee stated       that one purpose of the inquiry was to determine ``whether to       approve articles of impeachment with respect to the President       or any other Administration official.'' H.R. Rep. No. 116-      105, at 12, 13 (2019).\7\        The committee formally claimed to be investigating       impeachment when it petitioned the U.S. District Court for       the District of Columbia to release grand-jury information       related to the Special Counsel's investigation. See       Application at 1-2, In re Application of the Comm. on the       Judiciary, U.S. House of Reps., No. 19-gj-48 (D.D.C. July 26,       2019); see also Memorandum for Members of the Committee on       the Judiciary from Jerrold Nadler, Chairman, Re: Lessons from       the Mueller Report, Part III: ``Constitutional Processes for       Addressing Presidential Misconduct'' at 3 (July 11, 2019)       (advising that the Committee would seek documents and       testimony ``to determine whether the Committee should       recommend articles of impeachment against the President or       any other Article I remedies, and if so, in what form'').\8\       The committee advanced the same contention when asking the       district court to compel testimony before the committee by       former White House Counsel Donald McGahn. See Compl. for       Declaratory and Injunctive Relief 1, Comm. on the Judiciary,       U.S. House of Reps. v. McGahn, No. 19-cv-2379 (D.D.C. Aug. 7,       2019) (contending that the Judiciary Committee was ``now       determining whether to recommend articles of impeachment       against the President based on the obstructive conduct       described by the Special Counsel'').        In connection with this litigation, Chairman Nadler       described the committee as conducting ``formal impeachment       proceedings.'' David Priess & Margaret Taylor, What if the       House Held Impeachment Proceedings and Nobody Noticed?,       Lawfare (Aug. 12, 2019), www.lawfareblog.com/what-if-house- held-impeachment-proceedings-and-nobody-noticed (chronicling       the evolution in Chairman Nadler's descriptions of the       investigation). Those assertions coincided with media reports       that Chairman Nadler had privately asked Speaker Pelosi to       support the opening of an impeachment inquiry. See, e.g.,       Andrew Desiderio, Nadler: `This is Formal Impeachment       Proceedings,' Politico (Aug. 8, 2019), www.politico.com/ story/2019/08/08/nadler-this-is-formal-impeachment- proceedings-1454360 (noting that Nadler ``has privately       pushed Speaker Nancy Pelosi to support a formal inquiry of       whether to remove the president from office''). On September       12, the Judiciary Committee approved a resolution describing       its investigation as an impeachment inquiry and adopting       certain procedures for the investigation. See Resolution for       Investigative Procedures Offered by Chairman Jerrold Nadler,       H. Comm. on the Judiciary, 116th Cong. (Sept. 12, 2019),       docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20190912/ 109921/BILLS-      116pih- ResolutionforInvestigative Procedures.pdf.        Speaker Pelosi did not endorse the Judiciary Committee's       characterization of its investigation during the summer of       2019. But she later purported to announce a formal       impeachment inquiry in connection with a separate matter       arising out of a complaint filed with the Inspector General       of the Intelligence Community. The complaint, cast in the       form of an unsigned letter to the congressional intelligence       committees, alleged that, in a July 25, 2019 telephone call,       the President sought to pressure Ukrainian President       Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the prior activities of one       of the President's potential political rivals. See Letter for       Richard Burr, Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence,       U.S. Senate, and Adam Schiff, Chairman, Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence, U.S. House of Representatives at       2-3 (Aug. 12, 2019). After the Inspector General reported the       existence of the complaint to the intelligence committees,       the President declassified the official record of the July 25       telephone call and the complaint, and they were publicly       released on September 25 and 26, respectively.        On September 24, the day before the release of the call       record, Speaker Pelosi ``announc[ed]'' that ``the House of       Representatives is moving forward with an official       impeachment inquiry'' and that she was ``direct[ing] . . .       six [c]ommittees to proceed with their investigations under       that umbrella of impeachment inquiry.'' Pelosi Press Release,       supra note 1. In an October 8, 2019 court hearing, the       House's General Counsel invoked the Speaker's announcement as       purportedly conclusive proof that the House had opened an       impeachment inquiry. Tr. of Mot. Hrg. at 23, In re       Application of the Comm. on the Judiciary (``We are in an       impeachment inquiry, an impeachment investigation, a formal       impeachment investigation because the House says it is. The       speaker of the House has specifically said that it is.'').        On September 27, Chairman Engel of the Foreign Affairs       Committee issued a subpoena to Secretary of State Pompeo       ``[p]ursuant to the House of Representatives' impeachment       inquiry.'' Three Chairmen's Letter, supra note 2, at 1. That       subpoena was the first to rely on the newly proclaimed       ``impeachment inquiry.'' A number of subpoenas followed, each       of which was accompanied by a letter signed by the chairmen       of three committees (Foreign Affairs, Oversight and Reform,       and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence       (``HPSCI'')). Although the September 27 letter mentioned only       the ``impeachment inquiry'' as a basis for the accompanying       subpoena, subsequent letters claimed that other subpoenas       were issued both ``[p]ursuant to the House of       Representatives' impeachment inquiry'' and ``in exercise of''       the committees' ``oversight and legislative jurisdiction.''       \9\        Following service of these subpoenas, you and other       officials within the Executive Branch requested our advice       with respect to the obligations of the subpoenas' recipients.       We advised that the subpoenas were invalid because, among       other reasons, the committees lacked the authority to conduct       the purported inquiry and, with respect to several       testimonial subpoenas, the committees impermissibly sought to       exclude agency counsel from scheduled depositions. In       reliance upon that advice, you and other responsible       officials directed employees within their respective       departments and agencies not to provide the documents and       testimony requested under those subpoenas.        On October 8, 2019, you sent a letter to Speaker Pelosi and       the three chairmen advising them that their purported       impeachment inquiry was ``constitutionally invalid'' because       the House had not authorized it.\10\ The House Minority       Leader, Kevin McCarthy, and the Ranking Member of the       Judiciary Committee, Doug Collins, had already made the same       objection.\11\ Senator Lindsey Graham introduced a resolution       in the Senate, co-sponsored by 49 other Senators, which       objected to the House's impeachment  [[Page S356]]       process because it had not been authorized by the full House       and did not provide the President with the procedural       protections enjoyed in past impeachment inquiries. S. Res.       378, 116th Cong. (2019).        On October 25, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the       District of Columbia granted the Judiciary Committee's       request for grand-jury information from the Special Counsel's       investigation, holding that the committee was conducting an       impeachment inquiry that was ``preliminar[y] to . . . a       judicial proceeding,'' for purposes of the exception to       grand-jury secrecy in Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) of the Federal Rules       of Criminal Procedure. See In re Application of the Comm. on       the Judiciary, U.S. House of Reps., No. 19-gj-48, 2019 WL       5485221 (D.D.C. Oct. 25, 2019), stay granted, No. 19-5288       (D.C. Cir. Oct. 29, 2019), argued (D.C. Cir. Jan. 3, 2020).       In so holding, the court concluded that the House need not       adopt a resolution before a committee may begin an       impeachment inquiry. Id. at *26-28. As we discuss below, the       district court's analysis of this point relied on a       misreading of the historical record.        Faced with continuing objections from the Administration       and members of Congress to the validity of the impeachment-      related subpoenas, the House decided to take a formal vote to       authorize the impeachment inquiry. See Letter for Democratic       Members of the House from Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House       (Oct. 28, 2019). On October 31, the House adopted a       resolution ``direct[ing]'' several committees ``to continue       their ongoing investigations as part of the existing House of       Representatives inquiry into whether sufficient grounds exist       for the House of Representatives to exercise its       Constitutional power to impeach Donald John Trump, President       of the United States of America.'' Resolution 660, Sec. 1.       The resolution also adopted special procedures for       impeachment proceedings before HPSCI and the Judiciary       Committee.                                    II.         The Constitution vests in the House of Representatives a       share of Congress's legislative power and, separately, ``the       sole Power of Impeachment.'' U.S. Const. art. I, Sec. 1; id.       art. I, Sec. 2, cl. 5. Both the legislative power and the       impeachment power include an implied authority to       investigate, including by means of compulsory process. But       those investigative powers are not interchangeable. The House       has broadly delegated to committees its power to investigate       for legislative purposes, but it has held impeachment       authority more closely, granting authority to conduct       particular impeachment investigations only as the need has       arisen. The House has followed that approach from the very       first impeachment inquiry through dozens more that have       followed over the past 200 years, including every inquiry       involving a President.        In so doing, the House has recognized the fundamental       difference between a legislative oversight investigation and       an impeachment investigation. The House does more than simply       pick a label when it ``debate[s] and decide[s] when it wishes       to shift from legislating to impeaching'' and to authorize a       committee to take responsibility for ``the grave and weighty       process of impeachment.'' Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP, 940 F.3d       710, 737, 738 (D.C. Cir. 2019), cert. granted, No. 19-715       (Dec. 13, 2019); see also id. at 757 (Rao, J., dissenting)       (recognizing that ``the Constitution forces the House to take       accountability for its actions when investigating the       President's misconduct''). Because a legislative       investigation seeks ``information respecting the conditions       which the legislation is intended to affect or change,''       McGrain v. Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135, 175 (1927), ``legislative       judgments normally depend more on the predicted consequences       of proposed legislative actions and their political       acceptability, than on precise reconstruction of past       events,'' Senate Select Comm. on Presidential Campaign       Activities v. Nixon, 498 F.2d 725, 732 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (en       banc). By contrast, an impeachment inquiry must evaluate       whether a civil officer did, or did not, commit treason,       bribery, or another high crime or misdemeanor, U.S. Const.       art. II, Sec. 4, and it is more likely than a legislative       oversight investigation to call for the reconstruction of       past events.        Thus, the House has traditionally marked the shift to an       impeachment inquiry by adopting a resolution that authorizes       a committee to investigate through court-like procedures       differing significantly from those used in routine oversight.       See, e.g., Jefferson's Manual Sec. 606, at 324 (recognizing       that, in modern practice, ``the sentiment of committees has       been in favor of permitting the accused to explain, present       witnesses, cross-examine, and be represented by counsel''       (citations omitted)); see also Cong. Research Serv., R45983,       Congressional Access to Information in an Impeachment       Investigation 15 (Oct. 25, 2019) (``[D]uring both the Nixon       and Clinton impeachment investigations, the House Judiciary       Committee adopted resolutions affording the President and his       counsel the right to respond to evidence gathered by the       committee, raise objections to testimony, and cross-examine       witnesses[.]'').\12\ A House resolution authorizing the       opening of an impeachment inquiry plays a highly significant       role in directing the scope and nature of the constitutional       inquest that follows.        Such a resolution does not just reflect traditional       practice. It is a constitutionally required step before a       committee may exercise compulsory process in aid of the       House's ``sole Power of Impeachment.'' U.S. Const. art. I,       Sec. 2, cl. 5. In this Part, we explain the basis for this       conclusion. First, we address the constitutional distinction       between the House's power to investigate for legislative       purposes and for impeachment purposes. We next explain why an       impeachment inquiry must be authorized by the House itself.       Finally, we review the historical record, which confirms,       across dozens of examples, that the House must specifically       authorize committees to conduct impeachment investigations       and to issue compulsory process.                                      A.         The Constitution vests several different powers in the       House of Representatives. As one half of Congress, the House       shares with the Senate the ``legislative Powers'' granted in       the Constitution (U.S. Const. art. I, Sec. 1), which include       the ability to pass bills (id. art. I, Sec. 7, cl. 2) and to       override presidential vetoes (id. art. I, Sec. 7, cl. 3) in       the process of enacting laws pursuant to Congress's       enumerated legislative powers (e.g., id. art. I, Sec. 8),       including the power to appropriate federal funds (id. art. I,       Sec. 9, cl. 7). But the House has other, non-legislative       powers. It is, for instance, ``the Judge of the Elections,       Returns and Qualifications of its own Members.'' Id. art. I,       Sec. 5, cl. 1. And it has ``the sole Power of Impeachment.''       Id. art. I, Sec. 2, cl. 5.        The House and Senate do not act in a legislative role in       connection with impeachment. The Constitution vests the House       with the authority to accuse civil officers of ``Treason,       Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' that warrant       removal and disqualification from office. U.S. Const. art. I,       Sec. 2, cl. 5; id. art. I, Sec. 3, cl. 7; id. art. II,       Sec. 4. As Alexander Hamilton explained, the members of the       House act as ``the inquisitors for the nation.'' The       Federalist No. 65, at 440 (Jacob E. Cooke ed., 1961). And       Senators, in turn, act ``in their judicial character as a       court for the trial of impeachments.'' Id. at 439; see also       The Federalist No. 66, at 445-46 (defending the ``partial       intermixture'' in the impeachment context of usually       separated powers as ``not only proper, but necessary to the       mutual defense of the several members of the government,       against each other''; noting that dividing ``the right of       accusing'' from ``the right of judging'' between ``the two       branches of the legislature . . . avoids the inconvenience of       making the same persons both accusers and judges''). The       House's impeachment authority differs fundamentally in       character from its legislative power.        With respect to both its legislative and its impeachment       powers, the House has corresponding powers of investigation,       which enable it to collect the information necessary for the       exercise of those powers. The Supreme Court has explained       that ``[t]he power of inquiry--with process to enforce it--is       an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative       function.'' McGrain, 273 U.S. at 174. Thus, in the       legislative context, the House's investigative power       ``encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of       existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed       statutes.'' Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178, 187       (1957); see also Scope of Congressional Oversight and       Investigative Power with Respect to the Executive Branch, 9       Op. O.L.C. 60, 60 (1985) (``Congress may conduct       investigations in order to obtain facts pertinent to possible       legislation and in order to evaluate the effectiveness of       current laws.''). The Court has further recognized that the       House also has implied powers to investigate in support of       its other powers, including its power of impeachment. See,       e.g., Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U.S. 168, 190 (1880); see       also In re Request for Access to Grand Jury Materials, 833       F.2d 1438, 1445 (11th Cir. 1987) (the House ``holds       investigative powers that are ancillary to its impeachment       power''); Mazars USA, 940 F.3d at 749 (Rao, J., dissenting)       (``The House . . . has a separate power to investigate       pursuant to impeachment[.]'').        Because the House has different investigative powers,       establishing which authority has been delegated has often       been necessary in the course of determining the scope of a       committee's authority to compel witnesses and testimony. In       addressing the scope of the House's investigative powers, all       three branches of the federal government have recognized the       constitutional distinction between a legislative       investigation and an impeachment inquiry.      1.        We begin with the federal courts. In Kilbourn, the Supreme       Court held that a House committee could not investigate a       bankrupt company indebted to the United States because its       request exceeded the scope of the legislative power.       According to the Court, the committee had employed       investigative power to promote the United States' interests       as a creditor, rather than for any valid legislative purpose.       See 103 U.S. at 192-95. At the same time, the Court conceded       that ``the whole aspect of the case would have been changed''       if ``any purpose had been avowed to impeach the [S]ecretary''       of the Navy for mishandling the debts of the United States.       Id. at 193. But, after reviewing the resolution authorizing       the actions of the committee, the Court confirmed that the       House had not authorized any impeachment inquiry. Id.        In a similar vein, the D.C. Circuit distinguished the needs       of the House Judiciary Committee, which was conducting an       impeachment inquiry into the actions of President Nixon, from       those of the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign       Activities, whose investigation was premised upon  [[Page S357]]       legislative oversight. See Senate Select Comm., 498 F.2d at       732. The court recognized that the impeachment investigation       was rooted in ``an express constitutional source'' and that       the House committee's investigative needs differed in kind       from the Senate committee's oversight needs. Id. In finding       that the Senate committee had not demonstrated that President       Nixon's audiotapes were ``critical to the performance of its       legislative functions,'' the court recognized ``a clear       difference between Congress's legislative tasks and the       responsibility of a grand jury, or any institution engaged in       like functions,'' such as the House Judiciary Committee,       which had ``begun an inquiry into presidential impeachment.''       Id. (emphases added).        More recently, the D.C. Circuit acknowledged this same       distinction in Mazars USA. As the majority opinion explained,       ``the Constitution has left to Congress the judgment whether       to commence the impeachment process'' and to decide whether       the conduct in question is ``better addressed through       oversight and legislation than impeachment.'' 940 F.3d at       739. Judge Rao's dissent also recognized the distinction       between a legislative oversight investigation and an       impeachment inquiry. See id. at 757 (``The Framers       established a mechanism for Congress to hold even the highest       officials accountable, but also required the House to take       responsibility for invoking this power.''). Judge Rao       disagreed with the majority insofar as she understood       Congress's impeachment power to be the sole means for       investigating past misconduct by impeachable officers. But       both the majority and the dissent agreed with the fundamental       proposition that the Constitution distinguishes between       investigations pursuant to the House's impeachment authority       and those that serve its legislative authority (including       oversight).      2.        The Executive Branch similarly has long distinguished       between investigations for legislative and for impeachment       purposes. In 1796, the House ``[r]esolved'' that President       Washington ``be requested to lay before th[e] House a copy of       the instructions'' given to John Jay in preparation for his       negotiation of a peace settlement with Great Britain. 5       Annals of Cong. 759-62 (1796). Washington refused to comply       because the Constitution contemplates that only the Senate,       not the House, must consent to a treaty. See id. at 760-61.       ``It d[id] not occur'' to Washington ``that the inspection of       the papers asked for, c[ould] be relative to any purpose       under the cognizance of the House of Representatives, except       that of an impeachment.'' Id. at 760 (emphasis added).       Because the House's ``resolution ha[d] not expressed'' any       purpose of pursuing impeachment, Washington concluded that       ``a just regard to the constitution . . . forb[ade] a       compliance with [the House's] request'' for documents. Id. at       760, 762.        In 1832, President Jackson drew the same line. A select       committee of the House had requested that the Secretary of       War ``furnish[]'' it ``with a copy'' of an unratified 1830       treaty with the Chickasaw Tribe and ``the journal of the       commissioners'' who negotiated it. H.R. Rep. No. 22-488, at 1       (1832). The Secretary conferred with Jackson, who refused to       comply with the committee's request on the same ground cited       by President Washington: he ``d[id] not perceive that a copy       of any part of the incomplete and unratified treaty of 1830,       c[ould] be relative to any purpose under the cognizance of       the House of Representatives, except that of an impeachment,       which the resolution has not expressed.' '' Id. at 14       (reprinting Letter for Charles A. Wickliffe, Chairman,       Committee on Public Lands, U.S. House of Representatives,       from Lewis Cass, Secretary of War (Mar. 2, 1832)).        In 1846, another House select committee requested that       President Polk account for diplomatic expenditures made in       previous administrations by Secretary of State Daniel       Webster. Polk refused to disclose information but       ``cheerfully admitted'' that the House may have been entitled       to such information if it had ``institute[d] an [impeachment]       inquiry into the matter.'' Cong. Globe, 29th Cong., 1st Sess.       698 (1846).\13\ Notably, he took this position even though       some members of Congress had suggested that evidence about       the expenditures could support an impeachment of Webster.\14\       In these and other instances, the Executive Branch has       consistently drawn a distinction between the power of       legislative oversight and the power of impeachment. See       Mazars USA, 940 F.3d at 761-64 (Rao, J., dissenting)       (discussing examples from the Buchanan, Grant, Cleveland,       Theodore Roosevelt, and Coolidge Administrations).      3.        House members, too, have consistently recognized the       difference between a legislative oversight investigation and       an impeachment investigation. See Alissa M. Dolan et al.,       Cong. Research Serv., RL30240, Congressional Oversight Manual       25 (Dec. 19, 2014) (``A committee's inquiry must have a       legislative purpose or be conducted pursuant to some other       constitutional power of Congress, such as the authority .  .        . to .  .  . conduct impeachment proceedings.'' (emphases       added)); Cong. Research Serv., Congressional Access to       Information in an Impeachment Investigation at 1       (distinguishing between ``legislative investigation[s]'' and       ``[m]uch more rare[]'' ``impeachment investigation[s]'').        For instance, in 1793, when debating the House's       jurisdiction to investigate Secretary of the Treasury       Alexander Hamilton, some members argued that the House could       not adopt a resolution of investigation into Hamilton's       conduct without adopting the ``solemnities and guards'' of an       impeachment inquiry. See, e.g., 3 Annals of Cong. 903 (1793)       (statement of Rep. Smith); id. at 947-48 (statement of Rep.       Boudinot) (distinguishing between the House's ``Legislative       capacity'' and its role as ``the grand inquest of the       Nation''); see also Mazars USA, 940 F.3d at 758 (Rao, J.,       dissenting) (discussing the episode). In 1796, when the House       debated whether to request the President's instructions for       negotiating the Jay Treaty, Representative Murray concluded       that the House could not meddle in treatymaking, but       acknowledged that ``the subject would be presented under an       aspect very different'' if the resolution's supporters       had ``stated the object for which they called for the       papers to be an impeachment.'' 5 Annals of Cong. 429-30       (1796).        Similarly, in 1846, a House select committee agreed with       President Polk's decision not to turn over requested       information regarding State Department expenditures where the       House did not act ``with a view to an impeachment.'' H.R.       Rep. No. 29-684, at 4 (1846) (noting that four of the       committee's five members ``entirely concur with the President       of the United States'' in deciding not to ``communicate or       make [the requested documents] public, except with a view to       an impeachment'' and that ``[n]o dissent from the views of       that message was expressed by the House''); see also Mazars       USA, 940 F.3d at 761 (Rao, J., dissenting). To take another       example, in 1879, the House Judiciary Committee distinguished       ``[i]nvestigations looking to the impeachment of public       officers'' from ``an ordinary investigation for legislative       purposes.'' H.R. Rep. No. 45-141, at 2 (1879).        Most significantly, during the impeachments of Presidents       Nixon and Clinton, the House Judiciary Committee determined       that the House must provide express authorization before any       committee may exercise compulsory powers in an impeachment       investigation. See infra Part II.C.1. Thus, members of the       House, like the other branches of government, have squarely       recognized the distinction between congressional       investigations for impeachment purposes and those for       legislative purposes.                                      B.         Although the House of Representatives has ``the sole Power       of Impeachment,'' U.S. Const. art. I, Sec. 2, cl. 5 (emphasis       added), the associated power to conduct an investigation for       impeachment purposes may, like the House's other       investigative powers, be delegated. The full House may make       such a delegation by adopting a resolution in exercise of its       authority to determine the rules for its proceedings, see id.       art. I, Sec. 5, cl. 2, and each House has broad discretion in       determining the conduct of its own proceedings. See, e.g.,       NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U.S. 513, 551-52 (2014); United       States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1, 5 (1892); see also 1 Deschler's       Precedents ch. 5, Sec. 4, at 305-06. But the House must       actually exercise its discretion by making that judgment in       the first instance, and its resolution sets the terms of a       committee's authority. See United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S.       41, 44 (1953). No committee may exercise the House's       investigative powers in the absence of such a delegation.        As the Supreme Court has explained in the context of       legislative oversight, ``[t]he theory of a committee inquiry       is that the committee members are serving as the       representatives of the parent assembly in collecting       information for a legislative purpose'' and, in such       circumstances, committees ``are endowed with the full power       of the Congress to compel testimony.'' Watkins, 354 U.S. at       200-01. The same is true for impeachment investigations.\15\       Thus, Hamilton recognized, the impeachment power involves a       trust of such ``delicacy and magnitude'' that it ``deeply       concerns the political reputation and existence of every man       engaged in the administration of public affairs.'' The       Federalist No. 65, at 440. The Founders foresaw that an       impeachment effort would ``[i]n many cases . . . connect       itself with the pre-existing factions'' and ``inlist all       their animosities, partialities, influence and interest on       one side, or on the other.'' Id. at 439. As a result, they       placed the solemn authority to initiate an impeachment in       ``the representatives of the nation themselves.'' Id. at 440.       In order to entrust one of its committees to investigate for       purposes of impeachment, the full House must ``spell out that       group's jurisdiction and purpose.'' Watkins, 354 U.S. at 201.       Otherwise, a House committee controlled by such a faction       could launch open-ended and untethered investigations without       the sanction of a majority of the House.        Because a committee may exercise the House's investigative       powers only when authorized, the committee's actions must be       within the scope of a resolution delegating authority from       the House to the committee. As the D.C. Circuit recently       explained, ``it matters not whether the Constitution would       give Congress authority to issue a subpoena if Congress has       given the issuing committee no such authority.'' Mazars USA,       940 F.3d at 722; see Dolan, Congressional Oversight Manual at       24 (``Committees of Congress only have the power to inquire       into matters within the scope of the authority delegated to       them by their parent body.''). In evaluating a committee's       authority, the House's resolution ``is the controlling       charter of the committee's powers,'' and, therefore, the       committee's ``right to exact testimony and to call for the       production of documents must be  [[Page S358]]       found in this language.'' Rumely, 345 U.S. at 44; see also       Watkins, 354 U.S. at 201 (``Those instructions are embodied       in the authorizing resolution. That document is the       committee's charter.''); id. at 206 (``Plainly [the House's]       committees are restricted to the missions delegated to them .       . . . No witness can be compelled to make disclosures on       matters outside that area.''); Exxon Corp. v. FTC, 589 F.2d       582, 592 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (``To issue a valid subpoena, . . .       a committee or subcommittee must conform strictly to the       resolution establishing its investigatory powers[.]'');       United States v. Lamont, 18 F.R.D. 27, 32 (S.D.N.Y. 1955)       (Weinfeld, J.) (``No committee of either the House or Senate,       and no Senator and no Representative, is free on its or his       own to conduct investigations unless authorized. Thus it must       appear that Congress empowered the Committee to act, and       further that at the time the witness allegedly defied its       authority the Committee was acting within the power granted       to it.''). While a committee may study some matters without       exercising the investigative powers of the House, a       committee's authority to compel the production of documents       and testimony depends entirely upon the jurisdiction provided       by the terms of the House's delegation.        In Watkins, the Supreme Court relied upon those principles       to set aside a conviction for contempt of Congress because of       the authorizing resolution's vagueness. The uncertain scope       of the House's delegation impermissibly created ``a wide gulf       between the responsibility for the use of investigative power       and the actual exercise of that power.'' 354 U.S. at 205. If       the House wished to authorize the exercise of its       investigative power, then it needed to take responsibility       for the use of that power, because a congressional subpoena,       issued with the threat of a criminal contempt citation,       necessarily placed ``constitutional liberties'' in       ``danger.'' Id.        The concerns expressed by the Court in Watkins apply with       equal, if not greater, force when considering the authority       of a House committee to compel the production of documents in       connection with investigating impeachment. As John Labovitz,       a House impeachment attorney during the Nixon investigation,       explained: ``[I]mpeachment investigations, because they       involve extraordinary power and (at least where the president       is being investigated) may have extraordinary consequences,       are not to be undertaken in the same manner as run-of-the-      mill legislative investigations. The initiation of a       presidential impeachment inquiry should itself require a       deliberate decision by the House.'' John R. Labovitz,       Presidential Impeachment 184 (1978). Because a committee       possesses only the authorities that have been delegated to       it, a committee may not use compulsory process to investigate       impeachment without the formal authorization of the House.                                      C.         Historical practice confirms that the House must authorize       an impeachment inquiry. See, e.g., Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 135       S. Ct. 2076, 2091 (2015) (recognizing that ``[i]n separation-      of-powers cases,'' the Court has placed ``significant       weight'' on ``accepted understandings and practice''); Noel       Canning, 573 U.S. at 514 (same). The House has expressly       authorized every impeachment investigation of a President,       including by identifying the investigative committee and       authorizing the use of compulsory process. The same thing has       been true for nearly all impeachment investigations of other       executive officials and judges. While committees have       sometimes studied a proposed impeachment resolution or       reviewed available information without conducting a formal       investigation, in nearly every case in which the committee       resorted to compulsory process, the House expressly       authorized the impeachment investigation. That practice was       foreseen as early as 1796. When Washington asked his Cabinet       for opinions about how to respond to the House's request for       the papers associated with the Jay Treaty, the Secretary of       the Treasury, Oliver Wolcott Jr., explained that ``the House       of Representatives has no right to demand papers'' outside       its legislative function ``[e]xcept when an Impeachment is       proposed & a formal enquiry instituted.'' Letter for George       Washington from Oliver Wolcott Jr. (Mar. 26, 1796), reprinted       in 19 The Papers of George Washington: Presidential Series       611-12 (David R. Hoth ed., 2016) (emphasis added).        From the very first impeachment, the House has recognized       that a committee would require a delegation to conduct an       impeachment inquiry. In 1797, when House members considered       whether a letter contained evidence of criminal misconduct by       Senator William Blount, they sought to confirm Blount's       handwriting but concluded that the Committee of the Whole did       not have the power of taking evidence. See 7 Annals of Cong.       456-58 (1797); 3 Asher C. Hinds, Hinds' Precedents of the       House of Representatives of the United States Sec. 2294, at       644-45 (1907). Thus, the committee ``rose,'' and the House       itself took testimony. 3 Hinds' Precedents Sec. 2294, at 646.       Two days later, the House appointed a select committee to       ``prepare and report articles of impeachment'' and vested in       that committee the ``power to send for persons, papers, and       records.'' 7 Annals of Cong. at 463-64, 466; 3 Hinds'       Precedents Sec. 2297, at 648.\16\ As we discuss in this       section, we have identified dozens of other instances       where the House, in addition to referring proposed       articles of impeachment, authorized formal impeachment       investigations.        Against this weighty historical record, which involves       nearly 100 authorized impeachment investigations, the       outliers are few and far between.\17\ In 1879, it appears       that a House committee, which was expressly authorized to       conduct an oversight investigation into the administration of       the U.S. consulate in Shanghai, ultimately investigated and       recommended that the former consul-general and former vice       consul-general be impeached. In addition, between 1986 and       1989, the Judiciary Committee considered the impeachment of       three federal judges who had been criminally prosecuted (two       of whom had been convicted). The Judiciary Committee pursued       impeachment before there had been any House vote, and issued       subpoenas in two of those inquiries. Since then, however, the       Judiciary Committee reaffirmed during the impeachment of       President Clinton that, in order to conduct an impeachment       investigation, it needed an express delegation of       investigative authority from the House. And in all subsequent       cases the House has hewed to the well-established practice of       authorizing each impeachment investigation.        The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia       recently reviewed a handful of historical examples and       concluded that House committees may conduct impeachment       investigations without a vote of the full House. See In re       Application of the Comm. on the Judiciary, 2019 WL 5485221,       at *26-28. Yet, as the discussion below confirms, the       district court misread the lessons of history.\18\ The       district court treated the House Judiciary Committee's       preliminary inquiries in the Clinton and Nixon impeachments       as investigations, without recognizing that, in both cases,       the committee determined that a full House vote was necessary       before it could issue subpoenas. The district court also       treated the 1980s judicial inquiries as if they represented a       rule of practice, rather than a marked deviation from the       dozens of occasions where the House recognized the need to       adopt a formal resolution to delegate its investigative       authority. As our survey below confirms, the historical       practice with respect to Presidents, other executive       officers, and judges is consistent with the structure of our       Constitution, which requires the House, as the ``sole''       holder of impeachment power, to authorize any impeachment       investigation that a committee may conduct on its behalf.      1.        While many Presidents have been the subject of less-formal       demands for impeachment, at least eleven have faced       resolutions introduced in the House for the purpose of       initiating impeachment proceedings.\19\ In some cases, the       House formally voted to reject opening a presidential       impeachment investigation. In 1843, the House rejected a       resolution calling for an investigation into the impeachment       of President Tyler. See Cong. Globe, 27th Cong., 3d Sess.       144-46 (1843). In 1932, the House voted by a wide margin to       table a similar resolution introduced against President       Hoover. See 76 Cong. Rec. 399-402 (1932). In many other       cases, the House simply referred impeachment resolutions to       the Judiciary Committee, which took no further action before       the end of the Congress. But, in three instances before       President Trump, the House moved forward with investigating       the impeachment of a President.\20\ Each of those       presidential impeachments advanced to the investigative stage       only after the House adopted a resolution expressly       authorizing a committee to conduct the investigation. In no       case did the committee use compulsory process until the House       had expressly authorized the impeachment investigation.        The impeachment investigation of President Andrew Johnson.       On January 7, 1867, the House adopted a resolution       authorizing the ``Committee on the Judiciary'' to ``inquire       into the official conduct of Andrew Johnson . . . and to       report to this House whether, in their opinion,'' the       President ``has been guilty of any act, or has conspired with       others to do acts, which, in contemplation of the       Constitution, are high crimes or misdemeanors.'' Cong. Globe,       39th Cong., 2d Sess. 320-21 (1867); see also 3 Hinds'       Precedents Sec. 2400, at 824. The resolution conferred upon       the committee the ``power to send for persons and papers and       to administer the customary oath to witnesses.'' Cong. Globe,       39th Cong., 2d Sess. 320 (1867). The House referred a second       resolution to the Judiciary Committee on February 4, 1867.       Id. at 991; 3 Hinds' Precedents Sec. 2400, at 824.\21\       Shortly before that Congress expired, the committee reported       that it had seen ``sufficient testimony . . . to justify and       demand a further prosecution of the investigation.'' H.R.       Rep. No. 39-31, at 2 (1867). On March 7, 1867, the House in       the new Congress adopted a resolution that authorized the       committee ``to continue the investigation authorized'' in the       January 7 resolution and to ``send for persons and papers''       and administer oaths. Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 1st Sess. 18,       25 (1867); 3 Hinds' Precedents Sec. 2401, at 825-26. The       committee recommended articles of impeachment, but the House       rejected those articles on December 7, 1867. See Cong. Globe,       40th Cong., 2d Sess. 67-68 (1867). In early 1868, however,       the House adopted resolutions authorizing another       investigation, with compulsory powers, by the Committee on       Reconstruction and transferred to that committee the evidence       from the Judiciary Committee's earlier investigation. See       Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess. 784-85, 1087 (1868); 3       Hinds' Precedents Sec. 2408, at 845.        On February 21, 1868, the impeachment effort received new       impetus when Johnson removed the Secretary of War without the  [[Page S359]]       Senate's approval, contrary to the terms of the Tenure of       Office Act, which Johnson (correctly) held to be an       unconstitutional limit on his authority. See Cong. Globe,       40th Cong., 2d Sess. 1326-27 (1868); 3 Hinds' Precedents       Sec. 2408-09, at 845-47; see also Myers v. United States, 272       U.S. 52, 176 (1926) (finding that provision of the Tenure of       Office Act ``was invalid''). That day, the Committee on       Reconstruction reported an impeachment resolution to the       House, which was debated on February 22 and passed on       February 24. Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess. 1400 (1868); 3       Hinds' Precedents Sec. Sec. 2409-12, at 846-51.        The impeachment investigation of President Nixon. Although       many resolutions were introduced in support of President       Nixon's impeachment earlier in 1973, the House's formal       impeachment inquiry arose in the months following the       ``Saturday Night Massacre,'' during which President Nixon       caused the termination of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox at       the cost of the resignations of his Attorney General and       Deputy Attorney General. See Letter Directing the Acting       Attorney General to Discharge the Director of the Office of       Watergate Special Prosecution Force (Oct. 20, 1973), Pub.       Papers of Pres. Richard Nixon 891 (1973). Immediately       thereafter, House members introduced resolutions calling       either for the President's impeachment or for the opening of       an investigation.\22\ The Speaker of the House referred the       resolutions calling for an investigation to the Rules       Committee and those calling for impeachment to the Judiciary       Committee. See Office of Legal Counsel, U.S. Dep't of       Justice, Legal Aspects of Impeachment: An Overview at 40       (Feb. 1974) (``Legal Aspects of Impeachment''); 3       Deschler's Precedents ch. 14, Sec. 5, at 2020.        Following the referrals, the Judiciary Committee ``beg[a]n       an inquiry into whether President Nixon ha[d] committed any       offenses that could lead to impeachment,'' an exercise that       the committee considered ``preliminary.'' Richard L. Madden,       Democrats Agree on House Inquiry into Nixon's Acts, N.Y.       Times, Oct. 23, 1973, at 1. The committee started collecting       publicly available materials, and Chairman Peter Rodino Jr.       stated that he would ``set up a separate committee staff to       `collate' investigative files from Senate and House       committees that have examined a variety of charges against       the Nixon Administration.'' James M. Naughton, Rodino Vows       Fair Impeachment Inquiry, N.Y. Times, Oct. 30, 1973, at 32.        Although the committee ``adopted a resolution permitting       Mr. Rodino to issue subpoenas without the consent of the full       committee,'' James M. Naughton, House Panel Starts Inquiry on       Impeachment Question, N.Y. Times, Oct. 31, 1973, at 1, no       subpoenas were ever issued under that purported authority.       Instead, the committee ``delayed acting'' on the impeachment       resolutions. James M. Naughton, House Unit Looks to       Impeachment, N.Y. Times, Dec. 2, 1973, at 54. By late       December, the committee had hired a specialized impeachment       staff. A Hard-Working Legal Adviser: John Michael Doar, N.Y.       Times, Dec. 21, 1973, at 20. The staff continued `` `wading       through the mass of material already made public,' '' and the       committee's members began considering ``the areas in which       the inquiry should go.'' Bill Kovach, Vote on Subpoena Could       Test House on Impeachment, N.Y. Times, Jan. 8, 1974, at 14;       see also Staff of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary, 93d Cong.,       Rep. on Work of the Impeachment Inquiry Staff as of February       5, 1974, at 2-3 (1974) (noting that the staff was ``first       collecting and sifting the evidence available in the public       domain,'' then ``marshaling and digesting the evidence       available through various governmental investigations''). By       January 1974, the committee's actions had consisted of       digesting publicly available documents and prior impeachment       precedents. That was consistent with the committee's ``only       mandate,'' which was to ``study more than a dozen impeachment       resolutions submitted'' in 1973. James M. Naughton,       Impeachment Panel Seeks House Mandate for Inquiry, N.Y.       Times, Jan. 25, 1974, at 1.        In January, the committee determined that a formal       investigation was necessary, and it requested ``an official       House mandate to conduct the inquiry,'' relying upon the       ``precedent in each of the earlier [impeachment] inquiries.''       Id. at 17. On January 7, Chairman Rodino ``announced that the       Committee's subpoena power does not extend to impeachment and       that . . . the Committee would seek express authorization to       subpoena persons and documents with regard to the impeachment       inquiry.'' Legal Aspects of Impeachment at 43; see also       Richard L. Lyons, GOP Picks Jenner as Counsel, Wash. Post,       Jan. 8, 1974, at A1, A6 (``Rodino said the committee will ask       the House when it reconvenes Jan. 21 to give it power to       subpoena persons and documents for the inquiry. The       committee's subpoena power does not now extend to impeachment       proceedings, he said.''). As the House Parliamentarian later       explained, the Judiciary Committee's general authority to       conduct investigations and issue subpoenas ``did not       specifically include impeachments within the jurisdiction of       the Committee on the Judiciary,'' and it was therefore       ``considered necessary for the House to specifically vest the       Committee on the Judiciary with the investigatory and subpena       power to conduct the impeachment investigation.'' 3       Deschler's Precedents ch. 14, Sec. 15.2, at 2172       (Parliamentarian's Note).        On February 6, 1974, the House approved Resolution 803,       which ``authorized and directed'' the Judiciary Committee       ``to investigate fully and completely whether sufficient       grounds exist for the House of Representatives to exercise       its constitutional power to impeach Richard M. Nixon,       President of the United States of America.'' H.R. Res. 803,       93d Cong. Sec. 1. The resolution specifically authorized the       committee ``to require . . . by subpena or otherwise . . .       the attendance and testimony of any person'' and ``the       production of such things'' as the committee ``deem[ed]       necessary'' to its investigation. Id. Sec. 2(a).        Speaking on the House floor, Chairman Rodino described the       resolution as a ``necessary step'' to confer the House's       investigative powers on the Judiciary Committee:        We have reached the point when it is important that the       House explicitly confirm our responsibility under the       Constitution.        We are asking the House of Representatives, by this       resolution, to authorize and direct the Committee on the       Judiciary to investigate the conduct of the President of the       United States . . . .        As part of that resolution, we are asking the House to give       the Judiciary Committee the power of subpena in its       investigations.        Such a resolution has always been passed by the House. . .       . It is a necessary step if we are to meet our obligations.        . . . .        . . . The sole power of impeachment carries with it the       power to conduct a full and complete investigation of whether       sufficient grounds for impeachment exist or do not exist, and       by this resolution these investigative powers are conferred       to their full extent upon the Committee on the Judiciary.       120 Cong. Rec. 2350-51 (1974) (emphases added). During the       debate, others recognized that the resolution would delegate       the House's investigative powers to the Judiciary Committee.       See, e.g., id. at 2361 (statement of Rep. Rostenkowski) (``By       delegating to the Judiciary Committee the powers contained in       this resolution, we will be providing that committee with the       resources it needs to inform the whole House of the facts of       this case.''); id. at 2362 (statement of Rep. Boland)       (``House Resolution 803 is intended to delegate to the       Committee on the Judiciary the full extent of the powers of       this House in an impeachment proceeding[]--both as to the       persons and types of things that may be subpenaed and the       methods for doing so.''). Only after the Judiciary Committee       had received authorization from the House did it request and       subpoena tape recordings and documents from President Nixon.       See H.R. Rep. No. 93-1305, at 187 (1974).\23\        The impeachment investigation of President Clinton. On       September 9, 1998, Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr,       acting under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 595(c), advised the House of       Representatives that he had uncovered substantial and       credible information that he believed could constitute       grounds for the impeachment of President Clinton. 18       Deschler's Precedents app. at 548-49 (2013). Two days later,       the House adopted a resolution that referred the matter,       along with Starr's report and 36 boxes of evidence, to the       Judiciary Committee. H.R. Res. 525, 105th Cong. (1998). The       House directed that committee to review the report and       ``determine whether sufficient grounds exist to recommend to       the House that an impeachment inquiry be commenced.'' Id.       Sec. 1. The Rules Committee's Chairman emphasized that the       House would need to adopt a subsequent resolution if it       decided to authorize an impeachment inquiry: ``[T]his       resolution does not authorize or direct an impeachment       inquiry. . . . It merely provides the appropriate parameters       for the Committee on the Judiciary . . . to . . . make a       recommendation to the House as to whether we should commence       an impeachment inquiry.'' 144 Cong. Rec. 20021 (1998)       (statement of Rep. Solomon).        On October 7, 1998, the Judiciary Committee did recommend       that there be an investigation for purposes of impeachment.       As explained in the accompanying report: ``[T]he Committee       decided that it must receive authorization from the full       House before proceeding on any further course of action.       Because impeachment is delegated solely to the House of       Representatives by the Constitution, the full House of       Representatives should be involved in critical decision       making regarding various stages of impeachment.'' H.R. Rep.       No. 105-795, at 24 (emphasis added). The committee also       observed that ``a resolution authorizing an impeachment       inquiry into the conduct of a president is consistent with       past practice,'' citing the resolutions for Presidents       Johnson and Nixon and observing that ``numerous other       inquiries were authorized by the House directly, or by       providing investigative authorities, such as deposition       authority, to the Committee on the Judiciary.'' Id.        The next day, the House voted to authorize the Judiciary       Committee to ``investigate fully and completely whether       sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives to       exercise its constitutional power to impeach William       Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States of       America.'' H.R. Res. 581, 105th Cong. Sec. 1 (1998). The       resolution authorized the committee ``to require . . . by       subpoena or otherwise . . . the attendance and testimony of       any person'' and ``the production of . . . things,'' and to       require the furnishing of information ``by interrogatory.''       Id. Sec. 2(a). ``On November 5, 1998,'' as part of its       investigation, ``the Committee presented President Clinton       with 81 requests for admission,'' which the Committee       explained that it ``would have . . . compelled by subpoena''       had President Clinton not complied. H.R. Rep. No. 105-830, at       77, 122  [[Page S360]]       (1998). And the Committee then ``approved the issuance of       subpoenas for depositions and materials'' from several       witnesses. 144 Cong. Rec. D1210-11 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 1998).        In discussing the Clinton precedent, the district court in       In re Application of the Committee on the Judiciary treated       the D.C. Circuit's approval of the disclosure of Starr's       report and associated grand-jury information as evidence that       the Judiciary Committee may ``commence an impeachment       investigation'' without a House vote. 2019 WL 5485221, at *27       & n.36. But the D.C. Circuit did not authorize that       disclosure because of any pending House investigation. It did       so because a statutory provision required an independent       counsel to ``advise the House of Representatives of any       substantial and credible information which such independent       counsel receives . . . that may constitute grounds for an       impeachment.'' 28 U.S.C. Sec. 595(c) (emphasis added). And       the D.C. Circuit viewed the report as reflecting       ``information of the type described in 28 U.S.C.       Sec. 595(c).'' In re Madison Guar. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, Div.       No. 94-1 (D.C. Cir. Spec. Div. July 7, 1998), reprinted in       H.R. Doc. No. 105-331, pt. 1, at 10 (1998). The order       authorizing the transmission of that information to the       House did not imply that any committee was conducting an       impeachment investigation. To the contrary, after the       House received the information, ``no person had access       to'' it until after the House adopted a resolution       referring the matter to the Judiciary Committee. H.R. Rep.       No. 105-795, at 5. And the House then adopted a second       resolution (Resolution 581) to authorize a formal       investigation. In other words, the House voted to       authorize the Judiciary Committee both to review the Starr       evidence and to conduct an impeachment investigation.       Neither the D.C. Circuit nor the Judiciary Committee       suggested that any committee could have taken such action       on its own.      2.        The House has historically followed these same procedures       in considering impeachment resolutions against executive       branch officers other than the President. In many cases, an       initial resolution laying out charges of impeachment or       authorizing an investigation was referred to a select or       standing committee.\24\ Following such a referral, the       designated committee reviewed the matter and considered       whether to pursue a formal impeachment inquiry--it did not       treat the referral as stand-alone authorization to conduct an       investigation. When a committee concluded that the charges       warranted investigation, it reported to the full House, which       then considered whether to adopt a resolution to authorize a       formal investigation.        For example, in March 1867, the House approved a resolution       directing the Committee on Public Expenditures ``to inquire       into the conduct of Henry A. Smythe, collector of the port of       New York.'' Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 1st Sess. 132 (1867);       see also id. (noting that the resolution had been modified       following debate ``so as to leave out that part about       bringing articles of impeachment''). Weeks later, the House       voted to authorize an impeachment investigation. Id. at 290       (authorizing the investigating committee to ``send for       persons and papers''). The House followed this same procedure       in 1916 for U.S. Attorney H. Snowden  Mr. Chief Justice, I send to the desk a list of floor  privileges for closed sessions. It has been agreed to by both sides. I  ask that it be inserted in the Record and agreed to by unanimous  consent.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.

It will be debatable  by the parties for 2 hours, equally divided. Senator Schumer will then  send an amendment to the resolution to the desk. Once that amendment  has been offered and recorded, we will have a brief recess. When we  reconvene, Senator Schumer's amendment will be debatable by the parties  for 2 hours. Upon the use or yielding back of time, I intend to move to  table Senator Schumer's amendment.                            ____________________     Mr. Chief Justice, I ask the Court for a brief 15- minute recess before the parties are recognized to debate the Schumer  amendment.                            ____________________     Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate stand in recess subject to the call of the Chair.   There being no objection, at 2:49 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, recessed until 3:16 p.m.; whereupon the Senate  reassembled when called to order by the Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. There are now 2 hours of argument on Senator  Schumer's amendment.   Mr. Schiff, do you wish to be heard on the amendment, and as the  proponent or as the opponent?   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice, we wish to be heard and are a  proponent of the amendment.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Very well.   Mr. Cipollone.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief Justice, we are an opponent of the  amendment.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Schiff, you have an hour.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   In a moment, I will introduce House Manager Lofgren from California  to respond on the amendment, but I did want to take this opportunity,  before certain representations became congealed, to respond to my  colleagues' argument on the resolution at large.   First, it is worth noting they said nothing about the resolution.  They said nothing about the resolution. They made no effort to defend  it. They made no effort to even claim that this was like the Senate  trial in the Clinton proceeding. They made no argument that, well, this  is different here because of this or that. They made no argument about  that whatsoever. They made no argument that it makes sense to try the  case and then consider documents. They made no argument about why it  makes sense to have a trial without witnesses.   And why? Because it is indefensible. It is indefensible. No trial in  America has ever been conducted like that, and so you heard nothing  about it. And that should be the most telling thing about counsel's  argument.   They had no defense of the McConnell resolution because there is  none. They couldn't defend it on the basis of setting precedent. They  couldn't defend it on the basis of Senate history, traditionally. They  couldn't defend it on the basis of the Constitution. They couldn't  defend it at all.   And so what did they say? Well, first they made the representation  that the House is claiming there is no such thing as executive  privilege. That is nonsense. No one here has ever suggested there is no  such thing as executive privilege, but the interesting thing here is  they have never claimed executive privilege. Not once during the House  investigation did they ever say that a single document was privileged  or a single witness had something privileged to say.   And why didn't they invoke privilege? Why are we now? And even now  they haven't quite invoked it? Why are we now? Why not in the House?   Because in order to claim privilege, as they know, because they are  good lawyers, you have to specify which document, which line, which  conversation, and they didn't want to do that because to do that the  President would have to reveal the evidence of his guilt. That is why  they made no invocation of privilege.   Now they make the further argument that the House should only be able  to impeach after they exhaust all legal remedies, as if the  Constitution says: The House shall have the sole power of impeachment,  asterisk, but only after it goes to court in the district court, then  the court of appeals, then the en banc, then the Supreme Court. Then it  is remanded, and they go back up the chain, and it takes years.   Why didn't the Founders require the exhaustion of legal remedies?  Because they didn't want to put the impeachment process in the courts.   And you know what is interesting is that while these lawyers for the  President are here before you today saying the House should have gone  to court, they were in court saying the House may not go to court to  enforce subpoenas. I kid you not.   Other lawyers--maybe not the ones at this table--but other lawyers  for the President are in court saying the exact opposite of what they  are telling you today. They are saying: You cannot enforce  congressional subpoenas. That is nonjusticiable. You can't do it.   Counsel brings up the case involving Charles Kupperman, who was a  deputy to John Bolton on the National Security Council, and says: He  did what he should do. He went to court to fight us.   Well, the Justice Department took the position that he can't do that.  So these lawyers are saying he should, and then those lawyers are  saying he shouldn't. They can't have it both ways.   Now, interestingly, while Mr. Kupperman--Dr. Kupperman--went to  court--and they applaud him for doing that--his boss, John Bolton, now  says there is no necessity for him to go to court. He doesn't have to  do it. He is willing to come and talk to you. He is willing to come and  testify and tell you what he knows. The question is, Do you want to  hear it? Do you want to hear it? Do you want to hear from someone who  was in the meetings, someone who described what the President did--this  deal between Mulvaney and Sondland--as a drug deal? Do you want to know  why it was a drug deal? Do you want to ask him why it was a drug deal?  Do you want to ask him why he repeatedly told people: Go talk to the  lawyers?   You should want to know. They don't want you to know. They don't want  you to know. The President doesn't want you to know.   Can you really live up to the oath you have taken to be impartial and  not know? I don't think you can.   Now, they also made the argument that you will hear more later on  from, apparently, Professor Dershowitz that, well, abuse of power is  not an impeachable offense. It is interesting that they had to go  outside the realm of constitutional lawyers and scholars to a criminal  defense lawyer to make that argument, because no reputable  constitutional law expert would do that. Indeed, the one they called in  the House--that Republicans called in the House--Jonathan Turley, said  exactly the opposite. There is a reason that Jonathan Turley is not  sitting at the table, much to his dismay, and that is because he  doesn't support their argument. So they will cite him for one thing,  but they will ignore him for the other.   Now they say: Oh, the President is very transparent. He may have  refused every subpoena, every document request, but he released two  documents--the document on the July 25 call and the document on the  April 21 call.   Well, let's face it. He was forced to release the record of the July  25 call when he got caught, when a whistleblower filed a complaint,  when we opened an investigation. He was forced because he got caught.  You don't get credit for transparency when you get caught. And what is  more, what is revealed in that, of course, is damning.   Now they point to the only other record he has apparently released,  the  [[Page S387]]  April 21 call, and that is interesting too. Now, that is just a  congratulatory call, but what is interesting about it is the President  was urged on that call to bring up an issue of corruption. And, indeed,  in the readout of that call the White House misleadingly said he did,  but now that we have seen the record, we see that he didn't. And  notwithstanding counsel's claim in their trial brief that the President  raised the issue of corruption in his phone call, the July 25 call, of  course, that word doesn't appear in either conversation. And why?  Because the only corruption he cared about was the corruption that he  could help bring about.    Now, Mr. Cipollone and Mr. Sekulow made the representation that  Republicans were not even allowed in the depositions conducted in the  House. Now, I am not going to suggest to you that Mr. Cipollone would  deliberately make a false statement. I will leave to it Mr. Cipollone  to make those allegations against others. But I will tell you this: He  is mistaken. He is mistaken. Every Republican on the three  investigative committees was allowed to participate in the depositions,  and, more than that, they got the same time we did. You show me another  proceeding, another Presidential impeachment or other that had that  kind of access for the opposite party.   And, now, there were depositions in the Clinton impeachment. There  were depositions in the Nixon impeachment. So what they would say is  some secret process. Well, they were the same private depositions in  these other impeachments as well.   Finally, on a couple last points, they made the argument that the  President was not allowed, in the Judiciary Committee chaired by my  colleague Chairman Nadler, to be present, to present evidence, to have  his counsel present. That is also just plain wrong, just plain wrong. I  am not going to suggest to you that they are being deliberately  misleading here, but it is just plain wrong.   You have also heard my friends at the other table make attacks on me  and Chairman Nadler. You will hear more of that. I am not going to do  them the dignity of responding to them, but I will say this. They make  a very important point, although it is not the point I think they are  trying to make. When you hear them attack the House managers, what you  are really hearing is: We don't want to talk about the President's  guilt. We don't want to talk about the McConnell resolution and how  patently unfair it is. We don't want to talk about how--pardon the  expression--ass-backward it is to have a trial and then ask for  witnesses. And so they will attack House managers because maybe we can  distract you for a moment from what is before you. Maybe if we attack  House managers, you will be thinking about them instead of thinking  about the guilt of the President.   So you will hear more of that, and every time you do, every time you  hear them attacking House managers, I want you to ask yourself: Away  from what issue are they trying to distract me? What was the issue that  came up just before this? What are they trying to deflect my attention  from? Why don't they have a better argument to make on the merits?   Finally, Mr. Sekulow asked: Why are we here? Why are we here?   Well, I will tell you why we are here: Because the President used the  power of his office to coerce an ally at war with an adversary, at war  with Russia, used the powers of his office to withhold hundreds of  millions of dollars of military aid that you appropriated and we  appropriated to defend an ally and defend ourselves, because it is our  national security as well. And why? To fight corruption? That is  nonsense, and you know it.   He withheld that money and he withheld even meeting with him in the  Oval Office--the President of Ukraine--because he wanted to coerce  Ukraine into these sham investigations of his opponent that he was  terrified would beat him in the next election. That is what this is  about.   You want to say that is OK? Their brief says that is OK. The  President has a right to do it. Under article II, we heard the  President can do whatever he wants. You want to say that is OK? Then  you have got to say that every future President can come into office  and they can do the same thing. Are we prepared to say that? Well, that  is why we are here.   I now yield to Representative Lofgren.   Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, counsel for the  President, the House managers strongly support Senator Schumer's  amendment, which would ensure a fair, legitimate trial based on a full  evidentiary record.   The Senate can remedy President Trump's unprecedented coverup by  taking a straightforward step. It can ask for the key evidence that the  President has improperly blocked. Senator Schumer's amendment does just  that.   The amendment authorizes the subpoena for White House documents that  are directly relevant to this case. These documents focus on the  President's scheme to strong-arm Ukraine to announce an investigation  into his political opponent to interfere with the 2020 election.   The documents will reveal the extent of the White House's  coordination with the President's agents, such as Ambassador Sondland  and Rudy Giuliani, who pushed the President's so-called ``drug deal''  on Ukrainian officials. The documents will also show us how key players  inside the White House, such as the President's Acting Chief of Staff,  Mick Mulvaney, and his deputy, Robert Blair, helped set up the deal by  executing the freeze on all military aid and withholding a promised  visit to the White House. The documents include records of the people  who may have objected to this scheme, such as Ambassador Bolton.   This is an important impeachment case against the President. The most  important documents are going to be at the White House. The documents  Senator Schumer's amendment targets would provide more clarity and  context about President Trump's scheme. The amendment prevents the  President from hiding evidence, as he has previously tried to do.   The House subpoenaed these documents as part of the impeachment  inquiry, but the President completely rejected this and every document  subpoenaed from the House. As powerful as our evidence is--and make no  mistake, it overwhelmingly proves his guilt--we did not receive a  single document from the executive branch agency, including the White  House itself.   Recent revelations from press reports, Freedom of Information Act  requests, and additional witnesses, such as Lev Parnas, underscore how  relevant these documents are and, therefore, why the President has been  so desperate to hide them and his misconduct from Congress and the  American people.   A trial without all the relevant evidence is not a fair trial. It  would be wrong for you Senators, acting as judges, to be deprived of  relevant evidence of the President's offenses when you are judging  these most serious charges. It would also be unfair to the American  people, who overwhelmingly believe the President should produce all  relevant documents and evidence.   Now, documentary evidence is used in all trials for a simple reason.  As the story goes, the documents don't lie. Documents give objective  real-time insight into the events under investigation. The need for  such evidence is especially important in Senate impeachment trials.  More than 200 years of Senate practice make clear that documents are  generally the first order of business. They have been presented to the  Senate before witnesses take the stand in great volume to ensure the  Senate has the evidence it needs to evaluate the case.   Documentary evidence in Senate trials has never been limited to the  documents sent by the House. The Senate, throughout its existence, has  exercised its authority pursuant to its clear rules of procedure to  subpoena documents at the outset of the trial.   We don't know with certainty what the documents will say. We simply  want the truth, whatever that truth may be, and so do the American  people. They want to know the truth, and so should everybody in this  Chamber, regardless of party affiliation.   There are key reasons why this amendment is necessary. We will begin  by walking through the history and precedent of Senate impeachment  trials. I will let you know about the House's efforts to get the  documents, which were met by the President and  [[Page S388]]  his administration's categorical commitment to hide all the evidence at  all costs, and we will address the specific need for these subpoenaed  White House documents. I will tell you why these documents are needed  now, not at the end of the trial, in order to ensure a full, fair trial  based on a complete evidentiary record.   Someone suggested incorrectly that the Senate is limited only to  evidence gathered before the House approved its Articles of  Impeachment. Others have suggested, also incorrectly, that it would  somehow be strange for the Senate to issue subpoenas. These claims are  without any historical, precedential, or legal support.   Over the past two centuries, the Senate has always understood that  its sole power under the Constitution to try all impeachments requires  the Senate to sit as a Court of Impeachment and hold a trial. In fact,  the Founders assigned sole authority only twice in the Constitution,  first, giving the House sole authority to impeach, and, second, giving  the Senate sole authority to try that impeachment.   If the Founders had intended for the Senate to serve as some kind of  appellate body, they would have said that. But, no, instead they wrote  this in article I, section 3: ``The Senate shall have sole Power to try  all Impeachments.''   The Senate has always received the relevant documents in impeachment  trials, and, indeed, the Senate's own rules of procedure and practice  make clear that new evidence will be considered. Precedent shows this.  All 15 full Senate impeachment trials considered new evidence.   Let's look at a few examples that show the Senate takes new evidence  in impeachment trials.   The first-ever impeachment trial in 1868 against President Andrew  Johnson allowed the House managers to spend the first 2 days of the  trial introducing new documentary evidence.   It was the same in Judge John Pickering's trial in 1804. New  documents were presented to the Senate nearly a week before House  managers made their opening statements and later throughout the trial.   As has been mentioned earlier by Mr. Schiff, in modern times, in  2010, Judge Porteous's impeachment trial included 7 months of pretrial  discovery and 6,000 pages of documentary evidence admitted at trial.  After that evidence was admitted, the Senate held its trial.   President Clinton's case did not involve subpoenas for documents. Why  was that? Because President Clinton had already produced a huge trove  of documents. The independent counsel turned over to Congress some  90,000 pages of relevant documents gathered during the course of his  years-long investigation, and I remember, as a member of the Judiciary  Committee, going over to the Ford building and looking at the boxes of  the documents. But even with all those documents, the Clinton trial  included the opportunity to present new evidence and submission of  additional documents and three witnesses.   The Clinton impeachment precedent also shows how President Trump's  refusal to produce any relevant documents in response to congressional  subpoenas is different from past Presidents--different from President  Clinton, different from President Johnson, and less even than President  Nixon. In short, not a single President has categorically refused to  cooperate with an impeachment investigation. Not a single President has  issued a blanket direction to his administration to produce no  documents and no witnesses. These are the precedents the Senate must  rely on.   The Senate should issue a subpoena for documents at the very outset  of the proceedings so that this body, the House managers, the President  can all account for those documents in their presentations and  deliberations.    It doesn't make sense to request and receive documents after the  parties present their cases. The time is now to do that. So why is the  amendment needed to prevent President Trump from continuing his  categorical commitment to hide the evidence?   In this case the House sought White House documents. Why don't we  have them? It is not because we didn't try. It is because the White  House refused to give them to us. The President's defense team seems to  believe that the White House is permitted to completely refuse to  provide any documents without regard to whether or not it is  privileged. They apparently believe that Congress's authority is  subject to the approval of the President. But that is not what the  Constitution says. Our Constitution sets forth a democracy with a  system of checks and balances to ensure that no one, and certainly not  the President, is above the law. Even President Nixon produced more  than 30 transcripts of White House recordings and notes in the meetings  with the President.   Here, even before the House launched the investigation that led to  this trial, President Trump rejected Congress's constitutional  responsibility to use its lawful authority to investigate his actions.  He asserted that his administration was fighting all the subpoenas,  proclaiming: ``I have an Article II, where I have the right to do  whatever I want as President.''   Here is what he said: ``I have an Article II, where I have the right  to do whatever I want as President.''   Even after the House formally announced its investigation of the  President's conduct in Ukraine, the President still continued his  obstruction. Beginning on September 9, 2019, the House investigative  committee made two attempts to voluntarily obtain documents from the  White House. The White House refused to engage and, frankly, to even  respond to the House committee.   On October 4, the House Committee on Oversight Reform sent a subpoena  to the White House Acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, this time  compelling the production of documents from the White House by October  18. On October 8, before the White House documents were due, the White  House Counsel sent a letter to Speaker Pelosi, stating the President's  position that President Trump and his administration cannot participate  in this partisan inquiry under the circumstances. The President simply  declared that he will not participate in an investigation he didn't  like.   Ten days later, on October 18, the White House Counsel sent a letter  to the House, confirming that it would continue to stonewall. The White  House Counsel again stated that the President refused to participate.   Well, the Constitution, article I, section 2, says that the House  will have the sole power of impeachment, just as in article I, section  3, the Senate has the sole power to try. Participation in a duly  authorized congressional investigation isn't optional. It is not up to  the President to decide whether to participate or not. The Constitution  gives the House the sole power of impeachment. It gives the Senate the  sole power to try all impeachments.   The President may not like being impeached, but if the President, not  the Congress, decides when impeachment proceedings are appropriate,  then the impeachment power is no power at all. If you let him block  from Congress and from the American people the evidence to cover up his  offenses, then the impeachment power truly will be meaningless.   With all the back-and-forth about these documents, we have heard the  phrase ``executive privilege.'' The President and his lawyers keep  saying--they talk about a vast legal right to justify hiding the truth,  withholding information. But that is a distraction. That is not what  the Constitution provides.   The truth is, as has been mentioned by Mr. Schiff, in the course of  the entire impeachment inquiry, President Trump has not once asserted  executive privilege--not a single time. It was not the reason provided  by Mr. Cipollone for refusing to comply with the House subpoenas.  Indeed, President Trump didn't offer legal justification for  withholding the evidence.   Here is the truth. The President, Members of Congress, judges, and  the Supreme Court have recognized throughout our Nation's history that  Congress's investigative powers are at their absolute peak during  impeachment proceedings--your powers. Executive privilege cannot be a  barrier to give absolute secrecy to cover up wrongdoing. If it did, the  House and the Senate would see their powers disappear.   When President Nixon tried that argument by refusing to produce tape  recordings to prosecutors and to Congress, he was soundly rebuked by  the other two branches of government. The  [[Page S389]]  Supreme Court unanimously ruled against him. The House Judiciary  Committee voted that he be impeached for obstruction of Congress.   It would be remarkable for the United States Senate to declare for  the first time in our Nation's history that the President has an  absolute right to decide whether his own impeachment trial is  legitimate. It would be extraordinary for the Senate to refuse to seek  important documentary evidence, especially when the President has yet  to assert any privilege to justify withholding documents.   There is another reason this amendment is important. The documents  sought are directly relevant to the President's misconduct. The White  House is concealing documents involving officials who had direct  knowledge of key events at the heart of this trial. This isn't just a  guess. We know these documents exist from the witnesses who testified  in the House and from other public release of documents.   Let's walk through those specific documents that the White House  should send to the Senate. They include, among other documents relating  to President Trump, direct communications with President Zelensky;  President Trump's request for political investigations, including  communications with Rudy Giuliani, Ambassador Sondland, and others;  President Trump's unlawful hold of the $391 million of military aid;  concerns that White House officials reported to NSC legal counsel in  realtime; and the President's decision to recall Ambassador Marie  Yovanovitch from Ukraine.   The first set of documents the Senate should get about President  Trump's communication with the President of Ukraine would include the  phone calls on April 21 and July 25, as well as the September 25, 2019,  meeting with President Zelensky in New York.   We know, for example, that NSC officials prepared talking points for  the President in preparation for both calls to the Ukrainian President.  The talking points were about American policy, as reflected by the  votes of Congress, as well as the Trump administration itself. They  didn't include any mention of the Bidens or the 2016 election  interference or investigations that President Trump requested on the  July 25 call.   Here is a clip of Lieutenant Colonel Vindman explaining how the  President ignored the points about American policy reflecting the views  of both the Congress and the Trump administration.

Mr. Schiff, you have an hour, and you will be able  to reserve time for rebuttal.   Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Chief Justice Roberts, Senators, counsel for  the White House, I am Val Demings from the State of Florida.   The House managers strongly support the amendment to issue a subpoena  for documents to the State Department.   As we explained, the first Article of Impeachment charges the  President with using the power of his office to solicit and pressure  Ukraine to announce investigations that everyone in this Chamber knows  to be bogus. The President didn't even care if an investigation was  actually conducted, just that it was announced. Why? Because this was  for his own personal and political benefit. The first article further  charges that the President did so with corrupt motives and that his use  of power for personal gain harmed the national security of the United  States.   As the second Article of Impeachment charges, the President sought to  conceal evidence of this conduct. He did so by ordering his entire  administration--every office, every agency, every official--to defy  every subpoena served in the House impeachment inquiry. No President in  history has ever done anything like this. Many Presidents have  expressly acknowledged that they couldn't do anything like this.   President Trump did not take these extreme steps to hide evidence of  his innocence or to protect the institution of the Presidency. As a  career law enforcement officer, I have never seen anyone take such  extreme steps to hide evidence allegedly proving his innocence, and I  do not find that here today. The President is engaged in this coverup  because he is guilty, and he knows it. And he knows that the evidence  he is concealing will only further demonstrate his culpability.   Notwithstanding this effort to stonewall our inquiry, the House  amassed powerful evidence of the President's high crimes and  misdemeanors--17 witnesses, 130 hours of testimony, combined with the  President's own admissions on phone calls and in public comments,  confirmed and corroborated by hundreds of texts, emails, and documents.   Much of that evidence came from patriotic, nonpartisan, decorated  officials in the State Department. They are brave men and women who  honored their obligations under the law and gave testimony required by  congressional subpoena in the face of the President's taunts and  insults. These officials described the President's campaign to induce  and pressure Ukraine to announce political investigations; his use of  $391 million of vital military aid--taxpayer money appropriated on a  bipartisan basis by Congress--as leverage to force Ukraine to comply;  and his withholding of a meeting desperately sought by the newly- elected President of Ukraine.   This testimony was particularly compelling because the State  Department is at the very center of President Trump's wrongdoing. We  heard firsthand from diplomatic officials who saw up close and personal  what was happening and who immediately--immediately--sounded the  alarms.   Ambassador William Taylor, who returned to Ukraine in June of last  year as Acting Ambassador, texted other State Department officials: ``I  think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a  political campaign.''   Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who was delegated  authority over Ukraine matters by none other than President Trump,  testified: ``We knew these investigations were important to the  President'' and ``we followed the President's orders.''   David Holmes, a senior official at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, said:  ``[I]t was made clear that some action on a Burisma/Biden investigation  was a precondition for an Oval Office meeting.''   During their testimony, many of these State Department officials  described specific documents--including text messages, emails, former  diplomatic cables, and notes--that would corroborate their testimony  and shed additional light on President Trump's corrupt scheme.    For instance, Ambassador Taylor, who raised concerns that military  aid had been conditioned on the President's demand for political  investigations, described a ``little notebook'' in which he would  ``take notes on conversations'' he had with key officials.   Ambassador Sondland referred by date and recipient to emails  regarding the President's demand that Ukraine announce political  investigations. As we will see, those emails were sent to some of  President Trump's top advisers, including Acting White House Chief of  Staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, and Secretary  of Energy Rick Perry.   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, who oversaw Ukraine  policy matters in Washington for the State Department, wrote at least  four memos to file to document concerning conduct he witnessed or  heard.   Ambassador Kurt Volker, the Special Representative for Ukraine  Negotiations, provided evidence that he and other American officials  communicated with high-level Ukrainian officials--including President  Zelensky himself--via text message and WhatsApp about the President's  improper demands and how Ukrainian officials would respond to them.   Based on the testimony we received and on evidence that has since  emerged, all of these documents and others that we will describe bear  directly on the allegations set forth in the first Article of  Impeachment. They would help complete our understanding of how the  President's scheme unfolded in real time. They would support the  conclusion that senior Ukrainian officials understood the corrupt  nature of President Trump's demand. They would further expose the  extent to which Secretary Pompeo, Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney,  and other senior Trump administration officials were aware of the  President's plot and helped carry it out.   We are not talking about a burdensome number of documents; we are  talking about a specific, discrete set of materials held by the State  Department--documents the State Department has already collected in  response to our subpoena but has never produced. We know these  materials exist, we know they are relevant, and we know the President  is desperately trying to conceal them.   As I will describe, the Senate should subpoena the following: No. 1,  WhatsApp and other text message communications; 2, emails; 3,  diplomatic cables; and 4, notes.   Given the significance and relevance of these documents, the House  requested that they be provided. When these requests were denied--when  our requests were denied--the House issued subpoenas commanding that  the documents be turned over, but at the President's direction, the  Department of State unlawfully defied that subpoena.   As I stand here now, the State Department has all these documents in  its possession but refuses, based on the President's order, to let them  see the light of day. This is an affront to the House, which has full  power to see these documents. It is an affront to the Senate, which has  been denied a full record on which to judge the President's guilt or  innocence. It is an affront to the Constitution, which makes clear that  nobody, not even the President, is above the law. It is an affront to  the American people, who have a right to know what the President and  his allies are hiding from them and why it is being hidden.   In prior impeachment trials, this body has issued subpoenas requiring  [[Page S396]]  the recipient to hand over relevant documents. It must do so again  here, and it must do so now at the beginning of the trial, not the end.   Of course the need for a Senate subpoena arises because, as I have  noted, the President ordered the State Department to defy a subpoena  from the House. At this point, I would like to briefly describe our own  efforts to get those materials. I will then address in a more detailed  fashion exactly what documents the State Department has hidden from the  American people and why the Senate should require it to turn them over.   On September 9, exercising their article I oversight authority, the  House investigating committee sent a document request to the State  Department. The committee sought materials related to the President's  effort to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into his  political rival, as well as his dangerous, unexplained withholding of  millions of dollars in vital military aid.   After the State Department failed to produce any documents, the House  Committee on Foreign Affairs issued a subpoena to the State Department  on September 27.   In a letter on October 1, Secretary Pompeo acknowledged receipt of  the subpoena. At that time, he stated that he would respond to the  committee's subpoena for documents by the return date, October 4, but  his response never came.   Instead, on October 8, President Trump's lawyer--writing on the  President's behalf--issued a direction confirming that the  administration would stonewall the impeachment inquiry.   To date, the State Department has not produced a single document--not  a single document--in response to the congressional subpoena, but  witnesses who testified indicated that the State Department had  gathered all of the records and was prepared to provide them before the  White House directed it to defy the subpoena.   Notwithstanding this unlawful obstruction, through the testimony of  brave State Department employees, the House was able to identify, with  remarkable precision, several categories of documents relevant to the  first Article of Impeachment that are sitting right now--right now--the  documents are sitting right now at the State Department.   I would like to walk you through four key categories of documents  that should be subpoenaed and which illustrate the highly relevant  documents the State Department could produce immediately to this trial.   The first category consists of WhatsApp and other text messages from  State Department officials caught up in these events, including  Ambassadors Sondland and Taylor and also Deputy Assistant Secretary  George Kent, all three of whom confirmed in their testimony that they  regularly use WhatsApp to communicate with each other and foreign  government officials.   As Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent explained, WhatsApp is the  dominant form of electronic communication in certain parts of the  world. We know that the State Department possesses records of WhatsApp  and text messages from critical eyewitnesses to these proceedings,  including from Ambassadors Sondland and Taylor and Deputy Assistant  Secretary Kent.   We know that the Department is deliberately concealing these records  at the direction of the President, and we know that they could contain  highly relevant testimony about the President's plan to condition  official Presidential acts on the announcement of investigations for  his own personal and political gain.   We know this not only from testimony but also because Ambassador  Volker was able to provide us with a small but telling selection of his  WhatsApp messages. Those records confirm that a full review of these  texts and WhatsApp messages from relevant officials would help to paint  a vivid, firsthand picture of statements, decisions, concerns, and  beliefs held by important players unfolding in real time.   For example, thanks to Ambassador Volker's messages, we know that  Ambassador Sondland--a key player in the President's pressure campaign  who testified in the House about a quid pro quo arrangement--texted  directly with the Ukrainian President, President Volodymyr Zelensky.  This image produced by Ambassador Volker appears to be a screenshot of  a text message that Ambassador Sondland exchanged with President  Zelensky about plans for a White House visit--the very same visit that  President Zelensky badly needed and that President Trump later withheld  as part of the quid pro quo described by Ambassador Sondland in his  testimony.   This body and the American people have a right to know what else  Ambassador Sondland and President Zelensky said in this and other  relevant exchanges about the White House meeting or about the military  aid and the President's demands, but we don't know exactly what was  conveyed and when. We don't know it because President Trump directed  the State Department to conceal these vital records. These are records  that the State Department would have otherwise turned over if not for  the President's direction and desire to cover up his wrongdoing.   To get a sense of why texts and WhatsApp messages are so vital, just  consider yet another piece of evidence we have gleaned from Ambassador  Volker's partial production.   On July 10, after the White House meetings at which Ambassador  Sondland pressured Ukrainian officials to announce investigations of  President Trump's political opponents, a Ukraine official texted  Ambassador Volker: ``I feel that the key for many things is Rudi and I  ready to talk with him at any time.''   This is evidence that, immediately following Ambassador Sondland's  ultimatum, Ukrainian officials recognized that they needed to appease  Rudy Giuliani by carrying out the investigations. Of course, Mr.  Giuliani had publicly confirmed that he was not engaged in ``foreign  policy'' but was instead advancing his client's--the President's--own  personal interests.   Further, in another text message exchange provided by Ambassador  Volker, we see evidence that Ukraine understood President Trump's  demands loud and clear.   On the morning of July 25, half an hour before the infamous call  between President Trump and President Zelensky, Ambassador Volker wrote  to a senior Ukrainian official:         Heard from White House--assuming President Z convinces       trump he will investigate/``get to the bottom of what       happened'' in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to       Washington. Good luck! See you tomorrow--Kurt.    Ambassador Sondland confirmed that this text accurately summarized  the President's directive to him earlier that morning.   After the phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky,  the Ukrainian official responded, pointedly: ``Phone call went well.''  He then discussed potential dates for a White House meeting.   Then, the very next day, Ambassador Volker wrote to Rudy Giuliani:  ``Exactly the right messages as we discussed.''   These messages confirm Mr. Giuliani's central role, the premeditated  nature of President Trump's solicitation of political investigations,  and the pressure campaign on Ukraine waged by Mr. Giuliani and senior  officials at President Trump's direction.   Again, this is just some of what we learned from Ambassador Volker's  records. As you will see during this trial presentation, there were  numerous WhatsApp messages in August while Ambassadors Volker and  Sondland and Mr. Giuliani were pressuring President Zelensky's top aide  to issue a statement announcing the investigation that President Trump  wanted. Ambassador Taylor's text that you saw earlier about withholding  the aid further reveals how much more material there likely is that  relates to the Articles of Impeachment.   There can be no doubt that a full production of relevant texts and  WhatsApp messages from other officials involved in Ukraine and in touch  with Ukrainian officials--including Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador  Taylor, and Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent--would further illuminate  the malfeasance addressed in our first article.   This leads to the second category of documents that the State  Department is unlawfully withholding--emails involving key State  Department officials  [[Page S397]]  concerning interactions with senior Ukrainian officials and relating to  military aid, a White House meeting, and the President's demand for an  investigation into his rivals.   For example, on July 19, Ambassador Gordon Sondland spoke directly  with President Zelensky about the upcoming July 25 call between  President Trump and President Zelensky.   Ambassador Sondland sent an email updating key officials, including  Secretary Pompeo, Acting White House Chief of Staff Mulvaney, and his  senior adviser, Robert Blair. In this email, he noted that he  ``prepared'' President Zelensky, who was willing to make the  announcements of political investigations that President Trump desired.  Secretary Perry and Mick Mulvaney then responded to Sondland,  acknowledging they received the email and recommending to move forward  with the phone call that became the July 25 call between the Presidents  of the United States and Ukraine.   We know all of this not because the State Department provided us with  critical documents but, instead, because Ambassador Sondland provided  us a reproduction of the email.   In his further testimony, Ambassador Sondland quite correctly  explained that this email demonstrated ``everyone was in the loop.''   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret. Everyone was       informed via email on July 19th, days before the Presidential       call. As I communicated to the team, I told President       Zelensky in advance that assurances to run a fully       transparent investigation and turn over every stone were       necessary in his call with President Trump.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Even viewed alone, this reproduced email is  damning. It was sent shortly after Ambassador Sondland personally  conveyed the President's demand for investigations to Ukrainians at the  White House, leading several officials to sound alarms. It was said  just a few days before the July 25 call, where President Trump asked  for a ``favor,'' and, by itself, this email shows who was involved in  President Trump's plan to pressure the Ukrainian President for his own  political gain.   But it is obvious that the full email chain and other related emails  to this key time period would also be highly relevant. We don't have  those emails because the State Department is hiding them, at the  direction of the President. The Senate should issue the proposed  subpoena to ensure a complete record of these and other relevant  emails.   Any doubt that the State Department is concealing critical evidence  from this body was resolved when the State Department was recently  ordered to release documents, including emails, pursuant to a lawsuit  under the Freedom of Information Act. These documents are heavily  redacted and are limited to a very narrow time period, but,  nevertheless, despite the heavy redactions, this highly limited glimpse  into the State Department's secret records demonstrates that those  records are full of information relevant to this trial.   For example, several of these newly released emails show multiple  contacts between the State Department, including Secretary Pompeo, and  Mr. Giuliani throughout 2019. This is an important fact.   Mr. Giuliani served as the President's point person and executed his  corrupt scheme. Mr. Giuliani repeatedly emphasized that his role was to  advance the President's personal agenda--the President's political  interests, not to promote the national security interests of the United  States. The fact that the President's private attorney was in contact  at key junctures with the Secretary of State, whose senior officials  were directed by the President to support Mr. Giuliani's efforts in  Ukraine, is relevant, disturbing, and telling.   For example, we know that on March 26, as Mr. Giuliani was pursuing  the President's private agenda in Ukraine, and just 1 week after The  Hill published an article featuring Mr. Giuliani's Ukraine conspiracy  theories, Secretary Pompeo and Mr. Giuliani spoke directly on the  phone.   That same week, President Trump's former personal secretary was asked  by Mr. Giuliani's assistant for a direct connection to Secretary  Pompeo.   Based on these records, it is also clear that Secretary Pompeo was  already actively engaged with Mr. Giuliani in early spring of 2019. It  also appears that these efforts were backed by the White House, given  the involvement of President Trump's personal secretary.    This body and the American people need to see these emails and other  files at the State Department, flushing out these exchanges and the  details surrounding Mr. Giuliani's communications with Secretary  Pompeo. Moreover, based on call records lawfully obtained by the House  from this period, we know that from March 24 to March 30, Mr. Giuliani  called the White House several times and also connected with an  unidentified number numerous times.   These records show that on March 27, Mr. Giuliani placed a series of  calls--series of calls--to the State Department switchboard, Secretary  Pompeo's assistant, and the White House switchboard in quick  succession, all within less than 30 minutes.   Obtaining emails and other documents regarding the State Department  leadership's interaction with President Trump's private lawyer in this  period, when Mr. Giuliani was actively orchestrating the pressure  campaign in Ukraine related to the sham investigation into Vice  President Biden and the 2016 election, would further clarify the  President's involvement and direction at this key juncture in the  formation of a plot to solicit foreign interference in our election.   We also know, based on recently obtained documents from Lev Parnas,  an associate of Rudy Giuliani who assisted him in his representation of  President Trump, that Giuliani likely spoke with Secretary Pompeo about  Ukraine matters even earlier than previously understood.   According to documents obtained from Mr. Parnas, Mr. Giuliani wrote  in early February of 2019 that he apparently spoke with Secretary  Pompeo about the removal of the U.S. Ambassador in Ukraine, Marie  Yovanovitch. Mr. Giuliani viewed her as an impediment to implementing  the President's corrupt scheme and orchestrated a long-running smear  campaign against her. Here is what Mr. Parnas said about this just last  week.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Mr. Chief Justice, I send a motion to the desk to  table the amendment.   The CHIEF JUSTICE.

I remind everyone that I will be moving to table the amendment. It is  also important to remember that both the evidence and witnesses are  addressed in the underlying resolution.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The amendment is arguable by the parties for 2  hours, equally divided.   Mr. Manager Schiff, are you a proponent or opponent of this motion?   Mr. Manager SCHIFF.

Mr. Schiff, your side will proceed first, and you  will be able to reserve time for rebuttal.   Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, before I begin, the House  managers will reserve the balance of our time to respond to the counsel  for the President.   Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, counsel for the President, and the  American people, I am Jason Crow from the great State of Colorado.   The House managers strongly support this amendment to subpoena key  documents from the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB. These  documents go directly to one of President Trump's abuses of power: his  decision to withhold vital military aid from a strategic partner that  is at war to benefit his own personal reelection campaign. Why should  that matter? Why should anybody care? Why should I care?   Before I was a Member of Congress, I was an American soldier serving  in Iraq and Afghanistan. Although some years have passed since that  time, there is still some memories that are seared in my brain. One of  those memories was scavenging scrap metal on the streets of Baghdad in  the summer of 2003, which we had to bolt onto the side of our trucks  because we had no armor to protect against roadside bombs.   When we talk about troops not getting the equipment they need, when  they need it, it is personal to me. To be clear here, we are talking of  $391 million of taxpayer money intended to protect our national  security by helping our strategic partner, Ukraine, fight against  Vladimir Putin's Russia, an adversary of the United States.   The President could not carry out this scheme alone. He needed a lot  of people to help him. That is why we know as much about it as we do  today. But there is much more to know. That is what trials are for, to  get the full picture.   We know there is more because President Trump needed the Office of  Management and Budget to figure out how to stop what should have been a  routine release of funds mandated by Congress--a release of funds that  was already under way.   The people in this Chamber don't need me to tell you that because 87  of you in this room voted for those vital funds to support our partner  Ukraine.   Witnesses before the House testified extensively about OMB's  involvement in carrying out the hold. It was OMB that relayed the  President's instructions and implemented them. It was OMB that  scrambled to justify the freeze.   OMB has key documents that President Trump has refused to turn over  to Congress. It is time to subpoena those documents. These documents  would provide insight into critical aspects of the military aid hold.  They would show the decision-making process and motivations behind  President Trump's freeze. They would reveal the concerns expressed by  career OMB officials, including lawyers, that the hold was violating  the law. They would expose the lengths to which OMB went to justify the  President's hold. They would reveal concerns about the impact of the  freeze on Ukraine and U.S. national security. They would show that  senior officials repeatedly attempted to convince President Trump to  release the hold.   In short, they would show exactly how the President carried out the  scheme to use our national defense funds to benefit his personal  political campaign.   We are not speculating about the existence of these documents. We are  not guessing what the documents might show. During the course of the  investigation in the House, witnesses who testified before the  committees identified multiple documents directly relevant to the  impeachment inquiry that OMB continues to hold to this day.   We know these documents exist, and we know that the only reason we do  not have them is because the President directed OMB not to produce them  because he knows what they would show.   To demonstrate the significance of the OMB documents and the value  they would provide in this trial, I would like to walk you through some  of what we know exists for which the Trump administration has refused  to turn over.   As we have discussed, the Trump administration has refused to turn  over any documents to the House in response to multiple subpoenas and  requests. Based on what is known from the testimony and the few  documents that have been obtained through public reporting and  lawsuits, it is clear that the President is trying to hide this  evidence because he is afraid of what it would show. The documents  offer stark examples of the chaos and confusion that the President's  scheme set off across our government and made clear the importance of  the documents that are still being concealed by the President.   We know that OMB has documents that reveal that as early as June, the  President was considering holding military aid for Ukraine. The  President began questioning military aid to Ukraine after Congress  appropriated and authorized the money--$250 million in DOD funds and  $140 million in State Department funds. This funding had wide  bipartisan support because, as many witnesses testified, providing  military aid to Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression  also benefits our own national security. Importantly, the President's  questions came weeks after the Department of Defense already certified  that Ukraine had undertaken the anti-corruption reforms and other  measures mandated by Congress as a condition for receiving that aid.  There is a process for making sure that the funds make it to the right  place and to the right people--a process that has been followed every  year that we have been providing that security assistance to Ukraine,  including the first 2 years under the Trump administration.   Nonetheless, the President's questions came days after DOD issued a  press release on June 18, announcing they would provide its $250  million portion of the taxpayer-funded military aid to Ukraine.  According to public reporting, the day after DOD's press release, a  White House official named Robert Blair called OMB's Acting Director,  Russell Vought, to talk about the military aid to Ukraine. According to  public reports, Mr. Blair told Vought: ``We need to hold it up.''   OMB has refused to produce any documents related to this  conversation. The Senate can get them by passing the amendment and  issuing a subpoena.   But there is more. The same day Blair told Vought to hold up the aid,  Michael Duffey, a political appointee at OMB who reports to Vought,  emailed Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Elaine McCusker and told her  that the President had questions about the aid. Duffey copied Mark  Sandy, a career official at OMB, who told us about the email in his  testimony before the House.   Like all others, that email was not produced by the Trump  administration in the House impeachment investigation. We know this  email exists, however, because in response to a Freedom of Information  Act lawsuit, the Trump  [[Page S403]]  administration was forced to release a redacted email consistent with  Sandy's description.   But OMB provided none of those documents to the House. With this  proposed amendment, the Senate has an opportunity to obtain and review  the full record that can further demonstrate how and why the President  was holding the aid. These documents would also shed light on the  President's order to implement the hold.   On July 3, the State Department told various officials that OMB  blocked it from dispensing $141 million in aid. OMB had directed the  State Department not to send a notification to Congress about spending  the money, and without that notification, the aid was effectively  blocked. Why did OMB block the congressional notification? Who told  them to do it? What was the reason? The Senate would get those answers  if it issued this subpoena.   But there is more. On July 12, Blair--the White House official who  had called Vought on June 19 and said ``We need to hold it up''--sent  an email to Duffey at OMB. Blair said: ``The President is directing a  hold on military support funding for Ukraine.''   We haven't seen this email. The only reason we know about it is from  the testimony of Mark Sandy, the career OMB official who followed the  law and complied with his subpoena. As you can see from the transcript  excerpt in front of you, Sandy testified that the July 12 email did not  mention concerns about any other country or any other aid packages,  just Ukraine. So of the dozens of countries we provide aid and support  for, the President was only concerned about one of them--Ukraine. Why?  Well, we know why. But OMB has still refused to provide a copy of this  July 12 email and has refused to provide any documents surrounding it,  all because the President told OMB to continue to hide the truth from  Congress and the American people.   What was he afraid of? A subpoena issued by the Senate would show us.   OMB also has documents about a key series of meetings triggered by  the President's order to hold military aid. In the second half of July,  the National Security Council convened a series of interagency meetings  about the President's hold on military aid. OMB documents would show  what happened during those meetings. For example, on July 18, the  National Security Council staff convened a routine interagency meeting  to discuss Ukraine policy. During the meeting, it was the OMB  representative who announced that President Trump placed a hold on all  military aid to Ukraine.   Ambassador Bill Taylor, our most senior diplomat to Ukraine,  participated in that meeting, and he described his reaction at his own  hearing.

The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Schiff, are you in favor of the motion or  opposed?   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. In favor, Your Honor.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone?   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. We are opposed.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Schiff, the managers will go first and are  able to reserve time for rebuttal.   Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished Members of the  Senate, counsel for the President, my name is Hakeem Jeffries, and I  have the honor of representing the 8th Congressional District of New  York, in Brooklyn and Queens. It is one of the most diverse districts  in the Nation. In fact, I have been told that I have the 9th most  African-American district in the country and the 16th most Jewish.   Here on the Hill, some folks have said: Hakeem, is that complicated?   But as my friend Leon Goldenberg says back at home: Hakeem, you have  the best of both worlds.   You see, in America, our diversity is a strength; it is not a  weakness. And one of the things that binds us together--all of us--as  Americans, regardless of race, regardless of religion, regardless of  region, regardless of sexual orientation, and regardless of gender is  that we believe in the rule of law and the importance of a fair trial.   The House managers strongly support this amendment to subpoena  witness testimony, including with respect to Mick Mulvaney.   Who has ever heard of a trial with no witnesses? But that is exactly  what some are contemplating here today. This amendment would address  that fundamental flaw. It would ensure that the trial includes  testimony from a key witness: the President's Acting Chief of Staff and  head of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, and it  would ensure that the Senate can consider his testimony immediately.   Let's discuss why the need to hear from Mick Mulvaney is so critical.   First, Leader McConnell's resolution undercuts more than 200 years of  Senate impeachment trial practice. It departs from every impeachment  trial conducted to date. It goes against the Senate's own longstanding  impeachment rules, which contemplate the possibility of new witness  testimony. In fact, it departs from any criminal or civil trial  procedure in America. Why should this President be held to a different  standard?   Second, the proposed amendment for witness testimony is necessary in  light of the President's determined effort to bury the evidence and  cover up his corrupt abuse of power.  [[Page S407]]    The House tried to get Mr. Mulvaney's testimony. We subpoenaed him.  Mr. Mulvaney, together with other key witnesses--National Security  Advisor John Bolton, senior White House aide Robert Blair, Office of  Management and Budget official Michael Duffey, and National Security  Council lawyer John Eisenberg--were called to testify before the House  as part of this impeachment inquiry, but President Trump was determined  to hide from the American people what they had to say. The President  directed the entire executive branch and all of his top aides and  advisers to defy all requests for their testimony. That cannot be  allowed to stand.   Third, Mr. Mulvaney is a highly relevant witness to the events at  issue in this trial. Mr. Mulvaney was at the center of every stage of  the President's substantial pressure campaign against Ukraine. Based on  the extensive evidence the House did obtain, it is clear that Mulvaney  was crucial in planning the scheme, executing its implementation, and  carrying out the coverup.   Emails and witness testimony show that Mr. Mulvaney was in the loop  on the President's decision to explicitly condition a White House  meeting on Ukraine's announcement of investigations beneficial to the  President's reelection prospects.   He was closely involved in implementing the President's hold on the  security assistance and subsequently admitted that the funds were being  withheld to put pressure on Ukraine to conduct one of the phony  political investigations that the President wanted--phony political  investigations.   A trial would not be complete without the testimony of Mick Mulvaney.  Make no mistake. The evidentiary record that we have built is powerful  and can clearly establish the President's guilt on both of the Articles  of Impeachment, but it is hardly complete. The record comes to you  without the testimony of Mr. Mulvaney and other important witnesses.   That brings me to one final preliminary observation. The American  people agree that there cannot be a fair trial without hearing from  witnesses who have relevant information to provide.   The Constitution, our democracy, the Senate, the President and, most  importantly, the American people deserve a fair trial. A fair trial  requires witnesses in order to provide the truth, the whole truth, and  nothing but the truth. That is why this amendment should be adopted.   Before we discuss Mr. Mulvaney's knowledge of the President's  geopolitical shakedown, it is important to note that an impeachment  trial without witnesses would be a stunning departure from this  institution's past practice.   This distinguished body has conducted 15 impeachment trials. All have  included witnesses. Sometimes those trials included just a handful of  witnesses, as indicated on the screen. At other times, they included  dozens. In one case, there were over 100 different witnesses.   As the slide shows, the average number of witnesses to appear at a  Senate impeachment trial is 33, and in at least 3 of those instances,  including the impeachment of Bill Clinton, witnesses appeared before  the Senate who had not previously appeared before the House. That is  because the Senate, this great institution, has always taken its  responsibility to administer a fair trial seriously. The Senate has  always taken its duty to obtain evidence, including witness testimony,  seriously. The Senate has always taken its obligation to evaluate the  President's conduct based on a full body of available information  seriously. This is the only way to ensure fundamental fairness for  everyone involved.   Respectfully, it is important to honor that unbroken precedent today  so that Mr. Mulvaney's testimony, without fear or favor as to what he  might say, can inform this distinguished body of Americans.   This amendment is also important to counter the President's  determination to bury the evidence of high crimes and misdemeanors.   As we have explained in detail today, despite considerable efforts by  the House to obtain relevant documents and testimony, President Trump  has directed the entire executive branch to execute a coverup. He has  ordered the entire administration to ignore the powers of Congress's  separate and coequal branch of government to investigate his offenses  in a manner that is unprecedented in American history.    There were 71 requests by the House for relevant evidence. In  response, the White House produced zero documents in this impeachment  inquiry--71 requests, 0 documents.   President Trump is personally responsible for depriving the Senate of  information important to consider in this trial. This point cannot be  overstated. When faced with a congressional impeachment inquiry, a  process expressly set forth by the Framers of the Constitution in  article I, the President refused to comply in any respect, and he  ordered his senior aides to fall in line.   As shown on the slide, as a result of President Trump's obstruction,  12 key witnesses, including Mr. Mulvaney, refused to appear for  testimony in the House's impeachment inquiry. No one has heard what  they have to say. These witnesses include central figures in the abuse  of power charged in article I. What is the President hiding?   Equally troublesome, President Trump and his administration did not  make any legitimate attempts to reach a reasonable accommodation with  the House or compromise regarding any document requests or witness  subpoenas. Why? Because President Donald John Trump wasn't interested  in cooperating. He was plotting a coverup.   It is important to take a step back and think about what President  Trump is doing. Complete and total Presidential obstruction is  unprecedented in American history. Even President Nixon, whose Articles  of Impeachment included obstruction of Congress, did not block key  White House aides from testifying in front of Congress during the  Senate Watergate hearings. In fact, he publicly urged White House aides  to testify.   Remember all of those witnesses who came in front of this body? Take  a look at the screen. John Dean, the former White House Counsel,  testified for multiple days pursuant to a subpoena. H.R. Haldeman,  President Nixon's former Chief of Staff, was subpoenaed and testified.  Alexander Butterfield, the White House official who revealed the  existence of the tapes, testified publicly before the Senate, and so  did several others. President Trump's complete and total obstruction  makes Richard Nixon look like a choirboy.   Two other Presidents have been tried before the Senate. How did they  conduct themselves?   William Jefferson Clinton and Andrew Johnson did not block any  witnesses from participating in the Senate trial. President Trump, by  contrast, refuses to permit relevant witnesses from testifying to this  very day.   Many of President Clinton's White House aides testified in front of  Congress, even before the commencement of formal impeachment  profession. During various investigations in the mid-1990s, the House  and the Senate heard from more than two dozen White House aides,  including the White House Counsel, the former Chief of Staff, and  multiple senior advisers to President Clinton.   President Clinton himself gave testimony on camera and under oath. He  also allowed his most senior advisers, including multiple Chiefs of  Staff and White House Counsels, to testify in the investigation that  led to his impeachment.   As you can see in the chart, their testimony was packaged and  delivered to the Senate. There were no missing witnesses who had defied  subpoenas. No aides who had personal knowledge of his misconduct were  directed to stay silent by President Clinton.   We have an entirely different situation in this case. Here we are  seeking witnesses the President has blocked from testifying before the  House. Apparently, President Trump thinks he can do what no other  President before him has attempted to do in such a brazen fashion:  float above the law and hide the truth from the American people. That  cannot be allowed to stand.   Let me now address some bedrock principles about the Congress's  authority to conduct investigations. Our broad powers of inquiry are at  their strongest during an impeachment proceeding, when the House and  Senate exercise responsibilities expressly set forth in article I of  the Constitution.   Nearly 140 years ago, the Supreme Court recognized that, when the  House  [[Page S408]]  or Senate is determining a question of impeachment, there is no reason  to doubt the right to compel the attendance of witnesses, and their  answer to proper questions, in the same manner and by the use of the  same means that courts of justice can in like cases. Our Nation's  Founders and greatest legal minds recognized these principles early on.  Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story explained that the President should  not have the power of preventing a thorough investigation of his  conduct or of securing himself against the disgrace of a public  conviction by impeachment, if he should deserve it.   President Trump cannot function as judge, jury, and executioner of  our democracy. It wasn't just the courts that confirmed this for us. It  was some of our Nation's leading public servants. Representative John  Quincy Adams, speaking on the floor of the House, after he had served  as President, once explained: ``What mockery would it be for the  Constitution of the United States to say that the House should have the  power of impeachment, extending even to the President of the United  States himself, and yet to say that the House had not the power to  obtain the evidence and proofs on which their impeachment was based.''   As Hamilton, Story, Adams, and others have recognized, the President  cannot insulate himself from Congress's investigations of his  wrongdoing. If the President could decide what evidence gets to be  presented in his own trial, that would fundamentally nullify the  constitutional power of impeachment.   This amendment is important because President Trump simply cannot be  allowed to hide the truth. No other President has done it; the Supreme  Court does not allow it; and the President is not above the law.   Witnesses matter. Documents matter. Evidence matters. The truth  matters.   Let me now turn to the third justification for this amendment. Mr.  Mulvaney's testimony is critical to considering the case for removal.  It is imperative that we hear from the President's closest aide, a man  intimately involved at key stages of this extraordinary abuse of power.  President Trump knows this. Why else would he be trying so hard to  prevent Mick Mulvaney from testifying before you?   There are at least four reasons why Mr. Mulvaney's testimony is  critical. To begin with, as Acting White House Chief of Staff and head  of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney has firsthand  knowledge about President Trump's efforts to shake down Ukraine and  pressure its new President into announcing phony investigations.   Mr. Mulvaney was in the loop at each critical stage of President  Trump's scheme. He was in the loop in the planning of the scheme; he  was in the loop in its implementation; and he was in the loop when the  scheme fell apart. He even admitted publicly that the aid was withheld  in order to pressure Ukraine into announcing an investigation designed  to elevate the President's political standing.   Mr. Mulvaney, perhaps more than any other administration witness,  excepting the President, has firsthand insight into the decision to  withhold $391 million in military and security aid to a vulnerable  Ukraine without justification. Indeed, our investigation revealed that  President Trump personally ordered Mr. Mulvaney to execute the freeze  in July of 2019. Mr. Mulvaney holds the senior-most staff position at  the White House. He is a member of President Trump's Cabinet, and he is  responsible for President Trump's team at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He  remains the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, which  implemented the hold on the security assistance, in violation of the  law, as the Government Accountability Office recently concluded.   In short, respectfully, the Senate's responsibility to conduct a  complete and fair trial demands that Mr. Mulvaney testify.   Second, Mr. Mulvaney's testimony is critical because of his knowledge  of the planning of President Trump's abuse of power. Ambassador Gordon  Sondland, the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, testified that  there was a quid pro quo. Ambassador Sondland is not a so-called Never  Trumper. Mr. Sondland gave $1 million to President Trump's  inauguration.   He testified that everybody was in the loop and that it was no secret  what was going on. In fact, as early as May of 2019, Ambassador  Sondland made clear that he was coordinating on Ukraine matters with  Mr. Mulvaney.   Here is what David Holmes, an official at the U.S. Embassy in  Ukraine, had to say on that matter:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Mr. Chief Justice, I make a motion to table the  amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Democratic leader is recognized.                              Amendment No. 1290     Let's take a 5-minute break. I ask everybody to stay  close to the Chamber. We will go with a hard 5 minutes.                            ____________________     Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate stand in recess subject to the call of the Chair.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 11:19 p.m., recessed until  11:39 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Schiff, are you in favor or opposed?  [[Page S421]]        Mr. Manager SCHIFF. In favor.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone.   Mr. Counselor CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief Justice, we are opposed.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. There are 2 hours for argument, equally divided.   Mr. Schiff, you may proceed first.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, the majority leader amended his  resolution earlier today to allow the admission of the House record  into evidence, though the resolution leaves the record subject to  objections.   But there is a gaping hole--another gaping hole--in the resolution.  The resolution would allow the President to cherry-pick documents he  has refused to produce to the House and attempt to admit them into  evidence here.   That would enable the President to use his obstruction not only as a  shield to his misconduct but also as a sword in his defense. That would  be patently unfair and wholly improper. It must not be permitted, and  that is what the Schumer amendment addresses.   The amendment addresses that issue by providing that if any party  seeks to admit, for the first time here, information that was  previously subject to subpoena, that party must do a simple and fair  thing; it must provide the opposing party all of the other documents  responsive to the subpoena. That is how the law works in America. It is  called the rule of completeness.   When the selective introduction of evidence distorts facts or sows  confusion in a trial, there is a solution. It is to ensure that  documents that provide for a complete picture can be introduced to  avert such distortions and confusion.   The rule of completeness is rooted in the commonsense evidentiary  principle that a fair trial does not permit the parties to selectively  introduce evidence in a way that would mislead factfinders. The  Senators should embrace it as a rule for this trial, and the amendment  does just that.   This amendment does not in any way limit the evidence the President  may introduce during his trial. He should be able to defend himself  against the charges against him as every defendant has the right to do  around the country. But this amendment does make sure that he does it  in a fair way and that his obstruction cannot be used as a weapon.   It is an amendment based on simple fairness, and it will help the  Senate and the American people get to the truth.   House managers are not afraid of the evidence, whatever it may be. We  want an open process designed to get to the truth, no matter whether it  helps or hurts our case. That is what the Senate should want, and that  is what the American people certainly want.   This amendment helps that process of getting more evidence so we can  get to the truth, and we urge you to vote for it.   The amendment also addresses another omission in the majority  leader's resolution by providing for the proper handling of  confidential and classified information for the record. This amendment  seeks to balance the public's interest in transparency with the  importance of protecting limited, sensitive information bearing  directly on the case you are trying.   As for confidential information, some of the evidence in this case  includes records of phone calls. They establish important patterns of  conduct, as we explain in the Ukraine impeachment report.   But the original phone records, including a great deal more  information in context, should be available for this body to review if  needed in a confidential setting. It contains personally sensitive  information concerning individuals who are not at issue in this trial  and would potentially subject them to intrusions on their privacy.   The Secretary of the Senate has the capacity to handle such material  and make it available to you as needed.   The amendment allows the privacy interests of many individuals to be  protected, while allowing the Senators access to the full record.   As for the classified information that this amendment addresses,  there may be several very relevant classified documents.   Let me just highlight one in particular. It involves the testimony of  the Vice President's national security aide, Jennifer Williams, and it  concerns a conversation between the Vice President and the President of  Ukraine, and the House managers believe that it would be of value to  this body to see, in trying the case.   Let me start by saying that we have twice requested that the Vice  President declassify this document. We have reviewed it, and there is  no basis to keep it classified. The Vice President has not responded,  and we can only conclude this was an additional effort by the President  to conceal wrongdoing from the public. But as it stands now, it remains  classified. It must be handled like any other classified document by  this body in a method that would allow them.   Let me just take a moment to go further. The public should see that  supplemental testimony as well. That supplemental testimony--that  classified testimony--was added to the record by the Vice President's  aide because she believed, I think, on further reflection, that it  would shed additional light on what she has said publicly. You should  see it and you should evaluate it for what it has to say, but, what is  more, so should the American people.   So I would urge not only that you support this amendment to make sure  that you can handle the classified information, there is a mechanism  for it, and personal identifiable information need not be made public,  but also information that is improperly classified that bears or sheds  light on her decision should be accessible to you and should be  accessible to the American people.   I reserve the balance of our time.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Philbin and  Mr. Sekulow will argue.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Philbin.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the Senate, the  President opposes this amendment, and I can be brief in explaining why.   This amendment would say that any subpoena that was issued pursuant  to the House's impeachment inquiry--any subpoena that they issued at  all--becomes defined as a duly authorized subpoena for purposes of this  amendment. As we have explained several times today, because the House  began this inquiry without taking a vote, it never authorized any of  its committees to issue subpoenas pursuant to the impeachment power.   The first 23 subpoenas, at a minimum, that the House committees  issued were all unauthorized in ultra vires, and that is why the Trump  administration did not respond to them and did not comply with them.  That was explained in a letter of October 18, from White House Counsel  Cipollone to Chairman Schiff and others, that it is a legal infirmity  in those subpoenas.   There has never been an impeachment inquiry initiated by the House of  Representatives against a President of the United States without it  being authorized by a vote of the full House. This is a principle that  the Supreme Court has made clear in cases such as United States vs.  Rumely, that no committee of Congress can exercise authority assigned  by the Constitution to the Chamber itself, of the House or the Senate,  without being delegated that authority by the House or the Senate.   In Rumely, the Court explains that to determine the validity of a  subpoena requires ``construing the scope of the authority which the  House of Representatives gave to the committee.''   So this is a legal issue, an infirmity in those subpoenas, and this  amendment proposes to do away with that legal infirmity by defining all  their subpoenas as duly authorized, and we do not support that  amendment.   In addition to that, I just want to respond briefly to Chairman  Schiff's description of the rule of completeness. This is not about the  rule of completeness. The rule of completeness has to do with a  particular document or a particular piece of evidence which is  misleading in itself. With that document, if there is something  specific about it that there is another response on the email chain-- something like that--that particular document has some specific thing  attached to it, and then that should also come into evidence.   But since all the evidentiary motions are being preserved and  objections can be made later, evidentiary arguments under the  underlying resolution can be made. The rule of completeness can be  argued. There is no need for that to do this amendment, because this  amendment doesn't have anything to do with the rule of completeness.  [[Page S422]]    With that, I will yield the remainder of my time to Mr. Sekulow.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Sekulow.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the  Senate. I will be brief. This amendment to the resolution we oppose, as  Mr. Philbin just said, because it is in essence an unconstitutional  attempt to cure a defect--a defect in their own proceeding.   To be clear, we are reserving our objections as it relates to  hearsay, which is what the record primarily consists of.   I also want to respond very briefly to what Manager Schiff said  regarding the proceedings in the House of Representatives and the lack  of agency counsel. He said it is much like the grand jury. He best be  glad and the Members of his committee best be glad that it is not like  a grand jury, because if it was a grand jury and information was  leaked, which it was consistently throughout this process, they could  be subject to felony.   So I want to be clear. Utilizing this amendment to cure a  constitutional defect--and that is what this is--is exactly what we  have been arguing about now for almost 11 hours. It is changing the  rules. It is different rules.   I can't determine if we are dealing with a trial, a pretrial motion-- but we have now have spent 11 hours arguing about something that we  will be arguing again next week.   But the idea that you can cure in three paragraphs constitutional  defects doesn't pass constitutional muster.   We yield the rest of our time.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The House managers have 54 minutes remaining.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Well, first of all, the counsel makes the  argument once again that with subpoenas, the President gets to decide  which are valid and which are invalid, and any subpoena the President  doesn't like, he may simply declare invalid, and that is the end of the  story. Therefore, it is invalid, and no documents are required, and no  witnesses need to show up, and, therefore, you don't need to consider  whether the President should be able to game the system by showing you  a handful of documents to mislead you and deprive you of seeing all of  the other documents relevant to that same subject. That is their  argument. The President didn't like the way the subpoenas were issued,  even though the Court has already ruled on this issue and said: No, Mr.  President, you don't get to decide whether a subpoena is valid or not  in an impeachment proceeding. That is the sole responsibility of the  House.   But no, I guess they would suggest to you the President would never  mislead you about documents. If they seek to introduce something, you  can be assured that that document tells the complete truth.   But we already know you can place no such reliance on the President.  How do we know this? We have already seen it.   Look at what they did in response to the FOIA, or Freedom of  Information Act, requests. They blacked out all the incriminating  information. They blacked out the ``we can't represent any more that we  are going to be able to actually spend this money in time. We can't  represent that we are not going to be in violation of the law of the  Impoundment Act.'' They redact that.   Is that what you want in this trial, for them to be able to introduce  one part of an email chain and not show you the rest?   You want to be able to have a situation where the President has  withheld all these documents from you, can introduce a document that  suggests a benign explanation but not the reply that confirms the  corrupt explanation, because that is what we are really talking about  here.   Now they clothe this in the argument that, well, we don't think these  were duly authorized subpoenas. We are merely categorizing the universe  of documents they should turn over if they want to turnover selective  documents. Let them call them unduly authorized, therefore. The point  is, that the documents that should be turned over should not be cherry- picked by a White House that has already shown such a deliberate intent  to deceive.   Finally, counsel says they can't tell whether we are dealing with a  trial here. Well, do you know something? Neither can we. If they are  confused, they are confused for a good reason, because this doesn't  look like any other trial that they are used to. People watching--they  are confused, too, because they would think if this was a trial, there  would be no debate about whether the party with the burden of proof  could call witnesses. Of course, they could. Of course, they can.   The defendant doesn't get to decide who the prosecution can call as a  witness. If you are confused, so is the public. They want this to look  like a regular trial, and it should. That has been the history of this  body. That has been the history of this body.   Now I know it is late, but I have to tell you it doesn't have to be  late. We don't control the schedule here. We are not deciding we want  to carry on through the evening. We don't get to decide the schedule.   There is a reason for why we are still here at 5 minutes to midnight.  There is a reason why we are here at 5 minutes to midnight, and that is  because they don't want the American people to see what is going on  here. They are hoping people are asleep. You know, a lot of people are  asleep right now, all over the country, because it is midnight.   Now, maybe in my State of California people are still awake and  watching, but is this really what we should be doing when we are  deciding the fate of a Presidency--that we should be doing this in the  midnight hour?   I started out the day asking whether there could be a fair trial and  expressing the skepticism I think the country feels about whether that  is possible, how much they want to believe this is possible. But I have  to say, watching now at midnight, this effort to hide this in the dead  of night cannot be encouraging to them about whether there will be a  fair trial.   I yield back.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                               Motion to Table     Mr. Chief Justice, I have a motion at the desk to  table the amendment.   The CHIEF JUSTICE.
