 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the House to approve  H.R. 3567, a necessary and long-overdue piece of legislation. This is a  straightforward, commonsense bill that authorizes the purchase of a  small parcel of Natural Resources Conservation Service property in  Riverside, California, by the Riverside-Corona Resource Conservation  District.   Since 1996, the conservation district has partnered with NRCS to  acquire, colocate and manage what was previously the USDA Salinity  Laboratory. Following acquisition of the property, NRCS has not  obligated any Federal funds for plant materials research at the  Riverside location in question.   On the other hand, the conservation district, as has been mentioned,  has invested $2.8 million in improvements and upgrade to the property.  All along, the conservation district has an understanding with NRCS  that they would eventually transfer the property to its ownership.                                time  1715    Following a series of changes in personnel within NRCS, the  conservation district was informed that legislation authorizing such a  transfer would be necessary.   H.R. 3567 authorizes USDA to sell the NRCS property in Riverside to  the conservation district for an amount equal to the appraised value of  the property. The legislation further states that current NRCS  operation at the property shall be allowed to continue at no cost to  the Federal Government.   In closing, this legislation will provide long-term security for the  conservation district and the investments it has, and will continue to  make, in the property. It also protects the interests of the NRCS and  the Federal Government for as long as its limited use of the property  is needed.  [[Page H8284]]    H.R. 3567 is a win-win solution for all stakeholders, and I urge my  colleagues to support the bill.
