 Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from New York.   (The remarks of Mrs. Gillibrand and Mr. Cassidy pertaining to the  introduction of S. 1313 are printed in today's Record under  ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.  [[Page S3314]]         Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Customs  and Border Protection Hiring and Retention Act, or CBP HiRe Act.   In recent years, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, has had  a lot of trouble recruiting, hiring, and retaining personnel to  adequately staff the border and our ports of entry. Today, CBP is  nearly 1,000 officers below the mandated staffing levels. The Border  Patrol, whose duty it is to secure 6,000 miles of borderlands, suffers  from a shortage of more than 1,800 agents. These shortages persist,  despite ample backing and funding from Congress and the threat they  pose to both national security and trade-reliant communities and  economies, particularly in my State of Arizona. This has been  frustrating for border communities across the country, but it is  especially problematic for Arizona, a State that depends on both border  security and a lot of cross-border trade.   For example, the Nogales port of entry in Southern Arizona is one of  the busiest ports in the United States. It processes approximately $2.5  billion worth of produce each year. Arizona alone does about $15  billion in trade with Mexico alone, every year. Mexican shoppers spend  about $8 million in stores in Arizona every day.   However, the port currently is suffering from a 23-percent shortage  of CBP officers. Our ports cannot effectively and efficiently  facilitate the flow of commerce across the border without adequate  staffing.   One of the biggest challenges in both retaining and hiring new  officers and agents for frontline positions has been the remoteness of  CBP installations. CBP officers and border agents are often stationed  in geographically remote and isolated locations. This likely  contributes to the fact that, of those leaving the agency, nearly 30  percent of Border Patrol agents and over 10 percent of CBP officers are  lost to other agencies.   Massive staffing shortages aside, CBP is barely able to hire fast  enough to fill the jobs left by departing agents and officers. So we  have great needs that are not being filled, but we also have attrition  we simply can't replace. In fact, CBP hires only 1 out of every 64  applicants for officer positions, and 1 out of every 113 applicants for  Border Patrol agent positions. This means that less than 2 percent of  applicants manage to get through CBP's hiring process. The situation at  CBP today is simply unsustainable.   Congress can't sit idly by as slow hiring rates and accelerating  attrition threaten the security of our borders and the underpinnings of  our economy. To that end, I am pleased to introduce my CBP HiRe Act  with Senator  [[Page S3330]]  Heitkamp from North Dakota. This legislation would streamline the  hiring process and allow the CBP to finally bring more agents and  officers into frontline positions.   Importantly, this bill gives CBP new tools to recruit and retain  personnel in remote and hard-to-fill locations. This includes special  salary rates and recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives.   In addition, the bill will eliminate bureaucratic redtape by giving  CBP the authority to use direct-hire authority and to expedite the  hiring of qualified applicants. Right now, the situation is that they  have to deal with other Federal agencies and get virtually every  incentive and program they want to approve and need to approve to hire  more officers. They have to run it up the flagpole so many times with  Federal agencies that it simply takes too long.   Lastly, the bill prevents CBP from disclosing an applicant's  polygraph results with another Federal agency or non-Federal employer.  Challenges relating to the administering of the polygraph have resulted  in approximately 65 percent of the individuals failing the test.   Think about that. People who are in another law enforcement position,  even those who have taken a polygraph before just a year or two prior-- many of them fear that a false positive on a polygraph exam might  impact their ability to move to another Federal agency if that is  disclosed. If you have a polygraph, which can't be used in courts of  law because it is not perfect or nowhere near perfect, then Federal  agencies shouldn't be able to forward that to other Federal agencies.  It acts as a big disincentive for people to apply for these positions  because a false positive on a polygraph exam might imperil their  chances to work for another Federal agency or to work in law  enforcement later in their career. This also creates a disincentive, as  I mentioned, for individuals to want to be hired by CBP.   In Arizona, safety and prosperity are inextricably linked to CBP's  ability to secure the border and facilitate trade. The CBP HiRe Act  will give CBP the tools and flexibility necessary to accomplish these  missions.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan solution, and I look  forward to seeing it move through the Senate without delay.                                  ______                                         By Mr. LEAHY:   S. 1306. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to  establish refundable tax credits for expenses relating to ensuring  safety and accessibility in historic structures; to the Committee on  Finance.
