 Mr. Speaker, last year, I had the opportunity to visit  Sudan and hear from the Sudanese people. I saw firsthand the  devastating toll that the Sudanese regime has taken on the country of  Sudan and its citizens.   Sadly, today, the hardship and violence have escalated after months  of peaceful protests by the brave Sudanese people.   Sudan's longtime leader, President Omar al-Bashir, was removed from  power. Since then, the Transitional Military Council has attacked  protesters who are peacefully calling for a transition to democratic  governance.   The news we continue to see from Sudan over the past few weeks has  been nothing short of heart-wrenching as peaceful protesters have been  attacked, threatened, and killed.   Congress cannot sit idly by while this regime kills its own citizens,  blocks communication to the outside world, and continues to commit  serious human rights abuses.   Congress must do everything we can to help end this conflict. We are  morally obligated to use this platform to call attention to what is  happening there and to say with a unified voice that the Sudanese  Government's treatment of its people is completely unacceptable.   For these reasons, I have introduced a bipartisan resolution this  week calling attention to the situation in Sudan. I am honored that the  chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Engel, joined two other  leaders on this issue, Representative McGovern and Representative  Bilirakis, in supporting this legislation as original cosponsors.   I ask my colleagues to all join as cosponsors for this important  resolution, a resolution that affirms that it is Congress' position  that the Transitional Military Council must immediately stop all  violence against peaceful protesters and begin to immediately  transition governance to a democratic and civilian-led body.   The Sudanese people have the right to freedom from oppression and  violence and to live in a country where they can choose their own  leaders without fear of persecution, without fear of violence, and  without fear of being killed for simply asserting their right to self- determination, as all human beings ought to be allowed.   Simply, the ability to peacefully assemble and have one's voice heard  is a basic human right. It should be afforded to all people, including  all citizens of Sudan.   This resolution also makes it clear that Sudan must improve  dramatically if it wants to continue a productive engagement with the  United States of America, including political reform and respect for  basic human rights.   This resolution affirms the right of Sudanese people to assemble  peacefully and condemns the government's use of violence against  protesters and journalists. We emphasize that absent political reforms  and respect for human rights, it will be impossible for the U.S. to  engage Sudan as a partner.  [[Page H4441]]    It is time that we step up. It is time that we have our voices heard,  that we stand up for people whose voices are being silenced by  violence. We have a chance to speak in a clear voice and send a message  that the United States and its government will support the people of  Sudan.   Sudan must do better because we and the world are watching. Sudan  cannot be allowed to go down this dangerous path.   We have to stand with the people of Sudan, stand for their democratic  rights, allow their voices to be heard, and allow them to live in  freedom.                            ____________________
