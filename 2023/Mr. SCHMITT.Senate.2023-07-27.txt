 Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment, and  I am proud to work with my colleague from Missouri and others in a  bipartisan way to provide some relief to the people who have been  affected by this.   Here in Missouri, I can tell you--a couple weeks ago, I gave my  maiden speech, and I talked a lot about where I grew up. I grew up in a  blue-collar town in the shadow of the airport in Bridgeton, and that is  the epicenter of where this happened--near the airport, near a  landfill.   In those areas in the city and north county, people work hard. They  always have. Little did they know that this hazardous toxic waste was  being dumped in their water, in the ground where their children play.   And all this amendment does is reauthorize something that has been on  the books for decades, and it allows people who have been affected to  apply.   So I am proud to support the people who have been affected who are  looking for some measure of justice. Nothing will make them whole, but  this is a step, and I am proud to work with my colleagues in that  regard too.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1058
