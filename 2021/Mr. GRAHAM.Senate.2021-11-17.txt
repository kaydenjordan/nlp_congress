 Mr. President, later this afternoon, I will be  introducing with Senator Scott--my colleague from South Carolina, Tim  Scott--a statement for the record honoring the life of Senator Hugh K.  Leatherman, Sr.   We just lost one of the most distinguished members of the State  Senate in the history of South Carolina. Senator Leatherman was a 40- year member of the South Carolina State Senate. He was the finance  chairman, and his leadership is legendary. With his help and  assistance, the Port of Charleston is on track to become one of the  premier ports on the east coast. He was indispensable in recruiting  Boeing, Honda, and Volvo to South Carolina.   He was a dear friend of both myself and Senator Scott. I have never  known a more effective voice for South Carolina. He loved the Pee Dee,  the Florence area he represented, but when it came to helping South  Carolina, Senator Leatherman was always there. You could count on him  to lead from the front. Trying to solve problems was his life's work  rather than creating problems.   I want to let the people of South Carolina know we have lost a giant.  There will be a big vacuum, and all of us in our State are going to  have to up our game to replace the vacuum created by Senator  Leatherman.   His legacy is just extraordinary. He touched so many lives. He led  the effort to put $300 million up front to deepen the Port of  Charleston at a critical time. I could go on and on and on about how he  helped every corner of the State, from the mountains to the sea. He was  a giant of the South Carolina Senate. His voice will be missed. He has  a record of accomplishment that is just, again, legendary.   To his family and legions of friends, we mourn Senator Leatherman's  loss, but you have a lot to be proud of. Now is the time to celebrate  this great statesman's life. Senator Leatherman was truly a statesman.  He could work across the aisle. He knew how to get things done. He used  the power given to him by his constituents and his fellow colleagues in  the South Carolina Senate for the greater good. There is no better  legacy or no better statement about a politician than to say that he  used his power for the greater good.   The statement will be forthcoming from myself and Senator Scott.   To his family and friends, we stand with you. You will not go through  this journey alone.   To my many friends in South Carolina from the Pee Dee, you lost a  great champion, and I will do everything I can to help fill that vacuum  and void.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, along with my fellow Senator from South  Carolina, Mr. Scott, I rise today to honor the life of South Carolina  State Senator Hugh K. Leatherman, Sr., who passed away, surrounded by  his loving family, on November 12, 2021, at the age of 90.   Senator Leatherman was born on April 14, 1931, in Lincoln County, NC.  He was raised on a farm and attended North Carolina State University,  earning a degree in civil engineering in 1953. In 1955, he moved to  South Carolina to start a concrete company, before starting his  political career. His expansive political career began in 1967 after  being elected to serve on the Quinby Town Council. During his term on  the town council, he served as mayor pro tempore for the town of Quinby  from 1971 to 1976. In 1980, Senator Leatherman ran for South Carolina  State Senate and served the people of District 31, which includes  Darlington and Florence Counties. On June 18, 2014, Senator Leatherman  was elected president pro tempore. He also served as the chairman of  the powerful senate finance committee, as well as a member of the  ethics, interstate cooperation, rules, transportation and the labor,  commerce and industry committees.   As a State senator, a position he held for more than 40 years,  Senator Leatherman's dedication to the State could not be questioned.  When it came to the needs of South Carolina, he was always at the  forefront of getting things done. His statewide perspective led him to  championing the Port of Charleston Harbor Deepening Project, as well as  recruiting companies like Boeing, Honda, and Volvo to come to the State  he loved so intensely. He will be remembered as having one of the most  effective voices for his region and the State and was always looking  towards what the State of South Carolina could become.   Senator Leatherman's devotion to his State and his constituency  should be a model from which all public servants look to follow. We  grieve his loss  [[Page S8342]]  but celebrate the accomplishments of this great, honorable man. Mr.  President, we ask that you and our colleagues join us in applauding  Senator Leatherman's many contributions made to the State of South  Carolina. A true champion of South Carolina, Senator Leatherman will be  sorely missed.                            ____________________
