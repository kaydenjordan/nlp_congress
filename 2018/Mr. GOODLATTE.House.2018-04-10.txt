 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4203) to amend title 18, United States Code, with regard to  stalking, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4203         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Combat Online Predators       Act''.       SEC. 2. ENHANCED PENALTY FOR STALKERS OF CHILDREN.

[[Page H3079]]         (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of chapter 110A of title 18, United States Code, is       amended by inserting after the item relating to section 2261A       the following new item:  ``2261B.

(c) Conforming Amendment.--Section 2261A of title 18,       United States Code, is amended by striking ``section 2261(b)       of this title'' and inserting ``section 2261(b) or section       2262B, as the case may be''.       SEC. 3. REPORT ON BEST PRACTICES REGARDING ENFORCEMENT OF                     ANTI-STALKING LAWS.         Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Attorney General shall submit a report to       Congress, which shall--        (1) include an evaluation of Federal, tribal, State, and       local efforts to enforce laws relating to stalking; and        (2) identify and describe those elements of such efforts       that constitute the best practices for the enforcement of       such laws.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4203, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased we are voting on H.R. 4203, the  Combat Online Predators Act. This legislation increases the maximum  criminal penalty for those who stalk children and obligates the  Department of Justice to report best practices for prosecuting stalking  laws at the State and local levels.   According to the National Center for Victims of Crime, approximately  7.5 million people are stalked each year. While stalking may not  involve physical harm, the psychological effects from being stalked can  be just as severe. Stalking victims live in constant fear of violence.  They fear it will never stop.   In fact, the prevalence of anxiety, insomnia, social dysfunction, and  severe depression is much higher amongst stalking victims than the  general population. About half of all victims of stalking indicate that  they were stalked before age 25, and about 14 percent of female victims  and 16 percent of male victims experienced stalking between the ages of  11 and 17.   Mr. Speaker, the unfortunate reality is that, in the internet age,  stalking our Nation's youth has become easier for predators. Predators  can now harass children in their homes--the very places our children  should be safest--and can even do so anonymously.   H.R. 4203 recognizes that those who stalk minors should be subject to  greater criminal penalties. The bill increases the maximum allowable  prison sentence by 5 years in cases in which the victim is a minor. No  child should live in constant fear for their own safety, and this bill  will further deter predators from such conduct.   Stalking cases are also notoriously difficult to prosecute because  they require showing repeated intentional harassment. It is important  for prosecutors to be able to reference best practices in investigating  and prosecuting these cases. Therefore, H.R. 4203 requires the Attorney  General to issue a report identifying best practices in bringing these  cases.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the lead sponsor of this  legislation, Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick from Pennsylvania. This bill  was approved with unanimous, bipartisan support by the House Judiciary  Committee, and I urge my colleagues in the House to support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, at this time, it is my pleasure to yield  such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Fitzpatrick), the chief sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time,  only to urge my colleagues to support this very strong, bipartisan  legislation.   I want to congratulate the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Fitzpatrick) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Murphy). I want to  thank the ranking member of our Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security,  and Investigations Subcommittee for her work in this area.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
