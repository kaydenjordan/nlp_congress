 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act.   This legislation is the collective achievement of House Democrats  from across the country who are working to reverse the Trump  Administration's health care sabotage by updating and improving the  Affordable Care Act.   This bill expands eligibility for health care tax credits to purchase  ACA plans and encourages remaining states to expand Medicaid. These  concrete steps will provide new coverage options to those navigating  recent job loss and economic uncertainty.   Critically, this legislation also empowers Medicare to negotiate a  better deal on prescription drug prices, which will bring an end to  price gouging of American consumers and finally allow people to afford  the drugs they need.   As the pandemic continues to challenge our collective public health  and well-being, now, more than ever, American families need relief from  soaring health care and prescription drug costs.   I encourage my colleagues to support this effort to protect patients,  expand access, and lower health care costs.
