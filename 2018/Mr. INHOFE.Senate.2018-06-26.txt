 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Nathan  Dills, the first Oklahoman to be sworn in as president of the Sheet  Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors' National Association, SMACNA.  With over 3,000 company members, SMACNA is a leader in promoting  quality and excellence in the sheet metal and air conditioning  industry.   Nathan decided to go into the family sheet metal business in 2006.  The passion for sheet metal operations goes back three generations in  Nathan's family. His grandfather, O.C. Patten, was a sheet metal  worker, and his father started the family's sheet metal business in  1977. Nathan now owns and operates the family companies in Oklahoma  City.   Not only was Nathan's father, Harold, on the SMACNA board of  directors, be he was also a member of the college of fellows, a  prestigious group within the SMACNA community. While a part of SMACNA,  he won the two highest awards given by the organization. Before Harold  passed away in 2016, Nathan was elected to the board, making his father  and the rest of his family extremely proud.   I am most impressed by Nathan's devotion to his faith and his family.  He has been married to his wife, Shannon, for 19 years. Nathan has two  stepchildren, Hayley and Jordan, one daughter, Olivia, and one  grandchild, Zaidan. With 20 kids and grandkids myself, I can attest to  the true joy faith and family bring to one's life.   I want to congratulate Nathan Dills on this well-deserved position  and wish him well in his new role as SMACNA president.                            ____________________
