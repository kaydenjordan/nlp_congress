 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, earlier this year the VA Office of the Inspector General  released two separate reports highlighting VA's failure to conduct  reliable lifecycle cost estimates for its Electronic Health Record  Modernization program.   Specifically, the IG repeatedly found unreliable and incomplete  estimates for infrastructure upgrades and costs as well as inadequate  reporting of those costs.   Given the size and scope of the EHRM program, the lack of accurate  cost estimates hampers VA's ability to provide Congress with an  accurate picture of the cost and scale of efforts to modernize IT and  physical infrastructure at VA medical centers.   This piece of legislation will address these issues. It requires VA  to look at all costs across VHA, OIT, and any other programs for any  amount expended on the EHRM program, including for infrastructure  projects and contractors that were not part of the original contract.  This legislation also requires VA to provide the committee with reports  on performance metrics and outcomes.   I thank Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Bost for their leadership  and for cosponsoring this legislation as well as all of the other  cosponsors and the committee members who have truly made this a  bipartisan effort.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.                                time  1230
