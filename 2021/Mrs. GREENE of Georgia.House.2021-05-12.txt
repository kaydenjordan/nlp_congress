 Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, I rise in  opposition to H.R. 1065.   There is language that I find many Democrats use in a lot of  Democrats' bills. It is called pregnancy rights. Pregnancy rights means  abortion to them, and I really don't understand that because that is  not pregnancy. Abortion is killing a baby in the womb. That is not  pregnancy rights. That is one issue we have there.  [[Page H2229]]    Democrats are once again using identity politics--this identity is a  pregnant woman--to overregulate businesses. Rather than giving mothers  greater access to paid family leave or making healthcare affordable,  Democrats want to double down on a government mandate that punishes  businesses and religious organizations and provides more access to  abortion. That is killing the baby in the womb. That is not pregnancy  rights.   Passing this bill means a small business or religious organization  could be forced to provide paid time off to an employee to have an  abortion even if that violates the religious beliefs of the  organization. On top of that, these groups can be sued for damages for  not taking every step to accommodate pregnant workers. That means  churches and small businesses, the backbone of America, will be tied up  in court for years seeking to comply with a one-size-fits-all  government agenda from Washington.   The solution to this problem is to reopen America, reduce government  regulations on small businesses, and keep Trump tax cuts that allow  companies to keep more of their money to pass on to employees.   I cannot support a bill that allows more abortion.
