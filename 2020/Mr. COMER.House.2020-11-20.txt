 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my dear family  friends, Freddie and Inez Bryant of Gamaliel, Kentucky, on their 65th  wedding anniversary on November 4.   Mr. Speaker, I have known Freddie Bryant my entire life. He worked  with and was very close with my grandfather, Harlin Comer, at my  grandfather's construction company. Freddie has told my father and I  countless stories about his travels and adventures with my family.  [[Page H6015]]    Freddie Bryant is an expert standing timber appraiser, who tried  unsuccessfully to teach me the trade as a young man. Freddie and Inez  have three children, nine grandchildren, 17 great-grandchildren, and  one great-great-grandson.   Mr. Speaker, congratulations to the Bryants, a wonderful Monroe  County family.                            ____________________
