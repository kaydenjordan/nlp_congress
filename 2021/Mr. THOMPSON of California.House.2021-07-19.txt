 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of  my bill, the PHONE Act of 2021.   My district has been ravaged by wildfire every year since 2017.  Thousands of homes have burned, and many families have been displaced.  Following these fires, survivors called my office and told me they were  losing their landline numbers because their phones had been  disconnected for too long after their houses were destroyed.   Fire survivors face so many hurdles on the road to recovery. Losing  their phone number is the last thing they should worry about. That's  why I introduced the PHONE Act with Representative Newhouse. This  bipartisan legislation allows disaster survivors to keep their phone  numbers and have some peace of mind while they rebuild.   I thank Chairwoman Eshoo and the Committee for their attention to  this important issue and I urge a yes vote on the PHONE Act.
