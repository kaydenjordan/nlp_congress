 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of Dr. Parthasarathy Vasudevan, who passed away on December 31,  2019. Dr. Vasu's 40 years of civic and medical leadership in Phillips  County were incredibly transformative for the Arkansas Delta, and his  efforts reveal a relentless quest to improve the quality of life for  those around him.   Dr. Vasu was a physician specializing in Urology in Helena, AR, with  demand for his services extending beyond Phillips County. His career  reflected 62 years of diverse experience spanning India, Boston, and  the Natural State. Dr. Vasu grew up in India where he received his  medical degree in 1958 and met his wife, Kanaka Rajgopal. She  accompanied him to the United States in 1973 for Dr. Vasu's residency  at the New England Medical Center in Boston, and upon his completion in  1978, the two embarked on their final move, to Arkansas.   Dr. Vasu's medical impact was widespread and included philanthropic  leadership in addition to his urology practice. He served as executive  director of the Helena Health Foundation, a nonprofit organization with  a mission to improve the quality of life and healthcare offered in  Phillips County through grant funding. During his time in this role,  Dr. Vasu was instrumental in developing the Delta Area Health Education  Center in Helena, which became the University of Arkansas for Medical  Sciences East Regional Campus in 2013. The foundation honored Dr.  Vasu's sponsorship with a $4 million Wellness Center in his name.   Dr. Vasu's extensive knowledge, dedicated service, and passionate  nature were qualities not only recognized by his patients, but also by  the civic institutions in which he participated. Organizations he was  active in were the Helena Rotary Club, as well as the Phillips County  Chamber of Commerce, among others. In recognition of his philanthropic  involvement, Dr. Vasu was awarded the Paul Harris Fellowship  recognition by the Rotary Foundation and the Channel 4 Community  Service Award. Phillips County also designated August 25, 2004, as  ``Dr. P. Vasudevan Day.''   Dr. Vasu was a tremendous asset to the Phillips County region, as  well as the State of Arkansas. He was not just a doctor, but he was a  mentor and a friend who loved politics and the Arkansas Razorbacks. His  devoted heart and helping hand touched the lives of many, and his  deeply respected legacy will transcend time. I extend my heartfelt  condolences to Dr. Vasu's loved ones, his patients, and Phillips County  citizens. We pray his remarkable example inspires many future Arkansas  leaders.                            ____________________
