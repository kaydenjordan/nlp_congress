 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mr. Thompson,  for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today as a symbol of what our immigration  system can achieve. In 1979, at the age of 24, I entered this country  alone with no friends, no family, but I had my American Dream.   At times, I slept in a car or at a homeless shelter that was funded  by a faith-based nonprofit. At times, I got sick and needed to go to  the hospital.   H.R. 2 would cut funding for these nonprofit organizations and remove  reimbursement systems for immigrants to get healthcare.   When my colleagues on the other side of the aisle ask me why I don't  support this bill, my answer is simple. I don't support cutting  programs that helped me and help immigrants like me in times of their  need and their hardship. I stand with countless immigrants who have  contributed greatly to our country and urge opposition to H.R. 2.   When my colleagues and I went down to the southern border, we met  with many nonprofit organizations and saw the important and necessary  work that they do. We met with the border agents and learned that they  are working with a broken immigration system.   Reforming this system is going to be complex, but the Republicans are  proposing an enforcement-only strategy. This is not going to work.   I propose that we expand legal pathways, restore asylum systems, and  work with nonprofit organizations like the ones that housed me and  cared for me when I was just arriving to this country.
