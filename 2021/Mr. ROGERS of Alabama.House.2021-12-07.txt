 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise in strong support of the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense  Authorization Act. And I want to start off by saying Chairman Smith has  been a real leader on this effort. He has had obstacle after obstacle  thrown in his way for months and has continued to be a real advocate  for the legislation, but also trying to make sure we get in a good  place. And I couldn't ask for a better partner to lead this committee  with.   The bill before us has strong bipartisan, bicameral support.   Over the last year, we have seen the best of our soldiers, sailors,  marines, airmen, and guardians. They have performed in the toughest  environments with the greatest level of skill and professionalism. Many  gave their lives so others would have a chance at a better life.   Without a doubt, our military is the greatest force for good the  world has ever seen. Providing the authorities and resources our  servicemembers need to defend our Nation and defeat adversaries is the  greatest responsibility we have here in Congress.   We accomplish that responsibility with the bill before us today. It  provides an additional $25 billion over the President's request,  reversing irresponsible cuts to procurement and readiness.   This bill ensures our warfighters are the best equipped and trained  in the world. It puts our servicemembers first, providing a 2.7 percent  pay raise and expanding benefits to their families.   It puts American workers first with historic investments in our  industrial base.   It also begins divesting in legacy systems that will not help us  deter future  [[Page H7217]]  threats. Instead, it invests in new technologies like artificial  intelligence, hypersonics, and quantum computing that will help us stay  ahead of our adversaries. That is important because Russia and China  are rapidly modernizing their militaries.   China is outpacing us with advancements in emerging technologies and  weapons systems. In recent years, we have seen China use its military  to push out its borders, threaten our allies, and gain footholds on new  continents.   This bill is laser focused on preparing our military to prevail in a  conflict with China. It makes critical investments in new systems  capable of surviving in contested environments. It includes provisions  that will remove China from our defense supply chain. And it reaffirms  our support to allies in the region, especially Taiwan.   In Eastern Europe, Russia is on the march again. Putin is threatening  NATO allies and amassing an invasion force on the Ukrainian border.   This bill makes historic investments in the European Defense  Initiative and provides $300 million for Ukraine, $75 million of which  is lethal aid.   Threats from near-peer rivals like China and Russia are not the only  ones we face. Terrorists continue to plot to destroy our way of life,  so we must continue to take the fight to them. With strong investments  in new capabilities and readiness, this bill enables our warfighters to  do just that.   Finally, I think we were all horrified by the disastrous withdrawal  from Afghanistan. This bill includes important provisions to provide  accountability and ensure that we honor the 2,500 Americans who gave  their lives in Afghanistan to keep our Nation safe.   Again, Madam Speaker, this is a carefully drafted bipartisan,  bicameral agreement. I urge all Members to support our servicemembers  and their families by voting in favor of this bill. I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  2015     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Turner), who is not only the ranking member on  Strategic Forces Subcommittee, but has spent years leading the effort  for us to get to meaningful ways to deal with sexual assault in the  military, which this bill does.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Jackson), an outstanding freshman member of  our committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Crawford).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher), the ranking member of the  Military Personnel Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Garcia).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Fallon).     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cammack).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, I want to again thank Chairman Smith, Chairman Reed,  Ranking Member Inhofe, and all the members of HASC and SASC for their  tremendous work this year. I also want to thank our committee staff on  both sides of the aisle, as well as staff from leadership, legislative  counsel, and CBO, for their hard work and dedication. Enormous numbers  of hours were put into this endeavor over the course of this year, and  I can't overstate how much I appreciate the staff work.   Finally, Madam Speaker, today is the day we honor the brave 3,500  American servicemembers killed or wounded in Pearl Harbor. On that day  and again on September 11, our Nation came together and vowed to defend  our homeland and protect our freedom from all enemies. Each year,  Congress comes together in an effort to fulfill that vow by passing the  National Defense Authorization Act.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to do that again this year and pass  the NDAA, and I yield back the balance of my time.
