 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Shalala) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule providing for the  consideration of H.R. 2339, the Protecting American Lungs and Reversing  the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act of 2019. This bill is a misnomer. It is  not aimed at curbing youth tobacco or e-cigarette use, it is aimed at  tobacco generally.   Both parties in the House and Senate agreed that we needed to act in  order to prevent youth access to these products. In December, we  fulfilled that commitment by sending a bill to the President's desk,  which he signed, that raised the legal age to purchase all tobacco  products to 21 years of age. President Trump signed what has been  termed ``T21`` into law on December 20 of 2019.   This policy will break down youth access through social networks in  schools where 18-year olds could purchase tobacco products legally and  then disseminate those products to younger students.   Other significant efforts such as the flavor ban by the Trump  administration will help limit youth tobacco use. The Food and Drug  Administration has issued a ban on flavored e-cigarette products that  appeal to children, including fruit and mint flavors. This ban will  help deter youth use in the future and prevent companies from targeting  children with appealing flavors.   When we first held a hearing on the vaping lung injury at the start  of the outbreak back in October, the cause of this lung injury was  unclear, however, these lung injuries were disproportionately affecting  the young population. After diligent efforts by the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention and State health departments, we have since  found that the vast majority of these lung injuries were caused by  tetrahydrocannabinol and the vaping products containing vitamin E  acetate, an additive.                                time  1230    Let me point out that none of these products are legal, and children  are buying them on the black market.   An article from National Public Radio, published September 27, 2019,  titled ``Many Vaping Illnesses Linked to Black Market `Dank Vapes' or  Other THC Products,'' walks through how two brothers in Wisconsin were  arrested for running a THC vape ring. Captain Mike Martin of the  Waynesboro Police Department in Virginia said that these products are  labeled ``Dank Vapes'' and ``appear commercially packaged, and there  are a variety of different flavors.'' His police department has  recovered $35,000 worth of vaping products.   At this point, Madam Speaker, I think it is worthwhile to point out  it is probably not a good idea for anyone to take into their lungs  something that is labeled ``Dank Vapes.''   According to the CDC, ``Dank Vapes appears to be the most prominent  in a class of largely counterfeit brands, with common packaging that is  easily available online and that is used by distributors to market THC- containing cartridges.''   H.R. 2339 does absolutely nothing to crack down on that black market.  These deliciously named vaping products, with flavors such as lemon  slushie, bubble gum, and sour diesel, will likely continue to be sold  illegally, especially online.   The Trump administration has already released guidance to ban  flavors. The Food and Drug Administration is requiring companies to  stop the manufacture, distribution, and sale of certain unauthorized  flavored e-cigarette products within 30 days of their published  guidance. This guidance took effect on February 6, 2020, and is now in  effect and enforceable.   This bill takes the flavor ban further and bans all flavored tobacco  products, including menthol. This will take flavored cigarettes,  cigars, and smokeless tobacco away from law-abiding adults, who must  now, by law, be 21 years of age to purchase any tobacco product.   Additionally, this bill contains a potential infringement on the  First Amendment by requiring health warnings on cigarette labels and  advertising. There are other ways to educate individuals, particularly  our young population, of the harmful effects of smoking without  impinging on freedom of speech.   Congress has already taken steps to protect our young people from a  future of tobacco addiction when we passed Tobacco 21, and the Trump  administration has stepped up and banned flavored e-cigarette products.  The House  [[Page H1235]]  also passed H.R. 3942, the Preventing Online Sales of E-Cigarettes to  Children Act, which requires age verification by all retailers at the  time of sale and delivery.   These policies will prevent young people from accessing e-cigarettes  and will deter future use. On the other hand, H.R. 2339 does not  address youth tobacco use. This bill would ban all flavored tobacco  products from all ages, taking away choices for law-abiding adult  Americans.   So, let's be clear. Tobacco is not healthy; however, law-abiding  adults are capable of making these decisions for themselves.   Traditional cigarettes remain the leading cause of preventable death  in the United States, claiming an estimated 480,000 lives or more each  year. This is a personal issue for me, as I lost both parents to  tobacco-related disease.   Now, according to the CDC, an estimated 34 million adults in the  United States currently smoke cigarettes, and more than 16 million  Americans live with a smoking-related disease.   While I am certainly concerned about the effect of e-cigarettes on  our young people, we do need to remember that there is a large adult  population with a whole host of health problems related to tobacco.  Some early studies show that current adult tobacco users may benefit  from the less harmful alternative that e-cigarettes pose.   Additionally, the adult population will seek out alternatives if  their tobacco product of choice is eliminated from the legal market. A  bill like this that makes illegal the products used by many Americans  could contribute to an already existing and thriving black market for  tobacco products.   As we saw last year, the outbreak of lung injuries was linked to  counterfeit and black market products. There were reports of illicit  operations by individuals taking THC vape cartridges and cutting the  product with other oils to maximize their profit.   If H.R. 2339 becomes law, it could inspire similar black market  operations to create products that law-abiding Americans currently  enjoy.   This bill is not about youth use of vaping products. It is about  eliminating all adult use of tobacco products.   We have seen a surge of lung injuries in the United States, an issue  that is not adequately addressed in this bill. The Centers for Disease  Control has linked these injuries to THC products, not tobacco.   Protecting our youth from tobacco is an important priority. However,  H.R. 2339 does not do that, and it goes too far. Therefore, I cannot  support it.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to oppose the bill, oppose the rule  that delivers the bill, and oppose this assault on free choice for the  American people.   Madam Speaker, with opposition to the rule, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article from The Hill  today, written by Yvette Clarke, making a point about the unintended  consequences of this legislation.   The bill carves out an exemption for certain cigar products, but it  also creates a ban on menthol products, which would have the unintended  consequence of adversely and selectively affecting individuals, tobacco  users, in communities of color.                       [From The Hill, Feb. 27, 2020]     Youth Tobacco Use Legislation Would Have Unintended Life-or-Death                    Consequences for Black Tobacco Users                         (By Rep. Yvette D. Clarke)         This week marks a critical, life-changing moment for the       black community, specifically for black tobacco users. The       Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act (H.R. 2339) is set       for a vote this week in the House of Representatives, and       while this bill seemingly makes a lot of sense in curbing       youth tobacco use, there are some glaring unintended dire       consequences for communities of color with this legislation.        H.R. 2339 does many things with the goal to reduce youth       tobacco use, like providing resources for a substantive       public awareness campaign to educate about the dangers of       tobacco use and reducing access to online purchases of       flavored tobacco products. However, this legislation does not       treat all tobacco products equally, carving out an exemption       for one flavored product, premium cigars preferred by white       smokers. A ban that makes an exception for one flavor--      premium cigars--while banning menthol puts black lives at       risk. Let me explain.        Considering the fact that 90 percent of black smokers use       menthol products, menthol tobacco users would live in fear of       new stop and frisk opportunities under this legislation,       because menthol would now be considered an illegal flavor. A       ban that targets menthol products but ignores other premium       tobacco products unduly burdens the black community. This       asymmetrical ban feels more like a targeted attack than a       value-neutral health care policy decision. In effect, white       adult smokers would see little difference in their lives       after this ban while black smokers could face even more       sweeping harassment from law enforcement if the hint of       menthol smoke can justify a stop.        Make no mistake, banning all electronic and combustible       tobacco products would save lives and while the premise of       this legislation to address the uptick in youth tobacco use       is positive, we cannot support an asymmetrical ban that       disproportionately endangers the black community.        While the debate has not made this clear, we are       unfortunately not currently considering a ban on all tobacco       products. In fact, we are not even debating a uniform ban on       vaping products or combustible cigarettes. Instead, the ban       would focus solely on flavored tobacco products, including       menthol. Considering how often teenagers develop smoking       habits after starting with flavored products, I understand       why the Energy and Commerce Committee has focused on this       issue. However, including menthol in the flavored products       ban will disproportionately imperil the black community       putting them at increased risk of additional over-policing.        I do not take this position lightly, but as an elected       official I must make the hard decisions--not the easy ones. I       have a responsibility, to my constituents and the       Constitution, to be the voice of the marginalized among us.       To do so, I worked with the committee to find solutions to       the criminal justice concerns of my community but was       ultimately rebuffed. Nonetheless, I introduced an amendment       promoting an education program to increase awareness about       the dangers of tobacco use and the implications of this       legislation. Constructive efforts like this will make       considerable headway towards reducing tobacco use without       laying the foundation for disparate enforcement of a ban.        While I would love to assume the best intentions of all       involved parties and hope for the best in regard to       enforcement, lived experience demands caution. In the world       created by this asymmetrical ban where menthol tobacco       products provide justification for police stops, I fear that       we would have handed law enforcement another excuse to       harass, detain and otherwise endanger marginalized       communities. Despite the clear health benefits of this ban, I       cannot in good conscious expose already vulnerable       communities to this risk.        As a duly elected representative of Brooklyn, it would be       an abdication of duty to disregard our painful history of       over-policing or to ignore the very real potential of this       history repeating itself. While no one would enjoy the       political pressure this has exposed, I cannot ignore my       nightmares of a jumped turnstile and a loosie turning into a       far more serious matter of life and death potentially       creating an additional health crisis. As Eric Garner's mother       knows all too well, and relayed in a letter to the New York       delegation regarding this ban, in New York a single cigarette       can become a death sentence.        If the committee decides to improve this bill by making it       a categorical ban on tobacco products, I will throw my full       support behind the effort. When I asked for a carve out for       menthol products, similar to the carve out that was granted       for the on line sales of premium tobacco products like the       Cuban cigars favored by Wall Street executives, I was soundly       rebuffed. I would proudly support a categorical tobacco ban,       but the committee so far has denied this opportunity.       Nonetheless, and regardless of the political pressures, I       will continue to do everything in my power to protect the       people of the 9th District of New York and all black tobacco       users across America.     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Curtis).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Madam Speaker, I will include in the Record a letter from Mothers of  the Movement. They state, in part: ``We ask that, at the same time you  consider health issues, you look carefully at the criminal justice  impact of such a change in health policy. Our community has had plenty  of experience living under laws passed with the best of intentions.  Under your bill, cigarettes preferred by African Americans would be  illegal; cigarettes preferred by non-African Americans would be  legal.''                                        Mothers of the Movement,                                Miami Gardens, FL, October 11, 2019.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chairman, House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: We appreciate your focus on       reviewing the health effects of tobacco and e-cigarettes in       young people. We urge you to pay very close attention to the       unintended effects of a ban on menthol cigarettes and what it       would mean in the Urban community.        We both strive hard to do our best and set examples in our       community amongst the black youth. Our focus is within       various cities throughout the country. We have witnessed       encounters with law enforcement and negative policing which       has been spread throughout our community.        H.R. 2339, the Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act,       contains a provision that bans menthol cigarettes. We are       concerned of the rising numbers of Black Americans who prefer       menthol cigarettes. We are alarmed that 80% Black Americans       in Urban communities invest in purchasing of these good. As a       result of this ban, we recognize the effects which may happen       within the Urban community and the justice system.        We do not encourage, support, or promote smoking especially       in our Urban communities. We are concerned that this ban in       many cases will reintroduce another version of stop-and-frisk       in black low socio-economic communities. We experience and       are forced to tolerate aggressive behaviors from law       enforcement. This is our reality and is displayed throughout       different levels of government, locally and nationally daily.       This ban will introduce or replay many hard to employ young       black Americans to the criminal justice system. We do not       want to take parents, sons, and daughters out of households       for small infractions that carry financial obligations. We       ask that, at the same time you consider health issues, you       look carefully at the criminal justice impact of such a       change in health policy. Our community has had plenty of       experience living under laws passed with the best of       intentions. Under your bill, cigarettes preferred by African-      Americans would be illegal; cigarettes preferred by non-      African-Americans would be legal.        Small violations can quickly escalate to consequential       events. We refuse to witness another mother join us in death       of a loved one because of readily available products and       decisions available in our Black communities            Best Regards,      Gwendolyn Carr,        Mother of Eric Garner.      Sybrina Fulton,        Mother of Trayvon Martin.    Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I  will offer an amendment to the rule to immediately bring up a  resolution condemning the comments of Democratic Socialist Presidential  candidate Bernard Sanders.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of this  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, to explain this amendment, I yield 5  minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Florida an  additional 3 minutes.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, this bill claims to curb youth tobacco use, including  vaping. The reality is it bans many types of tobacco products that are  legally and voluntarily used by adults.   While I do not support any form of tobacco use, it is a choice for  law-abiding adults to make. The unintended consequences of suddenly  making legal tobacco products illegal will likely push people to the  black market to seek the same products--or worse. If we really want to  address vaping, we need to target products containing  tetrahydrocannabinol, THC.   As I previously stated, we just recently made tobacco use illegal for  those under the age of 21, and the Trump administration has banned  certain flavored e-cigarette products.   This is a problem that requires a multilayered approach.  Unfortunately, the provisions in this bill will not produce the desired  result, and could even create more harm than good for some populations.   Republicans do stand ready to work on bipartisan solutions to  increase the health of our population and to protect our young people,  but I need to urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, a ``no''  vote on the rule, and a ``no'' vote on the underlying measure.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
