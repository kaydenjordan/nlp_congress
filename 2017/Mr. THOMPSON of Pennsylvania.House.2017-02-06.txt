 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the start  of National School Counseling Week to recognize the tremendous impact  that school counselors have on our students.   School counselors are committed to helping students realize their  full potential. They encourage students to explore their ability,  strengths, interests, and talents as these traits relate to career  awareness and development.   National School Counseling Week is sponsored by the American School  Counselor Association and is always observed during the first full week  of  [[Page H997]]  February. This week's theme is ``School Counseling: Helping Students  Realize Their Potential.''   Mr. Speaker, what we know is that school counselors are integral to  student success. Counselors not only help students reach their academic  and career goals, but they focus on assisting with social and personal  development, too. Many parents also benefit from the assistance of  school counselors as they encounter the challenges of raising children  in today's world.   Our counselors play a vital role in the total education of children.  I salute these professionals in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and  throughout the United States for their dedication to preparing our  students to achieve success and become productive members of society in  this ever-changing world.   Thank you to our school counselors for all you do to help educate  students nationwide. Happy National School Counseling Week.                            ____________________
