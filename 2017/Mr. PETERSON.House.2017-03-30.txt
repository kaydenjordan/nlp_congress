 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of  H.R. 1431, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017 and urge  my colleagues to vote in support.   The Science Advisory Board's work is important to making sure the EPA  considers all scientific information when writing regulations that will  impact American farmers, families and small businesses. Unfortunately,  concerns have been raised about the current review process.   This legislation addresses those concerns and builds on the work done  in the 2014 Farm Bill to create an agriculture committee under the  Science Advisory Board. This bill is necessary to ensure the EPA takes  into account the best information possible with input from public and  independent stakeholders.   H.R. 1431 will ensure a balanced and independent Science Advisory  Board and will help alleviate some of the unintended consequences  surrounding EPA regulations.
