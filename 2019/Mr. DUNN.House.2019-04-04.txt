 Madam Speaker, I rise today to demand a vote on disaster  supplemental funding.   Next Wednesday will be the 6-month anniversary of Hurricane Michael  and 6  [[Page H3091]]  months with absolutely no supplemental disaster funding, no serious  action on the part of Congress to help the victims of Florida, Georgia,  Alabama, the Carolinas, and even the California wildfires.   Every time I am in Florida, I discover new destruction. That debris  has become firewood and is leading to massive wildfires. One just took  out 700 acres. That debris is also clogging our stormwater system, and  flooding will be our next disaster.   One of the strongest hurricanes in the history of the United States  ravaged Florida and left a path of destruction across the South, and  yet, here we are with only 3 legislative days before Easter and no  relief in sight.   The Senate again failed to pass a disaster bill this week, and the  House appears to have given up. This is shameful. The lack of action is  a disgrace to the American people.   Madam Speaker, American citizens are hurting. We must pass a disaster  relief bill and do it now.                            ____________________
