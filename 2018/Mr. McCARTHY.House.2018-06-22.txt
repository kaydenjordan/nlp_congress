 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  want to congratulate the gentleman for his work, his tireless effort,  and his passion for those who have been afflicted with the addiction  and have lost the battle.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge the passage of H.R. 6 which  contains more than 50 opioid-related bills which we have considered in  the past 2 weeks.   We have in this body the opportunity nearly every day to approve  legislation of great consequence to millions of people. But rarely do  the consequences feel so immediate and so vital as they do for the  opioids package we are considering. That is because this legislation  has to do with the deadliest drug crisis in our Nation's history.                                time  0945    The grim truth is this: More Americans have died from drug overdoses  since the turn of the century than died in the Civil War. Yes, you  heard that right. In less than two decades, more than 630,000 people  have died because of drugs. Half of those deaths had to do with  opioids. This death toll is the ``American carnage'' that President  Trump referred to in his inaugural address.   My hometown of Bakersfield has been devastated by illegal drugs,  mostly heroin and meth. In 2016 alone, 54 people in my county died of  an opioid overdose. This is a statistic made up of 54 stories of  unimaginable sadness. They are stories of happy families torn apart by  deceit, abuse, and death; stories of parents robbed of children,  children robbed of parents, and friends robbed of friends. My local  news talked  [[Page H5515]]  to one man in Bakersfield who has lost four friends to overdoses in the  past few years alone.   Of course, these tragic events are not confined to just my district;  they are happening everywhere across the country, coast to coast.   So I would like to tell you another story, this time from the other  side of the country. It is the story of Eamon Eric Callanan, age 28. He  did not live to see age 29.   Eamon came from a family with deep roots in Rochester, New York. One  of his great-grandfathers was a chief of police in Rochester. His  grandfather was a judge, and his parents are attorneys. They were the  very definition, in other words, of a law-abiding family. But in early  2012, a series of events took place that sent Eamon down a different  path and stole him from his family forever.   At age 25, Eamon hurt his back--a story that many in America have  seen--while he was on his job. He began taking opioid painkillers in  response to his pain. When the pills became too expensive, Eamon, like  many Americans, switched to heroin. Before long, the loyal, goofy kid  his family once knew was gone. Drugs had dampened the beautiful music  of his life and turned it into a sorrowful echo.   Eamon Eric Callanan died of a drug overdose on June 8, 2016. Last  Wednesday marked the 2-year anniversary of his funeral.   In many respects, Eamon's story is not unique. He was one of 169  people in his county--42,000 people in our country--to die of an opioid  overdose that year. Eamon was just one body in a grim tide of overdose  deaths.   So why am I telling you this story? I am telling it to remind you  that each one of those victims had a name and a life and friends and  family whom they loved and left behind.   One of those people Eamon loved and who loves him deeply in return is  actually sitting in this Chamber right now. Her name is Erin. She is  Eamon's sister and my press secretary. Erin was 24 days from her  wedding when she learned that she would never see her brother again and  that he would not be there to celebrate with her on one of the happiest  days of her life.   Let that be a lesson to all of us. There is no event so joyful, no  place so safe that it is untouched by the drug crisis--even a wedding  chapel, even here in the Halls of power, even in my office.   Mr. Chair, if we hope to defeat the deadliest drug crisis in history,  we will need the biggest response in history. Rest assured that the  response is already underway, led by this administration and this  Congress. We are wrapping up voting on more than 50 bills to help  millions of Americans affected by the opioid crisis. We are about to  vote on a package that contains almost all of those bills, H.R. 6.   Among others, it contains a bill by Congressman  Mike Bishop that  will reduce the flow of Chinese fentanyl into our country by giving law  enforcement new tools to detect suspicious packages in the mail. It  includes a reform to the so-called IMD exclusion, an outdated  regulation that restricts Medicaid funding for large inpatient  treatment programs, programs with the potential to heal substance abuse  patients like Eamon.   Those are just two of the important bills that are part of this  package. It is no exaggeration to say that they can save lives and save  families from the immeasurable grief of losing a loved one to an  overdose.   Yes, I am confident these bills will help stem the tide of drug  abuse, but I will end on a note of caution.   If defeating the opioid crisis is left to government alone, then we  will surely fail. Healing the wounds of drug abuse will take more than  just this body can provide; it will take the commitment by every  citizen to fulfill our duties to one another.   We have all been touched by this tragedy, so we all have a part to  play in its resolution. That means supporting people near us who are  struggling with drug addiction. It means rebuilding families and towns  torn apart by isolation, addiction, distrust, and death. It means  supporting the many charities, ministries, and nonprofits that are  already healing the sick in our communities.   In Bakersfield, that means groups like The Mission, the Christian  charity where I volunteer. The Mission operates a faith-based addiction  recovery program that is changing lives, even knitting together  families that have come apart at the seams.   Because of The Mission, a husband and wife with five children  overcame their past of drug addiction and drug dealing, and they did it  together. Then they convinced their niece to get clean, too.   We need more stories like that. In the days ahead, this House has a  chance to do its part to ensure that more stories of abuse and despair  have their own happy ending. We will do this work for the healers and  protectors, for the suffering, and for all those like Eamon who are now  at rest.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour  and at 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until  6:30 p.m.   On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning  hour and noon for legislative business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.  Last votes are expected no later than 3 p.m.   On Friday, no votes are expected in the House.   Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next  week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business  today.   In addition, the House will continue our work on appropriations by  taking up the 2019 Defense Appropriations bill sponsored by  Representative Kay Granger.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans are committed to national security and  rebuilding our military. This bill fully funds a well-deserved 2.6  percent pay raise for our brave men and women in uniform, their largest  pay raise in 9 years. It prepares for the future by investing more than  $90 billion into the research and development of new defense systems  and technology. Above all, it ensures American Armed Forces have the  equipment and training necessary to successfully carry out their  missions around the world.   This bill passed 48 to 4 out of subcommittee, so I hope my friends  across the aisle will consider voting for this important bill when it  reaches the floor.   Speaking of national security, the House will also make a motion to  go to conference on the National Defense Authorization Act, which the  House passed last month.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, additional legislative items are possible in  the House, including two bills from the Committee on Natural Resources.   First, H.R. 200, the Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing  Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act, sponsored by Representative   Don Young: This bill would reauthorize Magnuson-Stevens and replace  one-size-fits-all regulations with a tailored approach that will ensure  vibrant American fisheries.   Next, H.R. 2083, the Endangered Salmon and Fisheries Predation  Prevention Act, sponsored by Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler: This  bill will allow State and Tribal authorities to respond more quickly to  predators of the native salmon population.   Mr. Speaker, the House is also expected to consider legislation  related to border security and immigration.   As soon as our schedule is finalized, I will be sure to inform all  Members.   With that, I thank my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  appreciate him watching me on TV.   Mr. Speaker, if I could just restate, so maybe I could speak more  clearly.   The House is also expected to consider legislation relating to border  security immigration. So the answer is yes.   As I said before, we are bringing that bill to the floor. We have  been working very closely with the entire Conference, taking all ideas  in. We had a very productive conference last night. We will work  through the weekend, and you will see that bill on the floor next week.  And I look forward to Mr. Hoyer's support as well.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, it is quite interesting to me to listen to my friend. He  is complaining that somehow he is not involved. Mr. Speaker, he is  complaining about the number of hours that he sat in my office, not  just himself--Senator Durbin, the chief of staff to the President, the  Secretary of Homeland Security as well, and Senator Cornyn--and we  worked time and again. But every time, we tried to find compromise. We  even went to the point of their number one issue, and the President  went beyond what they even asked.   But they said: No, we can't do anything else. They said all they  wanted to do was go do a discharge petition. That is all they wanted.  They didn't want to work through the system.   But that was not unusual, because my friend, Mr. Speaker, likes to  quote people--I don't have it written. I just have it by memory, the  number of times my friend told me he would never vote to shut down the  government. He doesn't care about politics; he would never do that. But  we found it was a different year and a different time.   Then we talked about children's health, CHIP. A number of times, Mr.  Speaker, we would go to the other side, we would go to the ranking  member, and we would go to those individuals on the committee, but they  were told not to work with us. So we would run a bill, Mr. Speaker,  with everything that they had ever said they would want in it, and yet  they would get to the day and they would vote against it.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I just asked the gentleman if he would allow me the  opportunity to answer questions.    I know he likes to make long speeches before he gets to  a question, and I know he likes to go back in decades for the decades  that he has served, but I was only referring to this Congress. I was  moving to the answer, but I was building and explaining why the answer  is what it is.   He doesn't think the actions prior don't take place until now. We  have sat in those rooms and we talked about border security. The  interesting part, though, Mr. Speaker: The other side of the aisle that  said they were for border security, they were going to perpetuate the  problem we currently have because they did not want to end this catch  and release. They are going to put families in harm's way.   They question whether you could actually have a border of a wall.  That is really the philosophical debate that we are talking about.   Now, we will work through this bill. There are some other parts of  the bill that we are working on this weekend. Any changes that come to  a conclusion, of course, we will let you know.   But much of what this bill is is the same thing that we talked down  at the White House about and we talked for those numbers of hours  inside my office about.   But, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman on the other side said that he was  never going to shut down the government, but he voted to do it this  time. They said that they were concerned about CHIP, but they would  vote against it when we bring it to the floor.   Do you know what we had to do? We had to carry it on our own.   And do you know what happened for the American children? The longest  it has ever been renewed: 10 years.   So, yes, we want to work with them. But if the idea is to stop  anything from happening for the American public, do not expect me to  stop. It is too important. If we have to push through on our own, we  will.   And my friend made a statement that this body is one-sided. Don't  take my word for it. Let's go to Quorum, a company that only focuses on  data, that only focuses on measurements. Do you know what they said  about this Congress? Seventy percent of the bills signed into law this  Congress have one Republican and one Democratic cosponsor, the highest  rate in the past 20 years for bipartisanship.   The bills that we bring to the floor, despite the leadership's push,  every week, Mr. Speaker, we can see the actions. What was the action  that they held everybody until the last minute for those 23 people who  wanted to vote for the appropriations bill? They had to wait until the  Republicans carried it, then they released them to vote for it.   Or we talk about the farm bill.   Every day, Mr. Speaker, I come back here, I see the ranking member on  the other side put a letter out to her Members to not vote for whatever  comes.   And, yes, we on this side of the aisle want to solve DACA. But I  know. I read your tweets just as well: Dreamers can still apply to  renew DACA protections.   But, do you know what? In our bill, we deal with the DACA situation.   Do you know what else we also deal with? We deal with the border, and  we deal with security, because we do not want to be back here in  another 2 or 5 years with the same problem we have today.                                time  1230    Even if you won't work with us from the children's health insurance,  from funding of government, from appropriations for our veterans, you  want to hold those votes back, I don't think the public wants to hold  those back.   And you know what? If we have to push forward, we will. And I will  not apologize for it. This country is too important, the problems are  too big.   And I can listen, Mr. Speaker, to every argument we make, but I will  just think the American public can look at the data.   Do you know what today is, Mr. Speaker? The 6-month anniversary of  the tax bill passing. You know what else it is? One million new jobs.  You know what else it is? Unemployment below 4 percent. And in the last  49 years of this country, unemployment below 4 percent has only been 7  months in 49 years, but two of those 7 months were April and May of  this year. Unemployment claims, 44-year low. And for the first time in  the history of this Nation, there are more jobs being offered than  there are people looking for them.   So all that rhetoric, all those arguments you made building up to  that tax bill, the Armageddon, the crumbs, how terrible this is going  to be, 6 months later, history proves different.   And you know what, Mr. Speaker? If we had waited and waited for the  Democrats, there would not be a million new jobs, there would not be  unemployment where it is, because, Mr. Speaker, there wasn't one  Democrat to vote for it, even though a number of them privately told me  on this floor they wanted to, but their leadership told them no.   So if we have to solve the economy and we have to solve immigration  on our own, we will.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. My friend  made a lot of points. Sometimes facts get caught up in them.   So, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman talked about the floor and the  willingness of this side to allow Democratic amendments, or  bipartisanship.   As of June 7, Republicans in the 115th Congress--and we are not done  with this Congress yet--have provided for the consideration of over  1,200 amendments on the House floor. Now, that includes 570 Democrat  amendments.    And I don't want to compare apples to oranges, so let's do apples to  apples.   So in the entire 111th Congress--that was their entire Congress when  my friend was majority leader--Speaker Pelosi allowed less than 1,000  amendments to be considered on the floor.   Now, despite the unified Democratic opposition, Republicans are still  getting the work done, and we will continue to do that.   Now, my friend made a few statements, said there are things I did not  say. Maybe there were some things I did not say about the economy, but  they are different than what he would, because there is some really  good news, and it is not far from here.   Mr. Speaker, you could go to my friend's district. Each of the  counties that make up Maryland's Fifth Congressional District has seen  a drop in unemployment since 2016. St. Mary's County is down over a  full percent to 3.7, Calvert County down to 3.5, Charles County down to  3.8, Prince George's down to 4.1, and Anne Arundel County down to 3.2  percent.   Now, the other point I did not make--and I thank the gentleman for  bringing it up to me that I missed points--do you realize in America  today, if you are African American, this is the lowest unemployment has  ever been; if you are Hispanic, the lowest it has ever been.   Yes, there are things we had to do on our own, but the numbers prove  it is worth it.   And what is even more telling about this and something that makes me  prouder, it doesn't just help Republican districts, it helps  everybody's districts. It helps all Americans. And that is what we are  here for.   My friend brought up that there are issues. Yes, there are. That is  why we want to pass the immigration bill. We think there should be a  border and the border should be protected. We think children should be  with their parents, and that is what we are working on.   So I look forward to next week, to us passing an immigration bill  that solves a lot of these problems.   And, Mr. Speaker, I hope my friend from the other side of the aisle  would look at the bill and understand not everybody gets what they  want, because in that bill there won't be everything that I want, not  one person in this room will get everything they want. But will America  be safer? Will America be better in the future? Will we have a system  that works? Those answers will be yes, and that is how I will cast my  vote.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday, June 25, 2018, when  it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for  legislative business.
