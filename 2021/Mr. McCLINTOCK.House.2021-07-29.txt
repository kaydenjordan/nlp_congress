 Madam Speaker, I will speak on a related matter, and  that is how our Forest Service approaches fire in our densely  overcrowded and drought-stricken forest.   Madam Speaker, on July Fourth, lightning struck a tree in the  Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest in Alpine County, California, starting  a small fire that smoldered just over a quarter of an acre of rugged  terrain.   Now, instead of immediately attacking this fire, the U.S. Forest  Service decided to monitor it instead--that is to say, to do precisely  nothing.   On July 16, 12 days later, that small fire of a quarter of an acre,  now called the Tamarack fire, exploded out of control. It has now  consumed 70,000 acres as of this writing. One of the towns in its path  is Woodfords, California.   In 1987, the Woodfords Fire Department responded to a report of fire  on Forest Service land near their town in the same forest. They, too,  were turned away. In fact, Federal officials threatened Woodfords'  residents with arrest for even trying to extinguish the small blaze.   Hours later, that fire exploded to 6,500 acres, costing 25 families  their homes. Apparently, the Forest Service has learned absolutely  nothing in 34 years.   This let-burn policy of Federal land managers began back in 1972  during the height of the radical environmental movement. It stems from  the premise that fire is nature's way of cleaning up forests and that  active suppression of fire leads to a buildup of excess fuels.   That is right, as far as it goes because an untended forest is just  like an untended garden. It will grow and grow until it chokes itself  to death and will ultimately be consumed by catastrophic fire. That is  how nature gardens.   The U.S. Forest Service was formed to remove excess growth before it  can burn and to preserve our forests in a healthy condition from  generation to generation.   In California, active land management reduced acreage that was  annually lost to wildfire for more than 4 million acres a year in pre- Columbian times to just a quarter-million acres during the 20th  century.   Federal foresters marked off excess timber and auctioned it to timber  companies, which paid the Federal Government for harvesting rights.   Environmental laws adopted in the 1970s now require years of  environmental studies at a cost of millions of dollars before forest  thinning can be undertaken. That essentially brought the era of active  land management to a halt.   The result? California's wildfire damage has returned to its  prehistoric level, more than 4 million acres lost to catastrophic  wildfire last year. You see, nature is a lousy gardener.   In 1988, when the Federal let-burn policy produced the disastrous  Yellowstone fires, President Reagan reversed it. ``I did not even  know'' the policy existed, he said. ``The minute that this happened out  there and Don Hodel went out, he made it plain that, no, we were  withdrawing from that policy.'' That is what President Reagan said.   Unfortunately, Reagan left, and the policy returned. The devastation  that it has caused since then is tragic, avoidable, and incalculable.   Especially given the hazardous conditions of today's forest, sensible  policy would give top priority to extinguishing the small fires before  they can explode out of control into mega-fires.   Scrambling to explain their obvious dereliction of duty, Deputy  Forest Supervisor Jon Stansfield complained  [[Page H4279]]  that they just didn't have the resources to put out the small fire when  a water drop by helicopter could have stopped it cold.   Yet, they had the resources to photograph it by helicopter, and they  had the resources to do countless airdrops after they had allowed it to  explode out of control.                                time  1900    Now, the Federal Government owns 96 percent of Alpine County, leaving  it with virtually no tax base and entirely dependent on tourism  attracted by the national forest. The fire has not only taken people's  homes and destroyed their businesses, but it has severely damaged the  forest resource that Alpine County's entire economy depends on for  tourism.   It is dangerous nonsense to monitor incipient fires in today's forest  tinderbox, even if they seem to pose no immediate danger. No person in  his right mind would monitor a rattlesnake curled up in his bedroom  because it isn't doing much of anything at the moment. He would kill it  before it does.   In our national forests, only the Forest Service can prevent small  blazes from becoming forest fires, and it is about time they did.
