 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 567,  I call up the bill (H.R. 4373) making appropriations for the Department  of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2022, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I am very proud, Mr. Speaker, to present the fiscal year 2022 State,  Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations bill for the  first time as chairwoman of this critically important subcommittee.  Indeed, it is an honor to be entrusted with the responsibility of  managing the SFOPS bill which has been a key component of United States  foreign policy since World War II.   The resources provided in this bill are based on the fundamental  generosity of the American people, but they also protect and advance  our national security, economic prosperity, and global leadership. I  commend the Biden-Harris administration and our chair, Rosa DeLauro,  for recognizing the importance of the State and Foreign Operations  budget, and I urge my colleagues to follow suit by supporting this  bill.   With unprecedented levels of human suffering and so many complicated  challenges around the world, the bill rightfully increases funding for  global health and the prevention of future pandemics and for migration,  refugee, and disaster assistance, and continues our support for key  allies and partner organizations such as the United Nations. These are  just a few of many ways the SFOPS bill meets urgent humanitarian needs,  many of which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.   The COVID pandemic has caused significant economic and social harm.  That is why the development investments in this bill are especially  crucial as we strive to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by  2030, including eliminating extreme poverty, achieving an AIDS-free  generation, and supporting efforts to build inclusive, equitable, and  accountable societies for everyone.   Now, let me address directly some of the questions I have heard about  what the SFOPS bill does and does not include.   To my friends who focus, as I do, on women's global health, the  fiscal year 2022 SFOPS bill substantially increases funding for  bilateral family planning for the first time in a decade to $760  million, which is an $185 million increase over last year. It also more  than doubles our contribution to UNFPA to $70 million, which we know  was completely cut off and politically scapegoated during the previous  administration.   Just as important, the bill does not include previous years' policy  riders like the harmful Helms amendment and the global gag rule which  only served to undercut our programs' effectiveness and ability to  provide women, especially women of color, around the world with  comprehensive healthcare.   To our friends committed to fighting the climate crisis, this year's  SFOPS bill provides a $1.6 billion contribution to the Green Climate  Fund, which is the first direct appropriation that this House has  provided for the fund. Along with an additional $1.4 billion for our  other environmental programs, this bill invests $3 billion to combat  the climate crisis which will help ensure that the United States  resumes its leadership in this global fight and work in partnership  with other countries.   To my friends who have requested increased funding for our own  hemisphere, this year's bill includes a 25 percent increase for the  Caribbean, including $10 million in new funding for projects in the  Caribbean to promote inclusive economic growth.  [[Page H4141]]    The bill also includes $350 million more than last year for  assistance to Central America, which is urgently needed in the Northern  Triangle, to address the root causes of migration and to help combat  corruption and impunity which are so endemic among local government  officials. We all have met and are haunted by the experiences that  migrants have conveyed to us despite all the odds about their dangerous  journey across Mexico. We must do better so that the United States  border is not their last and best hope for survival. That is why the  House bill makes targeted investments in local communities through  trusted NGOs while holding national governments accountable.   The bill also provides critical support for vulnerable communities in  Africa and upholds our abiding commitments to the security of our  allies, such as Israel, Jordan, Ukraine, and Colombia. Many of our  partners continue to struggle with growing economic challenges at home  resulting from conflicts in their region, migration, and the impact of  COVID-19.   The SFOPS bill and report make clear our support for a two-state  solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and we have increased  assistance to the Palestinian people by $150 million over last year's  bill and eased the burdensome requirements on the administration's  ability to contribute to UNRWA.   Crucially, and of great importance to me, the bill also helps ensure  that our Nation's diplomatic and development workforce reflects the  diversity of the American people by increasing funding and providing  authority and guidance to equip the Secretary of State and USAID  administrator to make meaningful progress in increasing diversity and  inclusion in the Nation's international affairs workforce.   Lastly, to my friends who passionately advocate for human rights,  democracy, and the rule of law, I share your goals and your values. The  SFOPS bill may not solve all of the world's problems, but it certainly  makes new and significant gains on many different fronts. We include  new oversight and accountability requirements on our security  assistance which will better align such aid with our national security  policy before it is provided, and we provide support to civil society  leaders around the world who are making their communities and societies  more equitable and inclusive.   We also include $18 million for the Tibetan people. I especially want  to thank our Speaker and good friend, Chairman McGovern, for their work  on this issue.   I have many more examples, but my time is limited. I will conclude by  urging my colleagues to consider the very positive and considerable  progress we have made in this year's SFOPS bill in reversing the  devastating consequences from the last administration's foreign policy  failures. Restoring American credibility and leadership on the world  stage is no easy task, but this bill makes unequivocal commitments to  diplomacy and development in addition to improving the lives and  livelihoods of millions of people around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I ask your support of the SFOPS bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), our very distinguished  chair who serves for the first time this year as the chair of the  Appropriations Committee and has done a phenomenal job in helping us  get this bill to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I would just like to respond to  the gentleman from New Jersey and read a section of this bill.   It says: ``None of the funds made available in this Act nor any  unobligated balances from prior appropriations Acts may be made  available to any organization or program which, as determined by the  President of the United States, directly supports or participates in  the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary  sterilization: Provided, That any determination made pursuant to this  paragraph must be made not later than 6 months after the date of  enactment of this Act, and must be accompanied by the evidence and  criteria utilized to make the determination: Provided further, That  none of the funds made available under this Act may be used to lobby  for or against abortion.''   Finally, I will just say that Hart Research recently conducted a poll  of Americans across the political spectrum and found that over 60  percent of the American public supports reproductive freedom for women.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Mrs. Torres), who serves as a very valued member of the State, Foreign  Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee and has had tremendous  input into this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   First of all, let me just say, in responding to Mr. Smith, it is  really long overdue to stop partisan attempts to scapegoat and score  political points over UNFPA.   The fact remains that UNFPA vigorously opposes any and all coercive  practices and only supports access to safe and voluntary family  planning. Any suggestion to the contrary is simply false.   Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of the resources and programs in this  bill which provide us the unique opportunity to restore America's  global leadership that has been missing in recent years.   Together we can address the greatest challenges facing the United  States and provide vital support to the world's most vulnerable people.   I want to take a minute to just thank our staffs on both sides of the  aisle. As a former staffer, I know how these bills get put together,  the length of time that they put in, and the real forthright and  straight-up honest negotiations, given our differences. I think the  bill is a very good bipartisan bill, and I think it is, in many  respects, due to our staffs' relationships and their respect for each  other.   I specifically want to mention Craig Higgins and Erin Kolodjeski,  Jason Wheelock, Jean Kwon, Marin Stein, Clelia Alvarado, Lacy Kilraine,  Greg Adams, of course, in my office and Julie Nickson, Susan Adams,  Jamie McCormick, John Muscolini, and all of the members of our staffs  that haven't been mentioned, because I know a heck of a lot goes into  this in terms of our support staff day and night and for their  diligence and their brilliance and their respect for the process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3473. I yield back  the balance of my time.   Mr. McHenry. Mr. Speaker, this year's State/Foreign Operations  appropriations bill includes hundreds of billions of dollars in IMF  giveaways to China, Russia, and state sponsors of terrorism. It's an  abomination that the spending bill which funds our foreign policy  priorities writes massive checks for America's adversaries.   Under this legislation, the Treasury Department would be required to  support an allocation of more than one-and-a half trillion Special  Drawing Rights (SDR)--trillion with a T. These SDRs represent no- strings-attached liquidity that will be lavished on some of the worst  regimes in the world.   The Democrats' bill would send over $140 billion in hard currency to  the Chinese government to use as it wishes. Russia would get its hands  on nearly $60 billion. State sponsors of terrorism like Iran and Syria  would find themselves with more than $17 billion in support that they  can use to kill civilians and destabilize the world, while Venezuela  and Belarus would receive billions more.   Like last year, House Democrats have included these dollars for  dictators in the base text of this bill so that it can't be struck.  They're so ashamed of financing America's adversaries that they don't  want to require their Members' votes on this issue to be public.  Perhaps they suspect that their Members don't want billions in hard  currency going to the Chinese Communist Party, Vladimir Putin, and the  ayatollahs.   There are responsible ways to help the world address the COVID-19  pandemic without showering billions on genocidal regimes and other  human rights abusers--this is not it.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 567,  I rise as the designee of the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.  DeLauro) to offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of amendments  en bloc No. 1 and yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me just thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for these  amendments. Now I would like to yield to the gentleman from Kentucky  (Mr. Rogers), our ranking member. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Manning).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Spanberger).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier).     Madam Speaker, I reiterate my support for the  amendment, and urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  567, I rise as the designee of the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.  DeLauro) to offer amendments en bloc.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to  amendments en bloc No. 2, and I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This amendment includes changes to the bill that I believe would be  counterproductive, and I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Jacobs).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  567, I rise as the designee of the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.  DeLauro) to offer amendments en bloc.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of amendments en bloc No. 3. Let me  first thank my colleagues for raising these important issues.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Jacobs).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Phillips).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Omar).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, first of all, let me just say I am very proud of the  resources and programs in this bill,  [[Page H4151]]  which provide us the unique opportunity to restore America's global  leadership that has been missing in recent years.   Together, we can address the greatest challenges facing the United  States and provide vital support to the world's most vulnerable people.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these amendments en  bloc and the underlying bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
