 Mr. President, today I would like to recognize  retired Fire Chief Robert ``Bob'' Jenkins for 55 years of exemplary  service to his community and to Vermont. We are fortunate to have such  a dedicated public servant as Chief Jenkins in our State,  [[Page S6920]]  and I sincerely thank him and his family for everything they have done  for the people of Vermont.   Bob Jenkins joined the Vergennes Fire Department in 1962, following  in the footsteps of his father, George Jenkins. After serving for 5  years in Vergennes, Bob helped establish the New Haven Volunteer Fire  Department in 1967, which became part of the Addison County  Firefighters Association Mutual Aid system the following year. For five  decades, Bob continued to work with the New Haven Fire Department with  training and guidance, whenever needed. On May 6, 2017, at the  department's 50th anniversary, Bob was presented with an honorary  membership. This follows the honorary membership he received from the  Vergennes Fire Department in 1982.   Bob joined the Ferrisburgh Volunteer Fire Department in 1968, where  he was soon promoted to the rank of captain. In 1970, recognizing his  dedication and leadership, the department elected him chief, a position  he held for 19 years. Bob remained very active after stepping down as  chief, spending countless hours working with successive chiefs, passing  on knowledge and expertise to help maintain a professional and highly  trained department with well-maintained equipment. His service was  deservedly recognized this past summer, when the Ferrisburgh Fire  Department took delivery of a brand-new frontline engine and dedicated  it in honor of Chief Jenkins.   Bob has been a mentor to many other chiefs and firefighters  throughout Addison County, as well as the State of Vermont. He served  on numerous committees of the Addison County Firefighters Association,  including Sergeant at Arms at the annual business meeting and awards  banquet. He was presented with life membership to the association in  1993. He also served for many years as an instructor for the annual  Addison County Regional Fire School, which draws firefighters from  around Vermont, New York, and Canada. In 1994, the 24th Annual Regional  Fire School was dedicated to Bob for his commitment to the training  program.   Bob also served as an instructor for the Vermont State Firefighters'  Association and is a charter member of the Vermont Fire Academy  training center in Pittsford. He is passionate about teaching young  firefighters all aspects of the fire service, from today's firefighting  skills to department history. His expertise in building construction  has been particularly important during training and has helped keep  many Vermont firefighters safe during fire calls. He also teaches  respect for what firefighters do, for fellow members, for leadership,  and for our communities. In return, he has gained the respect of his  fellow firefighters for his willingness to share his time and  knowledge.   Bob's community service does not stop with firefighting. He has  served the town of Ferrisburgh in many different ways, including  overseeing construction of a new firestation in 1993, overseeing the  construction of a new town highway facility in 2015 to 2016, and  serving on the town select board, as well as projects for the North  Ferrisburgh Methodist Church.   The bottom line is that Bob Jenkins has unselfishly protected and  served his community for 55 years. He is a model for what leadership is  about. We must keep in mind that Bob did not do this alone. He had the  commitment and understanding of his wife of 52 years, Mary Jane; his  daughter, Robin; his son, Chris; and his stepsons, Tim, Mark, and  Ricky--even when Bob spent time away from home, missing family dinners,  family outings, birthdays, holidays, and school events.   I will finish with some words from New Haven Assistant Chief Dean  Gilmore: ``If you add Bob's love for his family, his love for his  community, and his love for his fellow firefighters; his family's love  for him, and his fellow firefighters; his fellow firefighters' love for  him and his family; his community's love for him, his family, and his  fellow firefighters; we have one powerful feeling in our hearts that is  everlasting.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, to commemorate Public Service  Recognition Week, the Vermont Federal Executive Association recognized  Federal employees with Excellence in Government awards.

It is an op-ed that I wrote.  It is called ``The health care crisis no one is talking about.''   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this op-ed be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From the Boston Globe, Oct. 31, 2017]         The Health Care Crisis No One Is Talking About                            (By Bernie Sanders)         The United States faces a major crisis in primary health       care, and unless Congress acts immediately it is likely to       become much worse.        Millions of Americans are at risk of losing their access to       health care because Congress did not renew funding for the       community health center program at the end of the fiscal       year, Sept. 30. Unless we renew funding immediately, 70       percent of funding will be cut, the doors of 2,800 community       health centers will close, and 9 million patients will lose       access to quality health care. That is unacceptable.        Our nation's community health centers provide affordable,       high-quality health care to more than 27 million people. This       includes not only primary health care, but also dentistry,       counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs. For the 13       million rural patients served, community health centers often       are the only health care provider for hundreds of  [[Page S6933]]       miles. And they provide good jobs in communities that need       them the most.        Community health centers not only save lives, they also       save money. Instead of people ending up in expensive       emergency room care, or in the hospital, they get the primary       care they need, when they need it, at high quality medical       centers. Compared to other providers, community health       centers save on average $2,371 per Medicaid patient and up to       $1,210 per Medicare patient. What's more, community health       centers have played a pivotal role in generating more than       $49 billion in savings to the entire health care system.        Not only do we have to renew funding for the community       health center program, we must also improve and expand the       National Health Service Corps--the program that provides debt       forgiveness for young doctors, nurses, dentists, mental       health providers, and pharmacists who are prepared to work in       our nation's most underserved areas. Without debt       forgiveness, it is very hard to get new doctors to choose       primary care--an area of medicine that does not pay the big       bucks. It is also difficult to attract medical professionals       into the underserved areas of our country where they are       needed the most.        It is widely acknowledged that we currently have the most       wasteful, inefficient, and expensive health care system in       the world. Despite spending almost $10,000 per capita on       health care, twice as much as any other country, 28 million       Americans have no insurance, even more are underinsured, with       high copayments and deductibles, and we pay the highest       prices in the world for prescription drugs. The rarely       discussed truth is that thousands of Americans die each year       because they cannot afford to get to a doctor when they       should.        We must not allow a bad situation to get worse.        We cannot tell millions of low-income and working people in       every state in this country that they will no longer be able       to access the health care, dental care, mental health       counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs they desperately       need.        We cannot tell pregnant women that they will not be able to       get the necessary prenatal care they require in order to have       healthy babies.        We cannot tell the young person addicted to opioids or       heroin that there is no treatment available.        We cannot tell chronically ill senior citizens that they       will have to survive without the prescription drugs they have       used for years.        We cannot force community health centers, which provide       some of the most cost-effective health care in the country,       to lay off the doctors, nurses, dentists, and administrators       who keep these centers going.        Historically, the community health center program has       enjoyed widespread bipartisan support, and that support       continues. Today, along with almost all Democrats, there are       a number of Republicans who fully understand how important       these centers are to the well-being of their states and want       to see the program refunded.        The time for delay is over. Congress must act immediately       to fully fund the community health center program and the       associated workforce programs that provide them with the       well-trained staffing they need.     Mr. President, the United States today faces a major  healthcare crisis. I think we all understand that. In the midst of that  healthcare crisis, we face an even greater crisis in primary  healthcare, and that means that there are many, many millions of  people, not just people who don't have any insurance, not just people  who are underinsured, but people even with decent insurance, who cannot  get to a doctor's office when they need to because there is not a  sufficient number of primary care physicians in their area. This is a  major crisis today, but unless Congress acts immediately, that crisis  is going to become much, much worse.   Millions of Americans are at risk of losing their access to  healthcare because Congress has still not renewed funding for the  Community Health Center Program, which expired on September 30. So we  hear a whole lot of discussion about a whole lot of serious healthcare  problems. This is one that we do not hear very much about, and that is  that Congress has still not renewed funding for the Community Health  Center Program, which expired on September 30. Unless we renew that  funding immediately, some 70 percent of funding will be lost. Seventy  percent of funding for community health centers will be lost. The doors  of 2,800 service sites will close and 9 million patients will lose  access to the healthcare they currently have. Nine million people will  find that when they go to a community health center, that center will  no longer be able to treat them. Clearly, this is unacceptable.   Our Nation's community health centers provide affordable, high- quality healthcare to more than 27 million Americans in every State in  this country. This includes, by the way, in terms of community health  centers, not only primary healthcare but also dental care, which is a  major crisis in this country. It is very hard in many parts of America  to find affordable dental care. It also includes mental health  counseling, which is another major issue, especially within the context  of the opioid and heroin epidemic we face. In addition to all of that,  community health centers provide low-cost prescription drugs at a time  when many Americans cannot afford the medicine they need.   They play a vital role in community after community, State after  State, in providing healthcare to some 27 million Americans. For the 13  million rural patients served, community health centers often are the  only healthcare provider for hundreds of miles in rural America. There  are deserts in which Americans cannot access a doctor, and community  health centers are the oasis in that desert. In addition to all of  that, community health centers often provide a lot of good jobs in  underserved communities that need them the most.   Community health centers not only save lives, but they also save  money. Every dollar we invest in strong primary healthcare saves us  dollars in the long run. Instead of people ending up in expensive  emergency room care--and emergency room care is the most expensive  primary care in the country--or ending up in the hospital because they  can't and do not go to the doctor when they should, community health  centers provide the primary care people need at a fraction of the cost  of an emergency room.   Medicaid, in many cases, will spend one-tenth as much per patient for  a community health center visit compared to an emergency room visit. So  it is an opportunity not only to provide good quality care but to save  substantial sums of money. Compared to other providers, community  health centers save, on average, $2,371 per Medicaid patient and up to  $1,210 for Medicare patients.   What is more, community health centers have played a pivotal role in  generating more than $49 billion in savings to the entire healthcare  system. They provide quality primary healthcare. They save money by  keeping people out of emergency rooms or keeping them out of the  hospitals. Not only do we have to renew funding of the Community Health  Center Program, we must also improve and expand the National Health  Service Corps, which is a program that provides debt forgiveness for  young doctors, nurses, dentists, mental health providers, and  pharmacists who are prepared to work in our Nation's most underserved  areas. Without debt forgiveness, without telling young graduates of  medical school who often leave school $200,000, $300,000, and $400,000  in debt--without giving them the opportunity to get those very large  debts forgiven, it will be very hard to attract physicians and nurses  and psychologists to rural areas or urban areas, where we have a  significant ``underserving'' in terms of medical care.   So we need to fund not only community health centers but the National  Health Service Corps. We currently have 1,100 National Health Service  Corps members who are in school or in residency programs who will not  be able to complete their training and become primary care  professionals. We need to provide the workforce for community health  centers and other underserved areas in this country.   Here is the very good news: The truth is, for many years, our  community health centers, which are playing a vital role all over this  country--urban areas and rural areas--have received bipartisan support.  I know a lot of the bipartisan efforts of the past have kind of  disappeared in the current political climate, but I am very happy to  say there is a very strong piece of legislation introduced by Senator  Roy Blunt, a Republican from Missouri, which has a number of Republican  cosponsors on it.   My own view is, I think every Member of the Democratic caucus would  sponsor it, but I think there is a whole lot of Republican support for  this community health center bill. So not only is Mr. Blunt the sponsor  of the bill, we have Senator Capito, Senator Gardner, Senator Collins,  Senator Wicker, Senator Fischer, Senator Boozman,  [[Page S6934]]  Senator Murkowski, and Senator Cochran--who are all Republicans-- onboard this legislation.   I believe, if that bill came to the floor today as a stand-alone  bill, it would pass overwhelmingly because people in rural America,  people in urban America--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents-- understand the very important role community health centers are  playing. What this bill is about, significantly, is funding for 5 years  not quite at the level I would like to see but at about 4 percent a  year which, in terms of medical inflation, really means level funding.  Now, that is in contrast to a bill that is being discussed in the  House, which is simply not satisfactory. The House bill is talking  about 2 years of funding, which means it is level-funded, which means  it is a significant decline in real dollars for community health  centers. Also, there are pay-fors for the bill which are totally  unsatisfactory. It is a question of taking money from Peter to pay Paul  and taking money from very important healthcare programs to put money  into this important program.   It is widely acknowledged that we currently have the most wasteful,  inefficient, and expensive healthcare system in the world, despite  spending almost $10,000 per capita on healthcare, which is twice as  much as any other country. I just returned from Canada the other day.  They spend about 50 percent per capita of what we spend of guaranteed  healthcare to all of their people, and many of their healthcare  outcomes are, in fact, better than they are in the United States. So we  spend a whole lot of money, and we are not getting particularly good  value.   One of the areas where we are getting good value is in the area of  community health centers. We need to not allow a bad situation to get  worse. We have a very serious crisis in this country with primary  healthcare, dental care, and certainly, mental health counseling. We  are in deep trouble. If we do not immediately fund the Community Health  Center Program, the National Health Service Corps, and the other  workforce programs, a very bad situation will become tragically worse.  We cannot tell millions of low-income and working people in every State  in this country that they will no longer be able to access the  healthcare, dental care, mental health counseling, and low-cost  prescription drugs they desperately need. We cannot tell pregnant women  they will not be able to get the necessary prenatal care they require  in order to deliver healthy babies. We cannot tell the tragic number of  people who are struggling today with opioid or heroin addiction that  there is simply no treatment available to them because community health  centers do a lot of that treatment. We cannot tell chronically ill  senior citizens they will have to survive without the prescription  drugs they have used for years. We cannot force community health  centers--which provide some of the most cost-effective healthcare in  this country--to lay off doctors, nurses, dentists, and administrators  who keep these centers going.   Historically, the Community Health Center Program has enjoyed  widespread bipartisan support, and I am glad to say that for this  program, that support continues. What I am asking today is for strong  support for the Blunt legislation. Let's get it onto the floor of the  Senate as quickly as we can. Let's pass it. Let's demand that the House  work with us to pass strong legislation. The time for delay is over.  Congress must act immediately to fully fund the Community Health Center  Program, the National Health Service Corps, and the Teaching Health  Centers Program today.   We know these programs work. We know they save money and lives. These  programs must be funded for 5 years, which is what the Blunt bill does.  We should not continue to ignore this very serious problem for another  day.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
