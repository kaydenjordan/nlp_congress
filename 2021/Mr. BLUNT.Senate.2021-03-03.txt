 Madam President, I rise today to recognize the National  Library Service for the Blind and Print Disabled on its 90th  anniversary. The National Library Service, or NLS, is an important part  of the Library of Congress, an institution that has long been committed  to serving readers with disabilities. The concept of a national library  for the blind was introduced in 1897 by the seventh Librarian of  Congress, John Russell Young, who established a reading room for the  blind that included more than 500 books and music items in raised  characters.   In 1913, Congress began to require that one copy of each book be made  in raised characters and deposited in the Library of Congress for  educational use; however, as impressive as this collection was, it was  only available to people who were able to visit in person.   In 1930, legislation was introduced in both the House and the Senate  to fund a Library of Congress program to provide service to blind  readers on a national scale. This led to passage of the Pratt-Smoot Act  which, on March 3, 1931, established what we now know as the National  Library Service for the Blind and Print Disabled. The act has been  amended several times, not only increasing funding for the program, but  also expanding service to children and people with physical and reading  disabilities and adding what is now the world's largest accessible  music materials collection.   Missouri has wonderful local libraries that play a key role in  connecting the NLS program to my constituents across the State. NLS and  the Wolfner Talking Book and Braille Library serve nearly 6,500  individuals and more than 600 intuitions in Missouri, providing daily  access to all the incredible resources NLS has to offer.   NLS is continuing its innovative and adaptive approach to serving  Americans with disabilities. NLS has a vibrant history that spans  phonograph records, cassette tapes, flash memory cartridges, and the  internet, all while continuing to supply hardcopy and digital braille  materials. With its modernization efforts underway, NLS no doubt has a  very exciting future ahead.   Today, it is my pleasure to congratulate NLS on its 90th anniversary.  I wish the wonderful staff at NLS continued success as they work to  ensure the NLS mission ``that all may read.''                            ____________________
