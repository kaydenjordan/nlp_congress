 Mr. Speaker, as someone who grew up in a communist  country where people were punished for expressing their opinions, I  have an enormous appreciation for our First Amendment rights. This is a  core principle our Nation was founded on.   I might not like many things that my colleagues from both parties  have to say. Sometimes I think they are crazy things, but I will still  vigorously defend their First Amendment rights and rights of free  speech, especially what they have said as private individuals before.  The voters will decide if they are the right representative for them.   It is a slippery slope to start policing people's opinions, and our  Congress will start resembling a communist politburo if we are not  careful. I would really like my colleagues to think before they make  this vote.
