 Mr. Speaker, we are going to talk about our health,  not about last week's legislation and the effort to change the  Affordable Care Act but rather about another part of the health of the  American public.   The most remarkable proposal came from the President recently in his  budget proposals.                                time  1815    I know that when I saw what he was proposing, I am thinking: You have  got to be kidding. He is proposing a $5.6 billion reduction in the  National Institutes of Health's research programs.  [[Page H2506]]    I want to just take a second here and draw your attention to what  research really means.   The National Institutes of Health is the principal research arm for  healthcare issues throughout the United States. Over the years, we have  spent very large amounts of taxpayer dollars dealing with health issues  in the United States. The result of those research efforts, together  with the implementation, has resulted in breast cancer deaths dropping,  between 2000 and 2013, by 2 percent, prostate cancer deaths down 11  percent, heart disease down 14 percent, stroke down 23 percent, HIV/ AIDS down 52 percent.   Research pays in better lives, in people living longer and the  quality of their life. And yet this 18 percent reduction that has been  proposed by the President in the basic funding for medical research  here in the United States goes directly against these very important  and very impressive changes in the statistics about mortality--HIV/ AIDS, 52 percent.   Now, it is not all research, but it begins with research. It is  unconscionable that such a proposal would be brought to the House of  Representatives.   We are going to go beyond these success stories, and we are going to  talk about this purple line here. The deaths from Alzheimer's have  actually increased by 71 percent in the same 13-year period, in part  due to the fact that the population, the baby boomers and those that  preceded them, grow old; and that is where Alzheimer's occurs, in the  older age groups.   So what is the research funding here on Alzheimer's? Well, not so  good.   But before I go to that, I just want to take one moment and draw your  attention to this little chart. This is the funding level for the  National Institutes of Health's projected budget: $31.7 billion. The  scientists, the researchers out there said that that is underfunding  not from their wish list, but from viable, credible research programs  that can't be paid for because they have run out of money. So they have  suggested that the budget should be somewhere around $35 billion.   So what does the President propose? Well, he proposes, instead of  going up, going down to $25 billion or just close to $26 billion, $5.6  billion less.   The result is that this is not going to come down. We are going to  talk about this for the next hour, about research, about the National  Institutes of Health, about what it means to your life, to my life, to  my colleagues' lives, to be able to extend our lives, whether it might  be prostate cancer, heart disease, stroke, HIV, or Alzheimer's. It is a  fact that, if we are to increase the research in this area, which,  until just last year, was just over $500 million, we can see this begin  to change.   Joining me today are my colleagues from around the United States. I  was looking for a more senior Member from California, Maxine Waters,  who is the co-chair of the Alzheimer's Caucus. She is not here, so I am  going to go to our next more senior Member, Mr. Cohen from the great  State of Tennessee.   I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee.    Thank you so very much, Mr. Cohen, for your personal  story and the effect of research not being available to you in your  early childhood and the result of that. We know that all across the  United States there are issues that are out there. Certainly  Alzheimer's, which is our principal subject matter today, together with  the cuts in the National Institutes of Health budget, but also there is  this thing called Zika. That is out there, and the research for that,  is that going to be forthcoming or is that also going to be cut?   I noticed that our co-chair of the Alzheimer's Caucus is here. Ms.  Waters, if you would like to join us, the gentlewoman from the State of  California with whom I have been able to work now for, well, just a few  years, dating back to our time in the California Legislature. I yield  to the gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the leadership of Ms.  Waters. It goes on for many years in this particular area and beyond.   Progress can be made. I am just going to take 2 seconds here to show  the funding levels for cancer, almost $5\1/2\ billion; HIV/AIDS, almost  $3 billion; cardiovascular, $2 billion. This is 1 year out of date.   Because of the work of Congress and the leadership of Chris Smith  from the Republican side and Ms. Waters from the Democratic side, plus  many Members, this number is not 560; it is just under a billion  dollars now. We need more, and we need to get at it soon.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the southern part of  California (Mr. Peters).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Peters for his comments. His  knowledge and expertise in this field is appreciated and, I am sure  when shared with the other Members of this House, will have a positive  result.   Mr. Peters said something toward the end of his conversation that I  think we need to drive home. I said earlier that the scientists  suggested that instead of a $31.7 billion budget for the NIH, they  needed an additional $3.3 billion. It is for those projects that Mr.  Peters described as peer-reviewed by peers in the area of science-- whether it is heart disease, cancer, or HIV or Alzheimer's--that are  worthy projects for which there is no money.    If we could fund those--not reduce the level of funding, as suggested  by the President, but, rather, increase it--what would be the result?   I am going to toss this up one more time. This is what happens when  research is applied to diseases. Breast cancer down, prostate cancer  down, heart disease deaths, strokes, and HIV, all down as a result of  research, and then the application of that research through the medical  community. This is progress. This is what can happen. This is what we  want to get to.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, let's move to the other side of the  continent. Let's talk about the view from New Jersey. I yield to the  gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).    Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from New Jersey pointed  out a very important thing here, and that is: When will we get real  about this?   It is my understanding that many of these budget cuts, the National  Institutes of Health and others, were made so that a wall on the  Mexican border could be funded.   Ponder that for a few moments. Is that really a priority? Do we cut  the funding for this basic research--whether it is for cancer,  diabetes, even people that are suffering from post-traumatic stress  disorder--so that we can fund a wall on the border?   That may be what this is all about, in which case it is a terrible,  terrible choice. I don't think we are going to make that.   I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) for her  views. I really appreciate her understanding of this and her  participation today.   I see next to you our colleague from the great State of Maryland (Mr.  Raskin) listening very intently to you and now prepared to jump into  the fray here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Raskin so very much. And,  indeed, the National Institutes of Health has a stellar representative,  as do the American people, and certainly the people of Maryland.   As he told his own personal story of one of the dreaded diseases, I  am delighted to see him stand here in such good health. Apparently, he  has recovered completely from that.   I suspect that recovery was, at least in part, due to, first, his  good health at the outset, but also to the research that was done in  the preceding years through the National Institutes of Health on cancer  research. We have seen the decline in cancer deaths as a result of that  research. What we would like to do is to deal with this Alzheimer's.   I want to take a moment just to talk about where we are. We had a  huge debate last week on repealing the Affordable Care Act and what it  would mean to Americans, and a lot of that debate centered around the  cost of medical services. Tragically, one of the ways that the  proponents of repealing the Affordable Care Act would save money is to  reduce the Medicaid program in different ways, but the end result was  to reduce the Medicaid program.   Sixty percent of the Medicaid program is for people in long-term care  facilities. A good percentage of those, probably the majority of those,  with some sort of dementia or Alzheimer's. What we need to do is to  address this issue straightforward.   I will tell my own story.   My mother-in-law lived the last 3 years of her life in our home. We  were in a position where we were able to take care of her, so she  didn't go to a long-term care facility. Nonetheless, it was one of the  obligations that we felt we had, and many, many other Americans share  that obligation.   This is 2015. The number $2.026 billion came up during the discussion  that we had. That is what we spent in 2016. Some of that was spent by  other payors. That would be insurance companies. Some was spent by  family. Medicare and Medicaid spent the great majority.   As we go through the years, in 2020, we expect to spend $267 billion.  And again, Medicare and Medicaid make up the great majority of it. As  we move through time, we will see that there will be greater and  greater expenses, rising year by year, so that in the year 2050, which  is not that far away--that is one generation away--we will be spending  over $1 trillion, and Medicare and Medicaid will, throughout this  entire period, be the single largest source of money to pay for  Alzheimer's.   So, if we want to reduce the cost of premiums, if we want to reduce  the cost of government, if we want to deal  [[Page H2510]]  with the quality of life of Americans, then we have to get to this  research because there is hope. Alzheimer's is not a hopeless disease.  It is not a disease for which there is no cure. It is a disease for  which we have not spent money on finding the cure.   If we can delay by a year, we will save tens of billions of dollars  of taxpayer money in care that has been pushed off into the future. And  the quality of life for the individual that has one more year of  quality of life ahead of them is enormous and invaluable.   Here is just a way of depicting the backward nature of how we are  dealing with the research for Alzheimer's. This was originally the  2015. We have been at this a couple of years, and we have seen  progress.   In 2016, we spent $941 million, just under $1 billion, on Alzheimer's  research. At the same time, we spent $153 billion in the care of  Alzheimer's in Medicare and Medicaid. It is Federal taxpayer money.   Look, $1 billion, less than $1 billion in research, $153 billion in  out-of-pocket expense caring for these individuals that have come down  with Alzheimer's. A pretty neat equation here, isn't it?   If we were to ramp that up, as we would like to see, from $941  million to $1.4 billion, the researchers all across this country--some  in San Diego, as we heard from Mr. Scott Peters; others in New Jersey,  as we heard from Mrs. Watson Coleman; or in other parts of California,  Boston, wherever. If we were to ramp that up by an additional $500  million, the researchers believe that they will untangle the tangles in  the brain that lead to Alzheimer's and understand what is going on and,  from that point, be able to find a path towards a solution.   It is not hopeless. We have seen progress. We have seen research that  was done a decade ago. The analysis indicated that it really didn't  work too well when they came up with a solution. Another researcher, 7  or 8 years later, went back to that very research, looked at the  statistical analysis, and noticed that, for those who had early onset,  that particular treatment modality had an enormous effect, not on those  that were in later Alzheimer's but those who were in early onset.   Whoa. What does that mean?   That means that there is a path. That means that there is an avenue  towards a solution. However, this Congress, the 435 of us who will be  here voting on the appropriations to fund the Federal Government, to  fund the military, to fund the highways, to fund the National  Institutes of Health, will be given a choice. We will have a choice. Do  we increase the funding for the National Institutes of Health and  Alzheimer's research, or do we fund a wall on the Mexican border to the  tune of $20 billion?   We just received that supplemental appropriation request from the  administration today to spend $20 billion on a wall.   I can talk to you about a wall. I represent 180,000 people just  downstream from the Oroville Dam, and I have got a 30-foot wall that  needs to be repaired. We are talking about imminent danger, and the  rainy season is not over in California.   Or, another $5.6 billion for the military for programs that nobody  has told us yet should be funded.                                time  1900    We are going to make choices here. The President has made his choice.  He has shown what is of value in his mind.   I challenge that value. I challenge that value statement. I will tell  you what is important. What is important are those millions of  Americans who face Alzheimer's in the days, the months, and the years  ahead. I am looking to the generations that are 40 and 50 years of age  today who know, like my wife and I, they will be caring for their  parents who are suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's. That is a  value that I think is important.   Mr. Cohen spoke to the real enemy. Is the real enemy somewhere out  there around the world, or is the real enemy the disease that will take  us down--in his case, childhood polio?   We are going to make choices here, very important choices to the  everyday lives of Americans. My choice is to increase, to increase the  budget, the appropriation for the National Institutes of Health so that  the $35 billion that the scientists--who have already done the peer  review on all types of diseases, ranging from Zika, to cancer, and HIV,  and Alzheimer's--say are worthy research projects that should be  funded.   I reject the value that the President has said to strip $5.6 billion  out of the National Institutes of Health and transfer it for a wall on  the Mexican border or for some spending in the military--some  unspecified spending. These are choices.   I know where, in my mind, the choice should be, and I reject the  choice that has been made by our President.   And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
