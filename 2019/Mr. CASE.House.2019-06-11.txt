 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 75th birthday of one  of the most iconic ships ever to sail the seven seas, the U.S. Navy's  USS Missouri.   Mighty Mo, our last battleship, was commissioned June 11, 1944, after  being laid down and launched at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. She went on to  one of the longest and most distinguished careers of any Navy ship  ever, earning 11 battle stars in three wars: World War II, the Korean  war, and Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm.   But she is best known for her role not in war but in peace. For of  course it was on her decks at anchor in Tokyo Bay on September 2, 1945,  V-J Day, that General Douglas MacArthur accepted the surrender of  Japan, ending World War II.   Mighty Mo was finally struck from the register in 1995. For the last  two decades, she has been moored in a place of honor at Pearl Harbor,  alongside her fallen sisters--most notably, the USS Arizona--as a  living museum under the loving stewardship of the USS Missouri Memorial  Association in partnership with the U.S. Navy.   On her decks next year, on September 2, we will recognize the 75th  anniversary of the end of the Second World War. But for today, let us  simply  [[Page H4399]]  wish Mighty Mo a heartfelt hau'oli la hanau, happy birthday, and many  more to come. Mahalo.                            ____________________
