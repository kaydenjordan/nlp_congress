 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize  the retirement of a true servant of the House, Joe Novotny.   A familiar voice that we all know so well, Joe served Congress for 29  years at both the committee and the institutional level, becoming a  recognizable and reliable part of the House legislative process as the  Reading Clerk.  [[Page H1572]]    Joe's career started as a House Page and led him to positions on the  Committee on Natural Resources and the Committee on Education and  Labor. In 2010, Joe joined the Clerk's organization as Reading Clerk,  where this Chamber has enjoyed his voice and diligence for over a  decade.   When asking the many teams who work with him how they would describe  Joe, the word that came up repeatedly was ``teammate.'' As a dedicated  public servant with nearly three decades of experience and knowledge,  Joe's attention to detail, mentorship, humor, and kindness made him an  asset and a friend to every team he has been a part of. From his  restaurant recommendations to stories about seeing his favorite bands  play live on weekends, Joe will not only be missed by his colleagues in  Legislative Operations, but by all of us who know him as part of this  Chamber.   I would like to wish Joe well in his retirement and celebrate his  commitment to serving this body so ably for so many years.  Congratulations, Joe.                            ____________________
