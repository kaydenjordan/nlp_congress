 Madam President, I rise today to bring the  Senate's attention to the life and legacy of an Alaskan trailblazer, a  woman of enormous heart and energy whose dedication to the young people  of Anchorage, AK, was deep and made a positive difference.   Etheldra ``Thel'' Sampson Davis was born in Arkansas in 1931, one of  eight children. After her family moved to California while she was a  child, she graduated from LA City College with an associate of arts  degree in 1951 and subsequently earned a bachelor's degree in education  from the University of California, Los Angeles. She practiced her  profession in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles for 8 years.   In 1957, Thel visited her adventurous older brothers in Anchorage,  AK, and fell in love with the State. After becoming certified to teach  in Alaska, she became the first African-American on-contract teacher in  the Anchorage School District in 1959. As a teacher, she contributed to  the future of the Anchorage community at five Anchorage elementary  schools: Willow Crest, Airport Heights, Government Hill, Mountain View,  and Denali. And in 1965, she earned her master's in education degree  from the University of Alaska Fairbanks.   In 1967, she became the assistant principal at Willow Crest  Elementary School. And in 1969--the same year in which she married  Joseph Davis--she applied for and was hired to fill the position of  principal at Fairview Elementary School. This was yet another  trailblazing moment for Thel, as she was the first African-American  principal in Anchorage. She later became principal at the new Ptarmigan  Elementary and later the John F. Kennedy Elementary School on Fort  Richardson near Anchorage. Always seeking additional knowledge and  skill, Thel achieved yet another goal by earning her doctorate in  education from California's Newport University in 1975.   Thel taught and provided leadership for Anchorage area students and  her fellow educators for 21 years until her retirement in 1980. A  former superintendent of the Anchorage School District has said of  Thel's service, ``Etheldra had a true passion and belief that ALL  students can succeed if given a rigorous academic program coupled with  love and concern.'' The Anchorage School Board, in reviewing the  proposal to rename Fairview Elementary School in her honor, noted that  her ``passion and commitment to the students entrusted to her care is  legendary.'' No better tribute can ever be said of an educator.   But throughout her career, Thel was not only a busy teacher and  principal. In addition to her school-based contributions to the  Anchorage community, Thel was an active member in a variety of  community and national organizations, including the Alpha Kappa Alpha  Sorority and National Education Association. She also helped to  establish several youth mentoring organizations, including the NAACP  Youth Council and the United League of Girls. As a member of the Black  Educators Taskforce, she helped to recruit and mentor African-American  teachers and administrators for Anchorage's schools.   After her retirement, Thel continued to contribute through her role  as a crime prevention specialist. Her work in that area resulted in the  creation of the Neighborhood Watch program in Anchorage and the Alaska  Coalition to Prevent Shoplifting.   Thel continues to lift students up. Her lifelong dream came true with  the creation of the Dr. Etheldra S. Davis Scholarship in 2019, which is  dedicated to helping young people continue their education through  whatever path is best for them, be it through the trades and  apprenticeship or college.   Thel ``gained her heavenly wings'' at the age of 85 on November 25,  2020, due to complications from COVID-19.   In recognition of the many contributions Dr. Davis made to  Anchorage's youth and the community at large over her many years of  service, the Anchorage School Board recently voted to rename the first  school in which she  [[Page S2542]]  served as principal in her honor. Henceforth, this school will be known  as Dr. Etheldra Davis Fairview Elementary School. It has been said that  seeing Thel's name above the school doorway will ``serve as a beacon  for generations of children to come in our neighborhood to show them,  in a very diverse neighborhood, what they can accomplish if they apply  themselves and they work hard.''   I think we all understand how important it is for children to see  adults who look like them and who share cultural history and  perspectives as leaders in their lives. I can only imagine how powerful  it must have been for Anchorage's African-American students to see an  African-American teacher and principal serving them and their school,  especially during the culturally fraught era of the 1950s and 1960s. I  know that the children who attend Dr. Etheldra Davis Fairview  Elementary School will continue to be inspired by her example for many  years to come.   I am proud to have known Thel and am proud today to come to the floor  of the U.S. Senate to honor her and her many contributions to the  community of Anchorage, AK, and, indeed, the entire State and  Nation.                            ____________________
