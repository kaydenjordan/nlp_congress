 Madam President, I rise today to honor the 75th  anniversary of the Memorial Baptist Church of Arlington, VA, for  faithful ministry and service to Arlington and the greater Washington,  DC area. For decades, they have lived up to their covenant to engage in  Christian care for each other, through bible study and dedicated work  for the advancement of Christianity.   Memorial Baptist Church's first public service was held on Easter  Sunday, April 6, 1947, at the old Glebe Theater near what is now  Langston Boulevard. Memorial Baptist was officially organized on April  28, 1947, less than a month after its first service, with Reverend  James Farmer becoming the church's first pastor. One year later, on  April 28, 1948, they celebrated the groundbreaking of their chapel, a  building that is still the center of the church today. Since  construction finished in 1949, locals from all over the area have come  to worship and be a part of their congregation.   Since Memorial Baptist's inception, they have been a catalyst of  community engagement, worship, and service. Along with being a center  for Christian prayer and values, they have brought people together in  weekly bible studies, adult classes, and family picnics. Memorial  Baptist Church also has a long history of faithful ministry and service  to the Arlington community and around the world, including mission  partnerships in Kentucky, Ukraine, and India.   Memorial Baptist Church has forged 75 years of history and tradition  for the local community. Memorial Baptist Church will continue to  minister and serve in the name of Christ with a variety of services,  programs, and activities in anticipation of a bright and productive  future.                            ____________________
