 Mr. President, I have the privilege of being the ranking  member of the Armed Services Committee, working with Senator McCain  with respect to the nomination of General Mattis.   I am strongly in favor of the general's confirmation for many  reasons. He possesses three distinct qualities that are absolutely  critical: confidence, courage, and character. And he will eminently  demonstrate those virtues as Secretary of Defense, in my view.   I would like to also inform the body and everyone else that we just  did this in a very thorough, careful, thoughtful way.   General Mattis was subject to a 60-vote procedural vote because we  had to waive his time from retirement to his ability to serve as  Secretary of Defense.   We had a hearing under the auspices of the chairman about the policy  with two noted historians and policy experts. Then we had a hearing  with General Mattis. We have collectively--and the chairman's  leadership is invaluable--moved to ensure that today we can confirm  General Mattis.   This has been an opportunity that we have not used to delay, defer,  or deflect the Mattis nomination. In fact, it was the one that we all  recognized that would have been subject to a 60-vote point of order. So  this represents the demonstrated good faith of our focus to ensure that  we can get people in place for the President.   With that, I yield to the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.
