 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, in the confirmation of any Supreme  Court nominee, it is the Senate's job to carefully and thoroughly  review the nominee's credentials, beliefs, background, and suitability  for the position. Once confirmed, a Supreme Court Justice is not  subject to review or to term limits. It is a lifetime appointment with  immense responsibilities and powers. We have to examine any Supreme  Court nominee in light of those facts.   Dr. Christina Blasey Ford has come forward with a credible allegation  that Judge Kavanaugh is guilty of sexual misconduct. I believe her, but  regardless of what you believe, she deserves to be heard in a  deliberate and impartial manner, in a way that is dignified  [[Page S6269]]  and respectful to both sides and to her, with as much independently  verified information gathered beforehand as possible. And now, of  course, there are additional allegations about Judge Kavanaugh's  actions that should be examined.   There is one simple way to get to the bottom of this without the he  said, she said, without the finger-pointing and name-calling: a quiet,  serious, thorough background check by the FBI. That is the logical way  to go. The FBI is not biased. The FBI is professional. It is a crime to  lie to them, so people have a large incentive to tell the truth.   Reopening an FBI investigation is a routine practice for judicial  nominations. It has happened over and over again when new information  has come up, and it only takes a short time to complete. It should be  quiet, serious, and get the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the  truth.   If my Republican friends are so concerned about this process being  chaotic, they should want the FBI to handle these allegations because  the FBI can conduct this investigation soberly, effectively, and  discreetly. In fact, there is really only one way to get to the bottom  of these allegations and prevent the Nation from being thrown into  further turmoil--an independent background check by the FBI. On the one  hand, our Republican colleagues decry the turmoil, but on the other  hand, they avoid the careful, best, serious way to get at the  allegations--a background check investigation by the FBI.   For some reason, both the White House and Senate Republicans are  blocking an FBI investigation and questioning its purpose. Let me ask  our Republican friends, President Trump, and America this question: If  President Trump and Senate Republicans are so certain the allegations  against Judge Kavanaugh aren't true, why aren't they welcoming the FBI  to look into it?   Leader McConnell, you spent 5 minutes pointing your finger at  Democrats. That shows someone who is in a pickle. That shows someone  who has dug a deep hole. If you really believe these allegations are  part of a despicable smear job, Leader McConnell, why don't you call  for an FBI investigation? What are you afraid of? What are you hiding?   What is Judge Kavanaugh hiding? Nobody knows. But people who want the  truth will find a truth teller. People who don't want the truth will  run away from a truth teller and instead point fingers of accusation  and wild, untethered allegations. That is what Leader McConnell is  doing. It is not a great moment. I know he prizes his role in ramming  through these rightwing Justices. That is part of his legacy. I don't  think America will see it that way a few years from now when we see  their rulings. There will be a huge backlash if Kavanaugh should get on  the Court and they should rule the way they have ruled in the past. But  that is not the search for truth; that is the search for a rush job to  avoid the truth. It should not happen.   Think about it. The White House is blocking an impartial  investigation of Dr. Ford's allegation. Chairman Grassley is setting  arbitrary deadlines for Dr. Ford to testify, dictating the terms of her  appearance, and denying her and the minority the right to call other  witnesses, which always happens at hearings, including an alleged  eyewitness. There was someone in the room. By press reports, he is  backing up Kavanaugh. Why are they afraid to have him testify? Or at  least he is saying he doesn't remember.    We are hearing that Chairman Grassley now wants to bring in outside  counsel to conduct the questioning, as if Dr. Ford were on trial, as if  Republicans were afraid to question Dr. Ford. This is so unusual, but  it shows a fear on the part of our Republican friends that something  bad and truthful will come out.   If Chairman Grassley and Leader McConnell continue down this road, we  are heading for a hearing that will be far from what a serious  factfinding inquiry should look like, far from respectful to Dr. Ford,  and far from fair.   Given the circumstances, the American people should ask--particularly  those who support Judge Kavanaugh--who is more credible: Dr. Ford, who  wants the FBI to investigate her allegation because she is confident it  will corroborate her account, or our Republican friends who are running  away from any objective factfinding and truth?   Remember, it is Dr. Ford who not only wants the FBI to look into  this, she took a voluntary lie detector test, and she knew she was  inviting harassment and ridicule and abuse for coming forward. She has  gotten death threats. She has had to move out of her house. She feared  her life would be upended, and it is. She still had the courage to do  this. We certainty owe her some dignity and a fair hearing, not the  kind of rushed, almost kangaroo court-style hearing where the Members  on the Republican side are afraid to even ask her questions and  confront her while they will say things behind her back.   Who is more credible? Is it Dr. Ford, who is willing to submit to all  this, or Republicans in the White House, who are stonewalling an FBI  investigation into facts and who are refusing to call other witnesses  to Dr. Ford's hearing, including the alleged eyewitness? Republicans or  Democrats? There is an easy, easy answer to all of these. So when  Leader McConnell rails and rants about Democrats, he is setting up a  straw man. He is afraid of what might come out, what the truth is, it  seems to me.   We have heard Judge Kavanaugh's defenders say: This happened 36 years  ago; it shouldn't matter. We have heard new, tortured formulations of  that shopworn excuse that boys will be boys. I don't agree with any of  those voices, any of those excuses, but let me address those who think  that, people who think: This was a long time ago. Boys did this. Let's  not hold someone accountable for it 30 years later, or at least let's  not stop his advancement in his career.   One obvious answer is, it is the Supreme Court. But I would ask those  who believe that Kavanaugh is not being treated fairly to examine one  more point: his credibility. Whether you think what happened 36 years  ago is enough to remove him from consideration of the Supreme Court, as  I do, or whether you don't, credibility of a Supreme Court nominee is  extremely important.   Judge Kavanaugh has unequivocally denied this. He didn't say, like  Mr. Judge, ``I can't remember. Maybe I had too many to drink, and my  recollection isn't great''; he unequivocally denied it. And this comes  on top of the fact that Judge Kavanaugh's testimony had real issues  with credibility. Is Judge Kavanaugh again denying the truth because  his confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court hangs in the balance? The  credibility of Judge Kavanaugh, given his previous testimony, given how  he skirted the truth, at the very minimum, on issues such as  appointment of certain judges, on torture, on Manny Miranda--and now he  says this, an unequivocal denial?   Let's assume that after the testimony of Dr. Ford, most Americans  believe it to be true. How would we want to appoint Judge Kavanaugh-- because he would have abjectly lied--if they believe it is true?   So there is the issue of credibility. Beyond the weight that  different people give what happened 30-some-odd years ago, beyond the  weight of whether people excuse or don't excuse the behavior--I don't  excuse it--is the issue that looms: credibility. Is Judge Kavanaugh the  kind of upright, straightforward individual we want on the Bench? Do  his flirtations with avoiding the truth in his testimony--is this just  another, even worse indication that he does not have the judgment, the  moral character, the credibility for a job that requires all three?   In summation, in the face of multiple allegations against Judge  Kavanaugh, the FBI should reopen the background check investigation,  and we should conduct a hearing where the appropriate witnesses are  called and respect is given to both the accuser and the accused.  Anything less will be viewed by the American people and I believe  judged by history as a stain on Republicans in the Senate and a stain  on the integrity of the majesty of the Supreme Court.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
