 Madam President, I am proud to host a number of  interns from Nevada in my office, all of whom have contributed greatly  to my work in the U.S. Senate. I know I speak for my colleagues as well  when I say that many of our interns have enjoyed and benefited from a  wonderful program operated by the Stennis Center for Public Service.  This program is designed to enhance the internship experience for  exceptional future leaders, giving young Americans an inside look at  how Congress works and an opportunity to learn from bipartisan senior  staffers and foster bipartisan relationships that will carry some of  them through their career supporting Congress.   Stennis interns are selected based on their employment experience,  college course load, and future service to Congress. This fall, 32  interns were chosen to be a part of this prestigious experience. These  interns serve us on both sides of the aisle, working for Democrats and  Republicans in the House and Senate, including one exceptional intern  in my office who was awarded this opportunity: Natalie Gilbert of Las  Vegas, NV.   Natalie is an impressive young Nevadan, having earned the  distinguished honors of State of Nevada Mock Trial Outstanding Attorney  and National Merit Commended Scholar in 2020. Before interning with my  office, she interned with the Clark County District Attorney's Office  in the homicide and domestic violence departments and worked directly  with their victim advocacy program. Surpassing over 100 hours of  volunteer service, Natalie has been an invaluable member of our Las  Vegas community. I am proud to recognize Natalie and her incredible  efforts. I wish her only the best as she continues to pursue her  studies in political economy and justice and peace studies at  Georgetown University.   In addition to Natalie, I would like to congratulate all of the  Stennis interns on their completion of this exceptional program. I also  thank the Stennis Center and their senior Fellows for providing a  meaningful experience and fostering bipartisan work.   I ask that the names of the 2021 Fall Stennis congressional interns  and the offices in which they work be printed in the Record.
