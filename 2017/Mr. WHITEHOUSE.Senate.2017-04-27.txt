 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  up to 15 minutes as in morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, on Monday night we confirmed former  Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue to be President Trump's Secretary of  Agriculture, and I am here for my 164th ``Time to Wake Up'' speech to  urge Secretary Perdue to listen to his agency, to scientific  researchers in farm States across the country, to our major food and  agricultural producers, and to farmers, fishermen, ranchers, and  foresters about the serious and growing effects of climate change.   Carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is changing the atmosphere  and the oceans. We see it everywhere. We see it on drought-stricken  farms and in raging wildfires. We see it in fish that are disappearing  from warming, acidifying waters. We see it in our dying pine forests.  We see it in extreme weather events.   Secretary Perdue is taking the helm of an agency with a key role in  mitigating those very effects. The USDA provides farmers, foresters,  commodities markets, and State and local officials with analyses of  trends and emerging issues affecting agriculture, the food supply, the  environment, and rural communities. In its own Climate Change  Adaptation Plan, the Department notes: ``Climate change has the  potential to confound USDA efforts to meet these core obligations and  responsibilities to the Nation.''   During his tenure as Governor, Secretary Perdue issued a State energy  strategy, stating: ``Strong scientific evidence exists that increasing  emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are affecting  Earth's climate.''   That is encouraging. Yet, when asked by Senator Leahy about climate  change during the Secretary's confirmation process, he backpedaled and  said: ``It is clear that the climate has been changing,'' but there is  ``significant debate within the scientific community'' on whether human  activities play a role in that.   Whoops, that is the classic denier dodge, and it is just not true.   Secretary Perdue said several times during his confirmation process  that he will use the ``best scientific and statistical data available''  to make decisions. The National Climate Assessment uses the ``best  scientific and statistical data'' to conclude this: ``In the long term,  combined stresses associated with climate change are expected to  decrease agricultural productivity.''   In the Midwest, for instance, the National Climate Assessment reports  that temperatures are increasing, and the rate of warming tripled  between 1980 and 2010. Under the assessment's worst-case scenarios,  temperatures across the Midwest are projected to rise 8.5 degrees  Fahrenheit by the year 2100. If you are a farmer, 8.5 degrees changes  everything.   In the western mountains, massive forests stand dead on the  mountainsides as warmer winters allow the killer bark beetle to swarm  into higher latitudes and higher altitudes. Over 82 million acres of  national forests are under stress from fires, these insects, or both.  Ominously, the assessment says that the combined effect of increasing  wildfire, insect outbreaks, and diseases is expected to cause an  ``almost complete loss of subalpine forests.''   The cost to taxpayers of fighting fires in those dead and dying  forests is growing dramatically. Firefighting has gone from just 13  percent of the Forest Service's budget in 2004 to over 50 percent in  2015. The Forest Service estimates that by 2025 fighting fires will  take up to two-thirds of its budget.  [[Page S2585]]  Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell testified to the Senate: ``This  increase in the cost of wildland fire suppression is subsuming the  agency's budget and jeopardizing its ability to implement its full  mission.''   One place Secretary Perdue can go to find out a little bit about this  is from our State universities.   The University of Wyoming's Center for Environmental Hydrology and  Geophysics, for example, reports: ``Many of the most pressing issues  facing the Western United States hinge on the fate and transport of  water and its response to diverse disturbances, including climate  change.''   At Kansas State University, professor of agronomy Charles Rice is  using climate modeling to help anticipate climate effects in the Great  Plains and to help the region mitigate and adapt to those effects.   In Wisconsin, Victor Cabrera, an assistant professor in the  University of Wisconsin-Madison Dairy Science Department, says that  higher summer temperatures and increasing drought will interfere with  both livestock fertility and milk production, and dairy cows could give  as much as 10 percent less milk. Secretary Perdue's own Department of  Agriculture predicts that by 2030 climate change will cost the United  States' dairy sector between $79 million and $199 million per year in  lost production.   South Dakota State University professor Mark Cochrane is working with  the Forest Service to better understand how a changing climate is  affecting our forests. Professor Cochrane reported: ``Forest fire  seasons worldwide increased by 18.7 percent due to more rain-free days  and hotter temperatures.''   Secretary Perdue could travel to Iowa and hear from Gene Takle, an  Iowa State University professor of agronomy and geological and  atmospheric sciences, who told a United Nations conference recently  that climate change is already affecting Iowa farmers. ``This isn't  just about the distant future,'' he said. At Iowa State's Leopold  Center for Sustainable Agriculture, Secretary Perdue could also hear  about what the center calls ``aggravated and unpredictable risk that  will challenge the security of our agricultural and biological  systems.''   I am from the Ocean State. So let's turn to the oceans, where the  National Climate Assessment predicts: ``Fishing costs are predicted to  increase as fisheries transition to new species and as processing  plants and fishing jobs shift poleward.'' In the Pacific Northwest,  ocean acidification caused a 70-percent loss of oyster larvae from 2006  to 2008 at an oyster hatchery in Oregon. Wild oyster stocks in  Washington State have failed as weather patterns have brought more  acidic water to the shore. This is an industry worth about $73 million  annually. So we ought not to laugh this off.   In Alaska, the University of Alaska has an Ocean Acidification  Research Center. That is how seriously they take it. The Ocean  Acidification Research Center warns that ocean acidification ``has the  potential to disrupt (the Alaskan seafood) industry from top to  bottom''--a top-to-bottom disruption of one of Alaska's major  industries, and we cannot get a word on climate change out of the  Republican side of the aisle in this building.   It is, of course, not just scientists. Some of the largest  agriculture and food companies are speaking out as well. For these  companies, climate change is not a partisan issue. It is not even a  political issue. It is a business survival issue. It is their new  reality. In 2015, major food and beverage companies visited Congress to  tell us how climate change is affecting their industry.   ``Climate really matters to our business,'' said Kim Nelson, of  General Mills. ``We fundamentally rely on Mother Nature.'' The choices  we make to protect or forsake our climate, she said, will be  ``important to the long-term viability of our company and our  industry.''   Paul Bakus, of Nestle, agreed, saying that climate change ``is  impacting our business today.'' His company cans pumpkins under the  Libby's brand. They have seen pumpkin yields crash in the United  States. Mr. Bakus told us: ``We have never seen growing and harvesting  conditions like this in the Midwest.''    Chief sustainability officer for the Mars Corporation, Barry Parkin,  was blunter in his assessment: ``We are on a path to a dangerous  place.''   Greg Page, the former CEO of Cargill, has publicly stated that  climate change must be addressed to prevent future food shortages.  Specifically, he said:         U.S. production of corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton could       decline by 14 percent by mid-century, and by as much as 42       percent by late century. From an agricultural standpoint, we       have to prepare ourselves for a different climate than we       have today.    In advance of the Paris climate conference, the heads of Mars,  General Mills, Nestle USA, Unilever, Kellogg Company, New Belgium  Brewing, Ben & Jerry's, Cliff Bar, Stonyfield Farm, Danone Dairy,  PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Hershey, and Hain Celestial signed a public  letter--this one here--that said:         Climate change is bad for farmers and agriculture. Drought,       flooding, and hotter growing conditions threaten the world's       food supply and contribute to food insecurity.    They continued:         Now is the time to meaningfully address the reality of       climate change. . . . We are ready to meet the climate       challenges that face our businesses.    These big, successful companies don't take climate change lightly,  and neither do our farmers, loggers, ranchers, and fishermen.   In South Carolina, farms that have been in families for generations,  like that of Representative Mark Sanford's, are under threat from  climate change. Congressman Sanford said: ``At our family farm in  Beaufort, I've watched over the last 50 years as sea levels have risen  and affected salt edges of the farm.''   Out West, ranchers are experiencing longer and more severe droughts.  In a 2012 survey of Southern Colorado ranchers, roughly one-quarter of  respondents said they would likely leave the industry if the drought  persisted. Carlyle Currier, who owns a ranch in Molina, CO, said: ``We  just can't grow enough to feed the cattle ourselves.''   In New Hampshire, Jamey French, President of Northland Forest  Products, has seen hardwood tree species begin to migrate, with less  valuable timber trees like oak and hickory beginning to take the place  of sugar maple and yellow birch.   I sure hope Secretary Purdue will come to Rhode Island and meet our  fishermen. Chris Brown is the owner of Brown Family Seafood and the  president of the Rhode Island Commercial Fishermen's Association. He  has fished in the waters of Rhode Island Sound for years: ``We used to  come right here and catch two, three, four thousand pounds [of whiting]  a day, sometimes 10,'' he told the New York Times. But the whiting have  moved north to cooler waters. ``Climate change is going to make it hard  on some of those species that are not particularly fond of warm or  warming waters,'' Chris said.   And he is not alone. I have been told by other fishermen that it is  getting weird out there in Rhode Island's waters, that this is not our  grandfathers' ocean. These changes are serious for this industry.   So I hope Secretary Perdue will hear the message of our farmers,  foresters, ranchers, and fishermen. They are sending this message loud  and clear. Climate change is happening now, and they count on us to  face the challenge.   The problem, of course, is the fossil fuel-funded denial machine that  has so much influence over the Republican Party in Congress today. That  fossil fuel-funded denial machine will do its best to change the  subject, to muddy the waters, to create artificial doubt, and to use  its anonymous dark political money to break up and thwart any signs of  progress, but all the dark money in the world can't change the things  that Iowa farmers, Wyoming ranchers, South Dakota forest managers, and  Rhode Island fishermen see.   If this body--if our Republican friends here--will not listen to Mars  Corporation, to General Mills, to Nestle USA, to Unilever, to Kellogg,  to Coke and Pepsi and Hershey, it is really time to wake up.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
