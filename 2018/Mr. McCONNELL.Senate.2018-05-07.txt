 Mr. President, I wish to pay respects to a member of  the Senate family who tragically passed away last week. Michael Beaver  was a talented attorney who served as the Senate's Assistant  Parliamentarian. That followed service as deputy legislative counsel  for the State of California.   Michael was just 39 years old. He leaves behind his wife, Gilda, his  two beloved sons, Bradley and Connor, his parents, and an extended  family that mourns his loss. They are joined by Michael's colleagues  here on the Senate staff, in the Secretary's office, and with the floor  staff on both sides of the aisle and throughout our whole institution.  The Senate's prayers are with all of Michael's family and friends at  this immensely difficult hour.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a totally different matter, this  week the Senate will consider another slate of extremely well-qualified  nominees for seats on the Federal bench. A thoughtful, independent, and  expert judiciary is a cornerstone of our constitutional order. It has  been the case since the very beginning of our country.   Accordingly, the six circuit court nominees we will now consider have  excellent reputations in the legal field and have demonstrated they  understand the proper role of Federal judges in our government.   First up is Kurt Engelhardt, of Louisiana, the President's choice to  serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Senate previously  confirmed Judge Engelhardt by voice vote to the Federal trial bench in  the Eastern District of Louisiana. Since then, he has only strengthened  his reputation for fairness and thoughtfulness.   In the latest edition of the Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, his  legal peers describe him as ``very conscientious'' and ``fair and  independent minded.'' The American Bar Association agrees. It awarded  Judge Engelhardt its highest possible rating of ``unanimously well  qualified.'' I urge every one of our colleagues to join me in voting to  advance Judge Engelhardt's nomination later this afternoon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, in storefront  windows across America, new signs are going up--signs that many  communities haven't seen literally in years. Here is what the signs  say: ``Now Hiring.'' Just 16 months into the Trump administration and  this Republican Congress, the percentage of American workers who are  unemployed, underemployed, or have given up finding a job is already  smaller than it ever was in any of the Obama years. In fact, it hasn't  been this low since 2001. Let me say that again. Less unemployment,  underemployment, and discouragement today than at any point in the last  17 years. Or we can look at how many Americans are receiving  unemployment benefits. The answer is this: fewer today than at any time  since--listen to this--1973.   We all know that these economic indicators can be noisy, but the big  overall shift from the Obama era is impossible to deny. Republican  policies have taken Washington's foot off the brake of the U.S.  economy. We have rolled back a host of job-killing regulations. We have  passed historic tax reform for middle-class families and job creators.  These Republican policies have helped to unleash a dynamic, growing  economy that is producing many more new jobs. It is putting the  stagnation of the last decade literally to shame. That means sidelined  workers get the chance to check back into the game. It means renewal is  coming to so many small towns, small cities, and rural areas that had  to sit and watch as Democratic policies funneled nearly all of the new  wealth and new jobs into our Nation's biggest and bluest urban areas.  It means higher wages, as local businesses are forced to compete again  for the best workers.  [[Page S2506]]    I recently read about a man named Chandler Steffy. He owns a roofing  company in Iowa. Three years ago, in the Obama economy, his laborers  earned less than $15 an hour. Today is a different story. The  unemployment rate in Iowa is under 3 percent, and Mr. Steffy pays $25  per hour to attract the best talent. American small businesses are  doing well and outbidding each other for American workers. It feels  good; doesn't it?   After 10 years of Democratic policies, this had practically become a  foreign concept. Not anymore--it is a new day. There is more business  for job creators, which means good jobs that need filling, which leads  to higher pay for workers. This is happening all over our country.   Rich Obermark owns a small contracting business in Paducah, KY. They  retrofit electrical systems, A/V equipment, and gas piping. He wrote me  to explain: ``For our small company, the tax cuts will mean [we'll] be  able to afford more trucks and tools.'' Tax reform, he said, ``will  allow us to invest back into our company, which will in turn allow us  to hire more people.''   There is more business, more investment, more job openings, and  higher pay for workers as a consequence. After 8 years of Democratic  policies, this sure is a sight for sore eyes, and this is only the  beginning. These are only the early returns from Republicans' pro- opportunity, pro-worker agenda.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I rise to honor the service and  sacrifice of Officer Phillip Meacham, of the Hopkinsville Police  Department, who lost his life in faithful service to his community.   Like all members of law enforcement, Officer Meacham put his safety  at risk each and every day for those he was sworn to protect. However,  on March 29, 2018, tragedy struck in a targeted act of violence when an  individual impersonating a police officer fatally shot him.   For a small community like Hopkinsville, KY, Officer Meacham's  killing appalled everyone to their core. This type of senseless  violence had no place in their or any community, and Officer Meacham's  loss sent shockwaves throughout western Kentucky. During his funeral  procession, hundreds of people--both friends and total strangers--lined  the streets to honor him.   Officer Meacham joined the Hopkinsville Police Department last May  after more than a decade at the Christian County Sherriff's Department.  His honorable service to this community will be remembered for years to  come by the men and women who served with him in uniform and by the  wife and young daughter he left behind.   As the community mourns Officer Meacham, we are all reminded of the  ever-present danger that the brave members of law enforcement face.  Officer Meacham's courage and heroism were hallmarks of his service,  and his community is safer because of him.   I would like to express my deepest condolences to Officer Meacham's  family, to the Hopkinsville Police Department, and to all those who  knew him. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in honoring this  Kentucky hero.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity  to congratulate Dr. Kay Adkins, the president and CEO of Ashland  Community and Technical College, ACTC, on her upcoming retirement after  more than 5 years of leadership to this Kentucky institution. A western  Kentucky native, Dr. Adkins knew this would be her last post before a  well-deserved retirement that will begin at the end of June.   After earning her doctorate in educational administration from  Illinois State University, Dr. Adkins held leadership positions at  community colleges around the country. Just before coming back to the  Commonwealth, she served as the president of Yuba College in  Marysville, CA, where she found success in diversity, strategic  planning, and the establishment of the Yuba College Foundation.   During her time at ACTC, Dr. Adkins helped the organization fulfill  its mission to provide accessible, affordable, and quality education to  its students. A member of the school's board of directors said, ``She's  the total package.'' A former chairman of the board credits her  leadership with making ACTC a leader of Kentucky's community colleges.   One of her many accomplishments in Ashland was the establishment of  the Holy Family Community Collegiate High School, which helps students  earn 2-year degrees while they pursue a high school diploma. Dr. Adkins  also strengthened the relationship between ACTC and many of Kentucky's  colleges and universities, so students could transfer their credits to  a 4-year program. In the face of economic hardships in the region, she  helped develop second-career retraining programs to help displaced or  out-of-work Kentuckians.   Dr. Adkins' efforts have already shown impressive results. Under her  guidance, ACTC awarded a record number of credentials to its graduates  each of the last 3 years. She has also built close ties with the  employer community in an effort to increase the number of scholarships  available to students and help them begin meaningful careers after  graduation. Her leadership has benefited students and the community.   Now, she plans to spend retirement in her native western Kentucky  with her husband, playing golf and traveling. I would like to  congratulate Dr. Adkins on her successful career and thank her for  years of dedication to Kentucky's students, and I urge my colleagues to  join me.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today it is my privilege to  congratulate Albert Hale, of Laurel County, KY, on his recent  retirement after more than four decades of public service to his  community. Hale left his position as emergency management director for  the county earlier this year, and I would like to take this opportunity  to join with the men and women of Laurel County in thanking him for his  diligent service.   After graduating from high school, Hale began working for the  Kentucky Department of Transportation as a heavy equipment operator.  Then in 1994, he added second career working on a part-time basis for  the county's sheriff's department. Since he took on that new  responsibility more than 20 years ago, Hale had been ready to answer  any call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.   Almost a decade later, Hale retired from the transportation  department and began working full time for the sheriff's department. In  that role, Hale coordinated with the U.S. Forest Service to assist in  its efforts to patrol the area surrounding the Laurel Lake. In 2008,  Hale left the sheriff's department for a position in the Laurel County  jail's work-release program where he worked with inmates to help them  find employment opportunities.   Two years later, Hale heard about a vacancy at the Laurel County  Emergency Management Department. He applied and joined the department  in 2010 as its director. In this role, Hale leads the support  organization to help his community prepare for, respond to, and recover  from a wide range of emergency situations. In this position, Hale had  the opportunity to collaborate with emergency management professionals  from across Kentucky.   As director, Hale remembered one particular event with great  satisfaction. After a powerful tornado in Laurel County, a number of  organizations and individuals came together to protect the community  and to help it rebuild. In the face of a disaster, the citizens of  Laurel County worked collaboratively to help their neighbors in need.   Throughout his long career, Hale has dedicated himself time and again  to the service of his community. As he fondly looks back on his career,  he also remembers the many family holidays  [[Page S2512]]  and occasions that he missed because of that service. So now, in his  retirement, Hale looks forward to spending time with his wife, son, and  grandchildren. However, if an unfortunate disaster were to strike the  Laurel County community, Albert is ready to volunteer to serve the  public once again.   I would like to join with Albert Hale's family and community in  thanking him for his lifetime of service, and I ask my colleagues in  the Senate to join me.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to help Whitley County,  KY, mark an impressive milestone. Founded in 1818, the county is  commemorating its 200 years of heritage and success with a year full of  events and celebrations. I would like to take a brief moment to join  them in remembering the unique history of Whitley County.   Although the first meeting of the Whitley County Court was held on  April 20, 1818, in the home of one of its earliest residents, Samuel  Cox, the area's history extends back to its first exploration as early  as 1750. The county was named for Colonel William Whitley, famous for  fighting many battles within the area, safeguarding the Wilderness  Road, and for his service in the War of 1812. The county seat,  Williamsburg, was also named in his honor.   At its founding, the county was home to only 500 residents. Whitley  County saw only tepid population growth during its first decades, but  after the Civil War, the number of residents quickly increased. With  the arrival of the L&N Railroad in 1883, the area flourished with the  influx of lumber and coal jobs. Now, Whitley County is home to more  than 35,000 Kentuckians.   Among the most remarkable aspects of the area is its picturesque  geography. In the Cumberland Mountains, much of the county is included  in the Daniel Boone National Forest. A portion of Whitley County's  western border also follows the path of the Cumberland River and  includes Cumberland Falls, known as the Niagara of the South. As the  only place in the Western Hemisphere with regularly visible moonbows,  the falls are a major source of tourism.   To celebrate its bicentennial, the county is hosting a wide range of  events, focused around the official founding in April, which included a  birthday party and the decorating of the downtown Williamsburg in red,  white, and blue. The county will also dedicate a historical marker at  the site of Samuel Cox's residence. Later in the year, Whitley County  will collect items for a time capsule and host a barbeque cook-off.   I would like to join everyone in Whitley County, including Judge/ Executive Pat White, Jr., in marking this occasion, and I would like to  ask my Senate colleagues to help me commemorate the bicentennial  anniversary.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.    Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading and, in  order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule  XIV, I object to my own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Finance Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1732  and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that  the Whitehouse amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to, the bill,  as amended, be considered read a third time and passed, and the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 2:30 p.m.,  Tuesday, May 8; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed. I further ask that  following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and  resume consideration of the Engelhardt nomination; finally, that all  time during recess, adjournment, morning business, and leader remarks  count postcloture on the Engelhardt nomination.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senators Cassidy and  Cantwell.
