 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill.   One month ago, George Floyd was murdered. As his 6-year-old astutely  said in the days following, ``Daddy changed the world.''   In this bill, there are several policies that have been highlighted  in the Harlem Manifesto Against Police Brutality. The Harlem Manifesto  advocates for a ban on chokeholds and the knee. It demilitarizes police  and ends qualified immunity.   The Harlem Manifesto also includes a provision to ensure that police  officers can be held accountable for excessive force. The standard  should not be willful intent but reckless intent. We must pass this  bill and eradicate the cultural violence in police departments across  the country.   The best anticrime policies are antipoverty policies. We must  continue this fight. Black lives matter.
