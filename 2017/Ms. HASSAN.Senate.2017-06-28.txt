 Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend and  colleague, Senator Shaheen, to discuss the stories and concerns we  heard from our constituents in New Hampshire about how they would be  hurt if TrumpCare becomes law.   Even though Republican leadership has delayed a vote on TrumpCare  this week, we know that the fundamentals of what is wrong with  TrumpCare will not change.   TrumpCare would force Granite Staters to pay more for worse  insurance, all to give billions of dollars in tax breaks to corporate  special interests--including Big Pharma--at the expense of hard-working  Americans and the programs they rely on. This is the basic principle of  TrumpCare, and it is unacceptable.   TrumpCare would be a disaster for people in New Hampshire. Granite  Staters know this, and they have been standing up and speaking out  against this dangerous bill.   As Senator Shaheen discussed, we held an emergency hearing last week  in Concord to hear from our constituents about how TrumpCare would  impact them. We held this emergency hearing at 2 p.m., on a Friday  afternoon, in the summer, and with just a day's notice. Yet hundreds of  people showed up.   Over 50 people shared their personal stories about the importance of  healthcare, of how they have benefited from the important protections  that are provided under current law--including maternity care,  prescription drug coverage, and coverage for substance use disorder  services--of the protections against insurance company  [[Page S3815]]  abuses, of Medicaid expansion, and of traditional Medicaid. They told  us what their lives were like and why TrumpCare would be devastating to  them and their families. I wish to share some of those stories today.   We heard from Ariel, from Rochester, NH, a mother who is benefitting  from substance use disorder services that are included in Medicaid  expansion and would be taken away under TrumpCare. Ariel said:         I am a mother of 3 children and I have a substance abuse       disorder. I come from a long line of women who never had much       opportunity. With the opportunity to have Medicaid I have       been given the chance of treatment.        Without the chance of treatment I wouldn't have been taught       that there is a solution and a way to live a full, beautiful       life as a woman in recovery . . . as a mother of 3 beautiful       children. . . . As a woman of dignity and grace. . . .        If the opportunity of Medicaid is taken away, the chance of       positive change in this world is going to drastically drop. .       . . Women like me may never know a world outside of drug use       and hopelessness.    She goes on to say:         Today because of the opportunity of change, I am able to be       a positive role model to my children and most importantly our       future.    When we met Ariel, she was pregnant with that third child, and she  went into labor immediately following our field hearing. She told us  over the weekend that she had a healthy baby boy. Because of the  treatment Ariel received through Medicaid, she is in a better position  to take care of that new baby boy.   Our Medicaid Program is not only critical to providing key support to  combat the substance misuse crisis, but, as Senator Shaheen mentioned,  it also helps seniors and those who experience disabilities get the  care they need--services that would be taken away under TrumpCare.   This is something we heard from a Granite Stater named Jeff, who has  a form of muscular dystrophy. Jeff said:         I am able to live a life that's independent in my own home,       pursuing my own career, only by virtue of the fact that I am       able to receive Medicaid services. Specifically, all this       discussion about private insurance is well and good, but I       think what some Senators aren't remembering or don't know is       that private insurance doesn't cover many of the types of       services that Medicaid does. . . . Especially personal care       services that allow us to live independently in our homes and       communities, which is where all of us would like to be, if       we're able to. So, I'm concerned about that.    He continued:         I'm concerned about the fact that my understanding is that       this bill would allow states to opt out of providing optional       Medicaid services, many of which are the waiver programs here       in the state that frankly are so vital to folks with physical       disabilities, developmental disabilities, acquired brain       injuries, and all sorts of other conditions. So that part       concerns me.    Medicaid coverage makes it possible for Jeff and so many others to  work and participate in their communities. Jeff also said that he was  concerned about the fact that TrumpCare cuts and caps Medicaid, which  we know is really just code for massive cuts that would force States to  choose between slashing benefits, reducing the number of people who can  get care, or both.   Senator Shaheen and I also heard from several Granite Staters who  have benefited from the Affordable Care Act and who are concerned that  TrumpCare would reduce the care they receive while raising their costs.  One of these people was Enna, from Exeter, NH. Enna said:         I am self-employed and purchase health insurance through       the Marketplace here in New Hampshire. The ACA had given me       the opportunity to purchase affordable health insurance for       myself and my family of four.    She explained:         We were unable to maintain insurance consistently prior to       the ACA, and even when we did have it, critical preventative       care--for myself, as a woman--was not covered by our previous       policy.    She said this about TrumpCare:         [It] would make our health coverage less comprehensive and       less affordable. I am certain that our risk of financial and/      or health catastrophe would be significantly greater [under       TrumpCare].    There is no doubt that we should all be working together in order to  improve the Affordable Care Act, build on the progress we have made,  and lower healthcare costs for all of our citizens. I am willing to  work with any of my colleagues on bipartisan solutions in order to make  that happen, but we know that TrumpCare is not the answer. While my  Republican colleagues have delayed a vote on this bill, no one believes  that TrumpCare is dead yet.   I am going to continue to share the stories of Granite Staters who  would have to pay more money for less care under TrumpCare. I will keep  working to ensure that TrumpCare never becomes law. I urge my  colleagues to take the time to listen to their constituents who would  be hurt under TrumpCare.   The people of New Hampshire have been so brave. They have come  forward, and they have talked about their most personal, difficult, and  challenging experiences. They have laid themselves bare before the rest  of us so we could understand what they have gone through and so we  could understand that if we are not committed to a healthcare system in  which every American--citizens in a democracy--have meaningful, truly  affordable access to the type of care that each of us would want for  our own family, then we are not doing our job as a democracy at all.   We need to protect and defend what we have, and, then, we need to  improve what we have. We need to come together and make sure that  healthcare is truly available to every one of us, so that we can be  healthy and productive and so that we can lead together.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
