 Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I want to thank the  chairman and also Ranking Member Thompson and Ranking Member Vela and  all of their committee staff for their great work and support of this  very important legislation. We would not be here today without their  commitment to keeping our ports safe. Thank you.   Mr. Speaker, you can't turn on the television or visit your favorite  website without seeing cyber threats dominating the news. All  industries, including our own Federal agencies, have been targets,  costing our economy dearly and exposing the personal information of  hundreds of millions of employees.   This is a growing problem that is not going away. Rather, these  threats are becoming more common and more severe. From the interference  in our elections to attacks on government workers, email hacks, and the  theft of credit card information, cyber threats are everywhere, and it  is time that we modernize the Federal Government's planning and  response to these threats.   In June, a Danish shipping company was infected with malware that  affected 17 of its shipping container terminals worldwide. The virus  spread to 2 million computers within a 2-hour period. As a result, the  largest terminal at the Port of Los Angeles shut down for 4 days from  the cyber attack.   A recent study estimated the cost of a shutdown of the Port of Los  Angeles and Long Beach at $1 billion per day to the local economy.   More than $1.3 trillion in cargo moves, annually, through our  Nation's 360 commercial ports, and many of the goods that enter through  the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach come to my district  before being shipped to the rest of the country.   With this much economic activity and the increased use of cyber  technology to manage port operations ranging from communications and  navigation to engineering, safety, and cargo, it is critical to protect  our maritime cyber infrastructure.                                time  1500    It is time that Congress modernize our Federal agencies. This is why  I am proud to bring the Strengthening Cybersecurity Information Sharing  and Coordination in Our Ports Act to the floor today.   This legislation would improve information sharing and cooperation in  addressing cybersecurity risks at our Nation's ports through several  measures: setting standards for reporting, providing guidance to ports,  bringing port representatives to the table for future planning, and  modernizing how the Coast Guard addresses cyber threats.   Mr. Speaker, these are commonsense measures. This bill has bipartisan  support. The Strengthening Cybersecurity Information Sharing and  Coordination in Our Ports Act passed the House unanimously last year,  and I am confident that passage today will push the Senate into action.   This legislation is supported by the Port of Los Angeles,  Congressional PORTS Caucus chairs, and it is endorsed by the Maritime &  Port Security Information Sharing and Analysis Organization. I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation because we simply can't afford  not to. Ports are too critical to our economy and our Nation.
