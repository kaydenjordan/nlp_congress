 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colton  Griffin, a third grader from Moville, Iowa. After his classmate and  friend, Hope, passed away in a tragic accident, Colton wanted to make  sure her bucket calf still made it to the fair.   That is when he came up with this great idea to have his whole class  help show her calf, Taffy. I had the pleasure of meeting Colton, and  his dad, Cody, at the Iowa State Fair last week, and they truly embody  ``Iowa Nice.''   Supporting our friends and neighbors in tough times is one of the  things that makes Iowa so special. With a heart that big, I know Colton  is going to do great things.   Madam Speaker, may God bless Colton and his friend, Hope, and her  family. May God bless.                            ____________________
