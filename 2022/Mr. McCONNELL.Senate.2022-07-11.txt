 Madam President, since the Senate was last in session,  our Nation's highest Court finished its term. It was an absolutely  historic series of victories for the American people and for the  Constitution--the single best Supreme Court term in nearly 70 years,  since Brown v. Board overturned Plessy in 1954.   For the first time in modern history, there is a textualist and  originalist majority on the Court--Justices who understand the job of a  judge is to follow the law as it is written, who understand they are  there to faithfully apply what our statutes and our Constitution  actually say and leave everything else to the people and their elected  representatives. This is the kind of judiciary that the rule of law  requires, that our system of government demands, that a diverse society  needs.   Last month, the Court corrected one of the most egregious legal and  moral mistakes of the 20th century. Only seven countries in the entire  world allow elective abortion-on-demand past 20 weeks, but until 2  weeks ago, past Supreme Courts had mistakenly decreed that the  Constitution forced America to be one of them. All 50 States had to  handle this issue like China and North Korea. No State was allowed to  handle it even like France or Germany.   Of course, there is no command like that in our Constitution, and  that is what the Court finally recognized. There is nothing in the  Constitution that forces us to be a radical, global outlier on  abortion. The American people finally have their freedom back to enact  commonsense protections for unborn life.   Millions of Americans spent nearly half a century working, marching,  and praying for this landmark day. It has been an honor to stand with  them throughout the journey that led to June 24, 2022, and to continue  to stand together. The Court's ruling in Dobbs is not only a huge  victory for innocent life, it is a historic triumph for the rule of law  itself.   Even liberal legal experts, including the late Justice Ginsburg, said  the Court's abortion precedents were badly reasoned.   Liberal Yale law professor Akhil Amar, just this May, wrote:         I am a Democrat who supports abortion rights but opposes       Roe . . . In the eyes of many constitutional experts across       the ideological spectrum, it [lacked] solid grounding in the       Constitution.   [[Page S3188]]     Now, Washington Democrats have taken pains to ignore that. Remember,  their party has become jaw-droppingly extreme on this issue. More than  60 percent of Americans support restrictions after 15 weeks. Only 19  percent of Americans want abortion on demand until the moment of birth,  but 97 percent of Washington Democrats support precisely that; 97  percent of Washington Democrats are with less than one-fifth of the  country on this issue. So Democrats are desperate to change the  subject. Many are not even trying to argue with the decision but have  pivoted to claims about all kinds of unrelated issues, but this is  nonsense.   Here again is Professor Amar, the arch-liberal from Yale Law,  writing, again, back in May:         Does Justice Alito's draft, as many are now claiming,       inflict collateral damage on other areas of constitutional       case law, such as the Warren Court's precedents on       contraception and interracial marriage? It does not. In fact,       the Dobbs draft reinforces these iconic opinions by       explaining why they were [actually] right.    From top to bottom, this ruling was a gigantic step forward for human  dignity and for the rule of law. The Justices tuned out the mobs and  attempted violence, tuned out the threats from politicians, and simply  followed the law where it clearly led.   This historic achievement was just one part of the most consequential  Supreme Court term in seven decades. I will have more to say on this  subject this week.
