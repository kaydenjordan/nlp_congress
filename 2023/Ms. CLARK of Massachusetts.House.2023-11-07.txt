 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Chair, we are 10 days from a GOP  shutdown, and instead of finding a bipartisan way forward, instead of  working with us to lower costs for families at home, instead of  honoring the budget deal that we already agreed to, Republicans have  turned around and become a pro-lead poisoning caucus.   Really. Read the bill. They have written a housing and transportation  budget that defunds lead removal in low-income housing, lead removal in  the homes of 46,000 children.   That is not all. This bill cuts affordable housing construction by  two-thirds. It guts transit funding, leaving parents with longer, more  dangerous, less reliable commutes.   News flash. Nobody's gas prices were ever lowered by banning Pride  flags, but the open discrimination against the LGBTQ+ Americans in this  bill will hurt communities in every single one of our districts.   This bill is more of the same from the MAGA Republican majority:  Unserious, heartless extremism.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to put children over politics and  vote ``no'' on this bill.
