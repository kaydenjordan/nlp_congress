 Madam Speaker, I thank the whip for organizing the Special  Order.   Remind me never to have Congressman McNerney do my eulogy. The crowd  would never believe it.   Madam Speaker, we are here to honor a remarkable man, a classmate,  and a friend of mine for 24 years.   We all know, in Washington and across the country, his leadership and  energy for the Energy and Commerce Committee and his leadership in the  Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee. But you may not know his  achievements in the heart.   He is committed to the Baltic States, in developing and enhancing  that relationship with the U.S.; his many years of service on the NATO  Parliamentary Assembly, traveling back and forth to Europe to lay out  and preserve that important relationship; his role serving on the  Smithsonian Institution Board of Regents; and his service on the West  Point Board of Governors. He has an amazing legacy for our country.   He has worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to achieve  things that matter to real people. His 1998 bill signed into law,  allowing for biofuel use in Federal, State, and private fleets, has  made biodiesel more readily available at fuel pumps across the country.   He is always focused on making sure 911 worked for the American  people. In 1999, he designated 911 as the universal emergency number in  the U.S. for mobile as well as landline telephones and continues to  improve on that for our safety and security.   He led the bill to require Federal testing of children's booster  seats, something every parent can take to heart.   Following that, he created a new internet domain, a place where  children could go that was safe and secure from predators. It was game- changing.   His 2003 law created a placement for heart defibrillators in schools.   You can see a theme here: helping real people, helping children,  helping families. He continued that work throughout his years on the  Energy and Commerce Committee.   I can go on and on, but he took on tough issues as well, ones that  people never thought could be solved, like the Toxic Substance Control  Act, something he worked years for, to build bipartisan support,  something that makes our Nation more secure environmentally as well.   We all know, since we have nicknamed him Yucca Shimkus for many  years, his devotion to trying to find a safe, secure nuclear energy  future for America.   He didn't do this by himself. He has an amazing family. His wife,  Karen, as Steve said, is here today. His three sons, David, Josh, and  Daniel, who we watched growing up reading in the townhouse, backing  their dad.   His heart is never far away from his hometown of Collinsville,  Illinois. He is, as you know, a proud graduate of the United States  Military Academy. He served over 5 years Active Duty in the Army and  then entered the Army Reserves. He retired with the rank of lieutenant  colonel.   After 28 years of military service, I can tell you, because I was his  roommate, when we finished long days at the Capitol, trying to figure  out how we get ready for the next day, John was leaving to go to a  Reserve training and continuing education, or the weekends on his  training as well. He has a devotion to this country that is  unbelievable.   His service has not just been to his country but to his community. He  ran and won his first election for the school township trustees because  he wanted to help children in his community. He was elected as Madison  County treasurer so he could serve a broader group of constituents.   In 1996, he won his first term in the United States House from  Illinois' 20th District. Today, he represents the 33 counties of the  15th District.   I can tell you, it must be an amazing district because we all know  where the largest ketchup bottle in America is located: Collinsville,  Illinois. We know his district is the horseradish capital of the world,  with the International Horseradish Festival, horseradish  food, horseradish fun.    I will tell you, he loves his Lord. He loves his family. He has  always fretted about how much more he can do to help our church, the  Holy Cross Lutheran Church, in which he has worshiped his entire life.   Two points, as we finish, for me.   You would love being his roommate. He is a man of integrity, of  character. He is, every morning, the first one up in the morning,  sitting at the kitchen table reading the Bible, sending out those Bible  phrases for his friends and colleagues in preparing for his day.   He is an amazing teammate, along with classmate and roommate. He and  I played in the Congressional Baseball Game now for 23 straight years.  He is a baseball player. He has won MVP four or five times. We have  lost count. He is the last Member of Congress to hit a home run out of  the field, out of the park, on his first to bat in the first year in  Congress. He has never hit the ball anywhere close ever since.   He was a catcher, a pitcher, and the captain of our team, which  doesn't surprise you. He has been the captain of everything he has been  involved with his entire life. With this, I will tell how remarkable,  how gutsy, this guy is.   In 2004 or so, he had open-heart surgery in the spring, which, of  course, would mean he would miss his favorite baseball game. We had the  Congressional Baseball Game, and the doctor told him he could begin to  start exercising 3 months after the surgery. Well, the baseball game  happened to be exactly 3 months after the surgery.   Another pitcher started the game, was called back to Congress for  votes in the Senate, and out of the bullpen came   John Shimkus, 3  months after heart surgery, not arthroscopic surgery, the kind that  cracks you open.                                time  2100    There he was, three up, three down, helping save the game for the  Republicans. That is the kind of lawmaker, that is the kind of friend,  that is the kind of competitor he is. John is never letting you down.   He has always upheld the highest standards for our country, for  Congress, and I will tell you, at a time where each day you are told  what is wrong with America,   John Shimkus is what is right with  America. We are so proud of our friend's service, and he will be missed  like nobody else.  [[Page H5043]]    God bless you, John. Thank you.
