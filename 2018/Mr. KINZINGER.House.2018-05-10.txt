 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, as a military pilot, Air Force pilot, I think it is  important to note that this will not affect range operations at Nellis  Air Force Base.   My district is home to four nuclear power plants, and I have seen  firsthand the hard work and dedication of the men and women who work  there. These plants not only provide clean, reliable power, but also  create good jobs, and they strengthen our communities.   In 1982, the government made a commitment to these communities.  Congress and the President approved Yucca Mountain over 15 years ago.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission concluded it can safely store spent  fuel there for 1 million years.   In Illinois alone, ratepayers have contributed over $3 billion to the  Nuclear Waste Fund, and Illinois houses more spent fuel than any State.   Today is about following through on our commitments. We must reassure  communities like La Salle and Byron, that put their trust in the  government, that they can continue to make clean, reliable nuclear  power as well as have a safe place to store it.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman and my Illinois colleague,  John  Shimkus, for being a tireless advocate for making good on this  commitment.
