 Scott Franklin).    SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong  opposition to the rule and to H.R. 1319.   We do need targeted relief for those hurt by this pandemic, but this  is bad legislation. Republicans introduced over 250 amendments to this  nearly $2 trillion bill, and Democrats only ultimately accepted one.  That is not unity. This is merely socialism in sheep's clothing,  redistribution of wealth through cash payouts to many who have had no  financial impact whatsoever from COVID. It is also redistribution of  wealth from future generations who will be stuck with the tab.   The CBO predicts our economy will grow by 3.7 percent this year  without any further congressional action. With over $1 trillion in  unspent funds from previous packages, we can't afford to jeopardize our  children's future with this socialist spending spree. I urge a ``no''  vote.
