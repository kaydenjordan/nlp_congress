 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 268, currently under consideration.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, while President Trump continues to keep our government  shut down, House Democrats are committed to working for the American  people. I am pleased to present legislation today that helps meet the  urgent needs of our fellow Americans affected by recent national  disasters.   Across the country, we have watched as hurricanes have pummeled  Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas; wildfires have burned large swaths  of the West; volcanoes have erupted in Hawaii; and typhoons have struck  territories in the Pacific. In addition to the tragic loss of life,  families have lost everything. Businesses have been upended.  Communities have been ripped apart.   This legislation attempts to meet these needs with $12.14 billion in  emergency spending. It includes $2.96 billion to rebuild damaged  infrastructure to help communities rebuild and to bring local economies  back to life.   The legislation embraces the unique needs of farmers and rural  communities, providing $1.86 billion to help them recover.   It enhances our national security and cares for our veterans and  their families by funding $1.46 billion for repairs and rebuilding of  damaged Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs  facilities.   The bill before us meets the complex needs of disaster victims, with  $555 million for social services, mental healthcare, education, and  activities that improve the prospects of dislocated workers.   Importantly, and unlike Republican legislation that was brought up in  December, the bill meets the urgent healthcare and nutrition needs of  Americans in the Northern Marianas, Guam, American Samoa, and, yes,  Puerto Rico.   President Trump grossly mismanaged the response to Hurricane Maria in  Puerto Rico, and since then, he has added insult to injury by  repeatedly trying to shortchange our fellow U.S. citizens in Puerto  Rico. This bill rights that injustice.   Finally, this legislation recognizes scientific reality and the  simple fact that climate change is increasing the number and severity  of national disasters. It includes $2.54 billion in resiliency funding  to mitigate damage from future disasters, preventing loss of life and  damage to property.   We all want to ensure that American families and communities have the  resources they need to recover from recent national disasters.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

Madam Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Ohio.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Price), who is the chair-designee of the  Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Bishop).    Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentleman from Florida's  remarks, but I remind the gentleman that we can't deliver this  essential disaster aid with the government closed. So I suggest the  gentleman urge those who are keeping the government closed that we must  deliver this aid, so open the government now, and we can have some  adult conversation.   Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lee), who is a senior member of the Appropriations Committee.    Madam Chair, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), the chair designate of the Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the chair designate of the Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee  of Appropriations.     Mr. Chairman, before I introduce our next, I would like  to say to the distinguished gentleman from South Carolina: I agree with  the distinguished gentleman from South Carolina. Let's stop this  political game. Let's direct our remarks. Let's make clear that the  President has the responsibility to open this government and to do it  now.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Thompson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), the chairman of the Homeland Security  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the  U.S. Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, to allow Federal agencies to begin the vital work that we  are funding in this bill, we must reopen the Federal Government.   I am pleased that the bill before us includes a continuing resolution  to immediately reopen the Federal Government and pay Federal employees,  who are going through such a difficult time taking care of their  families, putting food on the table, just going through the normal,  normal time that families have to endure when they don't have any money  to spend. This would pay Federal employees through February 8.                                time  1515    This continuing resolution ensures the Federal Government is working  for the American people, provides certainty for Federal employees, and  gives President Trump and the Congress time to negotiate on border  security and immigration policy.   Mr. Chairman, this legislation is a critical first step to meeting  our fellow citizens' urgent needs as they recover from recent  disasters, so I urge my colleagues: Join me in support of this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Madam Speaker, in fact, I am not even sure I heard  correctly. Trump, the President, opposes the dollar amount in the bill  because the only emergency is building the wall? Did I hear that  correctly, my friends?   Madam Speaker, this shutdown, frankly, has gone on long enough.  Perhaps, my good friends don't know the people who are suffering, who  are living paycheck to paycheck and who have to worry about taking care  of their kids. It is really puzzling to me that a statement like that  is being made tonight.   My friends, this shutdown has gone on long enough. This motion to  recommit would only further prolong the shutdown and the suffering and  the people who are really victims of this action.   The bill we are voting on today is very similar to the same package  that my Republican colleagues voted on back on December 21.   H.R. 268 provides disaster relief to those communities affected by  hurricanes, wildfires, typhoons, other natural disasters, and it funds  the entire government through February 8. In fact, this package  provides even more relief to those disaster-affected communities  following the adoption of the bipartisan and Republican amendments here  today. The only component that is not in this package that my friends  on the other side of the aisle voted for in December is the President's  wall money.   So, to use this MTR to further delay the government, this doesn't  make any sense to me at all, because this package being delayed is  unconscionable. Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues  to oppose the motion to recommit, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
