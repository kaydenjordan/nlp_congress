 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in staunch support of the bipartisan  Secure Equipment Act of 2021.   Hoosiers back home in my home State of Indiana rely heavily on  telecom companies to connect them with the critical services they need,  particularly healthcare through telehealth. When foreign adversaries,  like Communist China, try to prey upon these companies, they are in  turn attempting to prey upon hardworking Americans like my  constituents. That is why I am proud today to join my colleagues in  supporting this vital legislation that would ensure the Federal  Government prevents any further Chinese state-backed equipment from  being used here in the United States.   This bill is vital to our national security, and I urge my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle to support it.
