 Madam President, I am pleased to join my friend, the  senior Senator from Alabama, Chairman Shelby, as we prepare to debate  the second set of appropriations bills to reach the Senate floor this  session. Senator Shelby has noted that this is a change in recent  years. I commend him, and I commend both Republicans and Democrats who  have worked together in the way we used to and now are again. This  minibus contains four important bills for fiscal year 2019: the  Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies bill; the Financial  Services and General Government bill; the Agriculture, Rural  Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies bill;  and the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development and Related  Agencies bills.   Now, that was something significant to be on the Senate floor in past  years. What is even more significant--and Chairman Shelby would agree  with me--each of these bills was reported by the Appropriations  Committee unanimously. Every Republican, every Democrat voted for them.  They fund programs that provide important services to the American  people across the country. They invest in the future of this country.   Let me take one example, the Agriculture appropriations bill. This  bill is a win for farmers, for families, and for rural communities  through its investments in rural development, housing, food, nutrition,  agriculture, research, and clean water programs. Every State in this  Nation--yours, Chairman Shelby's, and everybody else's, and of course  my own State of Vermont--has rural communities and farm economies that  benefit from these important programs, every one of us does.   The Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development bill will make  critical infrastructure investments across the country and, of course,  also in my home State of Vermont. It includes $10 billion in new  funds--new funds--to help address our crumbling bridges and railways  and roads. Let me just say, if I might be parochial for a moment, what  that means in Vermont. It will help invest in safety improvements on  Amtrak's Vermonter and Ethan Allen lines but also will make much needed  repairs to our railroads and bridges. These increases in every one of  our States are a direct result of the bipartisan budget deal reached  earlier this year, and they are critically needed.   I have been here for over 40 years. What Senator Shelby and I have  done is we have brought the Senate back to the way it used to be to  actually get things done with Republicans and Democrats working  together.   Improving the Nation's infrastructure was one of President Trump's  key campaign promises. Unfortunately, he criticized the very budget  deal that made these increases possible. He proposed cutting--not  increasing--funding  [[Page S5231]]  for infrastructure programs that this bill supports. I am glad to say,  again, that Republicans and Democrats came together on appropriations  and took a different path. This bill also protects key investments in  affordable housing and community development programs, such as HOME and  CDBG. That is crucial funding that communities leverage to construct,  rehabilitate, and maintain affordable housing. This is housing that is  desperately needed across America--certainly in my State of Vermont--to  shelter families, but it also promotes economic mobility and stability.   The Interior bill makes critical investments in programs to help  ensure we have clean water to drink and clean air to breathe. I can't  think of any State in the country that doesn't want clean water and  doesn't want clean air.   It also supports important conservation programs, including support  for our national parks. Our national parks attract millions of visitors  each year. What a treasure, allowing families to come and see such an  important part of America. I think it is quite in the tradition of  Teddy Roosevelt and others who had supported such parks, but it also  has the Forest Legacy Program and the Land and Water Conservation Fund.  The Land and Water Conservation Fund is going to be beneficial for  Vermont, New York, and, truly, the whole northeast region. The bill  continues our commitment to regional efforts to protect, restore, and  preserve Lake Champlain, the largest body of fresh water in the United  States outside of the Great Lakes.    I am pleased to report that the committee rejected the misguided cuts  to the Environmental Protection Agency proposed by the administration  that would have set back the progress we have made in recent decades to  preserve our environment not just for ourselves but for future  generations.   Finally, the Financial Services bill helps to support small  businesses and local economies through the Small Business Development  Centers Program and other related programs. Every one of us knows that  small businesses and local economies make up the strength of our  States.   It also funds regulatory agencies that U.S. citizens rely on to  protect them from unfair, unsafe, or fraudulent business practices,  like the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade  Commission, which protect consumers. Yet we were able to reach consent  to consider such a broad package of bills in the Senate.   This is a broad cross section of issues, and every one of us had  different views. With the vast array of issues here, every one of the  100 Senators here, if writing this legislation by himself or herself,  may include something different or something else, and, then, of  course, we would have nothing. Instead, Republicans and Democrats came  together. I think a lot of this comes from the direct result of the  Shelby-Leahy-McConnell-Schumer commitment to move forward on a  bipartisan basis.   Senator Shelby and I met with the two leaders and said we wanted to  do that. We wanted to actually show the Nation that the Senate can  work, and we did it at spending levels agreed to in the bipartisan  budget deal. We rejected new poison pill riders from the right and the  left or controversial authorizing legislation.   We will all have issues about which we care deeply, but we had to  come together on what is in the best interests of the country, and,  frankly, as a Senator for almost 44 years, it was in the best interests  of the Senate.   I think Senator Shelby would agree with me that achieving this goal  of reporting strong, bipartisan bills took considerable restraint on  both sides of the aisle, but that restraint is what is required to get  these bills through the Senate. But I worry that the House is  proceeding on a different path. They have passed partisan bills filled  with poison pill riders that cannot and will not pass the Senate.   Funding the government is one of our most basic constitutional  responsibilities. If you go across this country, you will find that the  American people expect us to work together. They expect us to reach  across the aisle and to reach agreement on these bills. The programs  funded in these bills make a real difference in the American people's  lives, and they shouldn't be held hostage to unrelated partisan policy  fights. So I hope that when we get to conference on these bills, the  House will reverse and do their work in a bipartisan fashion for the  benefit of all Americans--not just Republicans, not just Democrats, but  all Americans.   I especially want to thank Chairman Shelby for his partnership on  these bills. I also thank the chairs and ranking members of each of the  subcommittees. If they hadn't been willing to work and cooperate  together, we wouldn't have these four bills before us. Again, I note  that they went through unanimously. We had reached a point where some  thought that we couldn't get unanimous agreement in the Senate that the  sun rises in the east. Maybe we couldn't, but we did get unanimous  agreement here, and thank goodness.   Madam President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I appreciate what the distinguished senior  Senator from Illinois just said. I will speak about the same amendment.  We will be offering this amendment. It does provide $250 million for  State election security grants. It provides it to protect our upcoming  elections from attacks by Russia especially but from many other hostile  foreign powers.   We don't do this as an exercise. We know the attacks have been there  in the past, and they are coming in the future. Look at what our  intelligence community said. They unanimously said that Russia  interfered in our 2016 election.   After the intelligence community unanimously said they interfered,  Congress came together, and we appropriated $380 million for State  election security grants in the fiscal year 2018 omnibus.   Since that time, all 55 eligible States and territories have  requested funding. One hundred percent of these funds have been  committed to the States. As of yesterday, 90 percent of the funds have  been disbursed to the States. This is pretty remarkable considering  that the fiscal year 2018 omnibus was signed into law just 4 months  ago.   I have asked what the funding was used for. I am told it has assisted  States in improving election cyber security. They have replaced  outdated election equipment. They have undertaken other anti-cyber  efforts.   That is an important first step. I know all of us do not want our  democracy attacked by foreign aggression. More is needed. It is  certainly needed before the November 2018 elections--I might say even  afterward.   States need postelection audit systems. They have to be able to  verify the accuracy of the final vote tally. They have to be able to  upgrade election-related computer systems if our Department of Homeland  Security identifies vulnerabilities. I believe the State and local  election officials should undergo cyber security training. They should  start using established cyber security best practices. These efforts  are all essential to the security of our elections, and my amendment  would enable them to go forward. In fact, yesterday, 21 State attorneys  general signed a letter. They urged Congress to appropriate more  funding for the States to help them meet their security needs.   Let me quote from their letter. They said:         Additional funding for voter infrastructure will not only       allow states to upgrade the election systems, but will also       allow for a comprehensive security risk assessment.       Unfortunately, past practice has shown that the existing       Election Assistance Commission grants are simply insufficient       to provide for the upgraded technology needed. More funding       is essential to adequately equip states for the financial       resources we need to safeguard our democracy and protect the       data of voting members in our states.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record,  at the conclusion of my remarks, a letter, dated July 23, 2018, signed  by 21 State attorneys general.   Mr. President, it is clear that Congress--this involves everybody in  the Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike--must serve as a bulwark  against Russian aggression. I say this because our President has, time  and again, proven he is either unable or unwilling to do so. Standing  on the world stage with Vladimir Putin, with everybody watching,  President Trump repeatedly refused to condemn Russia's attacks on our  democracy. He almost groveled to the authoritarian Putin. He praised  and defended Putin's ``strong denial'' of Russian interference. Then,  to make it worse, President Trump attacked our own law enforcement  institutions while standing feet away from the very foe our  institutions work so hard to protect us from.   All of our intelligence communities and law enforcement have the  sworn  [[Page S5246]]  duty to protect all Americans from foes like Russia. The President  stands next to the President of Russia and attacks the same law  enforcement institutions that protect us.   This brought about, not unexpectedly, bipartisan outrage over the  Helsinki fiasco. The next day, the President tried to walk back his  comments. But in typical fashion, he tried to have it both ways. He  repeated the baseless claim that the attack ``could be other people  also.'' Then, the very next day, when asked whether Russia is still  targeting the United States, the President inexplicably said, ``No.''  That was roughly 48 hours after his own Director of National  Intelligence issued a statement reaffirming that Russia is engaged in  ``ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy.'' Without  going into any of the classified material--just go by what our  intelligence agencies have said publicly. Russia is engaged in  ``ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy.'' And when the  President is asked whether they are targeting the United States, the  answer isn't no, it is yes.    Some have argued that this is an issue for the States to deal with  entirely on their own, that the Federal Government should not involve  itself in States' electoral systems. But our States were attacked in  2016 by a foreign adversary, and their election systems were hacked by  Russia's foreign military intelligence service.   If any one of our States was attacked by a foreign government, would  we stand by and say: Well, that is the State's problem. No. We wouldn't  say: Well, it is not my State, it is not my problem. You are on your  own. Of course not. An attack on any one of us is an attack on all of  us. We are the United States of America. We would come together to  protect that State. We would provide the Federal resources to help them  out. That is what we Americans do. The same standard applies here in  helping States strengthen and protect their election infrastructure.   We Senators from both parties have a choice: We either heed the fact- based warnings of our dedicated law enforcement and national security  professionals or we do as President Trump has done and say: Well, we  will take Vladimir Putin at his word. I don't. We either choose to act  as a coequal branch of government to defend our democracy or leave that  responsibility to a President who doesn't see the threat. In fact, he  embraces the threat even when it is standing right beside him.   I say to my fellow Senators, if you believe that Russia is fully  intent on destabilizing our democracy yet again in November, which is  something every one of our national security and law enforcement  officials believes--the people who read all the classified matters  every single day, the people who know our intelligence backward and  forward believe Russia is fully intent on destabilizing our democracy-- let's stand up for our country. Let's stand up for our intelligence  services and have this amendment as a chance to take action--more than  anything else, to stand up for America, stand up for our democracy.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                               State of New Mexico,                                  Office of the Attorney General,                                        Santa Fe, NM, July 23, 2018.      Chairman Michael McCaul,      House Homeland Security Committee,      Washington, DC.      Chairman Roy Blunt,      Senate Rules and Administration Committee, Washington, DC.        Dear Honorable Committee Members: The undersigned Attorneys       General write to express our grave concern over the threat to       the integrity of the American election system. As the latest       investigations and indictments make clear, during the 2016       election, hackers within Russia's military intelligence       service not only targeted state and local election boards,       but also successfully invaded a state election website to       steal the sensitive information of approximately 500,000       American voters and infiltrated a company that supplies       voting software across the United States.        The allegations in these indictments are extremely       troubling. They evidence technologically vulnerable election       infrastructures and the existence of a malicious foreign       actor eager to exploit these vulnerabilities. Moreover, it       has never been more important to maintain confidence in our       democratic voting process. It is imperative that we protect       the integrity of our elections. We must ensure that the       upcoming 2018 midterm elections are secure and untainted.       Accordingly, we ask for your assistance in shoring up our       systems so that we may protect our elections from foreign       attacks and interference by:        Prioritizing and acting on election-security legislation.       We understand that the Secure Elections Act (S.2261) is       before the Senate at this time and may address some of our       concerns.        Increasing funding for the Election Assistance Commission       to support election security improvements at the state level       and to protect the personal data of the voters of our states.       We are concerned that many states lack the resources and       tools they need to protect the polls. Additional funding for       voting infrastructure will not only allow states to upgrade       election systems, but will also allow for a comprehensive       security risk assessment. Unfortunately, past practice has       shown that the existing Election Assistance Commission grants       are simply insufficient to provide for the upgraded       technology needed. More funding is essential to adequately       equip states with the financial resources we need to       safeguard our democracy and protect the data of voting       members in our states.        Supporting the development of cybersecurity standards for       voting systems to prevent potential future foreign attacks.       It is critical that there be a combined effort between       governments and security experts to protect against the       increased cyber threats posed by foreign entities seeking to       weaken our institutions.        These changes are essential in order to strengthen public       trust in our electoral system. The integrity of the nation's       voting infrastructure is a bipartisan issue, and one that       affects not only the national political landscape, but       elections at the state, county, municipal, and local levels.       It is our hope that you agree, and will take swift action to       protect our national legacy of fair and free elections.            Respectfully,          Hector Balderas, Attorney General of New Mexico; George             Jepsen, Attorney General of Connecticut; Karl Racine,             Attorney General for the District of Columbia; Lisa             Madigan, Attorney General of Illinois; Janet Mills,             Attorney General of Maine; Maura Healy, Attorney             General of Massachusetts; Lori Swanson, Attorney             General of Minnesota; Gurbir Grewal, Attorney General             of New Jersey; Josh Stein, Attorney General of North             Carolina; Peter F. Kilmartin, Attorney General of Rhode             Island; Bob Ferguson, Attorney General of Washington;             Xavier Becerra, Attorney General of California; Matthew             P. Denn, Attorney General of Delaware; Russell Suzuki,             Attorney General of Hawaii; Thomas J. Miller, Attorney             General of Iowa; Brian Frosh, Attorney General of             Maryland; Bill Schuette, Attorney General of Michigan;             Jim Hood, Attorney General of Mississippi; Barbara D.             Underwood, Attorney General of New York; Ellen             Rosenblum, Attorney General of Oregon; Mark R. Herring,             Attorney General of Virginia.     Mr. President, I don't know whether there are others  seeking the floor. I was going to suggest the absence of a quorum, but  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Minnesota, and I yield to  her.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Bob Ross, a  detailee from the Department of Agriculture; Ramsay Eyre, an intern at  the Appropriations Committee; and Olivia Harris, an intern in my  personal office, be granted floor privileges for the length of the  current debate on H.R. 6147, an act making appropriations for the  Department of the Interior, environment, and related agencies for the  fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes.
