 Madam Speaker, I rise today because I am frustrated. I  came here to work--to work across the aisle and get things done.  Rightwing extremists are preventing us from doing our most important  job, passing a budget. It is catastrophic for our country, our  community, and our economy if extremist Republicans shut down our  government.   Let me be clear. Kentuckians cannot afford a shutdown. There are  119,884 Kentucky moms and babies who will lose access to vital  nutrition assistance. Nearly 556,000 SNAP recipients will lose access  to their benefits in a prolonged shutdown, and 10,672 Federal civilian  workers in my district could be furloughed or have to work without pay.  These are real consequences to Republicans' harmful actions.   Pass a spending bill. It is our job. When you are done playing  political games, we are ready to work together to avoid a disastrous  shutdown.                            ____________________
