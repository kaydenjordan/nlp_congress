 Madam Speaker, I am here today to share a bittersweet  message. Over 6 years ago, I interviewed Ms. Lauren Ziegler for the job  of legislative assistant. I saw something rare and special in Lauren,  and she proved it from her very first day on the job.   As my colleagues will attest, Capitol Hill is overflowing with many  talented people, but few possess the ability to do it all and to do it  well and to do it with a smile, and that sums up Lauren Ziegler.   Lauren rose from a junior L.A. position to become our legislative  director and our deputy chief of staff. However, for me, her most  significant role has been as one of my most trusted advisers. In truth,  I can think of no one who has better advised me over the years.   From day one, Lauren understood that our number one mission was to  serve the needs and the interests of the good people of the Texas 36th  Congressional District. I have received countless compliments from  folks in Texas and here in Washington regarding the quality of her  work. Frankly, I am shocked that no other office stole Lauren away from  us. I am sure many have tried.                                time  1015    Lauren's loyalty was true to the Babin team. She has served us and  Texas' 36th District with all of her heart. For that, we are very  grateful.   Lauren's heart belongs to the Sunshine State. She will be returning  home to Florida soon to continue serving our Nation in a different  capacity at NASA's Kennedy Space Center.   I have no doubt that, at NASA, Lauren Ziegler's rare and special  qualities will contribute to their abilities to break barriers, explore  the unknown, and send mankind back to the Moon and to places that we  have never been before. I look forward to watching her future unfold  down in Florida.   I hope that Lauren will look back on her time here in Washington with  as much fondness for us as we have for her.  [[Page H1533]]    Lauren, you will always be part of Team Babin and an honorary member  of the Babin family. I am very proud of you, and I am very proud to  have been part of your history. Thank you for a job well done.   God bless.                            ____________________
