 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 79, the Helping Angels  Lead Our Startups Act. This bill, under the guise of helping angel  groups attract additional investors for small businesses and startups,  would alter the balance between capital formation and investor  protection that we sought to achieve in the JOBS Act.   Let me remind my colleagues of what we did in the wake of the  financial crisis when bank lending was scarce. Our Nation's startups  had trouble getting off the ground and attracting new capital.  Previously, they had done so using rule 506, which allows companies to  sell private securities to accredited investors who are financially  savvy and have the means to bear their heightened risks and lack of SEC  oversight. As a condition to using rule 506, however, companies could  not solicit purchasers from or advertise to the general public.                                time  1415    This condition was viewed as a barrier to capital formation for  startups. Therefore, Democrats worked with Republicans to provide  companies in the JOBS Act with an alternative so that they could  broadly advertise and solicit new investors.   Recognizing the need to balance investor protection with this  expansion, Ranking Member Waters offered an amendment requiring  companies to take reasonable steps to verify that the ultimate  purchaser was an accredited investor. This verification requirement is  a necessary investor protection designed to prevent unsophisticated  investors from purchasing--either accidentally or by fraudulent means-- risky, illiquid, and lightly regulated Rule 506 securities.  [[Page H260]]    I would remind my Republican colleagues that this amendment was  agreed to unanimously, in part because the amended provision struck the  appropriate balance between capital formation and investor protection.  Nevertheless, here we are today seeking to alter it in H.R. 79.   This bill would remove the verification requirement and allow  companies to broadly solicit and advertise their private stock at any  event sponsored by a college, nonprofit, government organization, angel  investor group, or other group. That means that America's college  students can walk into an event on campus and be talked into buying  stock that they don't understand and may not ever be able to sell.  Having created this initial relationship, the company can then sell the  students stock without ever checking if they are accredited investors.   What is more, the bill would make it much easier for fraudsters to  swindle unsophisticated investors by, for example, encouraging the  unsophisticated investors to buy stock in a fake or failing company,  only to sell off their own stock at artificially inflated prices.   Republicans claim that the bill is merely a clarification; that these  demo days are not merely solicitations or advertisements in and of  themselves and can be used by companies to generally discuss investment  opportunities along with their products and services with the general  public. But that is not the case.   Companies can already go to a broadly advertised, widely attended  demo day and discuss their businesses and not implicate the securities  laws if they don't offer securities for sale or otherwise condition the  market for their security, but the bill would allow them to offer  securities or condition the market by describing the type and amount of  stock they are offering, the intended use of the proceeds, or any of  the other information in subsection (a)(4) of the bill.   Therefore, today, a company discussing such information would have  two options: one, to ensure that the event is limited to persons with  whom they or the event organizer has a preexisting, substantive  relationship or have been contacted through an informal personal  network; or two, verify at the time of purchase that their investors  are accredited by, for example, looking at bank statements, W-2s, or  third-party verification letters.   The bill would allow companies to avoid both options and broadly  advertise their stock, solicit purchases from the general public, and  never check to make sure they are financially sophisticated, accredited  investors. The only limitation--that the stock offerings only be at  events sponsored by certain groups--does not provide a meaningful  investor protection. Phony private universities or nonprofits that may  be guilty of fraud themselves can hardly be held accountable for  policing it in stock offerings.   So rather than clarify existing law and preserve the compromise we  struck in the JOBS Act, H.R. 79 provides a potential loophole that is  overbroad and harmful to investors.   Mr. Chairman, I am even more troubled that Republicans have brought  this bill and another Financial Services Committee bill to the floor  this week without a hearing or a committee markup. In fact, there are  10 new Republican Members and 4 new Democratic Members on our committee  that have never even considered this bill.   Collectively, they represent millions of Americans that are being  denied the right to better understand this legislation. It is deeply  troubling that Republicans have decided to use their newfound power to  rush through changes under cover of night without the benefits of an  open, public process.   For these reasons, I oppose H.R. 79.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.     Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, both Democrats and Republicans want to help facilitate  capital formation, particularly for groups such as angel investors, who  have substantial experience in the private securities market, and for  small companies like startups who are seeking funding to innovate and  grow. But as Members of Congress, we also have the responsibility to  protect investors and ensure that the rules of the road are reasonable  and appropriate. This is especially important for retail investors,  those of us who are looking to save for retirement or to buy a house or  to support our children's education.   That is what concerns me about the bill we have before us today. We  cannot create loopholes in the securities laws that could have a  serious negative impact on Americans' nest eggs, so we must strike the  right balance between capital formation in our securities markets and  investor protection.   It is with these goals in mind that Democrats supported the current  rules in place. Companies can raise money to grow and support their  businesses in our securities markets under the purview of the SEC and  State regulators. The regulatory framework we have set up allows for  different activities and oversight depending on the nature of the  security offering.   For example, public offerings provide robust information to investors  about the risks and rewards of a particular securities purchase. They  require the SEC or State securities regulator to preapprove and review  an offering, and they provide legal recourse to investors that may be  deceived. This is a strong regulatory framework that ensures our  markets are safe and sound. In exchange for complying with these rules,  companies can advertise and sell their stock to anyone in the general  public.   On the other hand, private offerings do not come with the same  regulatory requirements and protections, which can make it easier and  less costly for firms to raise money. This means less information for  investors, less legal recourse, and little to no scrutiny by  regulators. So we put in place procedures to ensure these private  offerings, which are inherently riskier, are only sold to accredited  investors.   Private offerings now play a significant role in the market.  Unregistered securities have surpassed registered securities in terms  of capital formation. They have accounted for more than $2 trillion in  new capital. Moreover, $71 billion has been raised since 2012 through  the general solicitation and advertising exemption that we put in place  in the JOBS Act. This is clearly an important and growing segment of  our market, and, as such, I believe we need to be even more cautious  about who is participating in it.   In fact, the SEC's Investor Advisory Committee said we should do  more, not less, to protect investors in the general solicitation and  advertising market for private offerings. They think we don't have  enough guardrails in place. And yet this bill would do the opposite, by  expanding the exemptions on general solicitation without similarly  protecting the investor.   The bill also undercuts an important amendment Ranking Member Waters  offered to the JOBS Act, which was approved unanimously. It required  companies to verify that the purchaser is an accredited investor and is  financially sophisticated enough to bear the risks involved in private  offerings. By effectively allowing purchasers to ``self-certify'' at or  after demo days sponsored by certain groups, the bill could open the  door to financial ruin for a retail investor who may not have  understood the consequences of his or her investment. So I oppose this  bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee for Ms. Waters'  amendment to improve H.R. 79.    Mr. Chair, I move for the adoption of the amendment. This  amendment, combined with Velazquez amendment, if adopted, would ensure  that the bill strikes the appropriate balance between capital formation  and investor protection.   First, the Waters amendment would prohibit event sponsors from  collecting finders' fees for connecting potential investors to  companies. This prohibition helps ensure that event sponsors, including  colleges, nonprofits, and trade associations, don't have perverse  incentives to drum up sales of stock.   Second, the Waters amendment would require the company selling  securities to be a company operating in the real economy, not a hedge  fund, shell company, or company going through bankruptcy. Not only does  this provision protect investors from purchasing shares of an opaque or  speculative firm, but it also ensures that the bill is targeted to  provide relief to our Nation's startups and small businesses.   These two provisions are commonsense changes that I hope will receive  bipartisan support. I move for the adoption of the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, just in closing, let me say that, again, this  amendment will bring some balance to the legislature and ensure that  the bill is targeted to provide relief to our Nation's startup and  small businesses, and I urge its adoption.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
