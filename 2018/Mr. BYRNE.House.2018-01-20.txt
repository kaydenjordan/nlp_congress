 Mr. Speaker, this is a shame. It is a shame that we find  ourselves in this position all because Senate Democrats think they can  hold the Federal Government hostage until they get their way on  immigration issues. There is no way around it.                                time  1645    That is exactly what is happening here. A majority in the House and a  majority in the Senate have voted to prevent this shutdown and keep the  government open.                                Point of Order     Mr. Speaker, where was I before my poster of Senator  Schumer was ruled in order? Oh, yes, government shutdowns have  devastating implications on so many different areas, especially when it  comes to our Nation's military.   All Active-Duty military personnel will come to work, but they cannot  be paid. Critical maintenance operations and training that are not  directly related to ongoing military operations are forced to stop, all  because of the Schumer shutdown.   Mr. Speaker, the government funding bill in question also includes 6  years of funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as  ALL Kids in Alabama, but Minority Leader Pelosi recently said that the  efforts to fund the government and fund CHIP are like a bowl of doggy- doo. I can assure the minority leader that funding for ALL Kids in  Alabama isn't doggy-doo to the over 150,000 children in my State who  receive insurance through the program.   Mr. Speaker, I have a message to my colleagues in the Senate: Enough  is enough.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.    Stop with these political stunts that put our military at  risk. Stop with the reckless antics that create uncertainty for  families across the country. Stop playing to the resistance base.   Stop with the games, and let's get our Federal Government back open  for business.   Enough is enough.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage adoption of this rule, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
