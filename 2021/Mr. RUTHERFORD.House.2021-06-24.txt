 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Edward Burr  and the Monique Burr Foundation for Children located in northeast  Florida.   Established in 1997, the Monique Burr Foundation works to prevent  abuse, bullying, cyberbullying, exploitation, and human trafficking of  children.   They have trained more than 5,000 facilitators in schools all across  67 Florida counties, 28 other States, and 3 foreign countries.   Madam Speaker, as the former sheriff of Duval County, I can  personally attest to the difference the Monique Burr Foundation is  making in the lives of children across Florida and across our country.   Recently, Mr. Burr received the Hearthstone BUILDER Humanitarian  Award in recognition of his decades of public service to support and  protect children in need.   On behalf of the Fourth Congressional District of Florida, I  congratulate Edward Burr for his well-deserved honor, and I thank the  Monique Burr Foundation for Children for their excellent work in our  community.                            ____________________
