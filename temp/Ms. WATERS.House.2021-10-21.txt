 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on my Special Order, and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, last month, the House Financial Services  Committee Democrats unanimously passed the housing title of the Build  Back Better Act to provide $327 billion in critical investments needed  to affordably house America and invest in neighborhoods across the  country.   With the inclusion of my committee's housing title, the Build Back  Better Act will create over 3 million affordable and accessible homes.  It will fully address the needed repairs in public housing so residents  can safely live in their homes with dignity.   It will help an estimated 750,000 households afford their rent or  exit homelessness through expanded housing choice vouchers. It will  address the racial wealth gap by helping first-generation home buyers  access homeownership. These investments will help the schoolteacher  experiencing homelessness; the children exposed to lead and other  harmful toxins in their homes; the elderly neighbor who can't afford  their prescription medications on a fixed income because the rent and  mortgage is too high; the millennial who cannot rely on the bank of mom  and dad for a downpayment to purchase their first home; and the  millions of families that hang in the balance of imminent eviction or  foreclosure due to the pandemic.   Just today, my committee heard from several witnesses on the  importance of the housing choice voucher program and how  transformational it can be for a family to receive this assistance.  Harvard Professor Raj Chetty testified about his research showing that  children whose families received a housing choice voucher to move to  low-poverty neighborhoods later in life earned 30 percent more than  children who remained in high-poverty neighborhoods. Another witness  testified about how the voucher program helps his clients escape  homelessness and achieve housing stability.    Housing is at the center of every household's economic stability and  our Nation's prosperity. Without these investments in resilient,  healthy, accessible, and fair housing, the Build Back Better Act will  not improve the lives of families across the country, as we have  promised it will.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to try, in the best way that I possibly can,  to describe what is happening in the Congress of the United States of  America. This build back mission, this act, is the vision of the  President of the United States of America. President Biden has taken  the leadership for job creation. He has taken the leadership to deal  with some of the equity issues in this country. He has taken the  leadership to do everything that can be done to ensure that we invest  in the human potential of the citizens of this country.   He is doing everything that he can to deal with the pandemic, and he  is unearthing and revealing the softness in our economy, in our  society, prior to that pandemic, and this is difficult work. This is  not easy.   Of course, eventually, we had to deal with the fact that we have some  who were resisting the mission of the President to build back better.   At one point in time, I know there was some talk about a $600  trillion bill. And, of course, we have heard most about a $327 trillion  bill. So at this point in time, we don't have the cooperation in order  to realize the President's mission and vision about what it takes in  order to support the citizens of this country in a way that will help  to change their lives.   However, this is transformative. This is the kind of legislation that  the President of the United States has developed and worked with  because he  [[Page H5785]]  understands what it takes to strengthen the economy, to create jobs, to  open up opportunities, to deal with rental assistance, and all of these  issues.   Unfortunately, there are two members of the Democratic Party on the  Senate side who do not agree. It has taken us a long time to understand  what it is they want, what it is they don't want. But in the final  analysis, they do not, at this point in time, support the President's  vision.   However, those of us who chair committees worked very hard on our  portion of the Build Back Better Act. I, as the chair of the Financial  Services Committee, worked very hard with our staff in order to  identify what is absolutely needed in order to support housing in a  real way in this country. Housing issues that have been disregarded,  that have not been paid attention to, housing issues that have gone  unattended to for so many years, in that, of course, we dealt with  public housing and the fact that they were in great disrepair, and they  needed the resources necessary to fix those elevators; in order to get  the lead out of the paint; in order to make sure that the stairways are  safe.   I am reminded of the fact that Ms. Velazquez from New York called me  from one of the public housing developments last winter when there was  no heat in the entire development.   So this money is desperately needed for the capital investments that  we need to do in public housing. But not only do we deal with public  housing, we deal with the fact that there are people who work every day  but cannot afford the rents. We deal with people who are paying 50  percent of their income for rent. We deal with people who are on the  ground in makeshift tents every day, homeless all over America.   One of the issues that has become very important to me is the choice  voucher issue. So in addition to the $80 billion that we advocated for  public housing, there is another $90 billion that we advocated for the  vouchers. This includes not only choice vouchers. It includes project- based vouchers so that we can develop more affordable units.   Of course, we recognized what the cities wanted, what they have been  dealing with, and what they believe will improve their ability to  assist those who are trying to get safely housed. That is the HOME  program that the cities love. That is the CDBG program and those  programs we funded. In addition to that, I want you to know that Barney  Frank and I worked for years in order to come up with the National  Housing Trust Fund. So we had $36 billion that we put into that.   Now, given that we don't know what the top line is in the Build Back  Better Act, and we don't know exactly whether or not our Senators on  the opposite side--on the Democratic side or the opposite side--will  honor this vision and this leadership of the President. So without  knowing what the top line is, we know that probably we are all going to  have to take cuts in all the areas that we have worked so hard for.   I am certainly prepared to accept our share of that responsibility. I  know that cuts have to be made, but they have to be made fairly. And so  there was a rumor that there was going to be zero dollars advocated to  these choice vouchers and project-based vouchers, and, of course, that  made me very unhappy. That caused me to have great concern. I have been  working, organizing press conferences, working with the advocates,  working with academicians and everybody to help the administration and  everybody else understand that we cannot do without adequate vouchers  for the people who are in such desperate need of rental assistance.   Everywhere all over the United States, particularly in Black and  Brown communities, people have been waiting for years to be able to get  these vouchers. And so we have a time now by which we are going to be  funding some of what is needed in housing, and at the top of my list  are the vouchers.   I want everybody to know that I have been talking with members of our  Caucus and I have been talking with members of the Congressional Black  Caucus. We are not backing away from getting a substantial number of  vouchers funded. I am not going to back away. I am not going to be shy  about it.   As a matter of fact, I will let the world know that I and others that  I have organized will not vote for any bill that does not have a  substantial number of vouchers in it so that we can deal with the  longstanding issues of a lack of decent and safe and secure housing in  our communities.    I don't need to say any more. All I need to let people know is, I am  fair. I accept cuts across many of these areas that I have worked so  hard for, but I do not want my number one issue in all of this housing  to be undermined, neglected. And I do not want the people of our  districts who expect their government to come to their aid when they  are coming to the aid of others in so many ways--and I respect the fact  that in our Caucus and in the Progressive Caucus, we have about five  different kinds of interests that we want to see supported. I, tonight,  am talking about housing. But I respect the agenda of the Progressive  Caucus and the five areas that they have identified. But for me,  housing is number one.   I will now call on those who are participating this evening.   I yield to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Cleaver), who is also my  friend and chair of the Financial Services Committee's Subcommittee on  Housing, Community Development and Insurance.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Torres), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Green), who is also the Chair of the Financial Services Committee's  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Clarke).  [[Page H5787]]         Mr. Speaker, I believe our time has been exhausted. I  yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
