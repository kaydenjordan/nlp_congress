 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3624. The Republicans stand  ready to work with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  strengthen our public markets and increase opportunities for everyday  investors.   We know that robust capital markets give everyday investors the  opportunity to save for a first home, a child's college education, and  retirement. But instead of considering a bill that will grow the  economy and create jobs, we are using our floor time, a full  legislative day, in fact, to talk about where public company employees  are located; not foreign companies, but American public companies.   We are considering a bill that really should be part of a larger  bill. It shouldn't take up a full legislative day. It is two-and-a-half  pages of legislative text and does very little that it purports to do.   But here we are. We must ensure that public companies are properly  regulated and supervised to protect our capital markets for all  Americans. That is why companies are already required to provide  information to investors on risk exposure, material financial data, and  the company's financial condition. These reports help investors  determine whether they believe the company's value is worthy of  investment.   Unfortunately, Democrats are pursuing a partisan agenda of government  mandates that jeopardize economic opportunity for millions of middle- income Americans.   H.R. 3624 is just the latest in a series of partisan proposals  offered by committee Democrats to add nonfinancial disclosures to an  already thorough list of mandatory disclosures, and the effort is  really to pursue a political agenda or political interest rather than  economic interest.    These mandates add to a company's cost of compliance. And in some  cases, they can put lives at risk for people who are employed in  countries around the globe. They do not have an impact on the  underlying value of the firm, and most certainly will discourage  companies from going public.   Why the bill's sponsor wants companies to disclose where employees  reside is unclear. I know the title of the bill, but I don't see in the  contents of the bill anything related to the title of the bill. The  bill provides no context for this data.   In fact, during the hearing on this legislation, witnesses shared  that simply knowing that 1 percent of the company's workforce resides  in a particular State or abroad, does not explain whether American  workers hold these jobs or have moved between States or overseas for  work; whether some expertise or resource is central to that job that  cannot be found in the United States or cannot be found in the State or  another region of the country; or whether moving jobs overseas results  in cheaper products for the American consumer or more jobs here in the  United States.   Perhaps they are selling something to a foreign country. We don't  have that as a part of information here with this disclosure. The  information sought by H.R. 3624 would, at best, tell an incomplete  story and, at worst, could be deeply misleading.   The only plausible explanation for this bill is to use the  information to try to shame public companies based on incomplete and  misleading information. It is unclear to me how shaming a company  benefits the everyday investor, or encourages more companies to go  public, or brings more vibrant capital markets here in the United  States or creates jobs here in the United States.   How does shaming a company encourage more companies to go public? How  does shaming create more opportunities to save for retirement? How does  it enhance children's savings for college, or parents saving for their  children to go to college?   How does it build a brighter, more vibrant future for them  economically? In fact, we have yet this Congress to bring a bill to the  floor that would accomplish the goal of building retirement savings,  savings for a college education, or help with buying a first home.   We have yet to consider one bill that will grow the economy or  actually create jobs. We are falling behind China. We are falling  behind our economic competitors across the world when it comes to the  number of initial public offerings, the number of IPOs.   China has more IPOs than the United States in recent time. We need to  right this. I want to hear what my Democrat colleagues' solution is to  that issue; not just a messaging bill that we have here today of two- and-a-half pages of legislative text.                                time  0930    I urge my colleagues to listen to the American people. Let's get back  to the economic work that they need, given where we are in this  economic cycle. I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.  It does nothing that the title says that it does.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The bill does no such thing as the author just stated, Mr. Chair. It  gives a list of the numbers of employees in each State or territory in  the United States. It gives the number of employees in a country as a  matter of corporate disclosures.   If my friend wants to talk about accountability, a list of names is  not accountability, unless this is about the trial bar suing or it is  about naming and shaming companies for changing head counts in  different States or government intervening to say that you can't move  employees between States. It does not do the things that the author  states.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   While I agree with my colleague from New York's sartorial decisions,  we diverge here.   What I would say to my colleagues here in the Chamber is that we all  care about having more workers here in America. We do. A corporate  mandate on disclosing the number of employees does not actually do  that.   Having competitive regulations, having a competitive Tax Code,  competing around the globe for jobs here in the United States, winning  a trade war with the biggest competitor on the globe that we have--a  rising China--and having an eye to the competition we face globally is  the way we get American jobs here and keep them here.   Simply mandating something more on our companies and holding them  back and retraining them does not actually move us forward in the  globe. It doesn't. It doesn't actually get at the driving force of  this.   What I hear from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle is that  it seems like they do support our having a reset with our trade  relationship with China and that they do agree that we need to have a  new trading relationship with our biggest trading partners so we get  more jobs here. The unions support that concept. Republicans support  that concept. We should be able to have a bipartisan coalition to  support a better agenda on trade so that we have American jobs here.   My district has felt that intensely, with the loss of textile  manufacturing jobs. The way we brought them back is by competing: by  having better regulation, better tax rates, and more technological  innovation here in the United States. Now, we have more jobs than we  did 10 years ago in textiles in North Carolina. We have more jobs than  we did 10 years ago when it deals with furniture.   We can compete. We can do this smartly, and we can do it well. But  more corporate mandates and more expense burdens on public companies  does not lead to more public companies and does not lead to better  investments for pensioners, whether it is public pensions, union  pensions, or individual folks who want to save for their retirement.   What we have to do is think differently than just more mandates, more  regulation, and more burden.   No State has felt this type of challenge and dealt with it in a  competitive way than the State of Michigan.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  [[Page H8236]]  Huizenga), who is the lead Republican on the Investor Protection,  Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentleman from Michigan an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Chair, I am ready to close, if I may inquire if the  gentlewoman from California has any further speakers.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let us be clear: The bill we are considering right now has nothing to  do with outsourcing. This is a political talking point, not a piece of  legislation. It will not bring jobs back to the United States. The bill  is simply designed to create more opportunities for corporate activists  and the trial bar to name and shame companies.   What does this do for the American people? Nothing.   In contrast, the Republican Tax Cut and Jobs Act has brought more  jobs and greater payback to the United States.   Mr. Chair, our unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, so all this  economic gloom about outsourcing, we have been talking about  insourcing, bringing jobs back to the United States from overseas.   We have a President who has an aggressive trade agenda to make sure  that we have more jobs here in the United States instead of outsourcing  [[Page H8237]]  jobs through bad trade deals that we agree in a bipartisan way.   Bad trade deals have cost us jobs over the years, led by both  Republican and Democratic Presidents, unfortunately. So there is  bipartisan support here for better trade legislation, better trading  relationships. Let's focus on that.   The labor force participation rate is way up and continues to rise.  More people in the United States are entering the workforce than  leaving the workforce. The American people are reaping the benefits of  a strong economy.   If Democrats are serious about continuing to grow our economy and  create high-paying jobs, let's start passing bills that unleash  companies, not constrain them.   Let's help businesses grow, not discourage them from going public.  American businesses need resources, not mandates, to compete with our  biggest economic threat--China.   If my Democratic colleagues are not interested in growing our  economy, let's find other areas of common ground. We should pass bills  that help everyday Americans save for their retirement, for their  children's college education, or to buy their first home.   Let's help those workers who are putting together a couple of jobs  get full-time jobs.   Let's pass bipartisan legislation to help seniors access prescription  drugs.   Let's authorize the Defense Department and have a stronger national  defense by passing a bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act.   Unfortunately, this bill we are discussing today would do none of  those things; and we have spent the large majority of our week  discussing two small, tidy, but very vacuous, extraordinarily vacuous,  pieces of legislation that have consumed our week, legislatively.   We have a 2\1/2\ page bill that is the full bit of our business here  on a Friday, on a legislative day. We had a really meaningless,  vacuous, poorly designed bill yesterday that consumed a whole  legislative day as well. This is not the way we should be running  Congress.   I would like to reiterate: The Republicans stand ready to work with  our colleagues across the aisle on meaningful legislation that will  help the American people.   So let's vote this bill down. Let's not just agree with the political  talking point that is put into legislative text for political reasons.  Let's vote this down. Let's get to serious legislating and get done  with these empty bills and on with the work of the American people.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
