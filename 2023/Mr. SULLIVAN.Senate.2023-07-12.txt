 Mr. President, it is my favorite time of the week here  in the U.S. Senate. I like to come down on a regular basis and talk  about the Alaskan of the Week. The Alaskan of the Week can be someone  who is doing something great for their local community, their State,  their country. Maybe it is someone who is helping to actually save the  world. That is who we have today--someone who literally helped to save  the world.   Before we begin, I know we have some Alaskans in the Galleries here.  Today, the Boys & Girls Club is in town, and we have some of our great,  young leaders from my State who are here, and I am really glad to see  them. It is appropriate, I think, as some of the Boys & Girls Clubs'  awardees can probably be Alaskans of the Week soon, right?   But I always like to begin my Alaskan of the Week remarks by just  giving a little update of what is going on back home in Alaska. We are  having a great summer. It is actually a really cold summer for us. The  Sun is high in the sky. People are fishing. Tourists are flocking to  our State.   By the way, if you are watching on TV, come up to Alaska, and you  will have the best vacation of a lifetime, I guarantee it. The midnight  Sun is out, and the scenery is spectacular. Of course, we are a place  of big skies, big places, a big ocean, big rivers, some of the most  resilient, interesting, special people in the world, and some of the  most patriotic. We have more veterans per capita than any State in the  country.   I have the pleasure of frequently speaking about our veterans in  Alaska, about our military in Alaska. Many of them have been honored by  being Alaskans of the Week. That is going to happen again today with a  very special veteran, Elverda Lincoln.   So let's talk a little bit about our Alaskan of the Week. She served  in the U.S. Navy during the Second World War. And I am going to talk a  little bit about a program, the WAVES Program. It is a very famous  program, the Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service. That is  the acronym, WAVES.   Elverda is a World War II vet, an Alaskan pioneer literally. She is  an author, a mother, a grandmother, a great-great-grandmother. She has  such an amazing story, and here is the deal: She is turning 100 in a  couple of days--100--and is still going strong.   So let me spend a few minutes talking about this extraordinary woman  who is such an inspiration to so many in Alaska and hopefully, after  millions of Americans listen to this speech, to so many Americans  across the country.   Elverda was born in 1923 in Minnesota as the oldest of 14 kids. She  was about 6 years old when the Great Depression began. Of course, it  was a very tough time for most Americans. In her words, there was no  work. Her family literally did not know where the next meal was coming  from. They ate a lot of soup, she said, and when there was not enough  to go around for the 14 kids her parents had to take care of, they just  added water to the soup. They were tough times, but she and her family  survived.   She said, ``We,'' like so many other Americans, ``were all in the  same boat.''   After graduating from high school, Elverda worked for some time in  Washington State, from working in a fruit cannery to waitressing, but  none of these jobs gave her a sense of fulfillment or adventure or  satisfaction.  [[Page S2352]]    Then December 7, 1941, happened, and our great Nation was at war. So  what did this young woman do? She said she noticed a huge sign in her  local post office. You know what the sign was--one of the most famous  recruiting posters ever. It was Uncle Sam literally pointing at her.  Every day, she said she walked past that sign that said: ``I WANT  YOU.'' She was a patriot, so eventually Elverda heeded Uncle Sam's  call, and she joined the Navy--like I said, the WAVES Program. She was  soon on a train to New York and on a journey then that took her across  the country--a 5-day train ride.   The WAVES Program was set up in 1942 by President Roosevelt to free  up positions primarily stateside but very important positions. You are  going to hear about what Elverda actually did for her country and the  Navy so that male sailors could deploy overseas.   So she got on a plane with eight other women who had also joined  WAVES. They had to take turns sleeping on the floor of the lavatory for  5 days because there were no assigned seats on this train going across  our great Nation.   There were 4 weeks of boot camp--tough duty--from 4:30 a.m. to 9:30  p.m. every day for 4 weeks straight.   When she completed boot camp, Elverda was filled with a sense of  accomplishment and patriotism. She had done something hard, something  fulfilling, something worthwhile. Beyond that, she felt connected with  her fellow WAVES. These were sailors in the U.S. Navy, women sailors.  Then, of course, she was connected with probably one of the most  important causes our country has ever undertaken--to win World War II  and free the world from tyranny and oppression.   Her confidence soared, she said, when she received her Navy uniform  and her $50-per-month paycheck--a lot of money back then. She was first  stationed in Seattle. Get this: Her job was to keep track of the exact  locations of U.S. ships and enemy ships and planes throughout the  Pacific. She then was transferred to Tongue Point Naval Air Station in  Astoria, OR. At this point, of course, the Pacific theatre--the war in  the Pacific--was in full force.   She aided in modifying, updating, and correcting naval communications  manuals. She helped to code a great deal of radio signals and manuals  that were used in battles like the Battle of Iwo Jima and were also  used in the invasion of the Aleutian Islands by Japan. A lot of people  don't know that Alaska was actually invaded by the forces of Imperial  Japan and occupied in the Aleutian Islands. Our military had to go  fight brutal battles in the Aleutian Islands to kick out the Japanese  on American territory, our great State.   It was only after the war that Elverda realized the great importance  of what she had done. Like I said, she is an Alaskan of the Week who  helped save the world--literally helped save the world.   She saw her time in the Navy as a great transition in her life, where  she found out what hard work and dedication and patriotism were all  about. And, importantly, she also met her husband, Bob Lincoln, a U.S.  marine--so we know Elverda has very good taste by marrying a U.S.  marine--while he was stationed in Oregon.   Both Elverda and Bob wanted to live a continued life of adventure and  travel, so after the war in 1950, with one child already born and  another one on the way, they packed up their car, and they drove north  to the great State of Alaska. Now, it wasn't a State back then. It was  still a territory, but you get the picture. They wanted an Alaskan  adventure, and they got it. They settled in the Matanuska Valley in the  town of Wasilla on a homestead.   Elverda and her husband Bob added to Wasilla's population, which,  back then, was 100 people. It is much bigger today. They felled trees.  They built a cabin. They built a life. They raised three wonderful  kids. Bob did everything from dairy farming to putting up telephone  lines to being a butcher. And, of course, they fell in love with  Alaska.   ``It's like one big family,'' Elverda said. ``Our friends range from  the preachers to the alcoholics and everybody in between.''   Eventually, Elverda began to write about her life in Alaska--some  funny and some very serious stories about life on the homestead in the  Last Frontier. She has written four books so far; and talking to her,  you have no doubt that she has at least four more in her.   Unfortunately, her husband, Bob, passed away. But before he did, he  and Elverda traveled the world, something that she continued to do  until recently.   Elverda now lives in the senior center in Wasilla, and she stays  busy. She walks every day. She quilts for charities, including Quilts  of Valor and quilts for Children's Place. During COVID, she made masks.   She has 5 grandchildren, 19 great-grandchildren, and 2 great-great- grandchildren. In her hundred years of life--hundred years of wisdom-- Elverda attributes her longevity to the following--and this is a great  lesson for everybody: living healthy, staying active, being positive,  and staying out of other people's business.   ``I've loved every minute of my life,'' Elverda recently said. And  what a life it has been.   So, Elverda, thank you for your service to our country. Thank you for  your service in the U.S. Navy in WAVES, to the great State of Alaska,  and to Wasilla. Thank you for being such a positive inspiration for so  many. Happy hundredth birthday from the U.S. Senate. And, of course,  congratulations on the great honor of being our Alaskan of the Week.   I yield the floor.    To my friend and colleague from Rhode Island, I will  gladly pass along your birthday greetings to Elverda. Thank you very  much.    Mr. President, the Alaska Railroad Corporation-- ARRC--is a renowned institution in my State, and I would like to first  congratulate the Alaska Railroad on its 100-year birthday and take a  few minutes to discuss the immense impact the railroad has had not only  within Alaska, but  [[Page S2356]]  also across our Nation. The Alaska Railroad, its builders, operators,  and leaders have been foundational to Alaska's development for a  century. Throughout its storied history, the railroad has supported war  efforts, transported passengers between Alaska's largest cities, helped  build the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, invested in real estate, and  facilitated tourism and commerce across miles of my State's remote and  wild landscapes.   It took decades of twists and turns before the Alaska Railroad  Corporation charged forth. What would later become the ARRC laid the  first track in Alaska in 1903, starting in Seward and extending 50  miles north. In 1914, the U.S. Congress, acknowledging the national  importance of expanding the railroad, funded construction and  operations from Seward to Fairbanks at an estimated construction cost  of $35 million.   On July 15, 1923, President Warren G. Harding drove a golden spike  into the ground at Nenana, uniting the track and marking the completion  of the Alaska Railroad. During World War II, from 1940-1943, the  railroad played a key role in moving military and civilian supplies  that were essential in supporting the war efforts. In 1943, two tunnels  were built through the Chugach Mountains to allow rail access to  Whittier, a military port and fuel depot essential to the Nation's  defense. This important partnership with the U.S. military continues to  this day.   In 1962, the railroad established its first car-barge service in  Whittier, followed by train-ship service, revolutionizing Alaska by  enabling rail cars from the lower 48 to be shipped to any point along  the Alaska Railroad. In the early to mid-1970s, the railroad supported  construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline; shipping and storing  pipeline between Valdez, Seward, and Fairbanks, from where it was then  trucked to the North Slope. In 1981, the railroad entered into  agreements with Fairbanks and Anchorage school district career centers  for a tour guide program that trained high school students to serve as  hosts onboard summer passenger trains.   In 1983, President Ronald Reagan signed into law the authorization of  the transfer of the Alaska Railroad to the State of Alaska. Shortly  thereafter, the Alaska Railroad Corporation was born. By 1996, the ARRC  showed a profit of $8.0 million and passenger ridership had grown to  512,000. Former Governor Bill Sheffield became CEO in 1997. In the  early 2000s, the Alaska Railroad Corporation's real estate operations  exceeded $11 million in profits for the first time and a web-based  passenger reservation system was implemented. Simultaneously, the  Alaska Railroad began a program to reduce diesel emissions and noise.  2003 was the railroad's most profitable and safe year in its history up  until that point.   In 2013, the Railroad's own Bill O'Leary was named CEO, becoming the  first lifelong Alaskan to lead the railroad. Today, the ARRC operates a  regularly scheduled public transportation service connecting Alaskans  and visitors to communities from Seward to Fairbanks. Passengers gain  access to wonderfully remote regions and areas off the road system  including Alaska's Chugach National Forest and Denali National Park,  which are visited by hundreds of thousands of people annually.   Like Alaska itself, the Alaska Railroad's story is full of peaks and  valleys. Every mile of this legendary railroad was earned through grit,  bravery, skill and sweat. Alaska Railroad Corporation trains are iconic  symbols, in Alaska and around the world, of the ``can do'' spirit of  Alaskans. The railroad's irreplaceable team, as much as the iron and  steel of the locomotives, have served as foundational infrastructure  driving economic development in The Last Frontier. I respectfully urge  my fellow Members of the 118th Congress to join the proud Members of  the Alaska Delegation in congratulating and thanking the Alaska  Railroad Corporation for 100 years of service to our State and to our  Nation.                            ____________________
