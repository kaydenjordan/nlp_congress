 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the HEROES  Act.   When I last spoke on this bill in this Chamber, I told a story about  a young man in my congressional district that I serve named Noah. He  wrote to me that his town may not survive this pandemic.   Now, more than a month since, I am awfully worried, too. The HEROES  Act would provide $915 billion for State and local assistance so our  small towns and cities, like where Noah lives, are not left behind.   It would strengthen programs for small business and deliver economic  security to those that are the backbone of our economy.   As our country is reeling from record-high COVID-19 cases, it would  allow uninsured Americans to access health insurance. Pretty darn  important during a worldwide pandemic.   For the cities and towns, for our small businesses, and for so many  Americans, this is not about politics; it is about survival. I urge the  Senate to join us in passing the HEROES Act.                            ____________________
