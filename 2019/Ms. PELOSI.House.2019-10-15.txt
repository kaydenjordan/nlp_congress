 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for his support of democracy and democratic freedom in Hong  Kong.   I want to salute my colleague, Representative Smith of New Jersey,  with whom I have worked for decades on this subject, whether it is for  religious freedom or freedom of expression in China.   I thank Mr. McGovern for his important leadership as chair of the  China Commission and as chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights  Commission.   Right now, we are on the PROTECT Hong Kong Act, as amended, by Mr.  McGovern, and I rise in support of that legislation and, indeed, the  bills that are on the floor to support democratic freedom in Hong Kong.   Mr. Speaker, for 4 months, the young people of Hong Kong have sent a  stirring message to the world that the dreams of freedom, justice, and  democracy can never be extinguished by injustice and intimidation. The  extraordinary outpouring of courage from the people of Hong Kong stands  in stark contrast to a cowardly government that refuses to respect the  rule of law or live up to the ``one country, two systems'' framework,  which was guaranteed more than two decades ago.   In 1984, before the United Kingdom transferred Hong Kong to China,  the Chinese Government promised a high degree of autonomy for the  territory in the Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong,  providing for an independent executive, legislature, and judiciary;  ensuring the freedom of speech, press, assembly, and religion;  prohibiting the central government, the Chinese Government in Beijing,  from interfering in the affairs that Hong Kong administers on its own  according to the Basic Law; and pledging a path to universal suffrage.   In 1997--that is when we were here doing this--when the handover  occurred, America was hopeful that the people of Hong Kong would  achieve this high degree of autonomy that they were promised, and this  was a promise that was participated in by the U.K. Government. Today,  we must sadly conclude that China has broken that promise.   For years, the people of Hong Kong have faced a barrage of unjust and  harsh restrictions on their freedoms, and those who have stood up for  their rights have been met with a cruel crackdown.   In Congress, Democrats and Republicans, in the House and in the  Senate, stand united with the people of Hong Kong. If America does not  speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interests,  then we lose all moral authority to speak out for human rights anyplace  in the world.   Since Tiananmen Square 30 years ago, many of us, in a bipartisan way,  have been fighting this fight, and we have seen that commercial  interests always win. It is always about the money.   I lost my innocence on human rights in America and China all those  years ago when I saw that, while we talked a good talk, when it came  right down to it, it was always about the money.   Again, to those who want to take the repressive government's side in  this discussion, I say to you: What does it profit a person if he gains  the whole world and suffers the loss of his soul?   We do not want to lose the soul of our country for commercial  interests, whatever those commercial interests may be.   It is interesting to hear people say we have to know both sides of  the story. Do you want to hear both sides?   One side is a very repressive regime that is crushing democratic  freedoms in Hong Kong at the same time that they have tried to destroy  the culture, the language, and the religion, all at the same time as  they incarcerate in reeducation camps more than 1 million--it could be  3 million--Uyghur Muslims in China, or they repress religious freedom  there. The list goes on and on.   And the other side: young people speaking out for freedoms,  democratic freedoms, in Hong Kong. They are so impressive.   Mr. Smith and I have worked, as Mr. McGovern has, with some three  generations, starting after Tiananmen Square and tanks rolling over  young people who spoke out for democratic freedoms in China; the next  generation, a couple, 15 years later; and now this generation of young  people, so impressive are they that even the more senior  [[Page H8126]]  freedom fighters in Hong Kong are impressed by their courage and their  stick-to-itiveness.   Today, the House is proud to pass the bicameral and bipartisan Hong  Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act to reaffirm America's commitment to  democracy. And that doesn't mean a democracy like this. It means  democratic freedoms, human rights, and the rule of law in the face of  Beijing's crackdown.                                time  1615    And Beijing thinks that they can rule because of money. It always  comes down to that. I thank Chairman McGovern and Congressman Smith for  their work to ensure an honest accounting of the situation in Hong  Kong, and to ensure accountability for those responsible for the  crackdown.   We are grateful to Chairman McGovern for his leadership on this  PROTECT Hong Kong Act which suspends sales of crowd control technology  and other equipment to the Hong Kong Police Force, as Mr. Sherman  pointed out earlier. I thank Mr. Sherman for his work on this and thank  him for his resolution calling for the Hong Kong Government to address  protestors' demands and condemning police brutality, in addition to  China's efforts to falsely accuse U.S. diplomats of fueling unrest.   Last week, Martin Lee, the grandfather of Hong Kong democracy--we  started working with him decades ago--said: ``We fear Hong Kong will  become just another Chinese city.'' That means one without any of the  freedoms that they were guaranteed. The future of Hong Kong, the future  of autonomy, freedom, and justice for millions is at stake.   America must stand with Hong Kong. It is very interesting that in the  first weeks of the demonstration, the first months of the  demonstration, 2 million people, mostly young people, were in the  streets. And people were saying: Oh, my heavens, 2 million people  turning out. And you remember that 2 million is 25 percent of the  population of Hong Kong which is 8 million people. It is 25 percent of  the population that was in the streets. And the beat goes on.   Hopefully, they will hear from this Congress our support for their  human rights, and that we will not sell our souls for money at the  expense of our values.   I also want to thank the distinguished chairman of the committee, Mr.  Eliot Engel, for his leadership on all of this over time. I urge an  ``aye'' vote on all of the above to join in bipartisan, bicameral  support for the people of Hong Kong.
