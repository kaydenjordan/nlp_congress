 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am horrified and saddened by the ongoing escalation of  violence in Gaza and in Israel.   We have now seen over 1,800 rockets being fired indiscriminately at  Israel's citizens, who are now fleeing for their lives. Yes, I believe  that Israel does have a right to defend herself.   Now, 103 Palestinians and seven Israelis are dead, including  children. It is so painful. The cycle of violence that we see over and  over again. Yes, I believe Israel does have the right to defend  herself. But in the end, there are no winners.   The United States can play a role. The Biden administration has  dispatched the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, his name is Hady  Amr, to Israel, and his job is to deal with the situation in Israel and  Palestine. I am hopeful that we will see a deescalation and a  ceasefire. But a return to status quo is simply not enough.   Earlier this week, prior to the attacks, I was deeply disturbed by  the intentional and the intended evacuation of Palestinian families,  some of whom have been in their homes for decades. The Biden  administration, through its National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan,  has also conveyed its consternation, its concern, about the evictions,  and has called and has urged the administration to remain heavily  involved, to address the root causes of this violence, including  ongoing evictions, displacement, and occupation, as it works to secure  a ceasefire.   The violence must end now, and we must work to enable dialogue that  can lead to a just, safe, and secure future for both Israelis and  Palestinians.
