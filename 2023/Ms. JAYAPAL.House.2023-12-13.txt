 Mr. Speaker, extreme MAGA Republicans in the House are  on a Donald Trump-directed fishing expedition. In fact, they have been  on a fishing expedition for months with embarrassing results--nothing-- no bites, no evidence for anything that justifies impeachment.   There are no fish to catch in this Republican swamp, and good luck to  all these Republicans who have to go home and justify a sham  impeachment to their districts while telling them that we haven't  passed the budget, haven't reauthorized the farm bill, haven't done a  single thing that helps Americans live their lives. Instead, we are  wasting time on bogus censure resolutions and bogus impeachment  inquiries.   We have 1\1/2\ legislative business days left in the year. We should  be passing bills to help working families, but that is not what we do  under extreme Republicans' control. Vote ``no'' on this new fishing  expedition.
