 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the President's veto of H.J. Res.  46. Keeping our Nation secure should be this President's very highest  priority, and it is this President's very highest priority.   With President Trump, there is no question that he has, and he will  continue to carry out, this priority. I support his efforts to build a  wall on the southern border to protect our country.   He has very clearly laid out the case for a declaration for a  national emergency. There is a crisis at the border, a crisis that  could have been addressed much sooner or even prevented, for that  matter. The open border policies in the last administration compounded  this growing problem.   We are seeing the highest rates of illegal immigration since 2007. In  February, there were more than double the number of illegal migrants  coming into this country, as compared to last year.   Border Patrol has apprehended over 268,000 individuals since the  beginning of this fiscal year. That is a 97 percent increase from the  previous year.   Schools, hospitals, and other services have become overcrowded. The  American workers have been hurt by reduced job opportunities and lower  wages. At the same time, human and drug traffickers are thriving.                                time  1245    In many of our communities, the notorious MS-13 gang has grown, and  we have seen tragic cases of crime committed by illegal aliens who have  been deported multiple times.   In my own home State of Missouri, an individual who was previously  deported returned here illegally and was charged in several violent  incidents. He is now suspected of murdering five individuals--or five  Americans.   That should never have happened, but these kinds of tragic--and  preventable--events are happening across the country. That is the very  definition of a crisis.   Last Congress, we enacted legislation to deal with the devastating  opioid crisis because that is, in fact, also a crisis. We can and we  must slow the flow of illegal drugs into this country. The men and  women who put their lives on the line every single day to secure our  borders deserve all the tools they need to do the job--including a  border wall.   Through President Trump's proclamation and his veto of H.J. Res. 46,  he is acting decisively to finally address this crisis under the  authority provided him by Congress. The National Emergencies Act is  crystal clear. The provisions the President will use under title 10  explicitly provide the President with that authority. The President is  well within his legal authority that Congress has provided him. That is  the bottom line.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand with the President and  to stand with law-abiding Americans and law-abiding immigrants to  sustain this veto.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Crawford), who is also the lead Republican  on the Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).    Madam Speaker, the President made it very  clear that the wall is critical to address both national security and  the humanitarian crisis.   DOD issued a fact sheet of the universe of projects that have not  been awarded, and they totaled more than what is needed. They total a  little over $12 billion.   Just because a project is listed doesn't mean that the funding will  be used. They only need $3.6 billion.   I might add, too, that if the fiscal year 2020 budget is enacted on  time and as requested, there is going to be no military construction  project that is going to be delayed or canceled.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Abraham).    Madam Speaker, I just need to point out that,  according to Customs and Border Protection, there were more illegal  drugs that were captured in between those ports of entry than there  were at the ports of entry.   In 2012, there were 11 million pounds of illegal drugs that were  seized in between--again, in between--those ports of entry, as opposed  to 4 million pounds at those ports of entry.   This is exactly why the wall is needed, so that we funnel that  illegal drug trafficking to those ports rather than in between those  ports of entry.   It is time that Congress gave those individuals that are on the  border, risking their lives to protect the United States, the tools  that they need, and that is a border wall.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Rogers), who is also the lead Republican on the  Committee on Homeland Security.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Despite the majority's blind objection to anything this President  does, the facts are clearly there to show that this is a real crisis.  President Obama agreed when he requested emergency funding in 2014 to  deal with the crisis on the border and when he declared a national  emergency because of the transnational drug traffickers.   Since fiscal year 2012, Customs and Border Patrol has seized 4  million pounds, as I pointed out earlier, seized 4 million pounds of  drugs at ports of entry but more than 11 million pounds of drugs  between those ports of entry. Nearly three times as many drugs are  seized in between those ports.   Many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle recognize the  need for a border wall. They voted to authorize a wall in 2006 and  again they voted to authorize, under President Obama, in 2013.   Last year, we passed bipartisan legislation to address the growing  impacts of opioids on our communities, drugs that continue to flow into  our country through our southern border. Make no mistake, the opioid  crisis is real.   Earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control issued a report  noting that deaths from fentanyl have increased from 1,663 in 2011 to  18,335 deaths in 2016. This is an increase of over 1,100 percent.   There was bipartisan agreement that there was a drug-related crisis,  but now, suddenly, some are calling this a ``manufactured crisis.''   The National Emergencies Act has been on the books since 1976 and has  been used dozens of times, but now, suddenly, some are calling it  ``unconstitutional.''   The National Emergencies Act is clear; it is absolutely clear: The  President has the authority to act. The President is using the  authority Congress has given him, and the President stood firm,  understanding the gravity of this crisis, and issued his first  Presidential veto.   I stand with him, and I urge my colleagues to sustain the President's  veto on H.J. Res. 46.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
