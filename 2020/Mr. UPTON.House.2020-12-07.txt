 Mr. Speaker, this 30 minutes is a tribute to our leader  who is leaving us,   Greg Walden, the top Republican on the Energy and  Commerce Committee and the former chairman, and, obviously, a good  friend to everyone on both sides of the aisle.   Knowing that many Members have plenty of meetings that are starting,  I am going to yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hudson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Johnson), also a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Blumenauer), a colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Fitzpatrick).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the State of  Washington (Mrs. Rodgers), the   Greg Walden successor as the top  Republican on the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee and, as we  like to say, chairman-in-waiting in the next aisle.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State  of Michigan (Mr. Walberg), who is another member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I know other Members may be on the way over.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks as part of  this Special Order for Mr. Walden.    So, Mr. Speaker, this is a farewell for Greg Walden.   He started off in public service serving as the youngest State house  majority leader in Oregon's history before he was elected to the U.S.  House for Oregon's Second District.   He came to the Energy and Commerce Committee in 2001, and, of course,  I referenced the Energy and Commerce Committee a little bit earlier as  the greatest committee, and that is because I simply took the words of  John Dingell, our former chairman, who agrees with me, I know, but as  he would say, our committee's jurisdiction is really just two words:  the world.   We have jurisdiction over energy, the environment, healthcare,  telecommunications, trade, manufacturing, and then some, and, of  course, that very important issue called oversight and investigations.   Greg chaired the Telecommunications Subcommittee from 2010 until  2016. He jumped up over others in seniority because of his knowledge on  that issue and his passion, whether it be broadband or digital  broadcasting, anything involving the telecommunication industry. He  became chairman of the full committee in 2017, and, obviously, the top  Republican now, as Republicans no longer serve in the majority.   As you look back at his career, Mr. Speaker, and you look at some of  these landmark issues--Cathy McMorris Rodgers indicated a couple--but  CHIP, children's healthcare, so important for all of our States. He was  a leader on that.   For the first time ever, we actually passed something with a 10-year  authorization bill called the community health centers authorization.   Opioids were a big issue 3, 4 years ago. It still is today, but  literally every member of our committee had a piece of that bill. I  want to say maybe more than 100 different separate bills were fashioned  together as one. President Trump signed it into law, and it made a  meaningful difference for so many people as they struggle with this  addiction across the country.   I couldn't forget this one bill, and I had to write the title down,  the Repack Airwaves Yielding Better Access for Users of Modern Servers.  I think I got that right. If you take the first letter of every word,  that spells RAY BAUM.   Ray Baum was our staff director of the committee for a couple years  until a terrible brain cancer took his life. This bill was named in  honor of Ray.   I will tell you, 911 calls wouldn't work today without this, because  this provided the location, when that call is made, to make sure that  the first responder, in fact, is going to get to that delivery site. So  it is very important legislation, and Ray was just an awesome leader on  our committee.   But I see other Members have joined us now.   May I ask, Mr. Speaker, how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McNerney), who is a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs.  Brooks), a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I want to report some breaking news. Roll  Call has just put something out online, it will be published tomorrow.  And the headline is: ``Adulting might be alive and well in Congress.  The retiring Lamar Alexander and   Greg Walden show it's possible to do  your job in public life while acting like a grown-up.''   That is Greg. He got things done. He was an Eagle Scout when he was a  youngster, still is a mighty big Ducks fan. You can't walk into his  office without seeing the Ducks. He is in a lot better mood on Monday  when you see him if the Ducks win. They didn't win the other day. But  he has been a really special individual with real care and handling of  all the different issues that our committee deals with.   A partner in leadership on both sides of the aisle, his word is his  bond. His staff has been terrific, all of them: All the subcommittee  staff, his personal staff, and obviously, his greatest staff person,  Mylene. Mylene and his son, Anthony, we have watched him grow up from  when Anthony was a youngster, but Mylene has been a special friend,  really, to all of us. She puts up with Greg. Usually, she is on the  West Coast while he is over here.   Mr. Speaker, he has been a special talent that has been lent to our  committee to make this country a better place.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Walden).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
