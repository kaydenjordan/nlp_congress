 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to stand with our trans  kids and their freedom to be who they are. To all of our trans and  LGBTQ+ kids who are watching today, let me just say that we see you,  that we love you, and that you belong.   Now, let's be clear about what this bill actually is: It is about  legislating hate in the name of advancing a political agenda. Now, our  colleagues are trying to claim that they are out here defending the  rights of women as they are waging a campaign to take away our  reproductive freedoms, to ban books, and now to bully our kids. It is  disgusting.   I am proud to be a New Mexican, and I am proud to be from a State  that is defending the rights of our children, of our LGBTQ+ community,  and our reproductive rights, because in New Mexico, we stand with trans  kids, and we stand in the fiercest opposition to this bill.
