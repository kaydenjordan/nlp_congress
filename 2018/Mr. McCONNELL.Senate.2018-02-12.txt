 Mr. President, today President Trump will put forward  his budget request for the next fiscal year. I look forward to  reviewing the President's priorities. With a bipartisan funding  agreement now in place, Congress and the White House can work together  to begin rebuilding our military, improve care for veterans, and tackle  other urgent matters, from disaster relief to the fight against drug  addiction.   I especially appreciate the President's focus on improving America's  infrastructure. The quality of our country's infrastructure affects  everything from our long-term economic future to working Americans'  everyday routines. As of 2016, nearly 1 in 10 bridges in our Nation is  structurally deficient. The average commuter loses 42 hours per year to  delays. The average age of our inland waterway locks and dams is over  50 years old. We are intimately familiar with this in Kentucky, where  we ship millions of tons of coal, agricultural products, and other  cargo on more than 1,900 miles of inland waterways.   The problem runs deeper than dollars and cents. American workers  built skyscrapers in less time than our government now spends  reviewing--not even building but reviewing--plans for new bridges and  stretches of highways. So I am particularly happy that the President is  proposing to eliminate regulatory barriers and streamline lengthy and  overcomplicated permitting processes.   Historically, infrastructure has been an area of bipartisan  cooperation. Our last three highway bills passed with large bipartisan  majorities, averaging more than 80 ``yes'' votes. So did our last three  WRDA bills and our last three FAA bills. I hope we can build on this  record and make more bipartisan progress on this subject.                            ____________________     Now on another matter, Mr. President, as I have  repeatedly stated, now that there is an agreement on long-term  government funding, the Senate will proceed to a fair debate over the  DACA issue, border security, and other matters pertaining to the  subject of immigration. This process begins in just a few hours. We  will vote to proceed to an unrelated, neutral House-passed bill that  will serve as the vehicle for any legislation that succeeds here in the  Senate. As I have repeated many times, I will ensure that a fair  amendment process gives Senators the opportunity to submit proposals  for consideration and votes. I hope this body can seize this  opportunity and deliver real progress toward securing our border,  reforming aspects of our immigration policy, and achieving a resolution  for individuals who were brought to our country illegally when they  were young.   The American people have heard no shortage of rhetoric on this issue.  They have heard many of my colleagues across the aisle insist that this  issue requires swift action. Now is the time to back up this talk with  the hard work of finding a workable solution. That means finding an  agreement which can pass the Senate, pass the  [[Page S856]]  House, and which the President will sign--not just making a point.   A number of my colleagues--Senators Grassley, Cornyn, Tillis, Perdue,  Lankford, Cotton, and Ernst--will introduce a balanced proposal that  tries to meet these requirements. I support the President's proposal  and my colleagues' legislation to implement it.   The Secure and Succeed Act is fair and addresses both sides' most  pressing concerns, conforming to the conditions the President has put  forward. It offers a compassionate resolution for 1.8 million illegal  immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. In  exchange, this solution delivers funding for President Trump's promise  to fully secure the border, reforms our approach to extended family  chain migration, and reallocates our arbitrary visa lottery into a more  sensible, merit-based system.   This legislation is a fair compromise that addresses the stated  priorities of all sides. It is our best chance of producing a solution  that can actually resolve these matters, which requires that a bill  pass the Senate, pass the House, and earn the President's signature. It  has my support.   The time for political posturing is behind us. Now we have an  opportunity to resolve these issues. I hope we make the most of it.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Andy  Croley, who will be honored by Leadership Tri-County, LTC, as the 2018  Leader of the Year. LTC was established in 1987 to serve Knox, Whitley,  and Laurel Counties. According to LTC's board of directors, the annual  award is given ``to the individual who has made an outstanding  contribution to leadership in the area and has done a lot to contribute  to the growth and development of the area.'' A lifetime resident of  Whitley County, Andy has served as the county coroner since 2002, and  he began serving as the county's deputy coroner in 1995. Because of his  years of service to southeastern Kentucky, Andy is an ideal choice to  receive this distinction.   In addition to his work in Whitley County, Andy has responded to  national tragedies such as Hurricane Katrina and the terrorist attacks  of September 11, 2001. As part of a recovery team in New York, Andy  spent several weeks working in the wreckage of the World Trade Center.  In appreciation for his brave efforts, New York officials gave him a  beam from the fallen towers. Andy donated the beam to the University of  the Cumberlands, where it was established as part of the school's  Patriot Park in 2003.   Andy is also dedicated to helping members of the next generation  succeed. Promoting high school football in Kentucky and Tennessee, he  has served as the chairman of the Border Bowl for several years. This  nonprofit organization hosts a football game in Williamsburg, KY,  featuring top players from both States. Andy's work on the Border Bowl  has given young athletes in both States the chance to hone their skills  and compete in a popular event.   I want to congratulate Andy Croley on being named the 2018 Leader of  the Year. I would like to commend him on this accomplishment, and I  urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing his work.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to  meet during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                        COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS    The Committee on Foreign Relations is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Monday, February 12, 2018, at 5 p.m., to hold  a hearing entitled ``Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanction  Act.''  [[Page S879]]                              ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 403, submitted  earlier today.    Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that  the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Hassan.
