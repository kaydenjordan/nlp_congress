 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on the Senate to  immediately pass the Honoring our PACT Act.   In 2017, I met a veteran from Cathedral City, Jennifer Kepner, who  developed pancreatic cancer due to her exposure to burn pits during her  service in Iraq.   Despite being a young and otherwise healthy mother of two with no  family history of cancer, she and her family faced roadblocks to  getting the care that she needed from the VA.   At her kitchen table, she asked me to lead this fight, and I promised  her I would. Now, 5 years later, we are closer than ever before to  fulfilling Jennifer's vision for her fellow veterans.   With my provision included to get veterans the presumptive benefits  they have earned and deserve, the Honoring our PACT Act will ensure  that no other veteran will have to fight like Jennifer did for the care  they need.   I urge the Senate to fulfill our Nation's promise to our veterans,  honor Jennifer's memory, and pass the Honoring our PACT Act without  delay.                            ____________________
