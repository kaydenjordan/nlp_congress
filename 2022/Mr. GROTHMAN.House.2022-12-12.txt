 Mr. Speaker, I one more time plead with the press corps  here to report what I thought was the most significant story to come  out in the last 2 weeks. And that is, that there were 73,000 got-aways  who came across the southern border in October.   So our listeners are aware, there are two large groups that have come  across the southern border when we talk about illegals coming here.  Some turn themselves into Border Patrol and ask for asylum and are  given a court date. But there are other more dangerous ones, the type  that are not subject to background checks and may be sneaking across  the border with illegal drugs who we refer to as got-aways.   Until last month, the all-time high for got-aways was around 59,000.  In one month, we had a 23 percent jump to 73,000. That ought to be a  banner headline in every newspaper across the country. And the fact  that it is not, should make the entire Washington press corps ashamed  of themselves.  [[Page H9687]]                                ____________________
