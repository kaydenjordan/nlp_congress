 Madam Speaker, I just wanted to point out, as a result  of the over 2 million acres of fire that have happened in California,  the next thing that happens is when the winter comes, and the rains  come--like we are having so much now--the deluge of rain caused after  the forest fires because of unmanaged forests the erosion that we are  seeing here.   This example here is Highway 70 running through Butte County and  Plumas County. The rockslide you see here is part of the fire scar. So  when we lose all that foliage, you get erosion.   What does erosion mean? Not just the highway being closed, but this  washes into, in this case Feather River, on down into Lake Oroville,  which is a water source for 25 million people in California.   So why is this important? Because we have to do a much better job of  managing our Federal forests, our Federal lands, and we are not doing  that. We are not doing it speedily enough because we have so much to  catch up on, yet every year millions of acres of forest land burn. This  is just one of the results here.   The lost transportation. The water quality that affects so many  people is going to be negatively affected by this lack of action. We  need the Forest Service to move rapidly towards not only mitigating the  fires from this year with erosion, but also manage these lands so we  don't have these horrific fires.                            ____________________
