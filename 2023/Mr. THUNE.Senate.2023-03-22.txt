 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before I begin my remarks, just a quick  observation.   I know that the majority leader comes down on a fairly regular basis  and attacks Republicans, particularly House Republicans, for not  producing a budget. Obviously, for the House Republicans, it is their  prerogative over there. If there is going to be a budget, it is  probably going to be a budget that is put together by the House  majority.   But I think it kind of misses the broader point, and that is that, at  least here in the Senate, which is our domain, our realm of  responsibility, it is up to the majority to put a budget forward. They  control the floor. They have all control here. They determine what  comes to the floor and what doesn't, and if they want to put together a  budget, they certainly could. One place to start, obviously, would be  the President's budget.   The President submitted a budget, which, by any estimation, is a  massive expansion of the Federal Government, with lots of new  spending--$5 trillion in new taxes, mostly on job creators and small  businesses. At the end of the budget period, he would add $17 trillion  to the Federal debt. Budget periods cover a window, typically, of 10  years. The President's budget, as put forward, at the end of that 10- year period, would add $17 trillion to the Federal debt and  dramatically increase spending.   Now, spending prepandemic, as we went into the pandemic, was about  $4.4 trillion a year--all in Federal spending. Of course, during the  pandemic, that increased. In a bipartisan way, there were some  decisions made to support and increase spending in some areas that were  designed to combat and deal with a lot of the adverse impacts of the  pandemic. Now the pandemic is behind us, and a lot of that spending  should have been temporary. A lot of that spending really shouldn't  have been incorporated into the baseline.   What the Democrats have done is incorporated that into the baseline  so that, this year, the amount of spending in the President's budget-- about $6.9 trillion--is about 55 percent more than the baseline  spending back in 2019, prepandemic, at a time when the population of  the country has only increased by 1.8 percent. Now, you could argue, I  suppose, if you had a massive increase in population--a lot more people  in the country--that Federal spending would increase with it, but  increasing Federal spending 55 percent at a time when you only have a  1.8-percent population growth in the country seems like a lot of  excessive spending spent on expanding and growing the size and the  footprint of the Federal Government.   Interestingly enough, at the end of that 10-year period--again, the  budget window covers 10 years--spending under the President's budget  would be $9.9 trillion--$9.9 trillion; in 2019, $4.4 trillion; at the  end of the 10-year window covered by the President's budget,  [[Page S885]]  $9.9 trillion--more than double, way more than double the amount of  spending that we had prior to the pandemic in 2019 and where some  additional spending that was added at the time was and should have been  temporary.   So those are kind of the contours of the President's budget. That is  his plan. The Senate Democrats, obviously, could put that on the floor  or they could come up with a different budget. But the point, very  simply, is they are the majority. That is their responsibility. If they  want to put a budget out, if they want to vote on a budget, put a  budget on the floor. We are happy to vote on it. We would be happy to  offer amendments to it, and they would be amendments that would reflect  the priorities that we have on our side, which call for less spending,  less government, a lighter regulatory touch, and not the massive tax  increases contemplated by the President's budget.   So that is just a point I wanted to clarify. As we have this  conversation around the budget of whose responsibility it is to advance  a budget here in the U.S. Senate, it is the job of the majority, and so  far the majority has not wanted to undertake that task. Perhaps, more  importantly, I don't think it probably wants to vote on the President's  budget, which, as I said, adds $17 trillion to the debt, which makes  the debt at the end of that 10-year period--the 10-year window, by the  way--$50 trillion; $50 trillion. That is what the President's budget  would have us at in total debt, cumulative debt, at the end of that 10- year period, but it adds $17 trillion during that 10-year window and  increases spending from $4.4 trillion prepandemic in 2019 to $9.9  trillion. It is pretty stunning, really, but that isn't what I came to  talk about here today.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Kentucky (Mr. McConnell).
