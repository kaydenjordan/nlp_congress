 Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, today I recognize and honor the  career of Janice Donaldson, Director of the Small Business Development  Center--SBDC--at the University of North Florida, UNF. At the end of  this month, she will retire after serving the small business community  for 31 years.   Since 1981, Mrs. Donaldson has supported small business owners and  entrepreneurs in the Jacksonville area. After graduating from the  University of Georgia in 1980, Janice joined the SBDC at UNF as editor  of the office newsletter. After 21 years with the office, Mrs.  Donaldson took over as director in 2002 and has been a resilient leader  throughout her years of service.   During her tenure as director, the center's service area grew  immensely, from one office serving five counties, to seven offices  serving 18 counties. Additionally, SBDC expanded its services from  supporting entrepreneurs, to now enabling clients to grow their  existing small businesses.   In her final year as director, Mrs. Donaldson faced one of her most  difficult challenges yet. The COVID-19 pandemic forced her office to  work remotely where they had to quickly acclimate to the ever-changing  economic conditions. Under her leadership, the SBDC team worked  diligently to help small businesses adapt to the pandemic, advising on  financial assistance opportunities available, including the Paycheck  Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loans through the U.S.  Small Business Administration. This year alone, the center has  participated in more than 20,000 consulting hours and facilitated the  awards of approximately $50 million in capital to small businesses in  her region.   Over the years, Mrs. Donaldson has shown paramount dedication to  small businesses. She has played a critical role in the economic growth  of northeast Florida and has nurtured the American dream. Mrs.  Donaldson will be greatly missed by her colleagues and the thousands of  business owners she has assisted throughout her notable career. I wish  her the best of luck in all of her future endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. President, chairman of the Senate Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small  business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit at the  heart of our country. It is my privilege to recognize a family-owned  business that invests heavily in its customers, employees, and  community. Today, it is my honor to name the Lucky Goat Coffee Company  of Tallahassee, FL, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   In 2010, Ben Pautsch founded Lucky Goat Coffee Company as a coffee  wholesale and distribution company. Ben, a graduate of Florida State  University--FSU--focused on providing high-quality beans to local  coffee cafes. The Tallahassee-based business grew quickly as orders  poured in. Their reputation for roasting the best grounds led to the  creation of the first Lucky Goat coffee shop in 2015. The appealing  storefront and large warehouse allowed Lucky Goat to spread their  knowledge and passion for coffee through various classes and tours,  strengthening their customer relationships in the process.   Today, Lucky Goat Coffee has grown to include five coffee shops in  Tallahassee and a franchise location in Jacksonville. Their  Tallahassee-based headquarters provides more than 350 wholesale  customers across the country with  [[Page S7175]]  premium coffee beans. Ben keeps his strong relationship with FSU. Lucky  Goat Coffee products are featured on campus, and Ben regularly hires  FSU students and alumni. From the start, Ben has been committed to  creating dignified work. He prioritizes career development and  professional growth for his employees, with one-time baristas moving up  to serve in senior management within the company.   Over the years, Lucky Goat Coffee has been recognized for its growth  and remained committed to investing in its community. In 2017, then- Governor Rick Scott recognized Lucky Goat Coffee with a Governor's  Business Ambassador Award. As one of the 100 fastest growing companies  owned or led by Florida State University alumnus, Lucky Goat Coffee was  named to the Seminole 100 in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Ben mentors young  entrepreneurs interested in the coffee industry, and Lucky Goat Coffee  supports local youth-focused organizations, including local Little  League teams and Cub Scouts. They also help Leon County Schools,  donating much-needed school supplies for students and equipment,  including coffee, for the teachers.   Like many Florida small businesses, Lucky Goat Coffee suffered a  severe decline in revenue due to the coronavirus pandemic. In April  2020, the U.S. Small Business Administration launched the Paycheck  Protection Program, a small business relief program that I was proud to  author. The PPP provides forgivable loans to impacted small businesses  and nonprofits who maintain their payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic.  A PPP loan gave Lucky Goat the support it needed to retain its  employees and survive the pandemic.   Lucky Goat Coffee is a notable example of a small business that  provides dignified work to its employees and invests in its community.  Through their passion and generosity, Lucky Goat fuels Floridians every  day with its delicious coffee and supports them through community  service.   Congratulations to Ben and the entire team at Lucky Goat. I look  forward to your continued success.                            ____________________
