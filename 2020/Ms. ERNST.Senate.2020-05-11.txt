 Mr. President, I would like to recognize Iowa Safe  Schools as they hold their 15th annual Iowa Governor's Conference on  LGBTQ Youth today, May 11, 2020.   This annual tradition, which began in 2006, is an effort to help end  bullying in our schools and to create leadership opportunities for  LGBTQ youth students from not just Iowa but from States across the  Midwest.   Thank you to Iowa Safe Schools for continuing your mission of  providing a safe environment and community for Iowa's LGBTQ youth to  learn and grow.                            ____________________
