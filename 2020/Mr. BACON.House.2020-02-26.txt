 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 35, the  Emmett Till Antilynching Act, we will be voting on later this  afternoon. I am pleased to see the House take steps in finally  addressing this issue.   Like many, despite our Nation's ugly history of lynchings, I was  shocked to learn that there was no law making lynching a Federal hate  crime.   My home in Omaha area is not unlike many other towns across the  country with a gruesome past of lynching. George Smith was murdered in  October 1891, and this past fall marked the 100th anniversary of the  murder of Will Brown on the steps of the Douglas County Courthouse  during the Red Summer. The hands of lawless and angry mobs in Omaha  beat and lynched these men in what can only be characterized as racial  terrorism.   We cannot simply wash away the past, but in order for our Nation to  heal from past racial injustice, Congress must specify criminal  penalties for the crime of lynching or conspiracy to commit lynching.   With at least 5,000 lynchings in our Nation's history, this bill is  important as an acknowledgement that this evil did occur, that millions  felt fear in their homes and communities, that many feared for their  lives, the lives of their dads and their sons, and that this formal  acknowledgement will help facilitate reconciliation.                                time  1015    Last year, I was approached by local African American community  leaders to look into antilynching legislation. I felt that the language  from Senator Harris' bill that passed with overwhelming bipartisan  support in the Senate was the right one to support here in the House.  This is how we are going to pass a bill and get it signed by the  President of the United States. It is because of these reasons that I  was honored to introduce the Senate-passed language in the House.  [[Page H1195]]    The bill we are voting on today contains the language of my bill that  I introduced 8 months ago verbatim. I do not complain because in the  end, I want results. We want results. We are closer than we have ever  been in making lynching a Federal crime. The action is long overdue,  going back 200 attempts since 1918, and today we are going to make  history once and for all on this issue.   It has been my privilege to be an advocate on this issue. I applaud  Senator Harris and Congressman Rush who have championed this bill for  years. We will finally get this bill to the President's desk to be  signed into law in order to close one of the ugliest chapters in  America's history once and for all.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank  Chairman Rush for his leadership, his heart for this bill, and I thank  the chairman and the ranking member for giving me a chance to speak and  for their comments.

I applaud  Senator Harris and Congressman Bobby Rush, who have been championing  this for years. We will finally get this to the President's desk to be  signed into law in order to close one of the ugliest chapters in our  history once and for all.
