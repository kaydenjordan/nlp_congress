 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  the American Cancer Society, which states cancer patients and survivors  need affordable, accessible insurance coverage with no preexisting  condition exclusions or annual and lifetime caps and that high-risk  pools have failed to meet these basic needs.                                             American Cancer Society                                           Cancer Action Network,                                        Washington, DC, May 3, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: The American       Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN) is deeply       concerned about the reports of additional amendments to the       American Health Care Act (AHCA), including one that would       allegedly add $8 billion in new spending for state high-risk       pools. This amendment is particularly egregious because it       would further incent states to apply for waivers from       current-law market rules that protect patients with pre-      existing conditions.        Historically, state high-risk pools have fallen short of       providing coverage of prevention, treatment and follow-up       care for cancer patients and survivors. Segmenting people       with cancer and other serious illnesses away from the private       marketplace and into high-risk pools absent an adequate and       permanent source of public funding has never been an adequate       solution.        Between 1976 and 2010, 35 states created high-risk pools to       cover individuals who could not otherwise purchase insurance       in the private market, usually because of a pre-existing       condition. Every one of those risk pools experienced net       operating losses year after year. Furthermore, high-risk       pools did not result in lower premiums. All of them set       premiums above the non-group market average or standard rate       in the state, usually by 150-200 percent. Only a few states       provided additional premium assistance for low-income       individuals, leaving many who could not afford premiums       priced out of the program. Most states also imposed waiting       periods before covering pre-existing conditions. An       individual with a prior cancer diagnosis often had to wait 6-      12 months before the high-risk pool would cover the costs       associated with cancer treatment or follow-up survivorship       care. Most states imposed limitations on coverage with either       lifetime or annual limits. And most plans offered deductibles       of $1,000 or higher. Neither AHCA, nor the new amendment       would fully protect patients from any of those conditions.        Cancer patients and survivors need insurance coverage that       is affordable, readily accessible, and protects them from       pre-existing condition exclusions, annual and lifetime caps       on coverage and extraordinary out-of-pocket costs. Past       experience has shown that high-risk pools failed to meet       these basic needs, yet still were a drain on state budgets.        As we have indicated in our earlier letters, there are       reasonable fixes that could be made to the current law. We       stand ready to work with you to develop policies that improve       the law and encourage a robust health insurance market that       provides affordable and comprehensive coverage options.            Sincerely,                                             Christopher W. Hansen,                                                         President.     Mr. Speaker, I oppose this cruel bill on behalf of  my constituents, especially those it would hurt the most: people with  preexisting conditions, older Americans, veterans, and lower income  people.   If this bill passes, we will go back to the days when people with  preexisting conditions could be denied coverage or charged more, when  insurers could decide whether or not to cover basic care like  hospitalization, and when sick babies might hit their insurer's  lifetime coverage limit before they could even walk.   Under this bill, older Americans will pay more. In fact, Americans  aged 50 to 64 would pay premiums five times higher than others.  Veterans will lose access to tax credits that make private coverage  affordable, and lower income people will be hurt.   Taking away Medicaid expansion would put affordable coverage out of  reach for millions and set us back in the fight against the heroin,  fentanyl, and opioid crisis.   Instead of this cruel bill, let's come together to improve health  care, not take health insurance away from millions just to give tax  credits to the wealthiest. We are better than that.
