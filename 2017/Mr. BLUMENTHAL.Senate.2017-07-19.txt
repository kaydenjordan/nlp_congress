 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am here to oppose the nomination of  John Bush to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.   I have been a member of the Judiciary Committee since I was sworn in  as a U.S. Senator 6 years ago. I have participated in dozens of  confirmation hearings. Over time, I have become accustomed to hearing  nominees attempt to dodge our questions. I have rarely come across a  nominee who was as reluctant to respond to my questions as John Bush,  and I have rarely felt so unsure and concerned about how a nominee  would assume the responsibility of a Federal judgeship if confirmed.   I should emphasize to my colleagues, as well as to the people of  Connecticut, there is no nomination I take more seriously than a  Federal judgeship, having been before numerous Federal judges, district  court judges, courts of appeals judges, and the U.S. Supreme Court on  four cases. Having seen as a law clerk, as well as a practicing lawyer,  the enormous impact and profound importance of this position, I take no  job more seriously and regard no more steadfastly any responsibility  that we have.   Mr. Bush has previously stated that originalism was the ``only  principled way'' to interpret the Constitution. When our ranking  member, Senator Feinstein of California, then, very reasonably, asked  Mr. Bush if judges should always use originalism to interpret the  Constitution, his response was this: ``My personal views on  constitutional interpretation will be irrelevant if I am fortunate  enough to be confirmed to the 6th circuit.''   With all due respect to Mr. Bush, I could not disagree more strongly.  Asking judicial nominees about how they would approach the task of  interpreting the law is extraordinarily relevant to this job. First,  judges are not robots. They have views regarding how to interpret  statutes and the Constitution. Applying those views is not inconsistent  with judicial impartiality, but, especially for a judge on the U.S.  court of appeals, those views matter greatly. The American people have  a right to know what those views are for an appellate judge, who often  cannot simply follow the letter or the exact words of the Constitution  or the Supreme Court's interpretation of it. There are all kinds of  gaps that may be left and questions that may be unanswered. Circuit  court judges are routinely asked to address constitutional questions  that the Supreme Court has never addressed or has answered  incompletely, and, sometimes, yes, incorrectly. It changes its  constitutional view because of a circuit court judge who has the  temerity to say that the Supreme Court either hasn't spoken to the  issue or, perhaps, has spoken decades ago, at a time when that  interpretation of the constitutional law had relevance and correctness,  but not now.   To do our job reviewing judicial nominees of the President, we need  to know how Mr. Bush plans to do his job. His refusal to answer causes  me extraordinary concern, particularly because, in light of his  previous comments, I have a pretty good idea how he intends to continue  to apply what he believes to be the original philosophy. It is one  thing to say forthrightly and honestly: ``That's my philosophy  originally.'' It is another to completely dodge the question.   I am pleased to be on the floor today with one of my really great  colleagues, Senator Franken, who will speak after me, and to have  followed two other extraordinarily distinguished Members of this body,  Senators Murray and Hirono, to focus on these concerns regarding Mr.  Bush's approach to the question of women's healthcare and  constitutionally guaranteed reproductive rights under the Fourth  Amendment.   Let me note at the outset that our Republican colleagues have  referred to a letter of support for Mr. Bush from someone who is on the  board of the Kentucky Planned Parenthood affiliate. That letter in no  way represents the position of the organization as a whole. In fact,  the president of Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky has stated  that Mr. Bush ``lacks the independence and temperament necessary for a  Federal judgeship.'' That's the position of the President of Planned  Parenthood for Indiana and Kentucky: He ``lacks the independence and  temperament necessary for a federal judgeship.'' The issue of a woman's  right to make decisions about when she becomes pregnant and whether she  has an abortion is a constitutionally guaranteed, protected right of  every woman, regardless of where she lives and what her background is  and any other circumstances. She has that right. I need to know that  any person I vote to confirm to the Federal bench will approach cases  involving reproductive rights with the utmost care and respect for  decades of hard-won precedent.   In coming years, judges will have to determine what constitutes an  undue burden--and that is a term of law, ``undue burden''--as States  continue to pass new laws that try to restrict women's reproductive  rights. They will have to probe the boundaries of the Court's Hobby  Lobby decision on how religious and reproductive freedoms might  conflict. These issues are far from easy, and the Supreme Court has  spoken to them in many respects incompletely or unclearly.   So when a nominee will not tell me how he plans to approach  constitutional interpretation--even though his record strongly reflects  a hostility to reproductive rights--how can I evaluate? How am I to do  my job when I don't know how he is going to do his job? How am I  supposed to take seriously his pledge to faithfully apply Roe v. Wade  and related precedent?   All I have left in evaluating the Bush nomination is what he said  outside the confirmation process before he was nominated for this  position. As many of us know, Mr. Bush was a blogger, authoring  hundreds of posts over several years under a pseudonym. I have read his  blog. In the words of one of my colleagues, I am not impressed. He once  wrote:         The two greatest tragedies in our country--slavery and       abortion--relied on similar reasoning and activist justices       at the U.S. Supreme Court, first in the Dred Scott decision,       and later in Roe.    Never mind that this statement is absurd on its face. Never mind that  the NAACP called it ``offensive and dishonest.'' What concerns me at  this moment is how this is the best statement of his views on the  constitutionality of  [[Page S4072]]  women's reproductive rights that we have heard. In light of that  statement, how can we expect anything else from this nominee other than  the narrowing of reproductive rights?   Then along with the question of how John Bush might act as a judge  comes the question of how the public perceives him. When you search the  internet for information about his nomination, here is what you find on  his blog: a post suggesting that someone ``gag the House Speaker,''  referring to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, not current House  Speaker Ryan; two posts suggesting that a reader of the blog from Kenya  must somehow be connected to President Obama; a post applauding former  Presidential candidate Mike Huckabee's statements that he believes  ``life begins at conception'' and ``strongly disagrees'' with ``the  idea of same-sex marriage''; and a whole collection, a menage of  partisan and inflammatory language--to use some euphemism for what can  be found here.   Reporters who covered this nomination have used words like  ``provocative,'' ``controversial,'' and ``not normal.'' This nomination  is, indeed, not normal. It is different and profound, not in a good  way. The Courier-Journal, Bush's hometown newspaper, chose this  headline for their coverage: ``Trump's judicial nominee from Louisville  ducks questions about his controversial blog posts.'' The article went  on to quote lawyers describing his answers to Judiciary Committee  members as ``laughable,'' ``absurd,'' and ``dishonest''--all quotes.   The Judiciary Committee heard from 27 LGBT advocacy organizations and  14 reproductive rights groups, and they told us, in no uncertain terms,  ``no'' to this nominee. I agree with them.   Finally, Mr. Bush wants us to believe that his political views can be  separated from his law practice or his prospective service on the  court. When asked why he cited unreliable news sources like World Net  Daily in his writings, he repeatedly shrugged off the question and  declined answering, saying political analysis is different from legal  analysis. There is truth to that point. Prior political activity is no  disqualification, in and of itself, for serving as a judge, but the  importance of public confidence in the judiciary is profound. The  confidence of people in the fairness and impartiality of our judges is  profoundly important and necessary. The courts have no army. They have  no police force of their own. Their rulings are credible and  enforceable because of confidence in the fairness and objectivity of  our judges.   Someone who is so clearly unqualified, by virtue of his record, I  cannot support. I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting against  Mr. Bush's nomination.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.
