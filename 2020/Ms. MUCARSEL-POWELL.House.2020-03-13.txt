 Madam Speaker, Miami-Dade County has its first  two confirmed cases of COVID-19, and we are all very concerned. Across  the country, events are canceled and store shelves are empty. With  anxieties high, we are receiving mixed messages when what we need right  now is coherent direction.   It is discouraging to see countries like South Korea respond much  more effectively than we are. While they screen tens of thousands, we  have sick patients and frustrated doctors who cannot access testing.   This is not right. We must make tests available and accessible to  everyone. We must strengthen our healthcare system so we have the beds,  the masks, the respirators, and the supplies to respond to a surge in  cases. We must provide relief to our working families and local  businesses struggling to cope with this virus.   Madam Speaker, I believe we have it within us to fulfill these needs,  but we all must come together for a comprehensive response to meet this  moment. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                            ____________________
