 Madam President, today I rise to honor and pay  tribute to Todd Haugen, a Minnesota legend who is retiring on November  18 after 42 years as a local radio host in Bemidji.   A proud graduate of Bemidji State University, Todd did not always  intend to become a radio host. He graduated with a major in geography  with no radio experience, originally hoping to pursue a legal career  and only taking a part-time gig as an afternoon radio DJ to earn some  more money. Todd figured that any job where he got to meet and  interview Barbara Mandell, one of the biggest country singers in the  country, couldn't be half bad. But he fell in love with his part-time  pursuit, drawn to the critical role that local radio stations play in  keeping communities informed.   Todd has been a staple on local airwaves since 1980 when he first  joined the team at KB101. With the exception of 6 months in 1985, Todd  has remained at KB101 throughout his entire career, where he has hosted  the morning show for almost four decades.   For generations of families in the Bemidji area, Todd's voice was as  integral to their mornings as their breakfast and coffee. Commuters  counted on him for weather updates, students looked to him for the  score of high school sports games, and the entire community depended on  him for honest news reporting and candid interviews.   Through his daily Chatabout public affairs show, Todd has interviewed  countless local elected officials and leaders, highlighting the issues  that matter the most to his listeners, from city council agendas and  school board meetings, to public safety guidance and flu season tips.  As Todd says, public service and helping people is the best part of his  job.   But not all of Todd's conversations were so serious. Throughout his  four decades in local radio, he also got the chance to show off his  light-hearted side, participating in cow milking contests, riding  elephants, and even introducing a wrestling match--all for the  enjoyment of his listeners.   Todd's engaging and entertaining work has won him a record six  National Association of Broadcasters Crystal Awards, a National  Association of Broadcasters Crystal Heritage Award, and two National  Association of Broadcasters Education Foundation--NABEF--Service to  America Awards. He has also been a two-time finalist for the National  Association of Broadcasters Marconi Award for Small Market Personality  of the Year.   Todd's service to his community has gone beyond just keeping them  informed and entertained on the radio.  [[Page S6689]]  He has done so much to give back, from hosting Hubbard Bemidji's annual  Radiothon To End Child Abuse since the event's inception in 1988 to  serving on the local school board this year to fill a vacancy. After  all Todd has done for Bemidji, he deserves the chance to spend more  time with his wife and his two daughters and to finally turn off his  alarm clock.   Todd, even though Bemidji will miss having you on the airwaves, I am  wishing you and your family all the best in your next chapter.                            ____________________
