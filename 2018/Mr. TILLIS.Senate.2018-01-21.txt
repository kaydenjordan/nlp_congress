 Mr. President, I reserve the right to object.    Mr. President, like the Senator from Connecticut, I don't  understand why we are here this weekend myself. I don't understand why  a continuing resolution--all the provisions in it have the broad  support of both sides of the aisle--has actually gotten us to a point  where we are putting so many people in jeopardy of not getting the  critical services they need. I don't understand that at all.   I think a simple request of extending the government for 4 weeks and  allowing the CHIP program to be authorized for 6 years makes a lot of  sense while we work through the issues we have on the DACA challenge.  It is something that I personally invested in. It is something that I  am really working very hard to come up with a solution to. But instead  of spending time on providing a solution to that problem, we are  playing these sorts of games, and now we are talking about funding the  government for 24 hours. That is not the way to actually conduct the  business of the U.S. Senate. For that reason, I object.    Mr. President, I ask that the Chair read rule XIX.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am glad  to hear that the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Connecticut all  want to get the government funded. I also think Wright-Patterson is a  great military installation.   I actually come from a State that is the home of the Global Response  Force, the 82nd Airborne, down in Fort Bragg. When the President calls  and they want to send somebody into harm's way, that is where they call  first. It is also the home of 45 percent of all marines that serve in  the Marine Corps. I worry a lot about the message we are sending our  men and women in uniform when we can't get our act together here.  Everybody in suits, everybody in the Senate, everybody here tonight is  playing games with funding our government.   My colleague just asked for a 1-day CR. That didn't happen. Now you  are asking for a 3-day CR. How about this? Why don't we stay here until  we get this done? Why don't we realize that, look, the daylight is not  going to come until about 8 or 9 hours. We can get this done before 9  o'clock tomorrow morning. Instead of asking for these half measures--a  1-day CR, a 3-day CR--why don't we get in a room tonight and solve our  problems? Why are we actually kicking the can down the road a little  bit--1 day, 3 days? We were trying to get 1 month done.   For that reason, Mr. President, I object.    I yield.    I do.    Actually, what I want to work on is funding that goes at  least for the next 4 weeks and maybe the next year. I want to get to  regular order. I actually want to provide certainty to men and women in  uniform who are out there fighting in harm's way, and we are sitting  here.    You have asked me a question, and I want to answer it. I  actually want to provide the funding to the military, to the men and  women who are working hard to protect this Nation, and that doesn't  happen through procedural discussions. It happens through----    I do.    Mr. President, just to cool down the temperature, why  don't we actually get back to what we tried to accomplish just a couple  of days ago--a 4-week CR that funded our military, that funded our  veterans, that funded CHIP for 6 years--and then get on to all the  other things that we want to do.   I, for one, have a lot of passion for coming up with a solution for  the DACA population. It is not going to happen tomorrow or the day  after tomorrow, but I believe it is going to happen.   What I prefer to do is actually to get on to funding the government  and then to get on to all of these other matters that are critically  important to all of us.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object.   I agree with the Senator from New Jersey, we want to fund the CHIP  program, which is exactly why we voted to try to extend it for 6 years  just a couple of days ago. The Senator voted against it. I agree with  him that the States are beginning to run out of money, and we need to  come up with a reauthorization soon, but this looks more like a way to  atone for a bad vote that was just made a couple of days ago on the  part of people on the floor today. What we need to do is go back and  fund the government.   I also care about the veterans who would have been covered by the  continuing resolution the Senator from New Jersey voted against. I care  about the military and military families who are affected by the CR.   I think, instead of doing these sorts of measures that give some  level of cover or comfort to those who voted against these same things  just a couple days ago, why don't we get back on funding the  government, opening it back up, making the right decision, and  resolving our differences but, at the end of the day, not through these  half measures.   For that reason, I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object.   First and foremost, I thank the Federal employees. I thank anybody  who works for the Federal Government for all the hard work they do. I  also apologize to them on behalf of the actions of some people in this  body who voted not to fund the government just a couple of days ago. I  hope we get to a point where we can fund the government and move on and  resolve our differences on very important issues, the DACA issue being  one that is very personally important to me.   As a practical matter, I think we will take care of the Federal  employees because they work hard, and they deserve that. What I will  tell you is the effect of these CRs--and something that I will say is  one of the reasons why I hate these continuing resolutions. Here is  what happens every time a CR is threatened to occur or a shutdown is  threatened to occur.   One of the reasons the short-term CRs make no sense to me is because  if you did a 1-day CR, then the good news is, everybody would come to  work tomorrow, and then tomorrow afternoon, you say: You are probably  not going to come back on Tuesday or the 3-day, where you say: The good  news is you are going to be here on Wednesday, but the bad news is, we  are going to have to furlough you again on Thursday.   At the end of the day, we need to fund the government. We need to  fund our military, we need to fund our veterans, we need to extend the  CHIP program for 6 years, based on the proposal which was voted down by  my colleagues, and my colleague who is offering this particular motion.  That is not the way to do it.   I want our leaders to get together, I want our Members to get  together, and solve this problem. These are half measures that do not  address the root problem. The root problem is getting people together,  getting them in a room, and funding the government.   For that reason, I object.    Mr. President, I just want to reiterate to Federal  employees that I fully believe that, just like these dramas in the  past, we will fund the government; they will be paid; and I apologize  on behalf of those who voted against the CR just a few days ago that  they are being taken through this process.   I, for one, have been here for 3 years. I have never voted against a  debt ceiling increase because I believe we need to pay the bills we  have obligated ourselves to. I have not ever voted for a government  shutdown because I believe we should do the work we are paid to do.   I will say, in closing, I also agree that Senator Heller has a great  idea. When we get into this mode and we can't actually fund the  government, then why on Earth should we be paid for what we are doing?   I don't think any U.S. Senator should be paid a dime; I don't think  any U.S. Senator should get healthcare every single day we fail to do  our job, and that is something hopefully we can get unanimous consent  tonight to put forth to say: Until we solve this problem, then maybe we  shouldn't get paid; maybe we shouldn't get a dime; maybe we shouldn't  get healthcare; maybe we should actually put our money where our mouth  is. Then maybe we can get some things done.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to  go back and talk about the concept of doing our jobs. We have done a  lot over the last 12 months. For people to say we haven't done  anything--let's go back and talk about the 12 circuit judges, Neil  Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, extraordinary regulatory reform--a number  of very positive things.   I know that your perspective is different based on what side of the  aisle you are on, but I am actually very proud of what we as a Congress  have accomplished and what this President has accomplished.                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 1301    Reserving the right to object--I do object, but I ask unanimous  consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of  Calendar No. 36, H.R. 1301; that the amendment at the desk, which  provides for full funding for authorized activities in the National  Defense Authorization Act, be considered and agreed to; that the bill,  as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.
