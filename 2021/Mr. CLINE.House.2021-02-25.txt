 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Luray  Bulldogs Girls Basketball Team who won the Virginia Class 2 State  championship this weekend.   After falling just short to Gate City in last year's state title  game, the Lady Bulldogs were ready to enact their revenge in Saturday's  rematch.   It was a nail-biter of a game as the two teams traded leads heading  into the fourth quarter. And with just a minute and 40 seconds  remaining, the game was tied at 54 apiece.   Following back-to-back steals and uncontested layups by senior,  Brynlee Burrill, the Lady Bulldogs pulled ahead by four and maintained  their lead. When all was said and done, Luray had avenged their  previous loss to Gate City with a 61-56 victory. This win capped off a  perfect 13-0 season and was the first State title in the program's  history.   The team has had a remarkable 2 years, with an overall record of 42- 2; and after battling obstacles all season, the win shows true  toughness, determination, and resiliency.   Congratulations to Coach Lucas and the entire Lady Bulldogs squad on  this incredible achievement.                            ____________________
