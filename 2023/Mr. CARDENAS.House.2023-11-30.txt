 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to celebrate the centennial  of a beautiful neighborhood that has contributed to the rich culture of  the San Fernando Valley, Toluca Lake.   Prior to the first Europeans' arrival, the Tongva people were the  first inhabitants of Toluca Lake. They established their homes on the  banks of the Los Angeles River there.   In 1889, General Charles Forman purchased the territory on which  modern-day Toluca Lake lies and, by 1893, applied for the first post  office and named the town Toluca Ranch, which he claimed was a Paiute  Indian word for beautiful and fertile valley.   Just like the rest of the San Fernando Valley at the time, Toluca  Lake was lined with crops of satsuma plums, cling peaches, Moorpark  apricots, and much more.   The lake in Toluca Ranch, which has starred in many movies, was very  attractive for movie producers, which in turn resulted in the movie  industry beginning to develop there. In 1915, Carl Laemmle built  Universal Studios in the area, after which several other studios, like  Warner Bros. Studios and others, started flooding into the community.   After the general's death in 1919, the ranch was sold to a group of  investors, who tried to build a bedroom community around the studios  and named the area Toluca Lake Park. By 1923, another group of  investors purchased the property and built a housing community, which  is now called Toluca Lake.   Toluca Lake has been home to many famous American artists and  celebrities, such as Frank Sinatra, Bob  [[Page H5989]]  Hope, Bing Crosby, Bette Davis, Steve Carell, Andy Garcia, Melissa  McCarthy, Amelia Earhart, and many more. President Ronald Reagan and  his wife, Nancy Reagan, even had their wedding reception in Toluca  Lake.   Today, Toluca Lake is a key community of the entertainment industry,  where working families can pursue the American Dream and tell stories  to the world. Toluca Lake is a place of work for many below-line  workers, such as hairdressers, painters, carpenters, and caterers.   One person I would like to acknowledge was an immigrant. He came from  Jalisco, Mexico, and worked at Toluca Lake's famous diner, Patys, for  over 10 years. His name is Santos Padilla, the father of our U.S.  Senator Alex Padilla.   Like Santos, thousands of people can provide for their families there  in Toluca Lake, and some even make it their home. Many of these  hardworking people are a part of organizations such as Toluca Lake  Homeowners Association, Toluca Lake Chamber of Commerce, Toluca Lake  Garden Club, Greater Toluca Lake Neighborhood Council, Toluca Lake  Beautification Partners, and even a magazine called Toluca Lake  Magazine.   They have volunteered thousands of hours for the community. They have  organized countless community cleanups, holiday parades, and farmers  markets. Each organization is committed to addressing the diverse needs  of residents, property owners, businesses, and local stakeholders.   With its rich culture and diverse constituents, Toluca Lake continues  to be an extraordinary part of the San Fernando Valley. There are many  communities named Toluca--in Mexico, Montana, Illinois, and North  Carolina--but there is only one Toluca Lake.   Congratulations to Toluca Lake on its 100-year anniversary.                    Remembering Manuel ``Manny'' Figueras     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Manuel ``Manny'' Figueras,  an amazing public servant who spent his entire life improving the lives  of many people from the city of Los Angeles and the San Fernando  Valley.   Manny was born on New Year's Eve in 1961 in Banes, Cuba. Just like  many Cuban families, the Figuerases left Cuba in 1968 to pursue their  dream of liberty and freedom here in the United States. The Figuerases  immigrated first to Miami, Florida, and then came to Los Angeles,  California.   Manny attended Roosevelt Middle School and Hoover High School in  Glendale and finished his education at Glendale College with a degree  in business administration.   Manny began his career in public service working for Councilmember  Richard Alarcon. I saw Manny's love for and commitment to his  constituents firsthand. As a field deputy, he was the first person a  constituent saw when they were trying to solve a difficult issue in  their community.   Manny had a special talent for helping mom-and-pop businesses. His  ability to listen compassionately and then develop a plan to cut  through the red tape of government made a difference in the lives of  many businessowners and families.   Even after Manny moved on from his life of service in the Los Angeles  City Council, constituents had his personal phone numbers and would  always call him, and he was always there to help. In his trademark calm  and caring manner, Manny would advocate for constituents in communities  in North Hollywood, Mission Hills, Sylmar, and beyond.    We lost Manny on October 11, 2023. He was surrounded by family and  friends. Manny is survived by his mother, Ana Figueras; his brother,  Juan Figueras; his sister-in-law, Dora Figueras; his nephew, Andrew  Figueras; his niece, Ariana LaBorico; and his nephew-in-law, Dylan  LaBorico.   We miss Manny very much.                            ____________________
