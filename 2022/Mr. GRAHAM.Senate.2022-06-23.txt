 Mr. President, I rise today to commend the North  Greenville University Crusaders baseball team for winning the 2022 NCAA  Baseball Division II National Championship.   The Crusaders outscored their four World Series opponents by a  combined 34-12. Their victory earned the program its first national  championship and marked the second Conference Carolinas baseball team  to win the title.   Throughout the season, Landon Powell, head coach of the Crusaders,  was consistently a role model to the players. When he was hired in  2014, the Crusaders were 8-35 and had three and one-half scholarship  players. Coach Powell turned the team around and guided them to a 29-25  winning record in his first year; since then, the Crusaders have  consistently averaged more than 41 wins per season.   On the field, Jax Cash went three for four at the plate and drove in  the final run of the game. Reece Fields pitched 5.0 innings, allowing  one run on six hits, three walks, eight strikeouts, and was named the  tournament MVP. Nate Roof pitched 3.0 innings, allowing no runs, two  hits, and a walk. The entire team should be proud of their hard work  and accomplishments. The North Greenville baseball team displayed  outstanding dedication and teamwork throughout the season and brought  pride to the State of South Carolina. The university, under the  leadership of Dr. Gene C. Fant, Jr., and Coach Powell, has much to be  proud of, and I look forward to another great season by the Crusaders.   I ask that our colleagues join me in congratulating the North  Greenville University Crusaders baseball team for winning the 2022 NCAA  Baseball Division II National Championship.                            ____________________
