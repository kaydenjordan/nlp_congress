 Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of Gun Violence Survivors  Week because I, too, am a survivor.   This week, just a month into the new year, there will have been more  gun deaths in the United States than our peer countries will experience  in an entire year--one month.   I wear black today. I wear black all week long to stand for every  survivor, every victim, every family that mourns the unnecessary gun  deaths that happen each and every single day.   I met earlier this week with Mary Miller-Strobel, whose brother, Ben,  was a combat veteran suffering from depression and PTSD. Ben had lost  30 pounds after his tour. Returning home, his father asked him about  his weight loss. Ben replied that he couldn't eat, and he said: ``It's  just so hard out there, Dad. It smells like death.''   Ben was seeking treatment at a local VA hospital, but his family  continued to worry about him. They worried that, in a moment of  desperation, Ben might end his own life.   Mary and her father drove to every gun store in their area. At each  store, they showed photos of Ben, pleading with them not to sell him a  gun.   Ben Miller died by suicide. He used a gun that he bought at a local  gun store.   Too often we are told that we must accept these tragedies. We are  told that, instead of changing our laws, we must have more active  shooter drills, more first graders coming home with tears in their  eyes, 6-year-olds asked to decide for themselves whether they are more  likely to survive by hiding in a closet or if they should rush the  gunman; more mothers reading messages from their children as they are  locked inside a school and they are pleading: Mom, if I don't make it,  I love you, and I appreciate everything that you have done for me; more  vigils each and every day for those that we continue to lose.   Too often, we are told that we must accept these tragedies. I refuse  to accept that. Millions of Americans across the country refuse to  accept that. This Congress should refuse to accept that.   We refuse to accept that, because we have passed bipartisan  legislation that will help save lives, legislation like the Bipartisan  Background Checks Act, a commonsense bill that will keep guns away from  those who should not have them.  [[Page H769]]                                     time  1015    We have passed H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019,  which would close the Charleston loophole.   We have passed a bill that gives the CDC and the NIH $25 million to  study gun violence, the first of its kind in over 20 years.   I have even introduced a bill that would give loved ones and law  enforcement more tools to keep guns away from those who are a danger to  themselves or to others; tools that may have helped Mary save her  brother, Ben's life.   With every unnecessary shooting, we continue to feel the weight of  this injustice; and I personally know that sense of injustice.   When my son, Jordan, was killed, I found myself asking America, how  could you allow this to happen to my child, my family, to my Jordan?  And after Parkland, I knew that this country needed to stand up and to  do something about it.   I knew that I had something that I had to do, and I knew that I  needed to stand up for families like mine in Marietta, Georgia, who are  terrified that their children will not come home from school, and they  are terrified of being me.   So I made a promise to my community that I would act. And I promised  that I would take all the love and the support and protection that I  had given to my child and use it to serve the American people. I  promised I would always be a mother on a mission to save the lives of  children from across America, children like my son.   During this Gun Violence Survivors Week, I pray that we all remember  that this is in our hands. Families like Mary's, children graduating  from high school, communities in Charleston, in Columbine, in Parkland,  in Sandy Hook, in Dayton, in El Paso, in Las Vegas, in the hundreds of  places where shooters and shootings don't even make the news. Their  lives are in our hands.   I thank my colleagues, and survivors, and volunteers, and advocates  across this country for their tireless work to protect our families.   May God bless us all in this fight to save American lives.                            ____________________
