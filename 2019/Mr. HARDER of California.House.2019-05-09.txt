 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my  amendment. My legislation would simply require the Federal Government  to issue an expert analysis of the impact of junk plans on mental  healthcare access. People deserve access to mental healthcare, and we  don't know how many people will lose that access if these junk plans  become used more widely.   That is exactly what my amendment would tell us.   People who are struggling with depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, or  substance use disorder deserve coverage. We are talking about real  people in our communities who need help, and they should get it.   That is especially true because of the stigma surrounding mental  health issues. If you tell your friends that you have cancer, they tell  you to get help. If you tell your friends you have depression, they  tell you to tough it out or go to the gym.   Without access to mental healthcare, a lot of people end up self- medicating. That is why we have to make sure that they are covered with  real insurance, not junk plans.                                time  1515    These plans are a scam.   I heard a horror story from a woman in Stanislaus County about her  family's experience with a junk plan before the Affordable Care Act.  Her daughter went off to school and got cheap, university-sponsored  insurance.   After a couple of years, she had a mental health issue present, but  she was completely denied coverage for the treatment that she needed.  Even though she paid premiums for years, she wasn't covered, and her  family had to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket. Years later, they  are still paying it off today, more than 10 years after her mental  health episode.   That is a common story because only about half of these plans cover  mental healthcare, and only about one-third cover substance use  disorder, and that is a huge problem in the Central Valley, especially  for young people.   It is in people's twenties that they start showing signs of a lot of  mental health problems, and this often coincides with the development  of substance use disorders. People who turn 26 have to get off their  parents' insurance. They pick the cheapest thing they can find.   If we don't pass this amendment, millions of people who have similar  stories will be denied coverage for mental health issues when they need  it most.   That is a scam. That is what my amendment demands.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my  amendment.   As I stated in my previous remarks, my amendment would simply require  the Federal Government to issue an expert analysis of the impact of  junk plans on mental health access.   People deserve access to mental healthcare, and we need to know how  many people will lose that access if these junk plans become used more  widely.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.
