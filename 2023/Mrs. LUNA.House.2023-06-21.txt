 Mr. Speaker, I call up the privileged resolution noticed  earlier today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Americans do not trust Congress. From the highest levels  of office, an elected Member of this body enabled the fraudulent  spending of $32 million out of the pockets of our American people and  threw it down the drain to knowingly chase ghosts, all for political  gain.   This man occupied a position of the highest trust and authority.   As Chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Schiff  launched an all-out political campaign built on baseless distortions  against a sitting U.S. President at the expense of every single citizen  in this country and the honor of the House of Representatives.   With access to sensitive information unavailable to most Members of  Congress, and certainly not accessible to the American people,  Representative Schiff abused his privileges, claiming to know the  truth, while leaving Americans in the dark about this web of lies.  These were lies so severe that they altered the course of the country  forever: the lie that President Donald Trump colluded with Russia to  steal the 2016 Presidential election revealed to be completely false by  numerous investigations, including the Durham report; the lie that the  Steele dossier--a folder of falsified and since completely debunked  collusion accusations funded by the Democratic Party--had any shred of  credibility, yet Representative Schiff read it into the Congressional  Record as fact; the lies concocted and compiled in a false memo that  was used to lie to the FISA court, to precipitate domestic spying on  U.S. citizen, Carter Page, violating American civil liberties.   Not only was this an egregious abuse of Representative Schiff's  privileged access to classified information, but this memo was littered  with 17 major mistakes and omissions. The groundless memo violated  Carter Page's civil liberties, publicly assassinated his character, and  subjected him to multiple, abusive, unlawful investigations.   Representative Schiff exploited his position as Chair of the Intel  Committee at every opportunity possible, threatening national security,  undermining our duly-elected President, and bringing dishonor upon the  institution. Perhaps most unforgivable, Representative Schiff ripped  apart American families across the country with repeated false  narratives.   His own political good was served by permanently destroying family  relationships and sowing lasting division across our land, which we  live with every single day.   The perpetrators of this web of deceit became mainstays on cable  news, waking up every morning with one goal: to lie, lie, lie to the  American people that there was direct evidence of a Russia collusion.   Despite transcripts from Representative Schiff's investigation  showing that the Director of National Intelligence, former Obama  Attorney General, former Deputy Attorney General, and FBI Director, to  name a few, went on record telling Representative Schiff's committee  that there was no direct evidence for his criminal conspiracy, yet to  this day, Representative Schiff actively fundraises off of his  exploitation of Americans, as if robbing them from the truth and $32  million in taxpayer dollars is not enough.                                time  1415    Can anyone in this Chamber comprehend this list of crimes and yet  somehow believe there should not be an answer for it?   This is not a partisan act. This is not a conservative versus liberal  vote. This is a clear vote between right and wrong, and I urge my  colleagues to do the right thing.   I will end with repeating what I started with. The American people do  not trust Congress. The cyclical pattern of lies has worn down the  credibility of every institution and every official in the United  States Government. You see it. I see it.   If we run away from this opportunity to hold this man accountable,  there is only one fault and that is of ourselves. We will betray the  people who trusted us and sent us here to do the right thing. We will  be responsible for the end of any shred of justice in this body. We  will reject the duty that we swore an oath to protect upon taking  office.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Ogles).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. Miller).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Langworthy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from South Carolina.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Colorado (Mrs. Boebert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Colorado.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Ms. Greene).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Mills).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Wyoming (Ms. Hageman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I take a second to thank all of my colleagues from across the aisle  who have spoken today for putting themselves on the Record defending  the Russia collusion hoax, even after the Burisma payments to Hunter  Biden and the big guy have been made public. The Congressional Record  is a very useful accountability tool.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  remind people that this is on behalf of the American people in  restoring order to the House and in an effort to bring back trust,  which is something that this institution has lacked for many years.   I am very proud and I own my vote in saying that I will be voting for  the censure of Adam Schiff.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As a United States Air Force veteran and a proud Mexican-American  woman that happens to be almost 8 months pregnant, I say that in regard  to integrity, what happened in this country, what happened with the  divide that occurred after the fact that the Russia  [[Page H3021]]  collusion hoax was pushed down the throats of the American people is  not what I would consider integrity.   If we want to talk about these little fun games and comments back and  forth, we are not here about Donald Trump. We are not here about  January 6. We are here about the former chairman of the Intelligence  Committee who used a lie that broke apart this country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Again, as I said, this is not about Donald Trump. This is about  holding accountable someone who exploited their official position and  had access to information that most Members of Congress do not have  access to and bringing accountability back to the American people.   Regardless of whatever the gentlewoman from California says or anyone  else, you guys are not being honest about the focus of this resolution  and this censure. That is exactly why we are here today to debate it  out.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
