 Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that I be  permitted to change my vote on the rollcall vote earlier today. The  vote was No. 65. I voted no. It was my intention to vote aye. It will  not affect the outcome.    Mr. President, it is Thursday afternoon, and it is the  time I love to come down to the floor. It is one of my favorite times  of the week  [[Page S1583]]  because I get to talk about an Alaskan who has done something really,  really important for their community, for their State, and for their  country. I know the pages like the speech because I talk about stories  in Alaska--the great State of Alaska and what is happening in the State  right now. Sometimes I call this person the Alaskan of the Week.  Usually, it is one person. Sometimes we fudge a little and recognize  more than one person. Today we are going to recognize our Alaskans of  the Week.   In any case, these are people who help their communities, help their  country, and oftentimes do something that is unheralded, nobody knows  about, very few know about, so I like to come down and tell the country  about what they are doing. As you know, Alaska is a big State. It holds  a lot of imagination for our Nation--the last frontier, with good  reason, because we are filled with resilient people, some who have  lived in Alaska for thousands and thousands of years, building  communities in some of the most extreme weather environments on the  planet, and they are tough, my constituents. They are also kind, and  they make it through our tough winters.   It is below zero in many, many parts of the State--well below zero.  We make it through these winters through toughness, ingenuity, and,  importantly, looking out for one another.   Last week, I highlighted a heroic Coast Guard rescuer, Evan Grills,  in a real epic story for those who listened to it--what this young  scout swimmer--rescue swimmer did in his first mission ever in the  Coast Guard, something that people should remember for a long, long  time.   This week, I am going to talk about another rescue mission--an only- in-Alaska mission--and I am going to recognize four extraordinary young  Alaskans who stuck together, toughed it out, looked out for one  another, and were rescued in another perilous situation. They are  Christopher Johnson, age 14; Frank Johnson, age 8; Ethan Camille, age  7; and Trey Camille, 2 years old. All of them are alive and recovering  because of their own ingenuity, determination, toughness, and looking  out for one another. These four boys are from Nunam Iqua, a Yupik  village 495 miles northwest of Anchorage.   Home to about 200 people, this village is a close-knit Yupik  community on the south fork of the Yukon River. A 2005 mission  statement, written by community leaders and elders, describes the  village like this: ``a small quiet community of family, relatives, and  friends working together [to pursue] our Yupik way of lifestyle with  respect to our surrounding land and waters for subsistence.''   Like many places in Alaska, temperatures there can be extreme, as  they would be on February 2, when these four boys were rambunctiously  playing in the house. Irene, the grandmother of three and mother of  one, was watching them that day. It was her birthday. As boys do, they  were getting restless. They wanted to get outside. Irene, wanting to  have them get some exercise and play, rightly encouraged them to get  outside in the great outdoors, but the weather was turning a little bit  ugly. Storms were in the forecast.   Irene later said:         They have to know how to be outside. They are tough Alaskan       kids. There's always going to be a storm coming. Besides,       their elders and their grandfather taught them to be prepared       for the weather.    This is teaching from their grandparents and mothers and fathers.   So the four boys--Christopher, Frank, Ethan, and Trey--trudged  outside to partake in one of the most popular winter hobbies we have in  Alaska, snowmachining. Snowmachining is often referred to as  snowmobiling by many Americans, but I am going to call it by its proper  name, snowmachining. Due to a lack of road systems in our State, it  also happens to be a primary mode of transportation during the winter  months across dozens and dozens of villages throughout Alaska.   After they went riding around the small village, the boys were going  to call it a day, when they spotted a fox. They spotted a fox. Like  curious young boys do, the irresistible urge to trace this fox began,  and they chased it out onto the tundra. Before they knew it, they lost  the fox. The snowmachine was now stuck in the snow, and they were lost  in a white blizzard. They were lost.   Chris, the 14-year-old--the oldest of the group, the leader--was  determined to lift the snowmachine free of the snow. He lifted it so  hard that it was later discovered he suffered a hernia. This is one  tough kid.   Eventually, the machine unfortunately ran out of gas, and the young  boys were miles and miles away from their village and lost. They began  tracking through the deep snow in whiteout conditions in a direction  they thought was the way back home.   At one point, one of the boys briefly took off his glove, which the  wind promptly took away in the storm. Yet they continued walking and  walking into winds as high as 60 miles per hour and wind chills way,  way below zero.   After fighting the deep snow and whiteout conditions for 4 miles,  Chris decided it was time to try to build a snow cave for shelter. That  is a smart young man, knowing how to survive.   They did it. They built a shelter out of snow--a hole for them to  crawl into and escape some of these most brutal wind gusts.   Now, a snow cave is only used as a last resort, but this was the last  resort, and these young boys knew it. So they crawled in, and they  huddled, and they waited for a rescue.   Back in the village, as you can imagine, the boys' family was getting  frantic. They called out to the community to help search for them, and  that is what people did. All throughout the community, they couldn't be  found. And then, as often happens in our State, the Coast Guard, the  National Guard, and local search and rescue groups from neighboring  villages were all activated--Alaskans throughout the State going to  look for these four boys. It was all hands on deck.   Irene and Karen, one of the mothers, of three of them, were  heartsick. Hours and hours went by. The whole State was holding its  breath. It had been over 24 hours. The cold night fell. Around 2 a.m.,  the search and rescue was called off.   In the snow cave, however, these young, tough Alaskan boys continued  to protect each other. Almost 20 miles away from home, they huddled.  They tried to keep each other warm to keep each other alive.   Ethan didn't have a glove. Christopher was only wearing sweatpants,  and they were particularly concerned for the 2-year-old, Trey. First,  one of them crawled on top of Trey, but they were afraid that might be  too much for him, so they created a kind of crisscross barrier to keep  this young 2-year-old alive and warm as best they could.   The 8-year-old, Frank, refused to close his eyes throughout the night  for fear of falling asleep and really never waking up. So he  continuously stayed awake and poked the other boys throughout the night  to keep them awake, which was successful.   The next morning, the storm had cleared, the sun started to come up,  and the search throughout the State, with all of these other Alaskans  looking for these four boys, continued. For hours and hours, the search  team kept their eyes peeled for anything unusual on the tundra.   About 1 hour before the sun was going to go down again the next day,  the search party from Scammon Bay--about 50 miles south--saw something.  They knew how to read the tundra. They knew what a snow drift would  look like, and this one looked different. Then they saw movement.   The search party investigated and came upon the four missing boys  huddled and bundled together. Because it looked like one big mass, at  first they didn't think any of the boys were alive, and then they  realized what was going on. They were protecting the baby.   One of the rescuers, Herschel Sundown, told a reporter they were  protecting Trey. The rescue team immediately got to work warming the  boys up, and within 15 minutes, a Coast Guard helicopter--our brave men  and women of the Coast Guard, always on the scene--quickly transported  these boys, after picking them up, to a local hospital.   Ethan, the 7-year-old, is now recovering from severe frostbite on his  hands, but all the kids are back at school and doing well.  [[Page S1584]]    The rescuer, Herschel Sundown said:         [Honestly], I don't know how they survived. The will to       survive in these young boys is amazing. I have never seen       anything like [it].    Irene, the grandmother of the three and mother of one, is so very  proud of them. She said: If I were to get lost in Alaska in the  wilderness, I would want to be with these four boys. So would I.   She also asked for the prayers of the country for Ethan and for his  hand to heal. And that is starting to happen.   These are the kind of young men and boys in Alaska who make us so  unique, tough, and resourceful. They uplift us, and they make us proud.  They are the protectors of their lands, their homes, and, importantly,  each other.   To the rescue crews, thank you again for your hard work and  perseverance and for risking your own lives for these young boys.   To Christopher, Frank, Ethan, and little 2-year-old Trey, thank you  for your inspiration, for your ingenuity, for your toughness, and for  being able to survive in the elements and looking out for each other.  Thank you for staying alive and staying safe, and congratulations on  being our Alaskans of the Week.   I yield the floor.    Thank you.                            Secure U.S. Bases Act     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Kyle Wood,  an intern in my office, be granted floor privileges for the remainder  of the month.
