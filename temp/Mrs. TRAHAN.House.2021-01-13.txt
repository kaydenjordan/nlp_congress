 Madam Speaker, I stand before you today in disbelief-- disbelief that, after the President incited a violent mob to commit an  act of insurrection and remained silent as police officers were  assaulted, the Capitol was ransacked, and Members of this body fled for  their lives, that there are still members of his party who refuse to  hold him accountable.   It is because of that inaction that there is only one path forward to  put an end to this Presidency. Donald Trump must be impeached, removed  from office, and barred from ever holding the Office of the Presidency  again.
