 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2581, the  Verify First Act, which was introduced by my colleague, good friend,  and fellow Pennsylvanian Lou Barletta. This is a simple piece of  legislation that ensures no American taxpayer dollars are used to fund  healthcare for those who are here undocumented.   Congress, the American people, and my constituents were told that,  under ObamaCare, illegal immigrants would not be eligible for tax  credits. Instead, the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs  Committee issued a report detailing that, as of June 2015, over half a  million people without legal status have received up to $750 million in  taxpayer-funded subsidies. No record can be found if any of this was  ever recovered.   It is time that we ensure our taxpayers that their dollars are only  going to those with legal status. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes''  on this legislation.
