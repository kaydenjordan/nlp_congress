 Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 147.   Stated against:    Madam Speaker, I was unable to vote on Roll Call 147,  House Resolution 403, the rule providing for consideration of H. Res.  275 and H.R. 1629.   I intended to vote ``yes'' on the resolution.   Additionally, I was unable to cast the vote of Representative Maxine  Waters by proxy. Had I been able to cast the vote of Representative  Waters on House Resolution 403 by proxy, Ms. Waters would have been  recorded as a ``yes.''                            ____________________
