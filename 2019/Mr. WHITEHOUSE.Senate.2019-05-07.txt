 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Before I begin, let me say how nice it was to be with  the Presiding Officer in her home State at the McCain Institute this  weekend.                            ____________________     Madam President, pick up the paper these days, and it  is hard to miss the headlines about corporate America getting serious  about reducing carbon emissions. Companies are purchasing renewable  power. They are moving into carbon-neutral office buildings. They are  purchasing electric vehicle fleets. They are developing new  technologies and products for the transition to a carbon economy. Many  are forcing some degree of sustainability out of their supply chains.  All of this is important work and the companies that are leading in  these areas deserve real applause.   But--you knew there was going to be a ``but,'' and here it is-- corporations alone reducing their own carbon emissions or designing new  low-carbon technologies will not win the fight against climate change.  If you want to fail on climate change while looking good, that will  work, but if you actually want to win--if you want to keep us between  1.5 and 2 degrees in temperature increase--you will fail.   A new report, ``The Blind Spot,'' from the Environmental Defense  Fund, makes crystal clear that individual corporate efforts to reduce  their own carbon emissions will not be enough. Here is what it says:  ``While voluntary actions by companies to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions are important, only public policy can deliver the pace and  scale of reductions necessary to avoid the worst impacts of climate  change.''   ``Public policy''--that is us. That is Congress.   EDF is not alone. Report after report has shown that we will fail  without government action. But as engaged as so much of corporate  America is in greening its own operations, they are almost totally  absent from the halls of Congress when it comes to climate change-- AWOL, no place.   So government sits, stalled by the fossil fuel industry, and does  nothing serious. As a Senator, I am an inhabitant of this political  ecosystem. I observe how this works. Consider this the field report of  the biologist who lives in the jungle.   The sad reality of our political ecosystem is that post-Citizens  United, the power of big industries seeking influence in Congress has  exploded. Where previously, big special interests had muskets, Citizens  United gave them artillery. On climate change, one industry, the fossil  fuel industry, is deploying its artillery of big money and big threats  here in Washington like nobody else.   It is no surprise. They are defending a $700 billion per year fossil  fuel subsidy just in the United States, according to the International  Monetary Fund. They have a huge interest--a multihundred billion dollar  interest--in preventing legislation that would reduce consumption of  their fossil fuels.   So they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on lobbying and  elections. They fund dozens of phony front groups and trade  associations to engage in all sorts of climate denial and obstruction.  They hide their influence in dark-money channels. They pollute the  public sphere as badly as they pollute the atmosphere.   In our political ecosystem, they are a big and dangerous predator.  Ask  [[Page S2704]]  former Congressman Bob Inglis. Ask former Senate candidate Katie  McGinty. The fossil fuel industry is a multitentacled, well- camouflaged, and deadly political beast.   And, then, there is the rest of the business community: retail, food  and beverage, financial services, tech, consumer goods, and  manufacturing. Most are taking steps to reduce their own emissions, but  when it comes to doing something about climate change here in Congress,  they just don't show up, and the result is entirely predictable.   In an institution like Congress, whose currencies are money and  influence, if one industry spends on lobbies like a beast and there is  no counterweight, that industry likely carries the day. That is  simple political hydraulics. It is true in sports, and it is true in  battles: If one side doesn't show up, the other side owns the field.  And so the fossil fuel industry owns the Republican Party.    That is why it is imperative that the rest of corporate America start  showing up on climate. Many of them are here. They do lobby. They just  care about other things, and their silence about climate change is  deafening. The good guys are just not on the field. They are scared of  retaliation. They have other priorities. They don't want to be yelled  at by the Chamber of Commerce. They are getting what they want and  don't want to upset the applecart. There are lots of reasons, but it  doesn't change the outcome. It is not just the EDF report.   I got today the New America report ``Prospects for Climate Change  Policy Reform.'' They point out that in the past, business and  government usually worked together to solve environmental problems. I  quote them here: ``A cross-partisan model of environmental-business  engagement held sway for decades on other issues; however, companies  have been less willing to provide leadership on climate policy.''   No kidding. But the fossil fuel industry is here, and it exerts a  relentless barrage of lobbying, electioneering, and propaganda pressure  on Congress. And it owns the field. This statement from the EDF report  is really its central message: ``The most powerful tool companies have  to fight climate change is their political influence.''   So when they don't show up, it makes a difference. This is the  message that corporate America needs to take to heart. Republicans are  not going to break this artificial, fossil-fuel-funded, climate logjam  here in Congress until corporate America--the corporate America they  listen to--starts to demand climate action, not on a website, not in  their purchasing standards but here in Congress.   In this political ecosystem, the inhabitants know when something is  real, and they know when it is corporate greenwashing, or well- intentioned peripheral stuff they can ignore. Members know who is  serious.   The fossil fuel industry is deadly serious. The EDF report says that  any evaluation of corporate climate policy must include an analysis of  its lobbying and political spending as it relates to climate. EDF is  right. Corporate America needs to be accountable for the results that  it pays for, and that includes whether or not companies fund anti- climate trade associations.   This is another dirty Washington secret. Many companies subcontract  lobbying and electioneering activity to trade associations. Two of the  biggest trade associations--the National Association of Manufacturers  and the very biggest, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the proverbial 800- pound gorilla--have spent decades denying that climate change was even  occurring and obstructing any effort to reduce carbon pollution-- decades of denial and obstruction.   Too many companies with good climate policies support them with the  result that those companies' functional climate presence in Washington  is opposite to what they say their policy is and opposite to what they  say on their website.   The group InfluenceMap looks at corporate lobbying and ranks  corporations and trade associations by their influence on climate  policy. Of the 50 most influential trade associations around the world,  InfluenceMap shows the Chamber and the National Association of  Manufacturers to be the two worst--the two most opposed when it comes  to reducing carbon pollution. Here they are, the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, right at the  bottom--the very worst.   Look at those companies that are greening their own operations but  are supporting the Chamber and the National Association of  Manufacturers. Look at the companies that don't show up in Congress to  lobby for climate action and, instead, lobby through these two who  lobby against the climate action those companies claim to support.  Those companies' net lobbying presence in Congress is against climate  action, whatever they may claim to support. Their net lobbying presence  in Congress is against climate action--directly opposed to the policies  they claim to support.   There is an accountability moment that needs to come for those  companies, unless they honestly believe that climate change is a hoax,  that it is not real, we don't need to worry about it, and obstruction  is OK. If that is their position, they are getting proper  representation from the National Association of Manufacturers and the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce, but if they are telling the world--and their  shareholders and their customers--that they take climate change  seriously, they have a little explaining to do about supporting these  two enemies of climate progress, particularly, if they are not showing  up in Congress to counter the denial and obstruction they are paying  for.   For years, companies that go out and brag to consumers and investors  about how green they are simultaneously fund climate denial and  obstruction via those two trade associations. That has to stop. In  fact, more and more consumers and investors are beginning to call on  companies to stop this corporate doublespeak. You can't have a good  climate website and fund these two organizations and face your  shareholders and say you are serious.   Consumers who buy a Coke or a Pepsi don't want to be supporting the  Chamber's decades-long campaign against climate action. Investors in  Coca-Cola and Pepsico don't want these companies to put their  reputations at risk by funding anti-climate groups. Investors don't  want these companies to ignore climate change when climate change may  upend their water-dependent businesses.    Coca-Cola features a powerful statement about its commitment to  climate action on its website. ``Climate change is a profound  challenge,'' it says, ``and we are partnering with other businesses,  civil society organizations, and governments to support cooperative  action on this critical issue. . . . We also recognize climate change  may have long-term direct and indirect implications for our business  and supply chain.''   In 2018, Coca-Cola disclosed that it gave the chamber at least  $85,000--probably a good deal more.   PepsiCo is even more explicit about the need for climate action. I  quote them:         Implementing solutions to address climate change is       important to the future of our company, customers, consumers       and our shared world. . . . We believe industry and       governments should commit to science-based action to keep       global temperature increases to 2 Celsius above pre-      industrial levels.''    In 2018, PepsiCo disclosed that it gave the chamber at least half a  million dollars.   Coke and Pepsi's own trade association, the American Beverage  Association, also gives money to the chamber.   So here are these two consumer-facing, climate-supporting companies,  and both of them contribute directly to the Chamber of Commerce, and  they run money through their own trade association, the American  Beverage Association, into the Chamber of Commerce. And there it lies  as the worst of the pair of lobbying organizations blocking climate  action.   What is the net effect of all of that? The net effect is that, for  all their good work reducing their own carbon emissions and reducing  their supply chain's carbon emissions, here in Congress, Coke and Pepsi  are net opposed to climate action.   Thankfully, some companies are beginning to realize that they can't  just sit on the sidelines here in Washington and let the fossil fuel  industry own Congress. Little Patagonia, the outdoor clothing  manufacturer, has led the way. Bravo, Patagonia. Danone,  [[Page S2705]]  Mars, Nestle, and Unilever have announced a sustainable food policy  alliance to pursue a price on carbon in Congress. Separately, Microsoft  recently announced that it was going to lobby Congress for a price on  carbon. But the fact that those companies are the exceptions I can name  shows how bad the presence of corporate America is on this issue here  in Congress.   I will give Microsoft some extra credit. Microsoft also stood up in  Washington State to support a ballot initiative to put a price on  carbon emissions. Starbucks, Amazon, Costco, and Boeing--big,  supposedly green corporations in Washington State--stood by and let  themselves get rolled by Big Oil, led by BP--``Beyond Petroleum,'' ha-- when Big Oil spent $30 million to defeat the measure.   By the way, it is the oil CEOs who have been saying: Oh, we know our  product causes climate change. We are serious about doing something  about it, and what we are going to do to be serious about it is to  support a price on carbon.   That is what they say. What do they do? Look at BP. Look at the oil  spending in Washington. They go right in and spend their money to fight  the very policy they say they support.   I know of no path to success on climate that does not include pricing  carbon. It is also the right thing to do because failing to price  carbon is bad economics. It is a market failure. So if you are a true  free market person, you ought to get behind a price on carbon. If you  are just a fossil fuel person, then OK, but admit it. There really is  no path to success on climate change that does not include pricing  carbon. That may be an unpleasant fact for some, but it is a fact.   Staying between 1.5 and 2 degrees Centigrade world temperature  increase is another fact. We can't miss that target, but we will. We  will miss that target if this corporate doublespeak doesn't change.   Work like this new report from EDF, and InfluenceMap's analysis of  how these trade associations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the  National Association of Manufacturers obstruct climate action, may help  convince corporate America that it is time to step up, get on the  field, and demand that Congress take real action to limit carbon  pollution.   Corporate America needs to go to its trade associations and say:  Knock it off. No more U.S. chamber of carbon. No more national  association of manufactured facts.   Corporate America is paying for this nonsense, and corporate America  can stop it. The two-faced game of having a good climate website but  having your presence in Congress be against climate action has got to  stop.   Corporate America--the political force Republicans listen to--has the  responsibility and the power to break the fossil fuel-funded logjam in  this body. They could do it tomorrow if they wanted to. You take the  leaders of corporate America in the sectors that I listed and you march  them right down to the leader's office, and they say to him ``We are  done with you, we are done with your candidates, and we are done with  your party until you knock off the obstruction,'' and we would be out  on the floor debating climate change within a week.   When corporate America takes up its responsibility and uses its power  to break the fossil fuel-funded logjam in this body, change on this  issue will come swiftly, and we will see bipartisan support for climate  action emerge.   I was here in 2007, in 2008, and in 2009. In all of those years,  there was constant bipartisan activity on climate. The pages would have  been awfully young back then. It is nearly 10 years ago now. They would  not recognize what is going on. I think there were five different  bipartisan climate bills in the Senate--serious ones--that would have  really done something significant to head off the climate crisis. All  of that stopped dead in January of 2010. It was like a heart attack and  a flat line on the EKG--stopped dead because the Supreme Court decided  Citizens United. That opened the floodgates of political money into our  politics. The fossil fuel money jumped on to that immediately. I think  they saw and predicted that decision. I know they asked for it, and  they were ready at the starting gun. From that moment when the fossil  fuel industry dropped in on the Republican Party and said, ``Nobody is  going to cross us on this any longer. You are all going to have to line  up on climate denial. We will take out Republicans who cross us. We  will do it to Bob Inglis, and we will do it to others. You are done  with bipartisanship on this issue,'' that is when it stopped.   If the fossil fuel industry would knock it off or if these front  groups like the chamber and the National Association of Manufacturers  would knock it off or if the rest of corporate America would simply get  in here and push back, show up, outpressure them, we could go back and  we could be bipartisan in a week. We are not there yet. Most of  corporate America is still avoiding this issue in Congress, but they  could really make a big difference. That makes it very much still time  to wake up.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
