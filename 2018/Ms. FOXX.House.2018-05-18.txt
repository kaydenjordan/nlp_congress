 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize May 13 through 19 as  National Police Week. This week is a special time to honor the law  enforcement officers who gave their lives in the line of duty  protecting our communities.   Last Sunday, 360 of those brave men and women were added to the  number of fallen law enforcement heroes on the National Law Enforcement  Officers Memorial. Their sacrifice is not forgotten, and their families  remain in our prayers during this week of remembrance.   We are blessed to live in a country founded on the rule of law, and  this cherished principle would not be preserved without our Nation's  dedicated law enforcement officers.   This week, we also show our gratitude to the 900,000 sworn law  enforcement officers who put their lives on the line daily for our  safety. Thanks for all you do.                            ____________________
