 Madam Speaker, I rise today at a time of grave concern  for all Americans.   This past weekend, I joined a bipartisan delegation traveling to  Belgium and Luxembourg for the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the  Bulge, a battle in which over 19,000 Americans gave their lives. Today,  we are called to preserve that democracy that they so bravely defended.   Over 2 years ago, I was one of the first Members of Congress to vote  to advance the inquiry. Since then, I have withheld final judgment as I  reviewed the facts and heard the testimony.   I believe there is overwhelming evidence well beyond a reasonable  doubt that President Donald Trump is guilty in both Articles of  Impeachment, abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Therefore, I  will uphold my oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the  United States in favor of impeachment.   It is our solemn responsibility to honor all those who have fought  and given their lives to uphold the truth. In America, no one is above  the law.
