 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the millions of  American workers whose rights have been undermined and attacked for  decades in this country. I am from a union family.   Americans who have been on the front lines of this pandemic since day  one, yet they have been forced to work with lousy benefits, in unsafe  conditions, and for insufficient pay. Too many of these workers don't  have the ability to organize for stronger rights because too many don't  even know their rights to organize.   Many times, employers deliberately don't want their workers to know  their rights to organize and they hide it. Other times, it is because a  worker's rights are posted in a language that he or she does not speak.   By passing the PRO Act, we will not only require employers to post  notices informing workers of their rights to organize, but with the  amendment I am proposing, we will also ensure that these notices are  posted in the languages spoken by their employees, such as Spanish,  Arabic, Polish, and any language, really. When one worker doesn't know  their rights, the entire workforce is weakened.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this amendment and the  PRO Act so we can truly restore workers' rights in this country. All  workers have rights.
