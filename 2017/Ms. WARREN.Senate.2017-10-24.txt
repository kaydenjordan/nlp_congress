 Mr. President, Wells Fargo creates 3.5 million fake  accounts, charging customers fees and ruining credit scores. Equifax  lets hackers steal personal information on 145 million Americans,  putting nearly 60 percent of American adults at risk of identity theft.  And somehow we are about to vote on a Republican proposal that makes it  harder for consumers to hold companies like Wells Fargo and Equifax  accountable. I know it sounds nuts, but it is true.   Here is the issue: If you have a checking account, credit card,  private student loan, or any number of financial products, there is a  good chance you have given up your right to go to court if that  financial firm cheats you. That is because tens of millions of consumer  financial contracts include a forced arbitration clause that says that  if this financial company cheated you, you can't join with other  consumers in court; you have to go to arbitration by yourself. Tens of  millions of consumers, including around 80 million  [[Page S6743]]  credit card customers, can't go to court if their banks cheat them.   Think about what this means in the real world. You wake up in the  morning and find a mysterious $30 fee on your account statement. You  call the bank and say: I didn't agree to this. The bank tells you to  pound sand. So what are your options? Well, if there is no forced  arbitration clause in your contract, you have a choice: You can go to  court, or, if your bank offers it, you can pursue arbitration.   Here is what you want to think about. Chances are pretty good that if  the bank cheated you with a $30 unauthorized fee, there are other  customers in the same boat. That means, if you want, you can join a  class action lawsuit against the bank for free. A class action gives  you a chance to get some money back, and it doesn't cost you anything.  A class action also means the bank might have to cough up some real  money and think twice before hitting you and their other customers with  hidden fees the next time around.   Now think about what happens if there is a forced arbitration clause.  You can't join with other customers in court. Your only option is to  file a solo arbitration claim, which will cost you $200 or more just to  get started. Who is going to pay $200 up front to try to get back a $30  fee? No one. That is exactly what the banks are counting on. They can  get away with nickel and diming you forever.   But say the bank steals a bigger amount and you just can't stand it  anymore, so you decide to be one of the roughly 400 consumers a year  who go before an arbitrator. If you don't like the result, there is no  appeal. Even worse, the banks are allowed to swipe your wallet in  secret. The records of these proceedings are not public, so the  regulators and the American people don't get to know what their banks  are up to. Does that sound like justice in America?   Earlier this year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau put a  stop to that. They issued a new rule that prohibits financial companies  from forcing you to give up your right to join other customers in court  and hold your bank accountable. House Republicans already voted to  reverse that rule. The Senate will soon decide whether to follow suit  and take away American families' freedom to choose to go to court if  they are cheated by their bank.   Make no mistake--anyone who votes to reverse this rule is saying loud  and clear that they stand with banks instead of their constituents,  because bank lobbyists are the only people asking Congress to reverse  this rule. Every other organization--all the ones that represent actual  human beings, not banks--every one of them wants this rule to be saved.  Let me tell you about some of them.   The Military Coalition, which represents more than 5.5 million  veterans and servicemembers, supports the CFPB rule because ``our  nation's veterans should not be deprived of the Constitutional rights  and freedoms that they put their lives on the line to protect,  including the right to have their claims heard in a trial.'' The  coalition says that ``[f]orced arbitration is an un-American system  wherein servicemembers' claims against a corporation are funneled into  a rigged, secretive system in which all the rules, including the choice  of arbitrator, are picked by the corporation,'' and they warn that  ``the catastrophic consequences these [forced arbitration] clauses pose  for our all-voluntary military fighting force's morale and our national  security are vital reasons'' to preserve the rule. That is from the  Military Coalition.    The AARP, which represents nearly 40 million seniors, says that the  CFPB rule should be preserved because it ``is a critical step in  restoring consumers' access to legal remedies that have been undermined  by the widespread use of forced arbitration for many years.'' Older  consumers are often at increased risk of financial scams, so the ``AARP  supports the availability of a full range of enforcement tools,  including the right to class action litigation to prevent harm to the  financial security of older people posed by unfair and illegal  practices.'' That is the AARP, which represents seniors across the  country.   The Main Street Alliance, which represents thousands of small  businesses, says that the CFPB rule will help small businesses fight  against big financial firms that try to drive up their fees. Since  almost ``20% of [small] business owners rely on credit cards as a  source of investment capital--many of which contain arbitration  clauses--forced arbitration makes it nearly impossible for small  businesses and consumers alike to protest hidden fees, illegal debt  collection, and other deceptive practices.'' That is from the Main  Street Alliance.   So there it is. Veterans, servicemembers, seniors, small businesses,  and consumers are all lining up to support the CFPB rule. But that is  not all. Let Freedom Ring, an organization that proudly touts itself as  ``supporting the conservative agenda,'' likes the CFPB rule, too,  saying it is ``in keeping with our Framers' concerns that without  appropriate protections, civil proceedings can be used as a means to  oppress the powerless.''   That is the thing you have to understand. The effort to reverse the  CFPB rule isn't about promoting a conservative agenda, and it sure as  heck is not about promoting a working people's agenda or a small  business agenda. It is about advancing the banks' agenda, period.   The banks and their lobbyists actually have the gall to claim that  they want to kill the rule because it is bad for their customers. That  claim is just plain laughable. According to a rigorous, 3-year-long  CFPB study, consumers recovered an average of $540 million annually  from class action settlements, while receiving less than $1 million  annually in the arbitration cases the agency reviewed. It is not even  close. Even if there are instances in which arbitration is a better  option for consumers than a class action lawsuit, the CFPB rule doesn't  stop consumers from choosing arbitration. The rule simply says that  consumers--consumers--should also have the freedom to go to court if  that is what they prefer.   I will tell you one thing: When it comes to what is right for  consumers, I listen to servicemembers, veterans, seniors, consumers,  and small businesses. I don't listen to bank lobbyists. When a bunch of  bank lobbyists tell you they know what is best for consumers, hang on  to your wallet.   Millions of Americans of all political parties think the game in  Washington is rigged against them, and this vote is exhibit A.  Companies like Equifax and Wells Fargo have hurt millions of consumers  and then turn around and try to escape accountability, using forced  arbitration clauses. The Republican Congress hasn't done a thing to  help the people hurt by Wells Fargo. The Republican Congress hasn't  done a thing to help the people hurt by Equifax. Instead, tonight they  are actually taking away one of the few legal tools to hold companies  like Wells Fargo and Equifax accountable.   This is shameful, and I mean that. Any Senator who votes against our  servicemembers and our veterans in order to shield big banks from  accountability should be ashamed. We should vote down this proposal.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.    Thank you, Mr. President. Tonight we are on the verge of  passing a Republican resolution to make it easier for financial  institutions to cheat people. Earlier this year, the Consumer Financial  Protection Board issued a rule that prohibits financial companies from  forcing you to sign an arbitration clause that makes you forfeit your  right to take a bank to court. So if this proposal passes, that rule  will just disappear.   Now, there are no real human beings who think it should be easier for  financial institutions to steal money from you and get away with it.  Bank lobbyists are the only people asking Congress to reverse this  rule, but let's face it, the Wall Street Journal is pretty powerful  around here. The question the American people should be asking right  now is, Are they powerful enough to win tonight?   The reason this vote is happening so late at night is because we were  right on the verge of blocking it. The American people have watched as  Wells Fargo cheated its customers and then used arbitration clauses to  try to escape liability. They watched as Equifax negligently allowed  hackers to steal personal financial information of more than half of  all American adults and then used arbitration clauses to try to escape  accountability. Politicians have been watching it too. While many of  their eyes might be blinded by dollar signs, it may not be enough.   There is bipartisan opposition in the Senate to turning financial  institutions loose to swindle their own customers. Right now our best  guess is that it is 50 to 50. That means that Vice President Mike Pence  is on his way to the Senate to cast a tie-breaking vote. If we can't  peel off one more Republican, Mike Pence will decide whether consumers  can hold banks like Wells Fargo accountable when they cheat their  customers.   Now, everyone assumes Mike Pence will side with the big banks, and I  have just one simple question: Why?   President Trump, Mike Pence works for you. His job is to cast his  vote the way you tell him to cast it. We spent more than a year  listening to you, first as a candidate and then as a President, and you  have gone on and on and on about how strong you are, how tough you are,  and about how you are going to stand up to Wall Street.   Well, this bill is a giant, wet kiss to Wall Street. Bank lobbyists  are crawling all over this place begging Congress to vote and make it  easier for them to cheat their customers. President Trump, are you  really going to let Mike Pence cast a tie-breaking vote to hand big  banks their biggest win in Congress since they crashed the economy 9  years ago?   You know, I followed a news story about how tough you are, Mr.  President--standing up to Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, and the  Republican Party. Well, this is a top priority for them, Mr. President.  So do you work for Mitch McConnell now? Is that the deal? Are you going  to roll over and hurt millions of people in this country because Mitch  McConnell tells you to?   I keep hearing that you and Steve Bannon are going to remake the  Republican Party into a party that stands up to Wall Street. Steve  Bannon works with the White supremacists, but, hey, he says he is going  to help you drain the swamp, right?   Well, where is the all-powerful Steve Bannon now? Where is he to tell  Mike Pence and Donald Trump that they don't work for Mitch McConnell?   Every organization--all the ones that represent actual human beings,  not banks--want this rule to be saved, none more than the organizations  that represent our veterans and our servicemembers. Do you know why  that is, Mr. President? It is because they are sick and tired of being  cheated by banks. They are sick and tired of politicians who say  ``thank you for your service'' and then turn around and vote to make it  harder for them to build a future for themselves and their families.   The Military Coalition, which represents more than 5.5 million  veterans and servicemembers, supports the CFPB rule because ``our  Nation's veterans should not be deprived of the constitutional rights  and freedoms that they put their lives on the line to protect,  including the right to have their claims heard in a trial.'' The  Coalition says that ``[f]orced arbitration is an un-American system  wherein servicemembers' claims against a corporation are funneled into  a rigged, secretive system in which all the rules, including the choice  of arbitrator, are picked by the corporation.'' They go on to warn that  ``the catastrophic consequences these [forced arbitration] clauses pose  for our all-voluntary military fighting force's morale and our national  security are vital reasons'' to preserve this rule.   We have seen all the tweets, Mr. President. We have seen you go on  and on about how disrespectful it is of our veterans and their families  that some football players don't want to stand for the national anthem.  Well, all three of my brothers served in the military, Mr. President.  Do you know what is disrespectful of our veterans and their families?  Passing laws that hurt our veterans and their families. Casting tie- breaking votes for laws that are opposed by the American Legion, by the  Military Coalition, by the Vietnam Veterans of America, by AMVETS, by  the Association of the United States Navy, by the Military Order of the  Purple Heart, by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, by the  Military Child Education Coalition, by the Military Veterans Coalition  of Indiana, by the National Association of Black Veterans, by the  National Guard Association of the United States, by the National  Military Family Association, by the Noncommissioned Officers  Association, by the Reserve Officers Association, by the Retired  Enlisted Association, by the Veterans for Common Sense, by the Veterans  Education Success, by Veterans Legal Institute, by VETJOBS and by Vets  First.    President Trump, this is up to you. Don't do this. Don't let Mike  Pence cast the deciding vote to hand a huge victory to Wall Street. If  you do, you should be prepared for the consequences. Veterans know when  a politician is all talk. They know the difference between a cheap pat  on the back and a real punch to the gut. They will not forget what  happens here today.   And for Steve Bannon--if this really happens today and Mike Pence  casts the deciding vote to make it easier for financial institutions to  cheat people, do you want to remake the Republican Party in your image?  Do you want to watch primary challenges against Republicans who roll  over to Wall Street? Do you want to go after the weak and spineless,  the DC-Wall Street swamp, the politicians who will not stand up to  Mitch McConnell, and all the globalists who think cash matters more  than people? If Mike Pence votes for this monstrosity, why don't you  primary Donald Trump, and when you are finished with him, why don't you  go after Mike Pence?   Steve Bannon, put your fat wad of billionaire Mercer money where your  mouth is or stop pretending that you are anything other than what you  are.   With the remainder of my time, I would like to read letters and op- eds from veterans begging Congress not to repeal this rule.   The first is from Col. Lee F. Lange, U.S. Marine, Retired, with 30  years of service, now serving as Arizona chapter president of the  Military Officers Association of America. He titles his letter, ``I  Served to Protect Our Rights; Don't Let Equifax Take Them Away.''         As a career Marine, I served to protect the rights of       Americans as guaranteed by the Constitution and its       amendments. Among them is the 7th Amendment right to trial by       jury in civil cases, a right dismissed by companies like       Equifax and now under siege in Congress.  [[Page S6757]]         Forced arbitration ``ripoff clauses'' buried in the fine-      print of bank accounts, auto loans and other contracts strip       servicemembers and veterans of their day in court when big       banks and other financial institutions violate the law.       Instead, people must face companies alone and cannot join       together in a rigged, secretive process where the banks and       lenders often choose the arbitrator.        Men and women in uniform are surely among the 145.5 million       people impacted by the massive data breach of sensitive       personal information held by the credit reporting agency       Equifax--and among those whose access to the courts was       stripped in Equifax's fine print until the company had to       relent. Servicemembers from Sergeant Charles Beard to Army       soldier Prentice Martin-Bowen have also had their rights       limited by forced arbitration.        Wells Fargo continues to use forced arbitration to deny       victims of the fake account scandal access to the justice       system. Arizona and Southern California were the epicenter of       the Wells Fargo scandal and Wells Fargo is Arizona's largest       bank. Some of the state's more than 500,000 veterans were       certainly caught up in its effects. Wells Fargo has been       caught but it is likely not the only financial institution       guilty of illegal practices.        The Department of Defense has long pushed for       servicemembers full legal recourse against unscrupulous       lenders, and members now have some protection against forced       arbitration clauses through the Military Lending Act. But the       MLA protections don't apply to auto loans, to rights under       the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, to bank account fraud       like the Wells Fargo scandal, or to veterans.        The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and its       Office of Servicemember Affairs have worked to protect those       who serve by issuing a rule restoring our 7th Amendment       rights and limiting the use of forced arbitration. The CFPB       rule enhances military consumer protections in the MLA,       restoring the right of servicemembers and veterans to seek       civil justice, including class action suits, for illegal       acts.        For that reason, The Military Coalition, a national       consortium of uniformed services and veterans organizations       representing 5.5 million current and former servicemembers       and their families and survivors, urged Congress to let the       CFPB rule go into effect. The American Legion has done the       same. The general public--including 64 percent of Republicans       and 74 percent of Democrats--also supports the rule to       restore our day in court.        But, despite this outpouring of support, the U.S. House of       Representatives has voted to block the rule from going into       effect. Wall Street lobbyists are pushing Congress to leave       forced arbitration as the only solution, severely limiting       the recourse of servicemembers and all Americans. For       example, only four arbitrations have been filed against Wells       Fargo in Arizona despite up to 178,972 or more fake accounts       in the state.    That is 4 arbitrations against 178,972 or more fake accounts in the  State.         We can't allow forced arbitration to be used as a tool to       block accountability.        The Senate, armed with lessons learned from the Equifax and       Wells Fargo scandals, can still reverse course. Our Senators       must put the interests of active-duty servicemembers,       veterans, and American consumers ahead of Wall Street       lobbyists and reject efforts to take away our day in court.    That was from Col. Lee Lange, U.S. Marine Corps, Retired, chapter  president of the Arizona Chapter of the Military Officers Association  of America and president of the Southwest Veterans Chamber of Commerce.   There is another one that I would like to read, and this is from the  chairman of the Alaska Veterans Foundation. It is titled ``Forced  arbitration and a right worth fighting for,'' by Ric Davidge.         As a veteran, I am proud to have helped protect the       freedoms so zealously guarded for us by our Founders. Another       guarantor of those liberties is the right to our day in       court--one especially vital to today's servicemembers who are       so often taken advantage of by financial institutions.        Today, the right to our day in court is endangered because       of actions under consideration by the United States Senate on       the issue of powerful banks and forced arbitration.        James Madison, one of the principal drafters of the Bill of       Rights, wrote that ``trial by jury in civil cases is as       essential to secure the liberty of the people as any one of       the pre-existent rights of nature.'' The Founders saw this       right to be heard before a jury of our peers as so vital that       they enshrined it in the Seventh Amendment.        This right is not only, in Winston Churchill's words, ``a       safeguard from arbitrary perversion of the law,'' but also a       means to ensure equal access to justice for the powerful and       the powerless alike, and for citizens to signal and set       acceptable standards of conduct in our society.        Why bring this all up now? Because the U.S. Senate is       considering legislation to roll back a rule recently       finalized by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)       to limit forced arbitration clauses buried deep in consumer       financial agreements. These forced arbitration agreements are       found in the fine print of financial agreements signed by       tens of millions of everyday Americans with the Wall Street       banks, covering everything from credit cards and checking       accounts to prepaid cards and payday loans. And they require       consumers to take disputes over bank wrongdoing not to courts       overseen by judges, but to arbitrators chosen by the       financial institutions--under their own rules.        Arbitration hearings are held in private with no public       record, no meaningful rules, not even a requirement that       arbitrators enforce state and federal laws. And of course, no       jury.        Perhaps most significant of all, Big Banks have leveraged       arbitration to block class action suits, where the ability of       consumers to band together helps balance the extraordinary       legal and financial resources at banks' disposal.        The Wells Fargo scandals--yes, there's more than one--offer       a prime example of how financial institutions use forced       arbitration to rip off consumers.        The bank, with 48 branches in Alaska, opened nearly 6,000       of its infamous fake accounts here on the Last Frontier.        A California judge ordered the financial giant to repay       customers more than $200 million for manipulating accounts to       generate overdraft fees--another activity repeated here.        Recently, nearly a quarter million Wells Fargo car loan       customers were dinged for nonpayment of insurance policies       illegally taken out for them--and almost 25,000 had vehicles       repossessed.        Most infuriating, Wells Fargo has been fined millions for       foreclosing on servicemembers or repossessing their cars in       violation of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.        In every case, Wells has used arbitration to shield itself       from accountability. Since 2009, only 215 consumers       nationwide have filed arbitrations against Wells Fargo--but       not one in Alaska. The reason: arbitration is often too       expensive for a single consumer with a small claim.        That's why the CFPB rule is so important--and why the Big       Banks' Washington lobbyists are working overtime to have it       overturned. The regulation will ensure all Alaskans retain       the right to their day in court as part of class actions--and       uphold the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to protect the       legal rights of the men and women fighting for this country.        As Congress considers whether to preserve this critical       protection for everyday consumers, and especially for our       servicemembers, our Alaska Republican Senators, Lisa       Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, need to remember that equal       access to justice is not a Republican or a Democratic idea.       It is an American right, as old as our Republic itself, and       it's worth fighting for.        Ric Davidge serves as chairman of the Alaska Veterans       Foundation.    From Robert Mitchell, a Marine Corps veteran: ``Forced arbitration is  un-American.'' This is from the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.         I am a proud Marine Corps veteran. Abroad, I joined with my       fellow Marines in united pursuit of justice and rights. At       home, I fight for them and other U.S. military members to be       treated fairly and with dignity in their financial affairs.       I'm disappointed by the actions of my U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton,       who is seeking to roll back a recent rule that restores       servicemembers' and other Americans' legal rights in the       financial marketplace.        So often, military members are unfairly targeted by       aggressive lenders, abusive debt collectors, reckless credit-      reporting bureaus, and discriminating employers. So I devote       my time to help them enforce their rights under federal and       state laws that grant them remedies and other ways to hold       bad actors accountable when they flout these laws.    He goes on to talk about what happens in the fine print in these  contracts and how it is that veterans and Active-Duty servicemembers  are repeatedly cheated.   His closing remarks are as follows:         Unfortunately, although the rule restores the rights of       active-duty servicemembers and American civilians, it has       become controversial in Washington because the financial-      services industry opposes it. For several years now,       financial institutions have been able to use their strict       terms to wipe away individuals' rights and essentially ignore       legal complaints.        But Senator Cotton and our representatives in Congress must       take the opportunity to look beyond the lobbyists and toward       the experiences of our military members and the U.S.       Constitution. They should support, not abandon, a rule that       simply restores our traditions.    I will just reference a letter from The Military Coalition, a  consortium of uniform services and veterans organizations representing  more than 5\1/2\ million current and former servicemembers and their  families and survivors who also wrote in strong support of protecting  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau arbitration rule. They  conclude:         Our nation's veterans should not be deprived of the       Constitutional rights and freedoms that they put their lives       on the line to protect, including the right to have their       claims heard in a trial by a jury when their rights are       violated. The catastrophic consequences these clauses pose       for our all-voluntary military fighting force's morale and  [[Page S6758]]       our national security are vital reasons for this rule to take       effect immediately.    We also have a resolution passed by the Ninety-Ninth National  Convention of the American Legion asking Congress not to roll back the  arbitration rule put forward by the CFPB, and we have a letter from  more than 30 veterans associations begging this Congress to please not  get rid of the forced arbitration clause that has been put forward by  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have these letters and  resolution printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                         The Military Coalition,                                      Alexandria, VA, July 25, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      House Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Senate Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Rep. Ryan, Rep. Pelosi, Sen. McConnell, and Sen.       Schumer: The Military Coalition (TMC), a consortium of       uniformed services and veterans organizations representing       more than 5.5 million current and former servicemembers and       their families and survivors writes today in strong support       of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) final       rule on Arbitration Agreements (Docket No. CFPB-2016-0020;       RIN 3170-AA51). The final rule addresses the widespread harm       of forced arbitration by preserving the ability of service       members and other consumers to band together to seek relief       through the civil justice system when financial institutions       have broken the law. We applaud the CFPB for moving forward       on this rule that recognizes the detrimental effects of       forced arbitration and class action waivers on our brave men       and women in uniform.        Forced arbitration is an un-American system wherein service       members' claims against a corporation are funneled into a       rigged, secretive system in which all the rules, including       the choice of the arbitrator, are picked by the corporation.       Found in almost every financial services contract, forced       arbitration clauses systematically include a provision       banning the rights of consumers to ban together to hold a       corporation accountable. Given the exponential and expansive       use of these clauses by financial institutions in contracts       with service members, prohibiting the practice of forcing       service members to surrender fundamental Constitutional and       statutory rights through the use of pre-dispute forced       arbitration clauses is now more critical than ever.        Our service members protect our nation against both foreign       and domestic threats. The sacrifices and logistical       undertakings they and their families make in order to serve       are compelling reasons alone to ensure they are not only       shielded from predatory financial practices and unscrupulous       lenders, but are also able to enforce their congressionally       mandated rights through our civil justice system if and when       violations arise.        However, class action waivers work against these rights.       They are particularly abusive when enforced against service       members, who may not be in a position to individually       challenge a financial institution's illegal or unfair       practices because of limited resources or frequent       relocations or deployment. Furthermore, for those service       members on active duty and serving overseas, it is critical       to retain the ability to get justice without having to       interrupt their service and distract their attention from the       mission at hand. Since these types of service members cannot       participate full time in pursuing an individual claim, being       able to enforce their rights through the class action       mechanism is essential. Thus service members should receive       the benefits of participating in a class action despite their       inability to shoulder the burden of bringing a claim alone.        Our nation's veterans should not be deprived of the       Constitutional rights and freedoms that they put their lives       on the line to protect, including the right to have their       claims heard in a trial by a jury when their rights are       violated. The catastrophic consequences these clauses pose       for our all-voluntary military fighting force's morale and       our national security are vital reasons for this rule to take       effect immediately.            Sincerely,      The Military Coalition.                                   ____   Ninety-Ninth National Convention of the American Legion--Reno, Nevada,                          August 22, 23, 24, 2017       Resolution No. 83: Protect Veteran and Servicemember Rights           to Fair Consumer Arbitration      Origin: Convention Committee on Veterans Employment &           Education      Submitted by: Convention Committee on Veterans Employment &           Education        Whereas, The American Legion is a national organization of       veterans who have dedicated themselves to the service of the       community, state and nation; and        Whereas, The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's       (CFPB) rule on Arbitration Agreements (Docket No. CFPB-2016-      0020; RIN 3170-AA51) addresses the widespread harm of forced       arbitration by restoring the ability of servicemembers,       veterans and other consumers to join together and seek relief       in class action lawsuits when financial institutions break       the law; and        Whereas, Congress enacted the Servicemembers Civil Relief       Act (SCRA), 50 U.S.C. app. 501 et seq., to strengthen and       expedite national defense by granting servicemembers certain       protections in civil actions against default judgments,       foreclosures and repossessions, enforceable in a court of       law; and        Whereas, In some cases, financial institutions violate SCRA       or other statutory or constitutional protections in their       interactions with servicemembers; and        Whereas, Many financial institutions include pre-dispute       mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts of adhesion that       bar servicemembers and others from bringing a legal action in       court or banding together in a class action lawsuit to seek       relief under federal or state law; and        Whereas, Class action waivers are particularly burdensome       to servicemembers, who may not be able to challenge a       financial institution's illegal or unfair practices       individually due to limited resources, deployment or frequent       relocations; and        Whereas, The Department of Defense concluded in 2006 that       ``Servicemembers should maintain full legal recourse against       unscrupulous lenders. Loan contracts to servicemembers should       not include mandatory arbitration clauses or onerous notice       provisions, and should not require the servicemember to waive       his or her right of recourse, such as the right to       participate in a plaintiff class''; and        Whereas, This is extremely unfair to bar servicemembers,       veterans and other consumers from joining together to enforce       statutory and constitutional protections in court, placing an       extreme hardship on the individual: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, By The American Legion in National Convention       assembled in Reno, Nevada, August 22, 23, 24, 2017, That The       American Legion oppose legislation to repeal the Consumer       Financial Protection Bureau's rule on arbitration agreements       and bar servicemembers, veterans and other consumers from       joining together in court against unscrupulous financial       institutions.                                   ____                                                        May 3, 2017.

Jeb Hensarling,      Chair, Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives.       Sen. Sherrod Brown,      Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban           Affairs, U.S. Senate.      Rep. Maxine Waters,      Ranking Member, Committee on Financial Services, House of           Representatives.        Dear Chairmen Crapo and Hensarling & Ranking Members Brown       and Waters: We, the undersigned representatives of       organizations who advocate for our nation's military       servicemembers, veterans, survivors, and military families,       write to urge you respectfully to ensure that important laws       and regulations that protect against financial deception and       abuse are not watered down or eliminated. We hope that       bipartisan agreement is possible in order to protect       America's military heroes and their families by resisting       proposals that would curtail the effectiveness of the       Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).        CFPB's Office of Servicemember Affairs--launched by Mrs.       Holly Petraeus--has produced tangible results for military       families across the country. Military leaders nationwide have       lauded the work of the consumer agency and its dedicated       military unit. For these reasons, we urge you to resist any       proposals that would limit the CFPB's ability to work on       behalf of servicemembers through changes to its authorities,       structure, or independent funding.        The CFPB's work to protect, assist, and educate military       families in the financial sphere is paying dividends for our       nation's military personnel readiness. We urge you to       continue to support the work of the Consumer Financial       Protection Bureau and its dedicated military office.        The enclosure to this letter summarizes the many ways that       the CFPB supports the Defense Department's key asset, its men       and women in uniform and their families.            Sincerely,        AMVETS, American Legion Post 122, Association of the United       States Navy, Blue Star Families, Coast Guard Chief Petty       Officers Association, Code of Support Foundation, Fleet       Reserve Association, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of       America, Ivy League Veterans Council, Military Child       Education Coalition, Military Order of the Purple Heart, The       Military / Veterans Coalition of Indiana, National       Association of Black Veterans, National Guard Association of       the United States.

The report noted that ``predatory       lending undermines military readiness, harms the morale of       troops and their families, and adds to the cost of fielding       an all volunteer fighting force.''        According to Department of Defense analysis of involuntary       separations that were due to legal or standard-of-conduct       issues--an average of 19,893 per year--the Department       estimates that approximately half are attributable to a loss       of security clearance, and, of these, 80 percent are due to       financial distress. The Department estimates that each of       these separations costs taxpayers over $57,000. Addressing       financial misconduct by bad actors that target military       families can both contribute to overall military readiness       and reduce the costs to taxpayers of involuntary separations.        Senior enlisted leadership vigorously praised the work of       the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and its Office of       Servicemember Affairs in a February 14, 2017, hearing by the       Senate Armed Services Committee, Military Personnel       Subcommittee. For example, Sergeant Major of the Army Daniel       A. Dailey stated, ``I see value in that organization and I       know they have done great things for our servicemembers.''                          `Dollar Signs in Uniform'         In an op-ed in the The New York Times, Mrs. Petraeus       describes how certain industry actors build their business       models on revenue from servicemembers, veterans, and their       families. While we welcome and celebrate businesses that       serve our community in an honorable, trustworthy manner, some       bad actors see us as nothing more than ``dollar signs in       uniform.''        In the last decade, we have seen financial companies engage       in foreclosure activity, auto lending, and payday lending       that violated laws and regulations protecting consumers and       servicemembers. There is a clear need for the CFPB to provide       both prevention and protection against harmful financial       practices.                           The CFPB's Strong Record         The CFPB engages in a number of activities that benefit       military families including monitoring of complaints,       enforcement, outreach and education, and consumer protection       initiatives.        Consumer Complaints. Military families have submitted       70,000 complaints; the agency's military unit closely       analyzes these complaints to better understand the challenges       that servicemembers face and how to address them. These       complaints often lead to significant monetary relief for       families who have been harmed by wrongful practices.        Education and Outreach. The CFPB has brought new leadership       and emphasis on service member issues by actively reaching       out to listen to and engage with servicemembers and has       developed a variety of resources.        Military installation visits: Nineteen visits in 2015 where       the OSA held Town halls and listened to servicemembers       directly.        Briefings, Outreach, and Community Collaborations: Over 60       events in 2015 delivered consumer resources directly to       servicemembers.        Veterans Outreach: Sixteen events were held in 2015 with       the aim of collaborating with other veteran support       organizations promoting consumer protection.        Digital Engagement: Financial resources delivered through       social media, and social media town halls with federal and       non-profit partners, as well as offering online training for       military financial educators.        On-Demand Virtual Forums: The forums provide servicemembers       and military financial educators with virtual training on       topics ranging from debt collection to the CFPB's complaint       process.        Direct-to-Consumer Education Materials: The materials       provide information on common issues facing the clients of       the military legal assistance community, including protecting       your credit while you are away from home, knowing your rights       when a debt collector calls, and minimizing student loan       payments.        Between October 1, 2011 and December 31, 2016, OSA       delivered consumer financial educational information and       materials to more than 26,000 servicemembers through live       events. This included interacting with active-duty       servicemembers and National Guard personnel through       leadership roundtables and town-hall-style listening sessions       at 145 military installations/units.        Supervision and Enforcement. The CFPB has placed a high       priority on holding financial companies that may be harming       military families accountable.        Before the CFPB was created, no federal agency routinely       examined or supervised non-bank businesses offering consumer       financial products. The Federal Trade Commission had       enforcement authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act       against unfair and deceptive practices and to enforce federal       credit laws with non-bank financial services companies, but       did not have supervision authority. The CFPB's new       supervision authority coupled with its authority to enforce       the Military Lending Act and its focus on listening to       servicemembers has allowed for enforcement actions that would       not have happened without the CFPB.        For example, the CFPB cited Cash America for violating the       Military Lending Act after routine examination exposed       compliance problems. The agency took action against USA       Discounters and other retail creditors abusing military       allotment systems. Other enforcement actions that also       impacted servicemembers include:        Rome Finance where, in conjunction with 13 state attorneys       general, CFPB provided $92 million in debt relief for 17,000       U.S. servicemembers and other consumers;        Suits against closed proprietary colleges ITT and       Corinthian Colleges, Inc. for predatory lending with debt       relief for Corinthian students of $480 million ultimately       secured.        Common-Sense Rules of the Road. The consumer agency has       also pursued consumer protection initiatives that will       strongly benefit military families.        Debt Collection: Over 46% of complaints received from       servicemembers in 2015 concerned debt collection. And       according to a 2015 report, servicemembers were nearly twice       as likely to submit debt collection complaints as the general       population who also submitted complaints. The CFPB has       outlined proposals to increase consumer protections from debt       collectors to address the industry's most abusive practices.        Forced Arbitration: The CFPB's proposed rule to rein in the       widespread harm of forced arbitration by preserving the       ability of servicemembers and other consumers to join       together in court when financial institutions break the law.       Compliance with the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act has been       a particular problem. Class action bans, which take away the       right to collective action, are particularly abusive, as they       prevent courts from ordering widespread relief when thousands       or millions of servicemembers are harmed. Class action bans       also prevent servicemembers from banding together when they       are not in a position to individually challenge a financial       institution's illegal or unfair practices due to limited       resources or frequent relocations or deployment. The Military       Coalition, representing 5.5 million servicemembers and their       families, recently sent a letter to the CFPB in support of       this proposal.                                  Conclusion         As noted by the Military Officers Association of America,       in a recent letter to the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking,       Housing, and Urban Affairs, it is ``vitally important to the       military community and readiness that the work of the Office       of Servicemember Affairs continues.''     It really comes down to this: We have heard from veterans  groups, from individual veterans, Active-Duty military, and from banks,  and the banks are the ones saying: Roll back this rule, and the  veterans and Active-Duty military are asking us not to.   The decision hangs in the balance tonight, and I urge my colleagues:  Just once, don't stand up with the big banks; stand up with the  veterans.   I urge the President of the United States: Show us what you are made  of. Stand up with America's veterans. Stand up to Wall Street; don't  just roll over for Wall Street. Be there for the people who count on  you. Be there for our veterans and Active-Duty military.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.
