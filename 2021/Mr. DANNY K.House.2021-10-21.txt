 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, Congress has a long- recognized and essential role in conducting oversight. The Select  Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States  Capitol has the solemn responsibility to investigate and report upon  the facts, circumstances, and causes related to the attack on January  6, 2021. This domestic terrorist attack sought to interfere with the  peaceful transfer of power and undermine American representative  democracy during the exercise of a constitutional process.   Mr. Bannon reportedly held multiple roles and had specific knowledge  relevant to the investigation of the January 6th attack on the Capitol.  Mr. Bannon has defied a lawful Congressional subpoena. The  investigation by the Select Committee is fundamental to our democracy,  and I will vote today to hold Mr. Bannon in contempt of Congress for  his failure to comply with a Congressional Subpoena. Mr. Bannon has a  duty to cooperate with the Congressional investigation into the  fundamental attack on our democracy on January 6th. Therefore, I will  vote in support of finding Stephen K. Bannon in contempt of Congress  for failure to comply with a Congressional subpoena.    DAVIS of Illinois (for himself and Mrs.               Walorski):        H.R. 5661.
