 Madam Speaker, this morning, the Commerce Department  announced that the economy shrank for the second quarter in a row. This  means that under President Biden, we are now in a recession. And yet,  the House is not acting responsibly to help the American people.   The Biden administration's policies have led our country into one  crisis after another: Inflation, high gas prices, soaring grocery  prices, supply chain problems, recession, children left behind in  school, a record number of deaths from overdoses, vaccine mandates, and  people quitting the workforce, and an overrun southern border with  500,000 people known to have gotten away in the past 10 months.   Meanwhile, House Democrats have focused on extreme policies, allowing  abortion up to the moment of birth, forcing taxpayers to pay for  abortions, and attacking the due process and Second Amendment rights of  the American people.   None of these policies will help hurting Michigan families and  seniors who are paying an extra $729 a month because of Biden's record  inflation.   When Republicans led the House, we had low inflation, affordable  energy, and a strong economy.                            ____________________
