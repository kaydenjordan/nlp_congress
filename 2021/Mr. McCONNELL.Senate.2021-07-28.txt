 Mr. President, yesterday, our colleagues Chairman  Leahy and Ranking Member Shelby announced a bipartisan agreement on  emergency funding for several pressing security matters.   The Appropriations Committee set out to address three key priorities:   First, reimbursing the costs incurred by the Capitol Police, the  National Guard, and other law enforcement for their assistance during  and after the January 6 attack on the Capitol; and providing for  necessary repairs and security updates to the Capitol Complex.   Second, addressing a shortfall from the efforts to keep Congress a  safe and functional workplace during the pandemic this past year and a  half. This is everything from PPE to overtime pay for staff.   And, third, some urgent support for our Afghan partners who have  assisted in the fight against terrorism and now seek to flee the  deteriorating situation brought about by the administration's literally  disastrous decision to abandon that country.   We owe a real debt to the men and women of the Capitol Police, DC  Metro Police, National Guard, and other agencies who helped secure and  protect our workplace. We are grateful to support staff, from the  Architect of the Capitol's team to the Attending Physician's office, to  the Sergeant at Arms, who have worked day and night keeping us  functioning safely throughout the pandemic.   And we intend to keep our Nation's promises to brave Afghans who have  taken great risks to help Americans and our partners fight the  terrorists.   So I applaud the bipartisan work of our colleagues. I am sure neither  side finds the compromise perfect, but I believe that both sides should  and will agree it is absolutely necessary.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on a different matter, the massive,  massive taxing-and-spending spree that Democrats want to ram through  this summer has problems that go even beyond inflation, rising costs,  and massive tax hikes.   The problem is not just Democrats' jaw-dropping $3.5 trillion  pricetag. It is also the long list of bad liberal policies that this  reckless taxing-and-spending spree is supposed to purchase.   I spoke yesterday about just a few of those bad ideas. They are  talking about amnesty for illegal immigrants, socialist price-fixing  that would leave us with fewer new prescription drugs, fewer new  treatments, and fewer new cures.   They want to permanently change the child tax credit into welfare  with no--no--work requirements; smuggle in big chunks of the Green New  Deal.   And in case all of this were not enough, some Senate Democrats want  to use this taxing-and-spending spree to grab control over all 50  States' election laws. I thought we just had that debate a couple of  weeks ago.   Remember, for several years now, our Democratic friends have claimed  that every successive election proved they needed to grab partisan  control over our democracy. In 2016, 2018, and 2020, win or lose--win  or lose--when foreign  [[Page S5116]]  interference occurred and when it did not occur, every possible result  has been claimed as proof that Washington Democrats should rip up our  democracy's rule book and write a new one that benefits them.   The latest phony justification has been the false notion that a few  States' mainstream voting laws equal some kind of assault on democracy  as we know it. Of course, that is absolutely utter nonsense. Americans  want it to be easy to vote and hard to cheat. Voter ID protections are  hugely popular. Basic voter roll maintenance is common sense.   The new law in Georgia, for example, provides for more flexible early  voting and absentee voting than many blue States, including New York.  But the facts weren't about to stop the Democrats' big lie. The absurd  comparison to Jim Crow segregation and all kinds of other horrors have  continued apace.   To provide a little more context about this fake hysteria, we can  also look internationally. As one columnist recently observed in the  Washington Post, the balance struck by the State of Georgia amounts to  ``one of the most expansive voting access laws in the world. Most other  countries do not allow no-excuse absentee voting, and dropboxes are  also virtually unknown elsewhere,'' other democracies around the world.  ``If Georgia's elections are undemocratic, then almost all of our  democratic allies are also undemocratic.''   If liberal activists and woke corporations believed their own  rhetoric, they wouldn't stop at boycotting and threatening the State of  Georgia. They couldn't possibly. They would be busy trying to divest  from most of our NATO allies and essentially the rest of the entire  developed world.   Some European countries allow mail-in voting, but most do not. We  constantly hear from our socialist friends how we should be emulating  Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. Well, none of them allow in- country postal voting--not a one. Bring on the boycotts, I guess.   And you don't even want to hear about early voting. Goodness  gracious. But France, Spain, Germany, Italy, the UK, Ireland--not a day  of in-person early voting in any of those countries, none of them. That  is according to an international NGO that studies democracy.   So, remember, the Texas and Georgia laws codify a whole lot of early  voting, mail-in voting, and lots of election-day voting.   And this is supposed to be the death of democracy? Some outrage on a  global and historic scale?   Give me a break. What nonsense.   Even going by Texas's new proposals, there will be voting by mail in  Paris, TX, but not in Paris, France. There would be almost 2 weeks of  in-person early voting in New Berlin, TX, but zero days in Berlin,  Germany. I am sure Democrats will be yelling at the Fortune 500 to  boycott Europe any day now--any day now.   Of course, the reality is that these moving goalposts are absolutely  fake. The frantic outrage is phony. It is all meant to justify a  political power grab that Democrats have had written and waiting since  years before any of these new State laws, which are supposedly  prompting it--yet another awful plank that my colleagues across the  aisle want to hide in the reckless taxing-and-spending spree they hope  to ram through Congress.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on one final matter, last week,  some of our colleagues expressed disapproval of U.S. strikes against  al-Shabaab terrorists in Somalia. I find their views difficult to  understand.   Al-Shabaab poses a significant threat to U.S. interests. But you  don't have to take my word for it. Late in 2019, the leader of al- Shabaab, an al-Qaida-affiliated terrorist group based in Somalia, said:         Our biggest target today is the Americans . . . The only       reason we have exerted all this effort and undertaken all       this preparation today is to attack the American troops.    In the assessment of the commander of U.S. Africa Command, U.S.  General Stephen Townsend, that is coming from ``the largest,  wealthiest, and most violent Al Qaeda-associated group in the world''  and ``the primary African violent extremist organization threat to  American interests.''   This is not a new threat. Al-Shabaab was designated a foreign  terrorist organization back in 2008. Its leaders declared allegiance to  al-Qaida in 2012, a year before their attack on the Westgate Mall in  Kenya that killed 67 people. The Obama administration designated the  group as an al-Qaida-associated force in 2016. That made it subject to  the 2001 AUMF.   At the time, it was a difficult but telling acknowledgement that the  al-Qaida terrorist threat was growing. The raid that killed Bin Laden  had clearly not ended the threat his terrorists posed to our country.   As a result of its declared and demonstrated allegiance to al-Qaida,  al-Shabaab is clearly subject to the 2001 authorization for the use of  military force, no question. President Obama knew it. General Townsend  knows it. Al-Shabaab themselves tell us they want Americans dead. What  more, what more do the skeptics need?   If our colleagues do not want the U.S. military to conduct strikes  against the al-Qaida terrorists responsible for killing Americans and  threatening our interests, I would be interested to hear how they  propose we defend against these threats.   So, by the way, with the administration's rushed withdrawal from  Afghanistan, there are well-founded concerns that al-Qaida may be  roaring back in that country.   So which al-Qaida affiliate should we stop pressuring--al-Shabaab,  AQAP, ISIS? Should we stop hunting for al-Zawahiri, the leader of al- Qaida?   Administrations of both parties have identified and supported local  partners who share an interest in combating terrorists. By and large,  this approach has succeeded in keeping pressure on the terrorists while  keeping more Americans out of harm's way.   But despite the best efforts of local partners to keep the terrorists  at bay and the best efforts of U.S. diplomats to broker peace, some  terrorists do require direct action by the U.S. military to be stopped.  These hard-core extremists pose a serious threat to American national  security. They seek to attack our interests all around the world,  including our homeland, if we let them.   The threat they pose will not recede if we lose focus. In fact, the  exact opposite is the case. So I hope the Commander in Chief will  exercise the authorities the Congress has provided him and the tools  Congress has funded to keep America safe against the terrorists who  continue to target our homeland and our interests abroad.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
