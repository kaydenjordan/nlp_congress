 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Dr. Chris  Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act, which will enhance  whistleblower protections for employees at the VA and lead to better  care for our Nation's veterans.   This bill is named in honor of Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick, a Wisconsinite,  who tragically took his own life after being fired from the Tomah VA  Medical Center in my congressional district in Tomah, Wisconsin.   Dr. Kirkpatrick was a clinical psychologist who specialized in  treating some of the toughest and most pressing issues our veterans  face today: PTSD, substance abuse, and chronic pain.   During his time at Tomah, Dr. Kirkpatrick noticed a disturbing trend  of overprescribing of opioids to patients.                                time  1330    Dr. Kirkpatrick had the courage to blow the whistle to his superiors  about what he rightly saw as dangerous pain management practices at the  time. Sadly, the overprescribing issues that Dr. Kirkpatrick tried to  warn about continued to occur at Tomah VA.   In 2015, a Wisconsin veteran named Jason Simcakoski tragically lost  his life at the facility due to the dangerous pain management practices  at the Tomah VA. Last year, I worked with the Simcakoski family to pass  the bipartisan Jason Simcakoski PROMISE Act to improve pain management  practices at the VA so that no other veterans and their families have  to go through what the Simcakoski family had to.   Although Dr. Kirkpatrick is no longer with us today, his dedication  to serving veterans and his courage to stand up for what was right is  why we are here today. This act will ensure that no one is retaliated  against for coming forward with concerns about waste, fraud, abuse, and  malpractice at the VA. The bill offers a number of new protections for  whistleblowers and will help ensure that supervisors found guilty of  retaliation are held responsible for their actions.   Dr. Kirkpatrick was dedicated to improving lives and serving our  Nation's veterans. The bill before us today will honor the memory of  Dr. Kirkpatrick by helping to make sure no one has to go through what  he did.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.
