 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairwoman Granger, Ranking Member  Visclosky, and the staff for their hard work on this legislation.   The FY19 defense bill funds to the levels of the bipartisan budget  agreement, providing robust investments in the Department of Defense. I  believe we have achieved a bipartisan product that will improve the  readiness of our servicemembers, to ensure that they have the training  and the equipment necessary to do their jobs and come home safely.   Additionally, this bill makes serious investments in environmental  cleanup by funding the environmental remediation accounts at almost  $200 million over the President's request. This is a commitment that  will ensure communities living on or around our military installations  have access to clean drinking water.   In Minnesota, this fund has been critical to cleaning up the Twin  Cities Army Ammunition Plant. It is a site in my district. That  restoration has made community and business development possible on  what was once deeply polluted land.   But I do want to mention one longstanding concern I have regarding  the amount of money that we are set to spend on the Pentagon's Nuclear  Posture Review over the next decade. We already have a credible  nuclear deterrent, spending more than $1 trillion on the nuclear triad  and billions more on low-yield nuclear weapons we don't need.    It does not make a lot of budgetary sense to move forward on this  program. The American people don't see the sense in this either. That  is why I don't support this program.   Again, I want to thank the chair and the ranking member for their  work.
