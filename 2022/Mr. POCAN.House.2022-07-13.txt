 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our amendment to  reduce the Pentagon's budget.   First, let me thank Congresswoman Lee for her partnership on this  issue and thank her for securing our Nation always by pursuing peace  first.   Mr. Speaker, $839.3 billion, the amount of the defense spending  authorized by this bill, before we include anything of up to the 650  amendments this week, is too much with too little accountability.   We already spend more on defense than China, India, the United  Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Japan, and South Korea  combined. It is more than double the amount of funding that the EPA;  Health and Human Services; Departments of Education, Energy, Commerce,  State, Housing and Urban Development, and Agriculture all receive  combined.   This bill also goes above and beyond what the Department of Defense  asked for in its budget request submitted to Congress. Yet, the  Department of Defense still can't pass an audit of the funding it  receives, a requirement of virtually every other agency.   Let's stop rewarding the building of amphibious vehicles that sink,  unready projects like the F-35 that still have hundreds and hundreds of  recognized deficiencies that have not been addressed, and Ford-class  aircraft carriers that have toilets that cost $400 thousand in  chemicals to flush when clogged. Yes, we flush defense dollars down the  toilet. Let's fix this.   At some point, spending doesn't actually just make you safer. It is  security theater and contractor profiteering.   We need a more modern definition of defense, one that recognizes real  national security threats like COVID, cyberattacks, and climate change.  But the current defense budget doesn't do that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.
