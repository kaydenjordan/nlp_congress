 Madam Speaker, I rise today because I came to  Washington to cut taxes for the residents of north Jersey. Our taxes  are simply too high.   This morning, at The Heritage Foundation, the Speaker claimed that  the rest of the country is propping up New Jersey. That is backwards.  Currently, New Jersey pays in so that States like Wisconsin can cash  out.   New Jersey is already a grand subsidizer of other States. We are one  of the top 3 percent taxpaying districts in the entire country and at  the bottom in what we get back. We need to change that.   New Jersey only gets back 33 cents for every dollar we send to  Washington. New Jersey residents get $3,076 less, as this shows, than  what they pay in. West Virginia, for example, gets $4.23 back for every  dollar it sends in.   New Jersey is not America's piggybank.   Our one saving grace has been the State and local property tax  deduction: the ability to deduct those higher State, local, and  property taxes before we have to send in our tax checks every April. It  allows us to avoid double taxation. Eliminating these State and local  tax deductions will cost New Jersey an average of a $3,500 tax increase  per resident. Property values will go down more than 10 percent.   So I am fighting to remove this tax hike provision from the tax  reform bill that can hurt our businesses and our citizens.                            ____________________
