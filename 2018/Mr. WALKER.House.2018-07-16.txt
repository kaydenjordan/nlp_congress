 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1376) to amend title 44, United States Code, to require  preservation of certain electronic records by Federal agencies, to  require a certification and reports relating to Presidential records,  and for other purposes.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1376, the Electronic Message  Preservation Act of 2017, introduced by the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Cummings), the ranking member of the Committee on Oversight and  Government Reform. The Electronic Message Preservation Act of 2017 will  ensure the Federal Government continues to take the necessary steps to  modernize its recordkeeping.   Despite the significant shift to electronic communications over the  last two decades, many Federal agencies are just now moving away from a  print-to-file method of electronic record preservation. Using paper to  preserve electronic records is inefficient, difficult to manage,  difficult to search, and risks loss of the records. Paper-based systems  can also increase the cost to the taxpayer.   At the end of 2016, the Office of Management and Budget began  requiring agencies to preserve records electronically if they were  created electronically. This bill codifies that requirement. This bill  ensures agencies will continue to electronically manage their records,  where possible, and closes gaps in current law.   H.R. 1376 also requires electronic Presidential records be held to  the same archival standards as those of executive agencies.   I would like to thank the gentleman from Maryland for his work on  this important issue this Congress and in the previous Congress.   I encourage my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5415) to require agencies to submit reports on outstanding  recommendations in the annual budget justification submitted to  Congress, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5415         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Good Accounting Obligation       in Government Act'' or the ``GAO-IG Act''.       SEC. 2. REPORTS ON OUTSTANDING GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY                     OFFICE AND INSPECTOR GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS.         (a) Required Reports.--In the annual budget justification       submitted to Congress, as submitted with the budget of the       President under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code,       the head of each agency shall include the following:        (1) A report listing each public recommendation of the       Government Accountability Office that is designated by the       Government Accountability Office as ``open'' or ``closed,       unimplemented'' as of the date on which the annual budget       justification is submitted.        (2) A report listing each public recommendation for       corrective action from the Office of Inspector General of the       agency for which no final action has been taken as of the       date on which the annual budget justification is submitted.

(B) With respect to a public recommendation for corrective       action from the Office of Inspector General of the agency--        (i) for which the agency has taken action not recommended       and considers closed, an explanation of the reason why the       agency took different action with respect to each audit       report to which the public recommendation for corrective       action pertains; and        (ii) for which no final action has been taken, an       explanation of the reasons why no final action was taken with       respect to each audit report to which the public       recommendation for corrective action pertains.        (C) With respect to an outstanding unimplemented public       recommendation from the Office of Inspector General of the       agency that the agency has decided to adopt, a timeline for       implementation.        (4) An explanation for any discrepancy between--        (A) the most recent semiannual report submitted by the       Inspector General of the agency and the report submitted       under paragraphs (2) and (3); and        (B) any report submitted by the Government Accountability       Office relating to public recommendations that are designated       by the Government Accountability Office as ``open'' or       ``closed, unimplemented'' and any report submitted under       paragraph (1) and (2).        (b) Additional Report Requirements for Certain Agencies.--      The head of a covered agency shall include in the annual       budget justification described in subsection (a) a written       response to each recommendation designated by the Comptroller       in the annual priority recommendation letter sent to such       head as high priority for attention by that head.        (c) Copies of Submissions.--The head of each agency or       covered agency, as applicable, shall provide a copy of the       information submitted under subsections (a) and (b) to the       Comptroller General and the Inspector General of the agency.        (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this bill may be       construed to affect an authority provided to an Inspector       General of an agency under the Inspector General Act of 1978       (5 U.S.C. App.), including the authority of such Inspector       General to identify each recommendation on which final action       has not been taken.        (e) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Agency.--the term ``agency'' means--        (A) a designated Federal entity, as defined in section       8G(a)(2) of the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C.

App.).       SEC. 3. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to carry out the       requirements of this Act. Such requirements shall be carried       out using amounts otherwise authorized.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 5415, the GAO- IG Act.   The Government Accountability Office and inspectors general are two  of the best sources for recommendations to improve the operations of  the Federal Government. Their efforts help fight waste, fraud, and  abuse; promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness within the  executive branch; and save taxpayer dollars.   GAO and inspector general audits and investigations often end with  corrective recommendations to the agency reviewed. As of May 2018, the  GAO has issued more than 1,500 products with about 4,800 open  recommendations.   Since 2014, IGs have issued over 8,900 reports, with approximately  40,300 total recommendations. During that same time period, IGs  identified over $99 billion in potential savings through their audits,  investigations, and recommendations.   But all of these recommendations are only as valuable as the agency's  commitment to implement them. I introduced the GAO-IG Act to ensure  every agency evaluates and implements recommendations by GAO and the  inspector general. The bill requires agencies to include the unresolved  GAO and IG recommendations within their annual budget justification to  Congress.   Agencies must also report on the implementation status of each  recommendation and why they are not fully implemented. This creates a  formal process in which agencies must take stock of their open and  unimplemented recommendations each year. This increased transparency  will encourage each agency to work with GAO and its inspector general  to identify and implement high-priority open recommendations.   I would like to thank Representatives Palmer, Duncan, Bishop, and  Fitzpatrick for their cosponsorship of this legislation. I would also  like to thank Chairman Gowdy and Ranking Member Cummings of the  Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for their support. The  bill passed out of the committee unanimously by voice vote earlier this  year.   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4446) to amend the Virgin Islands of the United States  Centennial Commission Act to extend the expiration date of the  Commission, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.  [[Page H6202]]    The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4446         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SEC. 1. AMENDMENT.         The Virgin Islands of the United States Centennial       Commission Act (Public Law 114-224) is amended--        (1) in section 7(b), by striking ``January 31, 2018'' and       inserting ``January 31, 2019''; and        (2) in section 10, by striking ``September 30, 2018'' and       inserting ``September 30, 2019''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4446, introduced by the  gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).   H.R. 4446 would extend the Virgin Islands Centennial Commission by a  period of 1 year.   Congress established the Virgin Islands of the United States  Centennial Commission to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the  transfer of the Virgin Islands from Denmark to the United States. The  Commission was delayed in convening. As a result, no events have been  planned or carried out, and there is no final report available  detailing the Commission's recommended activities.   This bill extends the life of the Commission by 1 year to give it  more time to plan events celebrating this important moment in American  history. The bill also delays the deadline for submitting the final  report by 1 year.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4890) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 9801 Apollo Drive in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, as  the ``Wayne K. Curry Post Office Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4890         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. WAYNE K. CURRY POST OFFICE BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 9801 Apollo Drive in Upper Marlboro,       Maryland, shall be known and designated as the ``Wayne K.       Curry Post Office Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Wayne K. Curry Post Office Building''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4890, a bill to name the post  office at 9801 Apollo Drive in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, after Wayne K.  Curry.   Mr. Curry was born in Brooklyn in 1951, but grew up in Cheverly,  Maryland. After graduating from Western Maryland College, now McDaniel  College, Curry began working for Prince George's County while earning  his law degree at night. In 1944, Wayne Curry ran and was elected to  the position of county executive.   Curry passed away from lung cancer on July 2, 2014, at the age of 63.   He was a dedicated public servant, and we honor him today by naming a  post office after him in the county in which he served.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H6203]]         Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5238) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 1234 Saint Johns Place in Brooklyn, New York, as the  ``Major Robert Odell Owens Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5238         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. MAJOR ROBERT ODELL OWENS POST OFFICE.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 1234 Saint Johns Place in Brooklyn, New       York, shall be known and designated as the ``Major Robert       Odell Owens Post Office''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Major Robert Odell Owens Post Office''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5238, a bill to name the  post office at 1234 Saint Johns Place in Brooklyn, New York, after  Major Robert Odell Owens.   Major Owens led a life of public service, beginning as a librarian at  the Brooklyn Public Library. At around the same time, Owens became a  member of the Brooklyn chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality,  where he worked to fight racism and discrimination in New York City.   From 1975 to 1982, Owens served as New York State senator. In 1982,  Owens won election to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he went  on to serve 24 years as a representative to the citizens of New York  City.   In Congress, Owens fought passionately for many causes, including  education policy. He was active in the Congressional Black Caucus  Education Brain Trust, promoting reading, science, and math education.   This bill would honor Congressman Owens' service by naming a post  office in Brooklyn in his name.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2692, a bill to name the  post office at 4558 Broadway in New York, New York, after Stanley E.  Michels.   Stanley Michels was a lawyer and politician from Washington Heights  who was a New York councilman from 1978 to 2001. He was active in  environmental protection and public health, having sponsored New York  City's first law regulating smoking in public places.   Michels also sponsored one of the first city laws to prevent  childhood lead poisoning, and he played a significant role in expanding  the city's recycling program. Stanley Michels was a dedicated public  servant.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4407) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 3s101 Rockwell Street in Warrenville, Illinois, as  the ``Corporal Jeffery Allen Williams Post Office Building.''   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4407         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. CORPORAL JEFFERY ALLEN WILLIAMS POST OFFICE                     BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 3s101 Rockwell Street in Warrenville,       Illinois, shall be known and designated as the ``Corporal       Jeffery Allen Williams Post Office Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Corporal Jeffery Allen Williams Post       Office Building''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4407, introduced by the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren).   H.R. 4407 would name the post office on Rockwell Street in  Warrenville, Illinois, in honor of the life and service of Corporal  Jeffery Allen Williams.   Corporal Williams was born in 1985 and graduated from Wheaton  Warrenville South High School in 2003. Shortly after graduating,  Williams joined the Army and trained to become a medical specialist,  dedicating his career and life to help his fellow soldiers.   Williams was deployed to Iraq in 2005, where he was assigned as a  medic in then-Colonel H.R. McMaster's personal security detachment.  Tragically, Corporal Williams was killed in action in Iraq in September  2005.   He is remembered by his troop as a dedicated, tough, and disciplined  medic who always put others before himself. His decorations include the  Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, and the Army Commendation Medal.   We thank Corporal Williams for his service and sacrifice.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill to honor him.  I look forward to hearing more about Corporal Williams from the sponsor  of this bill, Mr. Hultgren, in a few minutes, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), who is the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 931) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 4910 Brighton Boulevard in Denver, Colorado, as the  ``George Sakato Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 931         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. GEORGE SAKATO POST OFFICE.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 4910 Brighton Boulevard in Denver,       Colorado, shall be known and designated as the ``George       Sakato Post Office''.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 931, introduced by the  senior Senator from Colorado, Senator Cory Gardner. S. 931 would name  the post office at 4910 Brighton Boulevard in Denver, Colorado, in  honor of Private George T. Sakato.   Born in Colton, California, Sakato joined the U.S. Army in 1944.  Sakato served in the Army's 442nd Regimental Combat Team during World  War II. On October 29, 1944, Sakato showed extraordinary heroism,  charging a hill on the front line in France, winning control of the  site and assuming control of his platoon after his platoon leader was  killed in action.   In recognition of his heroism, Congress awarded him Nation's highest  award for military valor, the Medal of Honor.   After returning home, Sakato continued 27 years of his life to work  at the Stockyards Station Post Office.   Today and through this bill, we celebrate Private Sakato's life and  service to his Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill honoring his  life and service, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2979) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 390 West 5th Street in San Bernardino, California,  as the ``Jack H. Brown Post Office Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

JACK H. BROWN POST OFFICE BUILDING.

(b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Jack H.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2979, a bill to name the  post office at 390 West 5th Street in San Bernardino in honor of Jack  H. Brown.   Jack Brown was born in San Bernardino, California, in 1938. He served  in the Navy's Pacific Fleet during the Vietnam era.   After returning home, Brown took a job at Stater Bros. Markets, a  popular local grocery store. He would go on to found Stater Brothers  Charities, along with the Boys and Girls Club in San Bernardino and  Children's Fund of San Bernardino County.   Jack did a great deal for his community, and it is fitting that we  would name now a post office in his hometown in his honor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4946) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 1075 North Tustin Street in Orange, California, as  the ``Specialist Trevor A.

Win'E Post       Office''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may conclude.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4946, a bill to name the  post office at 1075 North Tustin Street in Orange, California, in honor  of U.S. Army Specialist Trevor Win'E.   Trevor Win'E was born in 1981, in Orange, California. Specialist  Win'E enlisted in the Army shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks to  train as a petroleum supply specialist.   In 2003, he was set to deploy to South Korea but requested to,  instead, deploy with his unit to Iraq, a request the Army granted. One  year later, he was killed when his convoy encountered an IED attack in  Tikrit, Iraq, causing fatal injuries.   Today, we honor Specialist Trevor Win'E's bravery and sacrifice for  our Nation with a small but lasting symbol of our gratefulness and  respect.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5504) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 4801 West Van Giesen Street in West Richland,  Washington, as the ``Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman Post Office  Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 5504           Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives       of the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SERGEANT DIETRICH SCHMIEMAN POST OFFICE BUILDING.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5504, a bill introduced  by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse) to name a post office  in West Richland, Washington, in honor of Marine Sergeant Dietrich  Schmieman.   Marine Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman grew up in Richland, Washington.  After graduating high school in 2009, Schmieman enlisted in the Marine  Corps, eventually attending the Special Operations School.   Sergeant Schmieman completed two overseas deployments. He received  multiple honors during his service, including two Marine Corps  Achievement Medals and a Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation. He also  achieved his goal of serving as a critical skills operator in the 2nd  Raider Battalion.   In July 2017, Sergeant Schmieman was tragically killed in a cargo  plane crash over Mississippi. We thank him for his service to our  Nation, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill in his honor.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to hearing more about this bill from  Congressman Newhouse in a few minutes, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Newhouse), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3076) to amend section 552a of title 5, United States Code  (commonly referred to as the Privacy Act) to require agencies to accept  electronic release forms, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3076         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H6210]]            SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Creating Advanced       Streamlined Electronic Services for Constituents Act of       2018'' or the ``CASES Act''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) congressional offices provide crucial services to       constituents by acting as a liaison between the constituents       and the respective agencies;        (2) this includes assisting constituents by making       inquiries and working toward resolutions on behalf of the       constituent with the respective agencies; and        (3) this process should be simplified through the creation       of electronic forms that may be submitted under section 552a       of title 5, United States Code (commonly referred to as the       Privacy Act), thus modernizing the process for constituents       and improving access and efficiency of Government services       and agencies in order to expedite the resolution of the       problem for which constituents sought help.

(2) Consent identifier.--The Director, or a designee, shall       assign each consent form submitted through the portal       described in paragraph (1) a consent identifier, which shall       be provided to the agency and the individual or entity       submitting the consent form.

No additional funds are authorized to carry out the       requirements of this Act. Such requirements shall be carried       out using amounts otherwise authorized.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3076, the CASES for  Constituents Act, introduced by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Graves).   One of the most important services we can provide our constituents is  help in navigating the complicated bureaucracy of Federal agencies.  Whether it is a senior who needs help with a Social Security office or  a veteran whose benefits are delayed, as Members of Congress, we can  often help constituents reach a real person and get better results from  Federal agencies.   However, in order for us to assist constituents while protecting  their privacy rights, the Privacy Act requires constituents to complete  and sign a consent form before agencies can provide a Member of  Congress information about the case. The constituent prints the form or  obtains it in person from a congressional office, signs it, and then  mails, faxes, emails, or physically brings it back to the congressional  office. The congressional office then must send the consent form to the  agency from which the constituent needs help.   This process has unnecessary steps, leading to delays that frustrate  our constituents, many of whom need help quickly.   H.R. 3076 helps to speed up the process by allowing constituents to  submit Privacy Act consent forms electronically directly to the agency  or a central portal. H.R. 3076 instructs the Office of Management and  Budget to issue guidance to Federal agencies to accept electronic  consent. OMB's guidance will maintain a role for congressional  caseworkers to advocate on behalf of constituents for a swift  resolution.   A swift resolution is especially important for those constituents in  the wake of natural disasters, since victims often need to reach out to  multiple Federal entities for relief. At a time when many citizens need  help from their government, allowing them to communicate more easily  with the government is the very least we can do.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Representatives Garret Graves and  Joe Kennedy for introducing this bill to improve constituents'  experiences when they are seeking help.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this practical solution,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4960) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 511 East Walnut Street in Columbia, Missouri, as the  ``Spc. Sterling William Wyatt Post Office Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4960           Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives       of the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SPC. STERLING WILLIAM WYATT POST OFFICE BUILDING.           (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States       Postal Service located at 511 East Walnut Street in Columbia,       Missouri, shall be known and designated as the ``Spc.       Sterling William Wyatt Post Office Building''.          (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Spc. Sterling William Wyatt Post Office       Building''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.  [[Page H6212]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4960, a bill introduced by the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler) to name the post office at  511 East Walnut Street in Columbia, Missouri, in honor of Specialist  Sterling William Wyatt.   Sterling Wyatt was born and raised in Columbia, Missouri. Even before  he graduated high school, Wyatt had shown great service and  achievement. He participated in the youth group and operated the sound  equipment for his church. He made the rank of Eagle Scout. He earned a  black belt in tae kwon do, and he received a certification as a nurse  attendant.   After graduating high school in 2009, Wyatt continued his service,  enlisting in the United States Army, where he was assigned to the 5th  Battalion, 2nd Infantry Division, and was ultimately deployed to  Afghanistan.   On July 11, 2012, when on patrol in Kandahar, Afghanistan, Wyatt's  vehicle was attacked by an IED, and he was killed in action at age 21.   Specialist Wyatt made the ultimate sacrifice in his service of his  nation. In recognition of his heroism, Specialist Wyatt was awarded the  Medal of Valor, the Bronze Star, and the National Defense Service  Medal, among others. We commend him for his service and honor him for  his sacrifice.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Hartzler for introducing the bill  and look forward to hearing more about the bill from her in the next  few minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3230) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 915 Center Avenue in Payette, Idaho, as the ``Harmon  Killebrew Post Office Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3230         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. HARMON KILLEBREW POST OFFICE BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 915 Center Avenue in Payette, Idaho, shall       be known and designated as the ``Harmon Killebrew Post Office       Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Harmon Killebrew Post Office Building''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.  [[Page H6213]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3230, a bill introduced by the  gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Labrador), to name the post office at 915  Center Avenue in Payette, Idaho, in honor of Harmon Killebrew.   Harmon Clayton Killebrew was born in Payette, Idaho, in 1936. He  began his career playing major league baseball in 1954. He played over  22 seasons with multiple teams, and when he retired in 1975, he had the  fifth most home runs in major league history.   Killebrew was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984. In 1976,  Killebrew cofounded the Danny Thompson Memorial, an annual golf  tournament that raises money for cancer research.   Sadly, on March 17, 2011, at the age of 74, Killebrew passed away. He  left an incredible legacy, one we continue to honor with this bill.   I thank the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Labrador) for introducing this  bill and look forward to hearing more from him about Killebrew in a few  minutes.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Idaho (Mr. Labrador), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 899) to amend title 38, United States Code, to ensure that the  requirements that new Federal employees who are veterans with service- connected disabilities are provided leave for purposes of undergoing  medical treatment for such disabilities apply to certain employees of  the Veterans Health Administration, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 899         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Providing       Healthcare Transition Improvement Act''.       SEC. 2. DISABLED VETERAN LEAVE FOR HEALTH-CARE PROFESSIONALS                     IN VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION.         (a) In General.--Section 6329(d)(1) of title 5, United       States Code, is amended to read as follows:        ``(1) the term `employee' has the meaning given such term       in section 2105, and includes--        ``(A) an officer or employee of the United States Postal       Service or the Postal Regulatory Commission; and        ``(B) notwithstanding subsection (a) of section 7421 of       title 38, an individual occupying a position listed in       subsection (b) of such section;''.  [[Page H6214]]         (b) Applicability.--With respect to a position listed in       section 7421(b) of title 38, United States Code, the       amendment made by subsection (a) shall apply to any       individual appointed to such a position on or after the date       of enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 899, the Veterans Providing  Healthcare Transition Improvement Act introduced by the junior Senator  from Hawaii.   S. 899 is the Senate version of H.R. 2648 introduced by the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Stivers). In 2015, Congress enacted the Wounded Warriors  Federal Leave Act. The Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act provides 104  hours of paid sick leave to newly employed veterans with a service- connected disability rating of 30 percent or more.   The sick leave is used to attend medical treatment related to the  service-connected disability and must be used within 12 months of  beginning employment. The law, however, did not explicitly apply to  veterans hired into certain medical occupations at the Department of  Veterans Affairs.   When the VA has applied the provisions of the act to these  occupations, this bill would ensure new veterans hired in these  positions continue to receive paid sick leave to treat their service- connected disability.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Stivers) for sponsoring the House version of this bill and for his  dedication to caring for our Nation's veterans. I would also like to  thank Chairman  David Roe and his staff at the House Committee on  Veterans' Affairs for working with us to bring this bill to the floor.   I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                   Committee on Veterans Affairs,                                      Washington, DC, June 19, 2018.      Hon. Trey Gowdy,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       2648, the ``Veterans Transition Improvement Act,'' and its       Senate companion, S. 899. There are provisions in the       legislation that fall within the jurisdiction of the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this legislation, I       am willing to waive this committee's right to sequential       referral. I do so with the understanding that by waiving       consideration of the bills, the Committee on Veterans'       Affairs does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over       the subject matters contained in the bills which fall within       its jurisdiction. I also request that you urge the Speaker to       name members of this committee to any conference committee       which is named to consider such provisions.        Please place this letter into the committee report on H.R.       2648 and into the Congressional Record during consideration       of this legislation on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                David P. Roe, M.D.,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and             Government Reform,                                     Washington, DC, June 20, 2018.      Hon. David P. Roe, M.D.,      Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On May 23, 2018, the Committee on       Oversight and Government Reform ordered reported H.R. 2648,       the Veterans Transition Improvement Act with an amendment, by       voice vote. The bill was referred primarily to the Committee       on Veterans' Affairs with an additional referral to the       Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Based on our       previous consultation, we intend to request S. 899--the       Senate companion to H.R. 2648--be scheduled for floor       consideration.        To expedite floor consideration, I ask that you forego       further consideration of H.R. 2648. This in no way affects       your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it       will not serve as precedent for future referrals. In       addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I       would support your request to have the Committee on Veterans'       Affairs represented on the conference committee. Finally, I       would be pleased to include this letter and any response in       the bill report filed by the Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform on H.R. 2648, as well as in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of S. 899, to       memorialize our understanding.        Thank you for your consideration of my request.            Sincerely,                                                        Trey Gowdy.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Stivers), the champion of this bill and the sponsor of its House  companion.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
