 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Ms. Norton,  for having this amazing interest to our country put before us for a  vote.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1532, No Human Trafficking on  Our Roads, and S. 1536, the Combating Human Trafficking in Commercial  Vehicles Act.   As the vice chair of the congressional bipartisan Caucus for Women's  Issues and a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee,  I am pleased that we are solving these issues of real concern.   Human trafficking is an inexcusable crime. According to the National  Human Trafficking Resource Center, about 8 in 10 reported victims are  women. It is a crime that exploits women more than anyone else, and  especially young girls.   Mr. Speaker, combating human trafficking is a serious concern of  mine. Unfortunately, in my district--I represent the Metro Detroit  area--a major international transportation and shipping hub in  southeast Michigan, we rank number seven in total human trafficking  cases reported in our country.   These bills mark progress toward combating human trafficking. We are  improving our systems to better recognize and report this crime. We are  closing loopholes in our transportation system that traffickers have  taken advantage of for far too long.   I am proud to support these bills, and I urge my colleagues to  support them as well.   Mr. Speaker, today I needed a vote and a voice for something that is  good for this country, and so I stand here in support.
