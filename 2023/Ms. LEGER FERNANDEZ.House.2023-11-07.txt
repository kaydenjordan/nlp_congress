 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Indiana, Mrs. Houchin, for the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, after wasting weeks as Republicans tried to get their  house in order, we have just 10 days left to fund the government or we  shut down.   My colleagues across the aisle might say that the House has already  passed 7 of 12 funding bills, but they know those bills are so extreme  that they won't get the necessary Democratic or Republican votes in the  Senate and don't have any chance of becoming law.   We are reviewing another extreme bill today, H.R. 4664, the Financial  Services and General Government Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2024.   Let's start with the numbers. The bill is 58 percent below last  year's level. If any of you had a business or just balanced your  housing budget, what would happen if you cut almost 60 percent from  what you had to spend from one year to the next? Your business or your  household would fail.    If a budget reflects your values, this extreme Republican bill values  the wealthy, the well-connected, the fraudsters, and the scammers.   A family putting their baby to bed tonight knows cribs are safe. The  babies aren't being strangled because of the work of the Consumer  Product Safety Commission, which recently turned 50.   What are Republicans doing in this bill to this well-honored and  respected  [[Page H5484]]  Commission? They are cutting their funding by 10 percent, so big  corporations can put profit over safety. Right now a small business  entrepreneur in a rural community or an affordable housing developer in  an urban neighborhood that the big banks ignore can secure financing  from a community development financial institution.   What is H.R. 4664 doing about those great affordable housing  opportunities? They are cutting the CDFI funding by $45 million. They  are cutting the Small Business Administration's entrepreneurship  program by $72 million. They are destroying opportunities that could be  created in small places that big banks just don't care about.   We want to grow the middle class and lower costs for Americans, but  this bill would do the opposite by slashing the budgets of the agencies  that protect consumers.   American consumers can sometimes feel helpless against the robocalls,  the credit card and bank fees, and the financial scammers. Well, the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau helped those consumers get $19  billion back when they went after those scammers, when they went after  those excessive fees. However, this bill would weaken this agency, an  agency that was born out of the 2008 financial crisis and the Great  Recession, a crisis that I will remind everybody occurred on  Republicans' watch and brought great suffering to families and  businesses.   This bill also undermines oversight of Wall Street when it cuts the  SEC by $149 million. Remember the SEC? It also came into existence, but  this time during the Great Depression. In each financial crisis we have  mentioned, Democratic Congresses and Presidents stood with small  businesses and working families against greed. Yes, the greed of Wall  Street and the greed of payday lenders.   This bill tells us that extreme Republicans are okay with dangerous  or defective products making their way into homes. Indeed, last night,  one Republican Member said we should just get rid of the Consumer  Product Safety Commission or just let them make recommendations, maybe  Congress will act. It is ridiculous to get rid of this important  consumer product safety agency.   Finally, this bill rescinds $10.2 billion from funding we gave to the  IRS last year. Then it cuts more funds for the IRS to modernize or  protect itself from cybersecurity threats. Why would you want to make  the IRS vulnerable to cybersecurity threats?   To add insult, the bill would keep the IRS from developing a program  so Americans can file their taxes for free. Really? You want to make  sure for-profit companies can charge taxpayers to file their taxes? How  cynical is that?                                time  1245    At a time when Americans are worried about fentanyl killing their  loved ones, this bill cuts funding for the Office of National Drug  Control Policy.   At a time when Americans are worried about terrorism, this bill cuts  funding for the National Security Council and Homeland Security  Advisory Council.   While this bill cuts funding for CDFI, Democrats are fighting to grow  the middle class by making housing more affordable.   While Republicans cut funding to the SBA, we are putting people over  politics by supporting small businesses.   Democrats, as we have been saying for the last 3 years, put people  over politics.   Unfortunately, this weekend the Republican Speaker of the House  stated he would not put people over politics. Well, today's  appropriations bill actually proves that.   I will end where I started. There are just 11 days to fund the  government. We need spending bills that are bipartisan, that address  the real needs of American taxpayers instead of just protecting the  wealthy and well off.   House Democrats want to work in a bipartisan manner to get things  done for the American people, but we will not stand for the extreme  culture wars, the attacks on reproductive healthcare, and the draconian  cuts House Republicans keep putting up for a vote in these  appropriations bills.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Americans know that the climate catastrophe is wreaking havoc on our  economy.   I come from a State where we lost billions due to wildfires that were  caused by many factors, but this repeats itself over and over again.   Across America, there is no place that is safe from the climate  catastrophe: the flooding, the hurricanes, the fires, the drought, and  those cost money.   They cost our farmers money. They cost our ranchers money, our  cities, our towns, our governments, and so yes, we must address that.   In fact, this administration was elected precisely because he said he  would address that. We need to emphasize that. To pretend that there  isn't an economic cost is to put your head in the sand.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from the  District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), my wonderful colleague representing  the District  [[Page H5485]]  of Columbia, which is a Democratically elected city, and we should  respect it as such.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Espaillat), an esteemed Member who I look  forward to hearing his viewpoints on the importance of addressing the  urgent needs that Americans have told us about such as how do we lower  costs, how do we make sure that we bring into line Americans' dreams  with Americans' realities.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, we hear time and again that these draconian spending  cuts are necessary because of the deficit, but let's take a step back  and think about how we got here in the first place and what we really  can do about it.   We need to remember that 36 percent of the debt is due to Republican  tax cuts, the Iraq war, the Republican war. This does not include the  $12.5 billion that Republicans are adding to the deficit from their  cuts to the IRS last week.   Clearly, Republicans like to talk about this, but they don't fix the  problem. Indeed, they are the problem. Their tax cuts are the problem.   While the House GOP continues to blame critical social, economic  development, and law enforcement programs for the Nation's debt, they  hide the fact that if it weren't for those tax cuts enacted under  President Bush and President Trump, our debt wouldn't be an issue.  Indeed, the report shows that revenues would have kept up with spending  if we wouldn't have had these tax cuts.   Mr. Speaker, let's remind people where those tax cuts went. Who  benefited? The wealthy and the corporations that to this day still do  not pay their fair share in taxes.   If you want to address the issue of the deficit, let's address the  issue of the tax cuts, which you can see on this chart are primarily  due to the Trump and the Bush tax cuts, which isn't included on here,  or the Reagan tax cuts, which is when we started this downward spiral.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to provide for consideration of a resolution  which clearly states that it is the people's House's duty to keep our  promise to American workers and seniors to protect and preserve Social  Security and Medicare and to fight against any cuts to these vital  programs.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record along with any extraneous material  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  [[Page H5487]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr.  Robert Garcia), to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, first, I will touch on the idea that the Trump tax cuts  are suddenly the Pelosi tax cuts. That is ridiculous. We know the Trump  tax cuts. They claimed them. They want to extend them. In fact, they  have already been working on a bill in the Ways and Means Committee  that would increase tax cuts for the wealthy, but let's put that aside.   Mr. Speaker, let me talk about something else that is in this bill  that is very problematic. We know that we are in a period when  elections are so key, and preserving the integrity of our elections and  making sure that those who work on the democratic process, the day-to- day process of making sure that our elections work, have all the help  that they can get.   Right now, State and local election administrators are working hard  to make sure that is possible, but they are afraid.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record the  2023 Brennan Center poll analysis about the high turnover of election  officials amid safety threats and political interference.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4664 would make it harder for  those hardworking election officials to do their jobs.   This bill cuts funding for the Election Assistance Commission by $8  million. That funding helps State and local officials administer fair,  free, and secure elections. H.R. 4664 would also eliminate funding for  election security grants.   In New Mexico, the secretary of State has used that money for  security trainings and to enhance voter registration.   Don't we all want more people to vote? I know Democrats do.   Indiana, as an example, has used funds for election security and to  upgrade voting equipment. This bill says to those election  administrators: Good luck. We are not helping you anymore with these  kinds of Federal funds.   Mr. Speaker, that is not all. This bill includes multiple riders that  would allow private companies, nonprofits, and government contractors  to keep their political spending secret. This type of secrecy leads the  American public to lose faith in our representative government. Our  constituents deserve transparency and to know that we work for them and  not some special interest group.   Let's put this bill aside and instead take up one that our democracy  deserves. We must always be working to that more perfect Union that our  Constitution calls out, but it requires work and funding our elections  at adequate levels.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, think about this rule. It sets out many amendments, and  that is what we have been seeing when we have been coming to the floor.  We come down and spend 10 minutes debating amendments that would reduce  somebody's salary to $1, but then it loses overwhelmingly. Over and  over, we keep coming to the floor and debating these amendments that  are nonstarters from the beginning, but we are taking up precious floor  time to do that.   Mr. Speaker, there was an amendment that isn't in this rule that  passed out of committee on a 30-30 vote. It was highly bipartisan and  didn't make it into the underlying bill. We asked last night if we  couldn't bring an amendment like this that clearly has bipartisan  support to the floor so that House Members would be able to vote on it.   Mr. Speaker, that amendment was the bipartisan Aguilar-Ciscomani  amendment, which would have allowed DACA recipients to work for the  Federal Government.   Remember, Dreamers can lawfully work for State, local, and Tribal  governments and in the private sector. Americans overwhelmingly support  Dreamers who were brought to this country at a young age and grew up  here. Up to 73 percent of voters in battleground States support  Dreamers and their ability to work.   This is the kind of amendment that this rule should have made in  order. I am disappointed that it didn't.   Mr. Speaker, as noted, after waiting weeks for the Republicans to  stop their infighting, we have just 10 days to fund the government.  However, my colleagues across the aisle have brought forward a bill  that slashes crucial funding for agencies that protect hardworking  Americans. Remember, this bill is 58 percent below what was  appropriated last year.   What does it do? It makes it easier for scammers, fraudsters, and  cheaters to exploit vulnerable citizens, including our seniors and  children, and makes it easier for them to get away with it.   The proposed cuts to agencies like the IRS, the Federal Trade  Commission, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission would expose  families to greater risk, all while protecting the interests of the  wealthy and the well connected.   As if that wasn't enough, this bill reduces support for election  officials by eliminating funding for election security grants.   In June, Congressional Republicans and Democrats and President Biden  made a deal to keep the lights on, and we passed the Fiscal  Responsibility Act into law. Mr. Speaker, 149 Republicans voted for  that law.   Americans expect us to live up to our word. Americans expect us to  live up to our promise. Americans expect us to live up to a law that  came out of significant and intense negotiation as to what the funding  level for government would be.   Unfortunately, Republicans broke that promise. They didn't even wait  a week before they broke that promise.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question and  this  [[Page H5489]]  rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
