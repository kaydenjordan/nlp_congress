 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a great  American and my dear friend, Brian Schlifke, of Lexington, Kentucky.   Brian served in the United States Army Signal Corps during the  Vietnam war, answering our Nation's call with valor through two tours.  He was a specialist in communications and earned the Bronze Star and  Combat Medal. He once said that he was ``no hero, just proud to have  been of service to my fellow soldiers.''   He continued that spirit of service throughout his life, working  diligently on behalf of other veterans. He was associated with the  Vietnam Veterans of America and Kentucky's Sixth District Veterans  Coalition.   Brian was a tireless advocate for his fellow veterans and worked in a  positive way to bring about necessary legislative changes. He had a  great spirit and a contagious smile, and his love for his country was  unwavering.   Our Nation lost a true patriot when Brian passed away on June 20,  2021. Brian is survived by his wife, Anne, and many other family  members.   It is my distinct honor, on behalf of a grateful Nation, to remember,  recognize, and pay tribute to the exemplary life of Brian Schlifke.                            ____________________
