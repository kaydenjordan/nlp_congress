 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Dr. Robert Martino  of Clarksburg, West Virginia.   In 2013, Dr. Martino began a unique program, generously providing one  day of free dental services to local Active-Duty military and their  families. He wanted to give back to those who have sacrificed so much,  and he has continued to do so each and every year, thereafter, and has  spread this idea throughout his professional network.   This day of service has now swept across the Nation, with over 500  businesses now offering our soldiers everything from dental services to  accounting. It has become known as Freedom Day.   But that isn't enough. I want to challenge more businesses to  participate. Visit freedomday.usa.org to find out how to get involved.   Dr. Martino, thank you for the example you set for America. You are  truly a great American.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule on  H.R. 3017, the Brownfields Enhancement, Economic Redevelopment and  Reauthorization Act of 2017. I am proud to be the sponsor of this bill,  which has broad bipartisan support, as you have been hearing about. It  will reauthorize the very successful EPA program, brownfields program,  for the first time since it was enacted.   Like my colleague Mr. Woodall said last night in the Rules Committee,  even though the brownfields site program is something that we all  support, and brownfields is something we all have in our districts,  working out the details of legislation like this is not easy, but the  fact that we are here today with a compromise bipartisan bill and no  amendment speaks volumes of how much support there is for H.R. 3017 and  the brownfields program.   There is no dispute that the EPA brownfields program has been a  success. As you just heard from the gentlewoman from Wyoming, the  program has resulted in over 27,000 properties being reassessed to  start them on this road to being cleaned up, and it has resulted in  over 129,000 new jobs.   Over the life of the program, the Federal dollars invested have  resulted in over $25 billion in leveraged private investment. This is a  program we all should support, and we all should encourage our  colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to fully fund this program  in the future.   I have confidence that H.R. 3017 will make the brownfields program  even more successful, and I urge my colleagues to be in support of the  rule and to vote for the bill on final passage.   I want to thank my committee chairman, John Shimkus, for his work and  the staff's work in bringing this bill together in a fine, compromised  fashion.
