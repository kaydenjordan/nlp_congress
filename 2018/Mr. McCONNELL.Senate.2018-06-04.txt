 Madam President, the Senate will begin this week by  voting on three more of the President's well-qualified nominees for the  Federal judiciary.   First on the slate is Magistrate Judge Robert Wier, selected by  President Trump to serve as a district judge for the Eastern District  of Kentucky.   Judge Wier's sterling credentials and the support he enjoys from the  legal community suggest that he will excel on the Federal bench. He  graduated at the top of his class at the University of Kentucky,  followed by a successful career in private practice. In 2006, he became  a magistrate judge. In 2014, his colleagues unanimously reappointed him  to a second term.   Judge Wier has the intellect, skill, and experience to take on this  role. I will proudly vote to advance his nomination later today.   Following Judge Wier, we will consider Fernando Rodriguez for the  Southern District of Texas and Annemarie Axon for the Northern District  of Alabama.   In each case, the Senate's work will be upholding one of our most  central constitutional responsibilities--to consider and confirm high- quality candidates.                            ____________________     Madam President, last week brought another set of  encouraging headlines about our growing economy. In the month of May,  the U.S. economy generated 223,000 new jobs. Unemployment has fallen to  3.8 percent, its lowest level since April of 2000. The proportion of  American adults who are employed is as high as it has been at any point  since the financial crisis.   We know these economic indicators can sometimes be noisy, but  consider them alongside all of the other signs we have seen over the  past year. Since President Trump was elected alongside a Republican  Congress, the number of Americans who say they are optimistic about  finding a good job has jumped 25 percentage points, and small business  owners report in record numbers that they are optimistic about the  prospects of hiring new employees.   The bottom line is clear: Under the policies of this unified  Republican government, American workers, families,  [[Page S2954]]  and business owners are achieving economic growth that is unmatched in  recent memory. It is driven by a 21st century tax code that lets  Americans keep more of their own money and encourages job creators to  invest in our Nation's workers.   It is made possible by historic regulatory reform, which has leveled  the playing field for American consumers and small businesses. From  farmers and ranchers to community bankers, the burdens of an out-of- control regulatory state are being lifted.   So after a decade of stagnation, Republican policies have gotten  Washington out of the way and freed American workers and job creators  to do what they do best--build a dynamic economy that is literally the  envy of the world.   But as impressive as some of these statistics may be, I think it is  important to keep in mind that these stories are, at the end of the  day, human stories. More than 1 million new jobs have been created just  since we passed tax reform last December. That is not an abstract  number. That is 1 million opportunities for young workers who are just  starting out and need to begin climbing the first rungs of the economic  ladder; for young fathers and mothers who can now leave a position  where their pay has stayed flat for a new opening in their industry; or  for midcareer professionals who were sidelined by a tough economy and  can now suit up and check back in to the game.   These aren't just economic statistics; they are American men and  women who have new chances to support their families and build their  lives that they simply did not have under the policies of the previous  administration.   I am glad that we fought and won--and will continue to win--major  accomplishments for the middle-class families we represent.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, June 5, all  postcloture time on the Wier nomination be considered expired and the  Senate vote on the confirmation of the nomination; further, that if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid on the  table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  June 5; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour  be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed. I further ask that following leader  remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Wier nomination under the previous order. Finally,  I ask that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to allow  for the weekly conference meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:06 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, June 5, 2018, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
