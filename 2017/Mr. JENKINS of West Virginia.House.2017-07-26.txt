 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman so  much for his leadership on this issue.   WOTUS, waters of the U.S., it has really been talked about for a  number of years. This is a classic case of Barack Obama, the  administration previous to the Trump administration, overreaching its  authority. This is executive branch takeover, waters of the U.S.,  saying that we have got what is called navigable waters and using the  executive authority to redefine what navigable waters are.    This hurts farmers. This hurts small businesses. The suggestion that  just a puddle, a small creek is defined as a navigable water, we know  that is simply not the case.   Let me remind folks about the three branches of government:  legislative, executive, and judiciary. We have Supreme Court decisions  that were putting a stop to the overreach of the Obama administration's  WOTUS rule. Thank you to the courts.   We now have an opportunity as the legislative branch. We appreciate  the work of the executive branch. We appreciate the fact that Donald  Trump and Scott Pruitt and this administration are working to put a  stop to it, because the Court said, as we all know, the Obama  administration overreached.   Now what we are doing, what this appropriations bill provides is the  voice of the legislative branch to say, yes, the prior administration  overreached; the executive branch historically needs to be curtailed;  the courts were right. We need to speak as the legislative branch  giving the authority to stop this onerous rule.   I applaud the work of the Appropriations Committee. We need to put  the legislative stamp of approval on what the Trump administration is  doing to stop this overregulation.  [[Page H6432]]    I thank the chair, and I certainly oppose this proposed amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the gentleman from New Jersey's amendment.   The fossil Energy Research and Development account actually helps the  Nation use the full extent of our resources safely, wisely, and  efficiently. I always hear Members say--and I have heard it several  times tonight already--that they support an ``all-of-the-above'' energy  strategy.   Unfortunately, this amendment does just the opposite. It picks energy  winners and losers. The level of funding for fossil Energy R&D in this  year's bill recognizes the important role fossil energy plays in our  Nation's future.   At a time when fossil power generation is actually expanding around  the globe, the activities funded in the bill advance our Nation's  position as a leader in fossil energy technologies.   I just hosted a conference in my home State of West Virginia on  something that is getting a lot of attention lately: rare earth  elements.   I want everybody just to think about that phone that they hold in  their hand or, if they are watching on TV, that TV in their home.   Guess what. These phones and those TVs have what is called rare earth  elements. And you would think by the term ``rare earth,'' it must mean,  gosh, they are rare, hard to find.   Guess what. Rare earth elements are found in many places. Amazingly,  coal contains an abundant supply of rare earth elements.   This is important to our national security because, currently, China  has a monopoly on the rare earth element market. Ninety percent of all  rare earth elements that are in every phone and every TV are controlled  by China. But we know that coal, through research, can unlock an  abundant supply of these critical elements that we need for everyday  technology.   So this just isn't about energy production. This is about everyday  items that impact our life.                                time  2030    So for our Nation's security and electric grid reliability and use of  our domestic fossil fuel resources, investment in fossil R&D is  critical. Each of these programs represent a partnership with the  private sector that provides an even greater leverage to Federal funds.  Therefore, I urge our Members to vote against the gentleman from New  Jersey's amendment so we can support fossil energy R&D for our country  and for our future.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  gentleman from New Jersey's amendment.   Let me simply state, while he politely suggests we have agreement,  bottom line, his amendment guts the fossil energy R&D. It takes over  $300 million out of the fossil research and development, the kinds of  research and  [[Page H6434]]  development that can generate rare Earth elements and other things that  we have talked about, in addition to use for our power generation.   Mr. Chair, I simply oppose this amendment and ask for its rejection.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I will be very brief.   By my calculation, this is about the third or fourth amendment from  the minority trying to take money out of a very important future- looking initiative, the fossil energy R&D, and redirect it elsewhere.  They keep trying to raid this important funding.   I am sitting here with my colleague from West Virginia, who NETL is  actually physically in his district. There is no stronger champion of  NETL than  [[Page H6436]]  the gentleman from West Virginia. This is hundreds of jobs in our  State, in his district, but the impact of their work reaches across the  country and literally around the world.   I spoke on a previous attack on this funding a moment ago. I defend  strongly the work of the fossil energy R&D. And to suggest this is just  looking to yesterday is missing the point that I made a moment ago  talking about rare earth elements and unlocking the potential that  these fossil resources have in so many ways, not just energy  production.   So I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for recognizing and  supporting fossil energy R&D and my colleague from West Virginia, who  is such a staunch supporter of NETL, and my ability to work with him.   Please, I encourage people to reject the gentleman's amendment.
