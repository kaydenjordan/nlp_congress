 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address a very important issue  in South Carolina's First Congressional District, the State of South  Carolina, and the United States of America.   Last week, a member of the State legislature in South Carolina filed  a piece of legislation that would execute women who have abortions. To  see this debate go to the dark places, the dark edges where it has gone  on both sides of the aisle, has been deeply disturbing to me as a  woman, as a female legislator, as a mom, and as a victim of rape. I was  raped as a teenager at the age of 16.   This debate ought to be a bipartisan debate where we balance the  rights of women and we balance the right to life.   But we aren't having that conversation here in D.C., we aren't having  that conversation at home, and we aren't having that conversation with  fellow State lawmakers.   This week, I filed a bill that would give women greater access to  contraceptives by cutting the red tape, reducing the application fees  with the FDA, and reducing that application process by half.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get  on board with these issues today.                            ____________________
