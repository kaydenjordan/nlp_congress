 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of subtitle E of title XVI, add the following       new section:       SEC. 1673. MODIFICATION TO CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE REVIEW                     OF COST ESTIMATES FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS.         Paragraph (1)(A) of section 1043(b) of the National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81;       125 Stat. 1576), as most recently amended by section 1643 of       the Carl Levin and Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon National Defense       Authorization Act  [[Page H5732]]       for Fiscal Year 2015 (Public Law 113-291; 128 Stat. 3650), is       further amended by striking ``10-year period'' and inserting       ``30-year period''.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Aguilar) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.    Mr. Chair, for decades, our Nation's nuclear weapons and  triad have provided us with strategic deterrence against nuclear war  and the existential threat it represents. And as is often said, it is  essential that these weapons and delivery systems be safe, secure, and  reliable.   However, the age of our forces is a major concern. Currently, our  nuclear-capable bomber fleet contains 76 B-52s with the first models  entering service over 50 years ago and continuing to fly only after  numerous modernization efforts.   Our Ohio class submarines' lifespan, which were originally 30 years,  have been extended to 42 years with the end of the 42-year lifespan  approaching in 2027. The first Minuteman III ICBMs were deployed 40  years ago.   With the provocative actions of North Korea and the increase in  nuclear weapon activities taking place around the world, a credible  nuclear deterrent is vital to national security of the United States.  But, over the past few years, there has been a good amount of debate as  to how much this modernization process will cost.   Over the next 30 years, not only will all three legs of our nuclear  triad, our bombers, ICBMs, and missile submarines have to be replaced,  a sustainment and modernization program for our nuclear bombs and  warheads will be taking place at the same time as well.   The Congressional Budget Office currently produces a projected cost  of nuclear weapons report annually. However, it only covers 10 fiscal  years into the future. My concern is that the CBO's current 10-year  timeframe does not encompass the later out-year costs, including the  late 2020s, and early 2030s, when costs are projected by many to  increase significantly.   My amendment would modify section 1643 of the fiscal year 2015 NDAA,  the CBO review of cost estimates of nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon  delivery systems, to make the timeframe 30 years instead of 10 years,  Mr. Chairman.   I brought this issue up last year when I served on the House Armed  Services Committee, and earlier this year Ranking Member Smith and  Ranking Member Visclosky wrote a letter to the CBO expressing their  interest in an assessment of the sustainment and modernization costs  associated with the triad for the next 30 years. The New York Times  reports that the CBO 30-year estimate, which is due to be released  later this year, will put costs at more than $1.2 trillion.   With a resurgent Russia, a rising China, and destabilized Middle  East, there is little evidence that the demands of our conventional  forces will decrease. That is why it is imperative that we have proper  accounting for our 30-year nuclear modernization process if we are to  adequately plan for future conventional and nuclear investments and  provide proper oversight.   Now, some of my colleagues will say that a 30-year cost estimate  isn't worth the paper that it is written on; that they would depict a  time period far too much into the future to obtain a realistic  estimate. But that isn't the case. Why do we have an FY17 Annual Long- range Plan for the Construction of Naval Vessels, which not only  contains an estimated 30-year funding requirement spanning the 30-year  timeframe, but also this was produced by DOD for a cost of $395,000 to  produce. We have a 30-year cost estimate for the Navy, but not for our  strategic deterrence.   I will close by mentioning, one of our nuclear gravity bombs is an  example of why we need a permanent 30-year estimate. According to GAO,  one cost estimate produced by NNSA's Office of Cost Estimating points  out that it could cost $2.6 billion more than previous estimates to  complete the B61-12 Life Extension Program. But the original baseline  was from NNSA's fiscal year 2017 Stockpile Stewardship and Management  Plan.   If Congress hopes to provide proper oversight of these modernization  efforts, we must have up-to-date estimates that accurately reflect any  updates and changes that impact our nuclear bombs, warheads, and  delivery systems. That is why I wish to make the time period for CBO's  estimate 30 years instead of 10 years.   These are important investments to make in our national security and  a responsible way to better understand the cost.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, if anything, my former chairman, when I  was on Armed Services, is consistent. He is right. He has continued to  oppose this amendment in the past.   But what I ask is: Why not have a 30-year estimate? We have one for  the Navy. We have one for other programs. If these reports truly aren't  worth the paper that they are written on, then why commission this  report? It is almost $400,000 in taxpayer costs.                                time  2200    The taxpayers deserve, and we deserve, to provide oversight over  these costs. If Congress hopes to provide the oversight for modernizing  these efforts, we need these up-to-date reports that accurately reflect  these updates and changes to bombs, warheads, and delivery systems. I  hope that the chairman would agree with me there.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on  the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be  postponed.   The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 printed in  part B of House Report 115-212.                  Amendment No. 12 Offered by Mr. Garamendi    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 printed in  part B of House Report 115-212.
