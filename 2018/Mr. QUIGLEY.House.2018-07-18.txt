 Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I do  not oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment.   I was disappointed that this bill originally cut CDFI by $59 million  and was very supportive of the full committee amendment that Mr.  Palazzo offered to add $25 million to the program, which passed with  bipartisan support. This amendment simply allocates that increase among  the various worthy programs in CDFI.   I am particularly pleased to note that the Bank Enterprise Award  Program and Healthy Food Financing Initiative received some of the  funding, although I would like to point out that this increase alone  does not bring any of the individual programs to their enacted levels  and still leaves CDFI $34 million, or 14 percent, below the current  level.   I urge support of the amendment and hope that we will be able to work  towards getting the CDFI the additional increases it needs in  conference.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    This amendment is another in a long line of attacks on  the Affordable Care Act. It is, unfortunately, an example of  Republicans turning to the appropriations process, instead of working  through the appropriate channels via the authorization committees.   Weighing down bills with partisan riders does nothing but make it  more difficult to enact these spending bills, especially in a timely  manner.   Turning to the substance of the amendment, our constituents would be  better served if we focused our efforts on extending quality,  affordable coverage to more individuals, not eliminating plans.   Healthcare is an essential right, and a healthy America is a more  productive, safer, and better place to call home. I suggest my  colleagues vote ``no'' on the Meadows amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
