 Madam Speaker, the measure before us is an  unconstitutional political stunt meant to undermine the President of  the United States. It will not become law, but it will embolden Iran.   The Speaker and my colleagues who support this resolution ought to  admit to the American people what they are doing, that is, undermining  United States defense policy towards Iran.   Qasem Soleimani, the lead architect and overseer of Iran's web of  terror is dead. This terrorist was responsible for the deaths of  hundreds of American servicemembers, the killing of an American citizen  in Iraq just 2 weeks ago, and the recent assaults against our Embassy  in Baghdad. He was engaged in planning for further deadly attacks.   But the Democrats in this body are so consumed by their hatred of  President Trump that they will not even stand with him in support of  the killing of the world's deadliest terrorist.                                time  1530    Instead, they have suggested a moral equivalence between the United  States and Iran. The Speaker of the House even blamed America,  describing the killing of Soleimani as ``an unnecessary provocation.''   Madam Speaker, what is a provocation is the introduction of this  resolution, which shows doubt about American resolve. It makes war  more, not less likely.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand united as Americans--to  put partisan stunts aside--and to oppose this dangerous resolution.
