 Mr. Speaker, a passionate educator, a change-maker, and a  powerhouse of a woman, that is how the community of Riverside would  describe my dear friend, Waudieur ``Woodie'' Rucker-Hughes.   As a history teacher at John W. North High School and an  administrator for the Riverside Unified School District, Woodie worked  to demolish educational barriers and address the needs of all students.   As an activist and leader for the Riverside branch of the NAACP,  Woodie challenged injustice and moved our communities forward every  single day. As a mother and a friend, she touched my life and the lives  of many others with her kindness and her steadfast support and  encouragement.   Today, we remember Woodie, her legacy, and everything she stood for.  I am going to leave you with Woodie's motto: Good, better, best. Never  let them rest until the good becomes better and the better becomes  best.   In honor of Woodie, let's keep working to make this country, and the  world, an even better place than she left it.                            ____________________
