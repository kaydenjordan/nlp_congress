 Madam Speaker, once again, the do-nothing Republican  Congress has outdone itself.   Here in America, we have a wage stagnation problem, an  underemployment problem, an infrastructure problem, a retirement  insecurity problem, and a corruption problem right here in Washington,  D.C.   What is the House Republicans' response to these challenges facing  the American people? They want to get out of town before sundown.   Why don't we remain here in Washington, doing the people's business  week after week, month after month until we get something done on these  issues, improve the lives of working families, middle-class folks,  senior citizens, the poor, the sick, and the afflicted?   They want to get out of town before sundown.   There are two very different visions for the American people.  Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the Presidency. What has  that brought to the American people? Chaos, crisis, confusion, the  culture of corruption.   Part two, the sequel, and the signature piece of legislation is the  Republican tax scam, where 83 percent of the benefits went to the  wealthiest 1 percent in this country simply to subsidize the lifestyles  of the rich and shameless. That is their signature accomplishment?   The Democratic vision is very different. Democrats here in the House  are fighting for the people. We are fighting to lower healthcare costs,  fighting to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, fighting to protect  people with preexisting conditions, fighting to dramatically lower the  high cost of prescription drugs, fighting to increase pay for everyday  Americans so that folks can provide a comfortable living for themselves  and for their families, fighting for a real infrastructure plan that  invests $1 trillion in fixing our Nation's crumbling bridges, roads,  and tunnels and will create 16 million good-paying jobs.   Democrats here in the House of Representatives are fighting to clean  up corruption in Washington to make government work for everyday  Americans. We are fighting to end, once and for all, the era of  Citizens United.   That is the House Democratic vision: lower healthcare costs,  increased pay,  [[Page H8177]]  and cleaning up corruption here in Washington. Democrats are fighting  for the people.                            ____________________
