 Mr. Speaker, as a co-sponsor of H. Res. 326 as  introduced on April 25, 2019, I support Representative Lowenthal's  determination to advance U.S. leadership in seeking a diplomatic  resolution to achieve a ``two-state solution'' to end the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. Unfortunately, amendments to the resolution mean  I can no longer vote in favor of H. Res. 326 and I will be voting  ``present.''   For years, I have heard colleagues say, ``It's only a resolution. It  really doesn't mean anything.'' At a time when the Trump administration  is actively taking policy actions to inflict pain on the Palestinian  people while giving a green light to Israel's annexation of Palestinian  lands, a statement by the House of Representatives to Israelis and  Palestinians does mean something.   Is there any doubt Israel and the security of the Israeli people have  the strong support of Congress? There is zero doubt. But millions of  Palestinians working to build a peaceful future feel that they have  been abandoned by Congress and attacked by the White House. The U.S. is  no longer an honest broker in any diplomatic peace initiative between  Israelis and Palestinians. The language added to H. Res. 326 stating an  ``ironclad commitment'' to $38 billion in foreign military aid only  highlights the contrast that there is no ironclad U.S. commitment to  human rights or even providing the most basic life-saving humanitarian  aid to the Palestinian people. This House vote today does not reflect  the reality on the ground.   This is the time to unequivocally support both the Palestinian  people's right to self-determination, justice, equality, and human  rights as well as Israel's right to live in peace and security. U.S.  aid must never be an ``ironclad'' blank check to any nation. I believe  if U.S. military aid to Israel is being used to enable or support the  military detention and torture of Palestinian children, the demolition  of Palestinian homes, or the annexation of Palestinian lands there  should be conditions on that aid--not cuts to aid, but conditions--as  has been done to aid to the Palestinians.   Striving for an Israeli state and a Palestinian state living side-by- side in peace and security is worth the effort of every Member of  Congress. But that means Congress will need to support the legitimate  rights, needs, and aspirations of both Palestinians and Israelis. In my  opinion, H. Res. 326 maintains the status quo and fails to move us  towards achieving peace. A peace that both Israelis and Palestinians  deserve and need.                  [From Noa Landau, Lisbon, Dec. 5, 2019]    Netanyahu Says `Our Full Right' to Annex Jordan Valley, Despite ICC                             Prosecutor Report         AFP Lisbon--Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Haaretz       Thursday that it's Israel's full right to annex the Jordan       Valley if it chooses to do so.        PM says political deadlock hinders controversial move,       adding: `Exactly because of that we should form a government       now and do it'        Earlier Thursday, International Criminal Court Prosecutor       Fatou Bensouda expressed concern over Israeli proposals to       annex this West Bank region.        Asked on the matter by reports in Lisbon, the premier said       ``It's our full right to do so if we decide,'' despite the       ICC prosecutor's report.        Asked about a timeline for the proposed annexation,       Netanyahu said ``there are some questions about what can be       done in a transition government. Exactly because of that we       should form a government now and do it.''        When asked whether he would agree to renounce serving first       as prime minister in a rotation agreement if Kahol Lavan       agrees to annex the Jordan Valley and to a defense treaty       with the United States, Netanyahu said ``those things will be       achieved when I'm prime minister. I have thousands of hours       on American prime-time TV and that has a certain influence on       the United States, especially now. I won't be able [to       influence] if I'm not prime minister.''        Netanyahu refused to tell the press whether he intends to       seek immunity from the Knesset in his three pending       corruption cases and cancel Likud's primary election, arguing       he wouldn't address personal matters in the briefing.        ``I intend to invest every effort, despite Kahol Lavan's       objection, to reach an agreement and prevent this truly       unnecessary election. Benny Gantz can [prevent it] if he       manages to overcome Yair Lapid and if [Avigdor] Lieberman       overcomes himself,'' Netanyahu said, referring to Kahal Lavan       co-leader and Yisrael Beiteinu chairman, who said he has no       intention to have his party join a narrow, right-wing       government headed by Netanyahu.        ``I hope that a minority government with the Joint List is       not an option,'' the premier said, reiterating a claim that       his political rivals are backed by Arab lawmakers.        When asked why he refuses to resign, the prime minister       said that ``the public has chosen me. Let the public       decide.''        Responding on the option of holding a direct election for       the prime minister between him and Gantz, Netanyahu said:       ``First, let's try to avoid another election, but this that's       an option that's becoming interesting.''        Earlier today, Netanyahu met with U.S. Secretary of State       Mike Pompeo after his phone call conversation with U.S.       President Donald Trump on Sunday, when they also discussed       the annexation of the Jordan Valley, which Netanyahu told       voters in September he would achieve.        Before taking off from Tel Aviv, Netanyahu told reporters       his meeting with Pompeo would be focused on ``Iran, first of       all,'' a mutual defense treaty and a ``future'' American       recognition of Israel's annexation of the Jordan Valley.    Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart today that I  rise to pay tribute to three brave soldiers from the Minnesota National  Guard who lost their lives yesterday in a helicopter accident.   To the families and friends who have lost loved ones, this is a  terrible, terrible tragedy.   Their loved ones answered the call to serve the Minnesota National  Guard. Those who answer that call do so because they are committed to  making our Nation safer and stronger. They defend our Nation abroad,  and they serve their friends and family at home by digging us out of  snowstorms and shielding us from rising floodwaters.   We recognize that their loved ones were not just citizen soldiers;  they were cherished members of their family.   To the Minnesota National Guard who have lost a fellow servicemember,  Governor Walz, the congressional delegation, the whole State of  Minnesota, and our Nation stand with them at this time of great  sadness.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to keep these citizen soldiers and  their families in our thoughts.
