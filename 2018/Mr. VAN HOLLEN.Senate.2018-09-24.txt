 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize  Stamatios ``Tom'' Krimigis on the occasion of his 80th birthday and  50th anniversary of service to the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics  Laboratory.   Dr. Krimigis is one of our Nation's brightest minds in the field of  space science, and I and countless others rely on his knowledge and  good counsel. He has had an amazing journey from humble beginnings on  the Greek island of Chios to become one of the world's most brilliant  and renowned space scientists.   The launch of Sputnik in 1957 drew his eye to the sky and inspired  him to study physics and space science, so he came to the United States  at the age of 18 to enroll at the University of Minnesota.   Upon finishing college, he went to the University of Iowa to work for  James Van Allen, who had been the principal investigator on Explorer 1,  which was the U.S. first satellite. In 1968, he joined Johns Hopkins  Applied Physics Laboratory. He was the head of the space department  from 1991 to 2004 and has been the emeritus head and principal staff  scientist since then.   Dr. Krimigis has led pioneering research into the Earth's  environment, its magnetosphere, the Sun, the interplanetary medium, and  the magnetospheres of the planets. He was critical in helping NASA  shape its approach to planetary exploration and has published more than  600 articles in scientific journals and books. He remains the only  scientist to lead investigations of every planet in our solar system.  In 1999, the International Astronomical Union named the asteroid 8323  Krimigis, previously 1979 UH, in his honor.   In addition to being a brilliant scientist in his own right, Dr.  Krimigis has mentored countless scientists, engineers, and staff at the  Applied Physics Lab, showing extraordinary generosity with his time to  develop new generations of leaders. He is always willing to share his  insights and provide thoughtful guidance. I am lucky to have Tom as a  friend and adviser who has provided insights and infectious enthusiasm  for the work being done by he and his colleagues at the Applied Physics  Lab. I was thrilled to join Tom to witness some of his major successes,  like the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous in 1998 and the Pluto fly-by in  2015.   Dr. Tom Krimigis has a special ability to help people understand the  value of investing in our ability to explore our planets and peer into  the depths of space, both to maintain America's technological edge and  to help answer basic universal questions about our place in the  universe. I am honored to recognize him today and to wish him a happy  80th birthday.                            ____________________
