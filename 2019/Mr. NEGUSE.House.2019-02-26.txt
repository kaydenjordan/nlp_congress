 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a Coloradoan, an  environmentalist, and a conservationist to support S. 47.   I want to thank my home-State colleagues in the Senate; of course, my  friends from the other side of the aisle; and, most importantly, our  chairman, Chairman Grijalva, for his leadership with respect to this  bill.   In the great State of Colorado, we understand the value of our public  lands. Our State's outdoor recreation economy brings in $28 billion and  $10 billion in workers' wages alone.    Investing in our public lands, conserving our wild places, is good  for our economy, and it is good for our future generations.   I am proud that this bill not only includes nine measures that would  impact my State, but two provisions, in particular, that I introduced  earlier this Congress that directly benefit Colorado's Second  Congressional District.   First, the Bolts Ditch Access and Use Act is an important provision  that allows the town of Minturn, in Eagle County in my district, water  access with use of the Bolts Ditch headgate.   Secondly, the WEDGE Act incorporates 124 acres of land adjacent to  Rocky Mountain National Park into Arapahoe National Forest.   I am excited to take up both of these provisions on the House floor  today, both of which will have a real local impact on the communities  that I am so honored to represent in Colorado's Second.   Not only this, but, of course, S. 47 provides permanent authorization  of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which is long overdue and a  milestone for future generations.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to support this bill and look  forward to continuing to work to conserve our public lands.    Madam Speaker, I rise today because, on February 24,  Colorado and our Nation lost a fierce and fearless advocate, Carrie Ann  Lucas of Windsor, Colorado.   A mother, an activist, and an attorney, Carrie practiced family law  to prevent discrimination against parents with disabilities. She  adopted four children, and her accomplishments centered on her  dedication to them. All her children have significant disabilities, and  Carrie always ensured that they were loved, respected, and supported in  their individual hopes and dreams.   Carrie devoted so much to ensuring her wisdom never stayed with just  her but was shared throughout the disability rights community, the  legal world, and our Nation. She spoke out strongly and protested each  day for the rights of people with disabilities to comprehensive  healthcare with dignity and respect.   It is a permanent scar on our Nation that Carrie was lost to the  refusal of an insurance company to cover one particular medication,  which led to escalating health issues and, eventually, her premature  death.   Carrie's activism knew only the bounds of freedom and of justice. She  was ceaselessly bold, brave, and selfless.   My thoughts are with her family, and I pray that this body will gain  some of the bravery that never faltered in her and use it as an  inspiration to ensure that no American goes without healthcare--ever.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the obituary of Carrie Ann  Lucas.                        Obituary for Carrie A. Lucas         The disability community lost one of its fiercest advocates       on 2/24/19. Carrie Ann Lucas, a disability rights attorney       who pioneered representation for parents with disabilities,       died after an arbitrary denial from an insurance company       caused a plethora of health problems, exacerbating her       disabilities and eventually leading to her premature death.       She was 47 years old.        Carrie Ann Lucas is known around the state and the country       for her strong advocacy.        Carrie Ann grew up in Windsor, Colorado, and had several       careers including being a teacher, ordained minister and       legal assistant before becoming an attorney. Carrie graduated       from Whitworth College in 1994, traveled and taught in       Saipan, and then returned to the states to attend the Iliff       School of Theology. She received a Master's of Divinity with       Justice and Peace Concentration from Iliff in 1999, but       during her time there, became increasingly involved in       disability advocacy. After she graduated, she started working       as an advocate and later legal assistant for the Colorado       Cross-Disability Coalition, investigating, preparing, and       monitoring disability rights cases and providing informal       advocacy on a wide range of topics. While there, she was       granted a full scholarship as a Chancellor's Scholar at the       University of Denver School of Law.        Following her graduation from law school in 2005, she was       awarded a prestigious Equal Justice Works fellowship to       create a program to combat discrimination that impacts       parenting for parents with disabilities. This program,       initially started within the Colorado Cross-Disability       Coalition, spun off to be Disabled Parents Rights, one of the       only organizations in the country devoted to this issue. She       also became a national expert and trainer on the rights of       parents with disabilities and, through her legal advocacy,       secured decisions upholding and promoting those rights here       in Colorado. Most recently she was recruited by the Colorado       Office of Respondent Parents Counsel to help set up a program       to train other lawyers around the state to replicate the sort       of impact she was making.        In addition to these professional activities, Ms. Lucas was       an advocate with the disability rights groups ADAPT and Not       Dead Yet, speaking, teaching, writing, testifying, and       protesting on disability justice and the rights of people       with disabilities to healthcare and respect. She was also a       talented photographer and cook. Carrie Ann was an activist at       heart. She graduated from EMERGE, ran for Windsor City       Council in 2017, and was planning on additional political       activity. She was chair of Colorado Democrats with       Disabilities for the past several years. She was a member of       the ADAPT group that protested in Cory Gardner's office and       got arrested to help save the Affordable Care Act in 2017,       particularly Medicaid. She served on the Board of Directors       of the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado. She was       active with Not Dead Yet and fought hard against physician       assisted suicide and the notion that life with a disability       is not worth living. She demonstrated every day how amazing       life with a disability can be. She was given the       Intersectionality Award from The Civil Rights Education and       Enforcement Center in 2016. She was a leader in passing HB       18-1104 which changed Colorado law to make sure that       disability was no longer a reason to remove a child from a       parental home. There is much, much more.        Carrie became a lawyer to practice family law after lived       experience of discrimination against parents with       disabilities firsthand. In 1998 fostered and later adopted       her oldest daughter, Heather Lucas. Heather has significant       developmental disabilities and was languishing in another       state. She fostered and was preparing to adopt a second       child, but that was disrupted due to prejudice against       parents with disabilities. Where most people might be upset       and feel helpless, Carrie Ann was furious and went to law       school to represent parents with disabilities.        Carrie adopted three more children over the years, Adrianne       Lucas, Azisa Lucas and Anthony Lucas. All of her       accomplishments centered on her dedication to her children       and her role as a mother. All of her children have       significant disabilities and Carrie Ann always made sure that       they were not only educated and included in their       communities, but that they were loved, respected, and       supported in their individual hopes and dreams.        Carrie had a severe neuromuscular disease, a rare form of       muscular dystrophy. She relied on a power wheelchair, and had       used a ventilator for years. However, her death was premature       and caused by inappropriate and brutal cost containment       procedures of an insurance company. Because Carrie Ann worked       for the state, she had use state insurance which was primary       ahead of her Medicare and Medicaid. In January of 2018 she       got a cold which turned into a trach and lung infection. Her       insurance company UnitedHealthcare, refused to pay for the       one specific inhaled antibiotic that she really needed. She       had to take a less effective drug and had a bad reaction to       that drug. This created a cascade of problems, loss of       function (including her speech). United Healthcare's attempt       to save $2,000 cost over $1 million in health care costs over       the past year. This includes numerous hospitalizations,       always involving the Intensive Care Unit which is par for the       course for ventilator users.        Carrie Ann had hoped to spend a lot of time in 2019 using       her tragedy to work to fix our broken health care system. Her       blog www.disabilitypride.com provides more details. For all       intents and purposes a shero of our community was murdered in       the name of cost containment. This is why we MUST fight these       measures with all we have. Insurance companies and government       programs must not be allowed to deny people what they need.       Just last month she was having to ration her insulin for her       type 1 diabetes because of the same insurance company and how       impossible it is to work between private insurance and       Medicare and Medicaid. This is a great example of why people       with disabilities should not be forced into insurance or       health plans and why we need Medicaid as the primary health       delivery system for this country.        In addition to her four children, Carrie Arm is survived by       her parents Phil and Lee Lucas, sister Courtney Lucas,       brother Eric Gover, her niece Danielle Mann, nephews Cody       Mann, Gavin and Colin Lucas, Danielle's partner Aaron Boone       and their sons Izaiah, Kyal and Eli, Gavin's wife Kathleen       and their daughter Emily and Colin's son Dakota. She is       predeceased by a sister, Kelli Mann and her grandparents. She       is also survived by her partner Dr. Kimberley Jackson, a CCDC       Board member and activist in the disability community. She       will be missed by a wide circle of friends and colleagues       throughout the country.                            ____________________
