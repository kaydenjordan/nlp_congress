 Mr. President, the Congressional Review Act, or CRA,  resolution we are debating today is the latest attack in the  unrelenting Republican crusade against funding--or defunding--Planned  Parenthood. They have tried everything: passing stand-alone bills,  attaching poison pills to must-pass bills, threatening a government  shutdown, struggling and failing to pass TrumpCare.   Today, we are debating whether to repeal an administrative action  that protects abortion providers, like Planned Parenthood, that receive  title X funding. Just a little while ago, Vice President Pence was here  to break a tie because Republicans in Congress couldn't get enough men  to tell women what to do with their bodies.   For nearly 50 years, title X funding has helped low-income Americans  access vital health services like birth control and cervical and breast  cancer screenings. Title X funding has been a healthcare lifeline for  millions of women in all parts of the country. But if this  Congressional Review Act resolution is passed, Planned Parenthood  clinics across our country can be prohibited from receiving title X  funding, even though it is currently illegal to use Federal dollars to  fund abortion services. Let me repeat: No Federal dollars can be used  to fund abortion services, period.   I understand the strong anti-abortion belief held by some of my  colleagues, but I don't understand why this translates into relentless  attacks on an organization that uses no Federal funds for abortion.  Planned Parenthood uses Federal funds to provide vital healthcare  services to millions of people, mainly women. Yes, I acknowledge there  are men who go to Planned Parenthood also.   In 2014, Planned Parenthood provided over 600,000 cancer screenings  and over 4 million tests and treatments for sexually transmitted  infections. But this is a factual argument, and we have learned over  the years that many of my Republican colleagues simply will not listen  to facts when it comes to Planned Parenthood.   Let me share a few stories from my constituents about the  transformational impact Planned Parenthood has had in their lives.  Perhaps after hearing these stories, we will think twice about  attacking the vital services Planned Parenthood provides all across our  country.   Hawaii is home to a large military community. Taylor from Honolulu is  a military spouse who wrote to me that she and other military  dependents turn to Planned Parenthood because of long wait times and  confidentiality concerns within the military healthcare system. Taylor  wrote:         My friend was experiencing severe cramping and pelvic pain       to the point where she had to utilize a sick day. When she       visited the medical services provider through the military,       they scheduled her for an appointment for four days out. She       was sent home with no pelvic exam or ultrasound. The pain was       so severe that she went to Planned Parenthood because she       could not wait to see her primary care physician. They       immediately performed a pelvic exam, an ultrasound, and an       STD screening. She was diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory       disease. Annually, 100,000 women become infertile as a result       of PID, so receiving quick treatment for this condition is       critical.    Taylor continued:         Defunding Planned Parenthood means that individuals who       experience common reproductive healthcare issues like this       would have lessened chances of receiving quick, necessary and       comprehensive medical care. Had it not been for Planned       Parenthood, she could have lost her ability to have children       in the future.    Do my Republican colleagues want to deprive military spouses of vital  healthcare services?   I also heard from Tiffany, a student at the University of Hawaii, who  went to a Planned Parenthood clinic after a pregnancy scare. She wrote:         I was afraid because I knew that having a child was beyond       my means. I was just starting out my university years at 21;       and I have extremely conservative parents who would have       surely not approved of my actions. I knew how difficult       having a child was for someone in my situation, especially       while going to school, and risking sacrificing my future, my       key to stepping out of poverty, was not an option. I was       unemployed and had Medicaid at the time as well, and Planned       Parenthood accommodated my financial situation.        Thankfully, I discovered I was not pregnant, and Planned       Parenthood took the extra time to sit me through my options       without any judgment whatsoever. I was also prescribed birth       control, offered an STD test, and was given Plan B in the       event I ever missed my birth control. The sense of relief,       reassurance, and care I felt walking out of the clinic left       me with a very strong impression, especially after so many       days of anxiety.    Do my Republican colleagues want to take away resources that help  thousands of young women like Tiffany fulfill their full potential?   These stories aren't rhetoric. They aren't hyperbole. They aren't  spin. They are powerful reminders that each day, women turn to Planned  Parenthood in a time of need.  [[Page S2125]]    Some of my colleagues have argued that all these thousands of women  who go to Planned Parenthood clinics can go to community health centers  if Planned Parenthood clinics have to close because of defunding.   This morning, I met with over a dozen leaders from Hawaii's community  health centers. So I asked them, could you take in all of Planned  Parenthood's patients? Their answer was an unequivocal no. Our  communities cannot afford to lose Planned Parenthood clinics.   A vote for this CRA is a vote to deprive women like Taylor and  Tiffany and millions more throughout our country of these important  healthcare services. Let's stop these attacks on women's healthcare. I  urge my colleagues to vote no.   I yield the floor.
