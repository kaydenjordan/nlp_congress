 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to address two issues today. One,  briefly, is the issue of guns about which many of our Democratic  colleagues have come down to speak. Then I want to speak about the  financial services regulatory reform bill we will be voting on later  today.  [[Page S1719]]                                    Gun Legislation    Mr. President, first, on the former topic, a number of our Democratic  colleagues have been down here, and we have heard a real passion and  concern about the victims of gun violence in our country. I certainly  understand and respect their passion. I have spent a lot of time  working to find sensible measures that will help address this in ways  that do not infringe on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding  citizens. It does feel like we are at a somewhat different moment here,  so I hope we can choose to get something done--something constructive-- and stop talking past each other and find where there is common ground.  I suggest four steps by which we ought to be able to find reasonable  consensus in the Senate, ought to be able to get to 60 votes, and be  able to at least modestly make some progress in this space.   One is a bill that has been introduced by Senators Cornyn and Murphy,  a bipartisan bill that is called Fix NICS. The fact is, our background  check system is only as good as the data that is in the system, and we  have an inconsistent quality of data. The data is provided, generally,  by the States. Some States provide excellent, comprehensive, up-to-date  data--other States, not so much. The Cornyn-Murphy bill would encourage  better compliance and better data from the States. Better data means we  would have a better NICS system.   A second piece of legislation is a bill I have introduced with  Senator Coons, and the sort of nickname for this legislation is ``Lie  and Try.'' Our legislation would make it possible for more States to  prosecute people who commit felonies when they attempt to purchase  firearms; that is to say, it is those people who knowingly lie about  their own criminal backgrounds--who deny their criminal histories--in  the hope that they will be able to somehow circumvent the NICS system  and buy firearms. It actually happens every day in America that  convicted felons, who obviously know they are convicted felons, deny  that and attempt to buy firearms they are not entitled to.   Our legislation would simply require the FBI, when it discovers that  someone has committed this sort of felony, to inform the law  enforcement in the State from which that person comes so the State  would be able to prosecute, if it would choose to. It is only about  enforcing the laws on the books. I often hear from my friends who are  Second Amendment supporters, as I am, that we ought to do a better job  of enforcing the laws on the books. This is an opportunity to do  exactly that.   A third opportunity for us is to recognize that the people whom we  deem to be so dangerous that we will not allow them to fly on planes-- the people on a terrorist watch list who could show up at airports with  valid IDs and boarding passes, and we will not let them get on a plane  as we think they are that dangerous--should also not be allowed to walk  into gun stores and buy firearms. Senator Collins and Senator Heitkamp  have introduced legislation. I am a cosponsor of it. It states that if  someone is so dangerous that we believe them to be a terrorist and we  won't let them fly, then we also will preclude them from legally buying  a firearm.    Lastly, Manchin-Toomey is legislation that Senator Manchin and I  introduced some years ago, and the idea behind this legislation is  simply to require a background check on commercial gun sales. Whether  they occur at a gun show or over the internet, these commercial-scale  transactions ought to be subject to a background check so that we can  determine whether the prospective buyer is somebody who we all agree  shouldn't have a firearm--a dangerously mentally ill person, someone  who has committed a violent criminal act, someone who is otherwise  simply disqualified from having a firearm. The only way we can actually  achieve that is if we have some mechanism to determine whether a person  is disqualified in this fashion. So Senator Manchin and I have  legislation that will do that without infringing on the absolutely  essential constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens.   These four items would be very constructive--fix NICS, ``Lie and  Try'' legislation, a ``No Fly, No Buy'' bill, and the Manchin-Toomey  legislation. I hope we are going to make some progress in this space,  and those would be candidates for doing so.   Mr. President, let me shift to S. 2155, the legislation we will be  voting on later today. This legislation is long overdue.   Let me be very clear about this. The financial crisis we experienced  is a decade behind us now. The Dodd-Frank financial services regulatory  bill--a massive construct that wildly overregulates financial  services--was signed into law 8 years ago, and we have done nothing  really meaningful to roll that back over these last 8 years.   This bill is the result of years of bipartisan work, an untold number  of hearings, and an extraordinary amount of testimony, and now we have  a product that we are going to, I hope, pass later today to begin to  roll back some of this excessive regulation.   I thank all the Democratic and Republican Members who worked to get  this product to where it is today. Senator Shelby, when he was chairman  of the Banking Committee, laid much of the groundwork for this.  Chairman Hensarling in the House, the chairman of the House Financial  Services Committee, has done great work in this space. Of course,  Chairman Crapo, as chairman, has done an outstanding job.   We are at a point where we are very close to finally making some  progress on this overregulation.   I will disclose up front that I have my own personal experience and  bias in this space, having worked with a great group of men and women  in eastern Pennsylvania and western New Jersey. We launched a community  bank back in 2005, and it was an amazing experience, a great  experience. It was a very successful bank.   Back in 2005 when we launched, I was shocked to learn how heavily  regulated a small, tiny, startup, brandnew community bank was. It  seemed to me that we needed permission from the regulators to change  the color of the drapes in the lobby of the bank, and this was all  before Dodd-Frank was passed. Dodd-Frank came along several years later  and made things much, much worse--way too prescriptive, way too much  discretion of power in the hands of regulators, a terrible trickle-down  effect whereby extensive regulations that were purportedly meant to  constrain large financial institutions also imposed huge costs on small  banks. We have gotten to the point where, arguably, small banks are now  too small to succeed.   Thirty years ago we had 14,000 banks in America, and today we have  fewer than 5,000. The trend toward consolidation in banking was  underway before Dodd-Frank, but Dodd-Frank dramatically worsened it.  One data point makes it very clear. Before the financial crisis, before  Dodd-Frank came along, we used to routinely launch, on average, over  100 banks per year across America. It was an ordinary thing for a group  of business folks to come together and decide they were going to launch  a bank to serve their community. It is a great thing when people do  that because it introduces new competition, new choices for consumers,  and new access to capital. There were over 100 per year routinely for  decades. From the time that Dodd-Frank was passed up through to this  year, we have had five new banks start up in America. We have  completely destroyed the entire de novo banking industry, and there is  a price for that. There is a price to communities, there is a higher  cost of credit, there is less available capital, and that doesn't serve  anyone well.   Our legislation, this bill we are going to vote on later today, is  going to improve the overall regulatory environment. At the same time,  it is going to make improvements for consumers. Let me touch on a few  of the features.   One is designed to improve access to mortgage credit. Section 101 of  the bill provides regulatory relief for financial institutions if they  originate a mortgage and keep that mortgage on their portfolio.   When a financial institution originates a mortgage and sells it,  which is a very common practice, there is this sense that the financial  institution doesn't care about the borrower's ability to repay. It  happens not to be true, but there are very, very extensive regulations  that are very onerous, and they make it more difficult for borrowers to  meet the criteria that are acceptable. Well, if the bank is keeping the  loan on  [[Page S1720]]  its own books, then it should be obvious to everyone that the bank has  every incentive to make sure the loan is made to someone who can repay  it. So this section provides some relief and some more flexibility so  that the bank can actually make a loan that works for that consumer  rather than one that works for whatever bureaucrats have decided.   Section 107 allows relief from some of the regulations in the  manufactured housing space. It is based on legislation that I  introduced with Senator Donnelly. This will help consumers who are  using manufactured housing, which is one of the most affordable ways of  having a home.   There are consumer protections like section 301, which protects  consumers' credit by giving consumers greater control over their credit  reports.   There is section 302, which protects veterans' credit by helping  prevent medical debt from improperly harming a veteran's credit report.   There is help for community banks--the very small banks that are not  systemically important to their neighborhood, much less the entire  economy. They are wildly overregulated. This diminishes that burden  modestly. It simplifies, for instance, their capital requirements.   Section 202 exempts very small community banks from the Volcker rule.  Why would we need to exempt them from it? Not so they can engage in the  proprietary trading or the kinds of investments that the Volcker rule  precludes, but it recognizes that community banks don't do that anyway.  They have never done that. They end up, instead, having to spend a  whole lot of money proving that they don't do that which they have  never done. It doesn't make any sense. This regulation relieves them of  some of that burden.   Section 210 will allow very small banks to have a little bit more  time between the onerous exams they are subject to periodically. It is  still very onerous, but at least there is some relief here.   There is a change in how we treat bank holding companies. We have,  unfortunately, as a result of Dodd-Frank, this concept of too big to  fail. We have enshrined it in law by creating what we call SIFIs, or  systemically important financial institutions. These are officially  designated ``too big to fail.''   Frankly, no institution should be too big to fail, but it happens  under Dodd-Frank automatically when a bank hits $50 billion. That is a  ridiculously low threshold, so this bill takes that automatic SIFI  designation up to $250 billion. Frankly, it shouldn't be automatically  based on the size of the institution; it should be driven by the  conduct of the institution, the kind of business they do. But at least  we are raising the threshold from $50 billion to $250 billion.   By the way, this is problematic, actually, for banks that are a  little larger than $250 billion. They still have this onerous, complex,  expensive regime that they have to comply with, while their  competitors, which might be just a few billion dollars smaller, are  relieved of this burden. So there is an unfairness in this. I intend to  work with regulators to basically have this SIFI designation reflect  the activity of the institution rather than just the size.   There is another provision, section 402, which deals with the  supplementary leverage ratio, which goes by the acronym SLR. The SLR is  basically a minimum capital ratio. It takes a look at the entire  balance sheet of a bank and says: Regardless of what those assets  consist of, we are going to have a minimum capital requirement. That,  of course, is in addition to all the specific capital requirements that  are associated with the various category of assets. That whole  regulatory regime remains in place, so we have both simultaneously.   This legislation has a very, very narrow exception for this secondary  SLR capital requirement. It simply holds that for those handful--there  are really only three custody banks, banks that have as their principal  activity the custody of securities for other financial institutions.  When they take custody-related cash and they put it on deposit with the  Fed or another central bank, that is a risk-free transaction. There is  no risk to an American bank having a dollar-denominated deposit with  the Fed; therefore, this legislation recognizes that you should not  have to be hit with an additional capital requirement for such a  transaction. That is a constructive feature.   Some have mischaracterized this and suggested that, oh my goodness,  we could have deposits with the Turkish central bank or the Greek  central bank. That is clearly factually wrong. The criteria for  eligibility is very, very narrow, and it is only at the most secure  central banks in the world, and by the way, mostly it is the Fed.   A quick additional word about this too-big-to-fail doctrine. I feel  very strongly that no institution should be too big to fail, and no  institution should get a taxpayer bailout. Some of my colleagues seem  to agree with that and have been very critical of a bailout that would  occur for a financial institution.   I would suggest that the best way to avoid taxpayers having to bail  out a financial institution is not to attempt to prescribe every  conceivable activity through massive regulation but, rather, have a  bankruptcy code that allows the failure to be resolved in bankruptcy.  The people who should be wiped out in the event of a failure of a  financial institution are the shareholders and unsecured creditors, not  taxpayers.   So for those of my colleagues who have come down here and expressed  great concern about potential bailouts, join me in my legislation,  which adds a chapter to the Bankruptcy Code so that we can successfully  resolve even a very large and complex financial institution where we  should, which is in bankruptcy, and not pose a risk to American  taxpayers. Senator Cornyn and I have legislation that would do that. It  really, over time, can completely end the debacle of too big to fail,  and that would be a very constructive development as well.   Let me conclude by saying that this bill, S. 2155, which is called  the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, is  very aptly named. The goals expressed in the title are actually  achieved in this legislation. I am confident we will make progress on  all of these fronts if and when--and I think we will--we pass this  legislation later today.   I certainly urge my colleagues to support this, but my last plea is  that this not be the last word on financial regulatory reform. This is  a constructive step in the right direction, but it is a modest step  forward. Much more needs to be done if we are going to have a safe but  robust competitive financial system that is capable of fueling the  economic growth that our economy is capable of.   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.
