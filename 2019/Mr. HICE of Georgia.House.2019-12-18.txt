 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   The majority has thrown almost every allegation imaginable against  this President, and yet these Articles of Impeachment that have been  submitted cannot name a single actual crime.   After all the drama, the majority has not found a single shred of  evidence, only second-, third-, fourth-hand information, but the facts  have remained the same. The transcript speaks for itself.   There was no quid pro quo. The Ukrainian Government said multiple  times they felt no pressure whatsoever. The aid ultimately came. And  even Speaker Pelosi said that this whole thing would have compelling,  overwhelming, bipartisan support.   None of those things exist.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand against the rule and the  forthcoming Articles of Impeachment. This is a disgrace and dangerous  to America, and I urge a ``no'' vote.    Madam Speaker, the Democrats' new definition for  evidence is allegations, allegations based on hearsay, I might add. So,  they hurl allegations against the President, and then they say to him  that it is not their responsibility to prove guilt but the President's  responsibility to prove his innocence.   This impeachment has been a sham and an act of injustice against the  President and against 63 million Americans who voted for him. Although  this process was rigged from the beginning, Democrats never produced a  single true piece of evidence.   It is time for us to stop this hoax and vote against these Articles  of Impeachment.
