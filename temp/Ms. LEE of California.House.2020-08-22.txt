 Mr. Speaker, we see across the country the  dismantling of the Postal Service, which has been a lifeline in  American life.   My constituents are terrified, and they are angry because they are  not receiving their medications on time; delays are hurting our small  businesses; and they are outraged that their constitutional right to  vote could be taken away.   This is not only an attack on our democracy but also on our workforce  heroes, who, in spite of the pandemic, deliver our mail. Forty percent  of these heroes are people of color. My grandfather retired as a letter  carrier after 35 years of service.  [[Page H4293]]    I urge an ``aye'' vote to support, rather than to destroy, our Postal  Service.
