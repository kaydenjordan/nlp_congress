 Mr. President, as we close out Black History Month this  week, I wanted to recognize a few people and initiatives that we are  really excited about.   Yesterday, I joined Congressman Mark Walker, Chairman of the  Republican Study Committee in the House, to host our Second Annual  Historically Black Colleges and Universities Fly In.   We hosted Presidents and Administrators from HBCUs throughout the  country, including four from my home State of South Carolina--South  Carolina State University, Claflin University, Allen University and  Benedict College.   We were able to host some great panels on ensuring curricula are  matched with the needs of the workforce, how to best encourage  entrepreneurship among students, and what steps we are taking at the  Federal level to help our HBCUs provide an invaluable education for  students for generations to come.   Representatives from the HBCUs heard from Google, McDonalds,  Starbucks, Bank of America the Morehouse College Entrepreneurship  Center, John Deere, Wal-Mart, the Center for Entrepreneurship &  Economic Development, and the Koch Foundation. I also want to thank my  friends Senator Lankford and Congresswoman Terri Sewell for joining us  on our member panel.   For decades, HBCUs provided Americans of color with educational  opportunities they would not have otherwise had. For generations, they  have given low-income students an education they could not otherwise  afford.   We have stood by them with the restoration of year-round Pell Grants,  a top legislative priority from last year's fly-in, which benefits more  than one million students.   I joined a bipartisan group of members of Congress, including  Representative Alma Adams, to ensure an increase in the Department of  Defense's HBCU and PMI grant program, boosting funding for this  important collaboration to $40M.   And earlier this month, we saw the Environmental Protection Agency  renew its partnership with Bowie State University to provide  professional experiences and advanced resources to Bowie State  students.   We will continue to stand with our HBCUs, and help ensure they are  providing the opportunities sought by so many people of color and low- income families from across the Nation.   I also want to talk about legislation my friend Senator Booker and I  introduced today to help combat Sickle Cell Disease.   Our Sickle Cell Disease Research, Surveillance, Prevention and  Treatment Act will do exactly what the title suggests . . . aid in  fighting sickle cell through research, surveillance, prevention and  treatment.   Currently, we don't really know exactly how many people have Sickle  Cell Disease. There's no real surveillance and reporting in place at  the Federal level, and only a handful of states have a reporting  process.   To best battle Sickle Cell, we have to know the universe of what  we're fighting against. So, our bill establishes the National Sickle  Cell Disease Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment program  to collect data on the demographics and prevalence of Sickle Cell as  well as identify and evaluate strategies for prevention and treatment.   We're also reauthorizing the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment  Demonstration Program (SDTDP) for four years, making some smart reforms  and expanding support services for kids and young adults making the  transition to adult care.   If you've ever met someone with Sickle Cell Disease, you know the  pain they go through. You see how hard it is on their families to watch  them suffer.   The Medical University of South Carolina has put so much effort into  finding a cure, and over the past few years I've gotten to know some of  the patients. Their perseverance is amazing.   We have taken some great steps forward, but we have to keep that  momentum going. I want to thank Senator Booker again for joining me in  this effort, and I look forward to our colleagues supporting the Sickle  Cell Disease Research, Surveillance, Prevention and Treatment Act.   Mr. President, Black History Month allows us to not only study and  learn from our past, but to see where we can go in the future. Our  Nation has made amazing progress in the past 50 years.   Without a doubt, there are still challenges ahead of us, and by  remembering the strength of folks like Dr. Martin Luther King, the  Friendship Nine, Cleveland Sellers, and so many other civil rights  heroes, I am heartened that despite those challenges, we will continue  to make progress.                                  ______                                         By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Leahy):  [[Page S1289]]    S. 2466. A bill to encourage and facilitate international  participation in the performing arts and for other purposes; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.
