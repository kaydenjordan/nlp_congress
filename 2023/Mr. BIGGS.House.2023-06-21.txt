 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for  holding this Special Order and talking about this very important  subject.   The reality is, as we are on that tank from ``Indiana Jones'' that is  going off the cliff, we are busy fighting on top of it, but the tank is  still going over the edge.   One of the problem areas that we have is this payment of a half a  trillion dollars a year--think about that--that we are giving to  unauthorized programs. You can go to the Congressional Research  Services and they will give you a full print out. You can get the full  display of all of them and when those programs expired.   One of the oldest ones--and I will just pull it up here. I have to  scroll through all of these programs, these hundreds and thousands of  programs. This is one where the Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction,  Mr. Buck, and I mention that because Representative Buck and I both sit  on judiciary.                                time  2110    It is the payment to the Legal Services Corporation. You know what  that is. That is the public defender's office. The expiration of their  authorization was in 1980, 42 years ago.   What is the amount of money that they were last authorized to spend?  Undefinite, an undefinite amount. There was no cap on it.   That is what we have. We have everything from EPA, State Department,  ATF. These are agencies and departments that haven't been authorized.  Then we have a whole list of additional programs that have not been  authorized, but we continue to fund them. Our own rule proscribes that.   The remedy for us immediately is, when those come up, at least under  previous terms of Congress, we have been able to actually raise a point  of order and get that pulled out, if we can.   Representative Buck, that gives you kind of a background and an idea  of what we are facing, which is part of our huge budgetary problem.    You would authorize a program--like the NDAA, the National  Defense Authorization Act. That is an authorizing program. It  authorizes us to spend money, and then we go ahead and appropriate to  that authorization.    Yes. I am not sure that I knew that detail because I don't  think I have seen that happen since I have been in Congress.    I am in my seventh year. That is the point. If you want to  authorize something, like the Judiciary Committee, they should be  holding these types of hearings because it is just what you say.   The year that I got elected from Arizona, a famous national journal  did a study and estimated that the Department of Defense was wasting  $125 billion annually. Well, that is one of those things where you  probably would want to bring it in. Actually, in this instance, the  NDAA, those hearings on authorization, you would be talking about if  there is really that much waste there and what we do to recover that  waste and prevent it.   We just don't do enough of that in Congress. We are just so busy,  again, like I said, trimming around the edges. We are not getting at  the core of the problem.    That is why I support what I call the Buck plan. The Buck  plan calls upon Congress, the majority in this case, in every committee  to have a subcommittee that is looking at the authorization  jurisdiction of that committee and then makes the recommendations, has  the hearings. Let's do this right.   Transparency is important, but beyond that, the process is broken. If  we are going to try to get a handle on our out-of-control spending, you  would think we would want to fix the process as much as anything.   I commend Representative Buck.   For those watching at home, both of you, Representative Buck has put  together this plan, has been championing this plan, and I am behind  that plan all the way. I think it is something we must do. It should be  part of any appropriations process going forward.    We are too fearful because every program that gets created  creates a constituency, and you have to look somebody in the eye and  say that program is no longer necessary.   The ESA is a perfect example of that. It has basically run amuck. It  is why California doesn't build storage facilities for water, which  impacts the entire western half of the United States. It is why we had  someone who wanted to stop any building in Arizona. They tried to get  the Sonoran Desert tortoise to be declared an endangered species, but  they had to stop counting when they got over 3 million of them. They  said, well, that is not really an endangered species. That would have  impacted the entire State because they are found everywhere in Arizona.  It is an example of one of those eternal programs that you and  President Reagan talked about.
