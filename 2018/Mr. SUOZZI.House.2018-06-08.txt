 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the illustrious  public service career of a former Member of this body, Congressman  Lester Wolff, who will soon be celebrating his 100th birthday.   In recognition of his monumental contributions to the preservation  and protection of our environment, especially on Long Island's  beautiful North Shore, I am proposing the renaming of the Oyster Bay  National Wildlife Refuge to the Congressman Lester Wolff National  Wildlife Refuge.   These precious wetlands, at Congressman Lester Wolff's urging, were  protected in 1968. In 1967, the New York state legislature had, at the  insistence of then-Governor Nelson Rockefeller and master planner  Robert Moses, authorized a bridge across the Long Island Sound.   Lester immediately saw this bridge would spoil the pristine and  precious resource of the Long Island Sound, and soon found himself at  the center of an enormous political fight. Lester won, and the Oyster  Bay Wildlife Refuge was born.   Lester's efforts in 1968 are an important part of our Nation's  environmental history. I urge my colleagues to support the renaming to  the Lester Wolff National Wildlife Refuge, and I wish Lester a happy  100th year and many more.                            ____________________
