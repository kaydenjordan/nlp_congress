 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express  my relief that Democrats and Republicans have come together to advance  a bipartisan spending measure to keep the government open and deliver  for the American people.   President Trump's recent irresponsible government shutdown over his  demand for an unnecessary, medieval wall was misguided and hurt our  dedicated Federal employees and their families and threatened our  economy.   I want to applaud my colleagues, the incredible Chairman Lowey,  Representative Pete Aguilar, Representative  [[Page H2026]]  Roybal-Allard, and all of our conferees for their diligent work to  reach the compromise bill that we are sending to the President's desk  tonight.   This legislation promotes 21st century border security and  humanitarian support for migrants in detention, alternatives to  detention, and family case management.   The American people sent a strong message when they elected a  Democratic majority in this House in November, and they want Congress  to focus on delivering real results that will benefit the lives of  hardworking, middle-class families.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do  now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 21 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Friday, February 15, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
