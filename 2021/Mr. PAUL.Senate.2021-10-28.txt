 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize a  family-owned small business and beloved eastern Kentucky staple, Hinton  Mills of Flemingsburg, KY, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   In 1918, Frank L. Hinton and his wife, Ellora, established Hinton  Mills in Goddard, KY. The general store, which provided supplies for  local farmers, moved down the road to Plummers Landing in 1923. After  serving in World War II, their son, Frank O. Hinton, returned to run  the family business together with his wife, Maxine. Frank O., who had a  passion for raising livestock, added a feed mill in 1956. By 1977,  Hinton Mills had added locations in Flemingsburg, Ewing, and May's  Lick, primarily serving local dairy operations and tobacco farmers. A  fifth location opened in Cynthiana in 2015, enabling Hinton Mills to  serve northern and eastern Kentucky.   Today, Hinton Mills continues to thrive as a farm supply store and  feed retailer. The family-owned business celebrated its 103rd  anniversary in 2021 and is led by the third and fourth generations of  Hintons. Family members serve in a number of roles, including Frank  O.'s son, Bud Hinton, as president, and Bud's son, Adam Hinton, as vice  president. Led by the ethos of ``Faith, Family, Friends, and Farming,''  Hinton Mills has grown along with the surrounding area. Their strong  sense of family has built a tight-knit, supportive team, with some  families employed there for generations. To celebrate its 100th  anniversary, Kentucky Gateway Museum Center hosted an exhibit in 2018  to recognize Hinton Mills and their impact on the agricultural  community of eastern Kentucky.   Over the past 100 years, the Hinton family has consistently invested  in and served their community. They regularly participate in local and  regional events, ranging from agricultural fairs and the annual Fleming  County FFA Tractor Parade, to hosting their annual weeklong Seed Day  customer appreciation event. Hinton Mills champions Kentucky's  agriculture industry, advocating for small agricultural businesses at  the local, State, and national level. They are a part of several local  business and industry groups, including the Fleming County Chamber of  Commerce and Kentucky Retail Federation. Notably, Adam has served on  the Kentucky Agricultural Development Board, the Kentucky Retail  Federation Board of Directors, and the Kentucky FFA Foundation's Board  of Trustees. Like many small businesses, Hinton Mills rallied to face  the challenges caused by the coronavirus pandemic and adapted to  continue supporting local farmers as they kept the country fed.   Hinton Mills is a remarkable example of the resilience and  adaptability of locally owned small businesses. Small businesses, like  Hinton Mills, form the heart of towns across Kentucky and play a  critical role in Kentucky's agricultural industry. Congratulations to  Bud, Adam, and the entire team at Hinton Mills. I wish them the best of  luck, and I look forward to watching their continued growth and success  in Kentucky.                            ____________________
