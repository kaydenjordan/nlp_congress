 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on  International Women's Day to honor a trailblazer.   Mr. Speaker, Bessie Coleman inspired women to reach for their dreams  just as she did soaring through the skies as the first African-American  and first Native-American woman pilot. She continued to follow her  dreams no matter how often those around her told her not to or to find  a different path.   She wanted to be a role model so that future generations of women are  inspired to accomplish whatever they set their minds to accomplish.   Because of Ms. Coleman, 21 women at Elizabeth City State University,  located in my district, now have hands-on flight simulation,  interactive panel  [[Page H1199]]  conversations, aviation program tours, and more as part of the Bessie  Coleman Aviator Academy for Women.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, was inspired by Bessie Coleman. We must continue  to celebrate and cherish Ms. Coleman for all she has done and for her  contributions to women's history and American history.                            ____________________
