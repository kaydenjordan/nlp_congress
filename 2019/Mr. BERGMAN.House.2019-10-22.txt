 Madam Speaker, since November 9, 2016, Democrats have  been calling for the removal of President Trump.   Even before he took office, they have been protesting the results of  the election and have sought to delegitimize his historic win in  battleground States like Michigan.   Breaking with historical precedent, House Democrat leadership will  not hold a vote on this extremely consequential matter. House Democrats  have created a toxic work environment, resulting in nothing getting  done, no good policy or law created, no regular order.   This is a politically motivated charade attempting to undermine and  diminish the effectiveness of a duly elected President and his  administration based on bias, prejudice, and disgraceful politics.   The people of the First District of Michigan sent me here to work  with others to get things done and represent the people with honor and  integrity. I am sure my 434 colleagues were sent here with the same  mission.   It is high time to get back to real work.                            ____________________
