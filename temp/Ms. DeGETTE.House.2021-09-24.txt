 Madam Speaker, what we are seeing in Texas, Mississippi,  and elsewhere is an unprecedented attack on Americans' right to  abortion care. It is a systemic effort by politicians who want to roll  back the clock on women's healthcare freedom in this country.   To those who continue to rehash the same outdated arguments that  would put their own personal beliefs on millions of women, and they say  it is somehow good for America, I say, save your breath. It is not.   And for these overheated claims that are being made today on this  floor and the rhetoric, I say that is simply not the case.   Madam Speaker, let me suggest a different paradigm that protects the  full range of women's healthcare freedom in this country. I will decide  what happens to my body, and you decide what happens to yours. I will  decide what is best for my health and my life, and you decide what is  best for yours.   What is at stake in this fight is not some frivolous benefit. It is  the fundamental right of women across the country to decide. Vote  ``yes'' on this important bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman  from North Carolina (Ms. Adams).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining on  both sides.    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Crist).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman  from Washington State (Ms. Jayapal).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman  from Georgia (Mrs. McBath).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  New Hampshire (Mr. Pappas).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley), an original cosponsor of this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman  from New Jersey (Ms. Sherrill).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Jones).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman  from New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman  from North Carolina (Ms. Manning).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman  from Georgia (Ms. Williams).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I am ready to close, whenever the  gentlewoman is ready. I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1045     Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    I continue to reserve the balance of my time, Madam  Speaker.    Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Judy Chu, the  author of this legislation who has been fighting tirelessly for years,  also Barbara Lee, my co-chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus, and to all of  our colleagues who value Americans' freedoms and the freedom of women  to have the full range of healthcare that they need.   This bill codifies the content of the law of the land, Roe v. Wade,  no more and no less.   The overheated and incorrect rhetoric on the other side of the aisle  is shameful. It is shameful because it denies the freedom of all  Americans to get the healthcare services that they need and to which  they are entitled.   Madam Speaker, we are a country of freedom, and we are a country of  freedom of religion. As a practicing Christian, I am offended by the  efforts on the other side of the aisle for people to impose their-- their personal--religious views on me as a Christian.   Every woman and every man in this country deserves the freedom to  exercise their religion and also to exercise their ability to get the  healthcare that they need.   For more than 50 years, as so many of my wonderful colleagues said,  women across this country have had the right to get the abortion care  they need because of a landmark decision made right across the street.  But that right is being severely undermined in States across the  country like Texas, Mississippi, and other States.   For people in Texas and these other States, 50 years of precedent and  healthcare access is being undermined as we speak. There are more than  500 laws that have been introduced in States across this country that  would restrict the ability of Americans to get the healthcare that they  need and deserve. As a result, more than 90 percent of American  counties no longer have abortion clinics. Some people might think that  is good, but the vast majority of Americans believe that it is the  choice of a woman and her healthcare provider about what healthcare she  should receive.   So today, if the Justices across the street won't act to protect this  freedom of healthcare, this House of Representatives will.   I will say it again: the decision of a woman to have an abortion  should be made between her and her doctor. The last thing the women in  this country want is a bunch of politicians in Washington, D.C., or in  Austin, Texas, or someone else telling them what their healthcare  should be.   So, therefore, let's codify Roe v. Wade. Let's codify these rights.  Let's stop the histrionics and inaccurate rhetoric. Let's oppose the  motion to recommit. Let's support this wonderful bill, the Women's  Health Protection Act.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'', and I  yield back the balance of my time.
