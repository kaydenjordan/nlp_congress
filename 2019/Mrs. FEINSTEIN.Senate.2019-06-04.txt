 I want to thank my distinguished colleague from the  great State of Maine. Thank you so much, Susan. Thank you for your work  here, for your care, for your concern, and for your vigilance on all  issues that affect women. Thank you so much.   Madam President, I am very proud to join Susan Collins and all of my  colleagues on the floor today to celebrate the 100th anniversary of  Congress's passing the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.   Before the 19th Amendment, women were actually denied the same basic  civil rights as men. We were not allowed to attend a college. We could  not become doctors, lawyers, or politicians. Married women had no right  to property, and even though women were required to follow the law,  they had no say in electing their lawmakers.   Simply put, women were second-class citizens. So it is against this  backdrop that the women's suffrage movement took shape decades ago to  fight to achieve equality for us, and the fight began at the polls.   In 1916 President Woodrow Wilson faced a tough reelection campaign.  At the time, 12 States allowed women to vote. The newly formed Women's  Party campaigned forcefully in most States against Wilson because of  his strong opposition to women's suffrage. As a result, women voted  against Wilson by notable margins, causing the first known gender gap  in a Presidential election.   Although Woodrow Wilson ultimately won a second term, the Women's  Party made clear that they were a force to be reckoned with. I could  not be more proud of the suffragists who fought for decades to secure  our right to vote and laid the groundwork for a woman's right to hold  office. It is because of fearless, hardworking women like Alice Paul,  Lucy Burns, and Dorothy Day that I stand here today on the floor of the  Senate representing the largest State in the Union, California.   In the first elections held after the 19th Amendment was ratified,  women won public office in 23 States. Today, women are represented in  all levels of government--Federal, State, and local.   In 1992, the first year I was elected to the Senate, a historic  number of women won elected office. Twenty-four new women were elected  to the U.S. House of Representatives that year, and four women-- Senators Murray, Boxer, Mosley-Braun, and I--were elected to the  Senate. Last year, nearly a century after Congress passed the 19th  Amendment, women set another record with 102 women serving in Congress  and 3 more holding seats on the U.S. Supreme Court. So women are still  shattering the glass ceilings.   In 2014, Janet Yellen became the first woman to lead the Federal  Reserve. In 2016, Hillary Clinton became the first woman to be  nominated by a major political party for President of the United  States. And just this year, after being elected the first female  Speaker of the House in 2007, Nancy Pelosi became the first woman to be  reelected Speaker of the House.   Last Congress, I became the first woman to serve as the ranking  member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. This is especially  significant for me because I was inspired by Anita Hill's testimony  before the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee to run for this office.   Even though there are more women in leadership positions across  industries, there is still work to be done. According to the American  Association of University Women, in 2017 women earned between 77 cents  and 53 cents for every dollar earned by men.   Susan Collins, we still have a long way to go, it seems to me.   In addition, women continue to face discrimination and harassment at  school and in the office, as well as high rates of sexual violence.   Before I close, I would like to address an issue that has  unfortunately been in the news quite a bit lately; that is, the latest  attacks on women's health and reproductive rights. We should not forget  what Justice Ginsburg told the Senate Judiciary Committee during her  confirmation hearings in 1992. I was there, and here is what she said:         The decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a       woman's life, to her well-being and dignity. It is a decision       she must make for herself. When Government controls that       decision for her, she is being treated as less than a fully       adult human responsible for her own choices.    In the past month, six States have passed blatantly unconstitutional  laws that effectively ban abortion, even in cases of rape and incest.  These new restrictions are especially concerning in light of the new  conservative majority on the Supreme Court, which has long signaled its  opposition to women's reproductive rights. Just last month, in a case  challenging abortion restrictions in Indiana, Justice Thomas authored  an opinion comparing contraceptives to eugenics and demonstrated a  clear hostility to Griswold and Roe. Between the Indiana case, the  various unconstitutional State laws, and other reproductive rights  cases on the Court's docket, many legal observers believe Roe today  remains in jeopardy.   As a U.S. Senator, I will continue fighting for equal rights for  women, and I will honor the legacy of women who blazed the trail. I am  honored to recognize those women and the progress we have made as we  commemorate the 100th anniversary of Congress passing the 19th  Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.   I yield the floor.
