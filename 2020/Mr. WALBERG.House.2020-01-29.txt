 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Walden, my friend, for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3201.   Opioids, heroin, fentanyl, and fentanyl-like substances have ravaged  the communities of all of us, like mine, across this Nation. Synthetic  opioids have claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Americans last  year, and I have heard firsthand some of those devastating stories from  friends, neighbors, and constituents in my district.   The DEA has been able to combat this part of the epidemic by changing  the scheduling so that the administration could combat all fentanyl- related substances.   Passing S. 3201 will allow law enforcement the leeway to properly  combat these fentanyl-like substances.   My support of this measure is strong, but I am admittedly frustrated.  We need to make this scheduling classification permanent. We cannot let  expiration dates approach while political games that we have seen for  months and months now take the spotlight and consume precious  legislative time that could have indeed helped to deal with some of the  concerns my friends on the other side of the aisle expressed about  minimum mandatories and criminal justice reform.   We have come dangerously close to the expiration of the temporary  order making fentanyl-related substances schedule I.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 3201, but I also  encourage immediate action to be taken to make these changes permanent  and to stop using political games to stand in the way of doing things  like this. Pass this legislation today.                                time  1300
