 Madam President, yesterday, the Senate overwhelmingly  voted to proceed to the National Defense Authorization Act by a vote of  86 to 6. That is about as overwhelming a bipartisan vote as we have had  lately, and it is for good reason. This bill represents one of our most  fundamental duties as the U.S. Congress, which is to authorize military  expenditures and to provide our men and women in uniform with the  resources they need in order to protect the American people.   The Defense authorization bill would authorize funding for the  Department of Defense to carry out its most vital missions, as well as  support our alliances around the world and improve the quality of life  for our servicemembers, including the largest pay raise in a decade.  All of us have long understood the importance of passing this  legislation each year, which is why for the past 58 years we have  passed the Defense authorization bill each of those years without  delay. The bill, of course, has gained broad bipartisan support in the  Armed Services Committee and in the first procedural vote yesterday  evening, but that doesn't mean that our colleagues across the aisle  aren't eyeing it as the latest target for their obstructionist tactics.   We are hearing that our Democratic friends are actually threatening  to filibuster this legislation in an attempt to force a vote on Iran,  but this is really just a subterfuge. I don't buy it. In reality, the  Democratic leader has urged the majority leader not to hold a vote on  the Defense authorization bill this week because so many of his Members  are running for President and need to be at the debate in Miami. He  said the Senate should wait to have the vote until the full body is  present. He said there is no rush to complete the National Defense  Authorization Act. Just to translate, the minority leader wants the  rest of us to stop working so that the Democrat Senators who are  running for President can prepare for the debate in Miami instead of  being here in Washington and doing their job. Instead of doing that,  they want to audition for their next job--or so they hope. Well, the  minority leader thinks we should delay giving our military families a  pay raise so his Members can campaign for President. That is one of the  more galling things I have ever heard proposed across the aisle.   The demand for a vote in relation to Iran is a smokescreen. It is a  tactic being used to cover up for their colleagues who don't want to  miss yet another vote. In the first 6 months of this year alone, Senate  Democrats have played politics with nominees for important positions  throughout the Federal Government and with border security funding in  the midst of a humanitarian and security crisis that is occurring at  the border. They dragged their feet on Middle East policy bills and  now, apparently, on the National Defense Authorization Act.   Our constituents sent us here to Washington to cast votes--yes or  no--on bills that shape our country and, in this case, strengthen our  Nation's military. We should not tolerate the political ambitions of  some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to take  precedence over the men and women who serve us in the military. Their  priorities may be elsewhere, but the rest of us are not buying it. It  is appalling, and we will not let it happen.                           Prescription Drug Costs    Madam President, on another matter, I recently heard from one of my  constituents in San Antonio about her growing concern with rising drug  prices. She wrote to me:         I personally haven't had to make the choice yet between       making my mortgage or getting a drug I need or my family       needs, but I know the day is coming. It's not a matter of if       it will happen, but when for all of us in America.    She is certainly not alone. Countless Texans have conveyed to me  their concerns about rising drug costs, and one man even told me that  he and his wife feel like their health is being held ransom. Across the  country more and more people are struggling to pay their out-of-pocket  costs for their prescription drugs and are weighing financial decisions  that no family should be forced to make.   Now, the good news is there is bipartisan agreement here in  Congress--somewhat of a rarity these days--that something must be done  to reel in these skyrocketing costs and to protect patients who are  being taken advantage of by some pharmaceutical companies. We have  spent a lot of time looking at this issue on both the Judiciary  Committee and the Finance Committee, on which I sit, as well as the  HELP Committee, which is also working on legislation to lower out-of- pocket healthcare costs.   When it comes to drug prices, we know that the high cost frequently  is not the result of the necessary sunk cost for research and  development of an innovative drug or a labor-intensive production  process or scarce supply. The high cost frequently is because major  players in the healthcare industry are driving up prices to increase  their bottom line.   Later this week, the Judiciary Committee will hold a markup to  consider some of the proposals by members of the committee to address  this kind of behavior. One of the bills we will consider was introduced  by Senators Grassley and Cantwell. It would require the Federal Trade  Commission to look at the role of pharmacy benefit managers, which play  an important--albeit an elusive part--in the pharmaceutical supply  chain.   Another bill we will be reviewing has been introduced by Senators  Klobuchar and Grassley and would combat branded pharmaceutical  companies' ability to interfere with the regulatory approval of generic  competitors.   I am glad we will also have a chance to consider a bill I introduced  with my colleague Senator Blumenthal from Connecticut called the  Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act. That bill takes aim at two  practices often deployed by pharmaceutical companies to crowd out  competition and protect their bottom line. Now, this bill, importantly,  will not stymie innovation, and it will not punish those who rightfully  gained exclusive production rights for a drug. That is what our patent  system is designed to do. Those are two false arguments being pushed by  opponents to my bill, though, and, believe me, there are many. The bill  is designed, rather, to stop the bad actors who abuse our laws and  effectively create a monopoly. Most drug companies don't fall into that  category, but some definitely do.   First, the bill targets a practice called product hopping. When a  company is about to lose exclusivity of a drug because their patent is  going to expire, they often develop some sort of minor reformulation  and then yank the original product off the market. That prevents  generic competitors from entering the market. One example was the drug  Namenda, which is used by patients with Alzheimer's. Near the end of  the exclusivity period, the manufacturer switched from a twice daily  drug to a once daily drug. That move prevented pharmacists from being  able to switch patients to a lower cost generic and gave the company an  unprecedented 14 additional years of exclusivity. Now, don't get me  wrong. There are often legitimate changes that warrant a new patent,  but too frequently we are seeing this deployed as a strategy to box out  generic competition.   By defining product hopping as anticompetitive behavior, the Federal  Trade Commission would be able to take action against those who engage  in this practice. It is an important way to prevent companies from  gaming the patent system and patients from carrying the cost of that  corporate greed.   Our country thankfully is the leader in pharmaceutical innovation.  None of us wants to change that, and that is partly because we offer  robust protections for intellectual property. Sadly, though, some  companies are taking advantage of those innovation protections in order  to maintain their monopoly as long as possible. Our bill would target  this practice, known as patent thicketing, by limiting patents  companies can use to keep their competitors away. One famous example is  the drug HUMIRA, which, as I understand, is the most commonly  prescribed drug in the world. It is used to treat arthritis and a  number of other conditions. AbbVie, the manufacturer of HUMIRA, has 136  patents on the  [[Page S4489]]  drug and 247 patent applications. This drug has been available now for  more than 15 years. This type of behavior makes it difficult for  biosimilar manufacturers to bring a new product to market to compete  with that drug and thus bring down the price for consumers.    In the case of HUMIRA, multiple biosimilars have been FDA-approved  and available since last year, but the vast array of patents obtained  by AbbVie prevent any competition from entering the market until 2023.  This artificial structuring delays market entry years past the  exclusivity period the law originally intended to grant. While the  patent on the actual drug formula may have expired, there are still, in  this case, hundreds of other patents that have to be sorted through.   Our legislation would seek to end patent gaming that leads to high  cost for consumers. Companies use these patents to extend litigation  against would-be competitors. That process is lengthy, complex, and  expensive. So by limiting the number of patents these companies can use  and preventing this sort of gamesmanship, our bill would simplify the  litigation process so companies are spending less time in the courtroom  and, hopefully, more time in the laboratories, innovating new disease- curing, life-extending drugs. Competitors would be able to resolve  patent issues faster and bring their drugs to market sooner. Better  competition, which is our goal, creates a better product at a lower  price for patients.   What my bill and those that we will be considering in the Judiciary  Committee this week have in common is that they seek to prevent bad  actors from gaming the system to exploit patients for profit. Since  Senator Blumenthal and I introduced this bill, we have received  valuable feedback from our colleagues in the Senate, as well as from  folks at the Federal Trade Commission, the Patent and Trademark Office,  the Food and Drug Administration, and many stakeholders. Their input  has helped us make adjustments to ensure our bill will effectively  carry out our goal, which is to reduce drug prices without hampering  innovation or creating overly burdensome regulations. We are finalizing  our revised bill, and we will introduce it soon.   The Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act will stop  pharmaceutical companies from deploying defensive strategies to  monopolize prescription drug patents and ensure that our healthcare  system works for, not against, the American people.   I appreciate our colleagues in the Senate, especially Chairman  Alexander of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee;  Chairman Grassley, who is chairman of the Finance Committee; and  Chairman Graham, who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who  continue to work with us to increase competition and bring down  healthcare costs for patients across the country. I look forward to our  markup on these bills later this week.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
