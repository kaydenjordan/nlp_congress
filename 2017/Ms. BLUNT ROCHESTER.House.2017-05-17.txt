 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter  from the Judicial Conference.                                          Judicial Conference of the                                                   United States,                                      Washington, DC, April 3, 2017.      Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker: On behalf of the Judicial Conference of       the United States, I write to transmit the Conference's       bankruptcy judgeship recommendations and corresponding draft       legislation for the 115th Congress. The Conference recommends       to Congress that it authorize four additional permanent       bankruptcy judgeships and convert 14 existing temporary       bankruptcy judgeships to permanent status, as set forth in       the enclosures.        The preservation of current on-board resources in these       courts is of great concern to the Conference. All 14       temporary bankruptcy judgeships included in the Conference's       recommendation have a lapse date of May 25, 2017. These       bankruptcy courts would face a serious and, in many cases,       debilitating workload crisis if these temporary judgeships       were to expire. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of       Delaware, for example, would be crippled as five of their six       authorized judgeships are temporary, all with the risk of       expiring in 2017.        Although bankruptcy filings nationwide have been declining       in recent years, the districts included in these       recommendations generally have experienced an increase in       filings resulting in stress on existing judicial resources.       Indeed, since the enactment of the Bankruptcy Abuse       Prevention and Consumer Protection Act in 2005, Pub. L. No.       109-8--the last time additional judgeship resources were       authorized for most of the courts included in the       Conference's recommendation--these districts have seen       weighted filings increase by more than 55 percent.        Section 152(b)(2) of title 28, United States Code, requires       the Judicial Conference to recommend to Congress the       authorization of additional bankruptcy judgeships. Following       a formal survey of all judicial circuits, the Conference       determines where additional resources are needed based upon       the circuit councils' requests and established criteria       including each court's workload and case filing statistics,       geographic needs, and pertinent additional factors. As part       of this survey, the Judicial Conference also considers       requests from the circuits to convert or extend existing       temporary bankruptcy judgeships based upon the district's       needs for stable judicial resources.        The Judicial Conference respectfully requests that you give       your full consideration to the Judiciary's resource needs as       identified in this proposed legislation. Additional caseload       information concerning these recommendations is available       upon request.        If we may be of further assistance to you in this or any       other matter, please do not hesitate to contact me or the       Office of Legislative Affairs, Administrative Office of the       U.S. Courts.            Sincerely,                                                     James C. Duff,                                                         Secretary.     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Conyers and my  colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee for their work on this  important legislation and for bringing this bill to the floor today.   An efficient bankruptcy system is important to the smooth functioning  of our economy. The preservation and addition of these positions will  add needed certainty to our legal system.   As the Judicial Conference of the United States highlighted in their  report to Congress, these resources will benefit individuals and  corporations, and are necessary to keep this system working. I am proud  of the work that the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware  does to protect jobs, creditors, and economic engines in our  communities across the country.   This legislation is a perfect example of Congress hearing the needs  of independent experts in the judiciary and acting in a bipartisan,  collaborative manner to address a looming problem.   I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on other  pressing problems for our constituents in such collaborative ways. I  urge all of my colleagues to support the Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of  2017.                                time  1415
