 Mr. Speaker, our country continues to fail Black people.   Seven-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones, in my district, would have  graduated from high school this year if she was not murdered by police  when they raided her home, the wrong home.   Yes, who killed George Floyd should be the focus, but also what  killed George Floyd. We are talking about centuries of dehumanizing  Black folks in our country, and it must end now.   We cannot stop here. We are, again, failing our neighbors when it  comes to public safety, education, poverty, structural racism, which is  deadly, and it is up to us to tear it down.   It is not enough for us to just say Black lives matter. We, in this  Chamber, have the power for real policy change and implementation that  truly frees our Black neighbors.   Aiyana, George, Breonna, Malice Green, we failed you, but your  murders may be the way not to continue the injustice that we see in our  country, and we have to stop it now.
