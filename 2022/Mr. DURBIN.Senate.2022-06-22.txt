 Mr. President, on June 12, a bipartisan group of 20  Senators announced an agreement on legislation to protect our children  and communities from the epidemic of gun violence. In the days since  then, this bipartisan group, led by Senators Murphy, Cornyn, Sinema,  Tillis, and others, have worked to move this agreement forward.   We took a test vote last night--our first Senate floor vote on the  package. It was a strong bipartisan rollcall. Let's be clear: This bill  is a compromise. In a 50/50 Senate, we expect nothing less.   It doesn't accomplish everything I want. It certainly doesn't  accomplish everything which the Republican colleagues who voted for it  want either, but the reforms and investments made in this bill  represent an important step toward making our Nation safer.   It won't end gun violence, but it will help to reduce the number of  shootings and killings which number 100 Americans each day, and it will  end, perhaps, guns as the leading cause of death among our children.   Let me highlight a few important provisions: $250 million in grants  for community violence intervention programs which have shown great  promise in communities in my State. This  [[Page S3056]]  would double the current annual Justice Department funding for these  programs. The bill makes dramatic investments in mental health  infrastructure, providing billions of dollars in school and community  mental health grants and behavioral health clinics. It gives an  additional $28 million to fund the trauma support in school program at  HHS. This is a program that Senator Capito--Republican of West  Virginia--and I created in 2018 to help break the cycle of trauma and  violence.    The bill also provides three-quarters of $1 billion in Byrne/JAG  grants to help States administer crisis intervention programs like the  extreme risk protection order laws in Illinois and 18 other States.   The bill takes significant steps toward closing the boyfriend  loophole: keeping guns out of the hands of dating partners who have  been convicted of domestic violence offenses.   It creates a new Federal offense for the crimes of straw purchasing  and gun trafficking. This will crack down on the illicit flow of guns  into cities like Chicago.   Again, this bill is a compromise. There are provisions I would rather  change and some I would rather do without; but, overall, it marks the  most significant gun violence reduction legislation in nearly three  decades. I commend the bipartisan effort that led us to this point, and  we should pass this bill without delay.   I want to call particular attention to two sections of this bill that  I mentioned.   One is to stop straw purchases. Straw purchases are when a person  with a clean criminal record or with no criminal record goes to buy a  gun for the sole purpose of giving it to another individual who has a  criminal record and couldn't legally purchase a gun himself. That  happens. It happened last year in Chicago. There was a straw purchase  of a gun, and the gun was handed to a felon who turned around and used  it to kill a Chicago policewoman named Ella French.   Ella French was 29 years old. She was a remarkable young woman. She  had a great future ahead of her. She was, unfortunately, shot--gunned  down--with a straw purchase gun. The same gun was used against her  partner in his police vehicle. He lost his sight in one eye. He  survived. But that just shows you that these straw purchase guns are  being used by people against police and innocent people on a regular  basis.   Straw purchasing--buying a gun with a clean record to hand over to  someone who has a felony conviction--should be treated as a serious  violent crime. This bill does that.   The second thing that we desperately need is to deal with counseling.  Now, I know there is a traditional political argument where Republicans  say: Guns are not the problem--it is mental health or other issues--and  Democrats say: It is guns, and if you don't include guns in the  package, you are not going to get the job done.   In my view, it includes both. You have to believe if half of the gun  deaths in America each day are suicides, that the people who are the  victims of those suicides needed, at least at some point in their  lives, mental counseling. This bill provides counseling, and I hope it  comes in the nick of time for people to turn their lives around and to  restore hope in their futures so that they don't resort to the  desperate decision toward suicide. Mental counseling, for them, is  important.   Secondly, of course, we read about the mass shooters in theaters and  in supermarkets and in schools, and we realize that they, too, should  have been counseled at some point in the hopes that you could try to  divert them from this vicious path that they are about to follow. That  is an important issue.   The third group is one that I am more familiar with. They are those  people who are involved in gun violence in our cities like Chicago and  St. Louis and in so many other cities. These are young people who have  diverted their lives away from what we consider to be normal because of  a traumatic experience.   Now, trauma is more than physical trauma. It can involve types of  posttraumatic stress that really lead to fight-or-flight syndromes and  an involvement in gangs and the use of guns without having the feeling  of guilt toward anyone you hurt.   These people need help. If we can reach them at an early age in  schools, we might be able to turn their lives around. If we don't try,  unfortunately, the violence will only continue on our streets. This  bill that we are considering--this community safety bill that we are  considering--provides resources to school districts to counsel young  people.   I think it is long overdue and is desperately needed, not just for  those who have been through serious trauma in their lives, but for  those facing other mental challenges. Our kids who have gone back to  school after COVID may need a helping hand and someone they can counsel  with. This bill starts providing those valuable resources. I believe it  will make an important difference in the future of our country.                                  Inflation    On another topic, Mr. President, ``inflation'' is the word on  everyone's mind. We see proof of it plastered on gas stations  throughout the country and in the aisles of our grocery stores. Too  many families are struggling to pay bills. Just last week, the Federal  Reserve launched its most forceful broadside against inflation, the  largest increase in interest rates in nearly 30 years.    As lawmakers, we owe the American people an honest, sober assessment  of how we can start to bring down prices and help alleviate stress at  the checkout lane; but, sadly, the inflation conversation has been  twisted with dishonesty and deflection by some political critics.   Instead of passing legislation to help reduce the cost of essential  goods and services like prescription drugs and childcare, many are  pointing the finger of blame at the Biden administration as if he  invented inflation or isn't doing his best to end it. Despite the fact  that it was former President Trump who urged the Federal Reserve to  keep the money printer running at the start of the pandemic and that  the Republicans oppose a bill that would prevent big oil companies from  price gouging, we see arguments that are made totally on a political  level.   The bad-faith arguments we have heard from across the aisle ignore  the essential truth: Inflation is not just an American problem; it is a  global problem. It is happening in advanced economies like in the UK  and France. That is largely due to disruptions in the supply chain.   The phrase ``supply chain'' didn't mean much to America a few months  ago, but now, we know it is an important part of our challenge. This  began 2 years ago with the pandemic, and it has been aggravated by  Vladimir Putin's barbaric invasion of Ukraine. It has caused the cost  of everything from food to energy to spike.   In the words of one conservative commentator at the Wall Street  Journal:         War in Ukraine Fans the Flames of Global Inflation.                                 Immigration    Mr. President, it is crucial to recognize the United States can't  solve these global drivers of inflation on our own, but there is one  driver of inflation that is within our control: labor shortages. We  have twice as many jobs that need to be filled in this country as  unemployed people to fill them.   What can we do?   The chart tells you part of the story. This chart indicates that,  under the policies of the previous administration and due to the COVID- 19 pandemic, as well as lengthy backlogs, America has experienced a  marked decline in immigration that has had a direct and detrimental  impact on working families.   According to EconoFact:         [N]et migration to the United States . . . has       significantly declined over the last five years due to       policies of the Trump administration, processing backlogs,       the pandemic, and other factors. This slowdown has       implications for the number of workers available and for       fiscal sustainability.    By the end of 2021, there were 2 million fewer working-age immigrants  in America than there would have been if the pre-2020 migration trends  had continued.   Now, perhaps your first instinct is, Well, that is a good thing; that  means more jobs for American workers.   But the reality is not that at all. This decline in immigration is  hurting working Americans and is contributing to inflation. There are a  number of industries in America that rely on foreign-born labor to  provide affordable goods and services to our country--industries like  construction, agriculture, transportation, to name just a few.  [[Page S3057]]    Consider the healthcare industry. Nursing homes depend on a reliable  supply of immigrant workers to provide care to the elderly and  disabled, but since 2019, nursing homes have lost more than 15 percent  of their workforce. Today, nearly every nursing home in the country--99  percent, according to the Wall Street Journal--is experiencing staffing  shortages. As a result, many of them have had to limit the number of  new clients they accept.   In the words of one leader in the industry:         We're just looking for people to fill the roles that we       need. And time and again, we find it is the immigrant       population that tends to respond to us.    So it is our grandparents who end up paying the price for the  shortage of working-age immigrants, and they are not alone.   If you are in the market for a new home, you may have noticed prices  are prohibitively high, and these skyrocketing costs aren't just  hurting potential home buyers; they are hurting renters as well. The  cost of rent is actually outpacing inflation in America.   One obvious way to bring housing costs back down to earth is by  expanding the supply of homes in America. There are plenty of  homebuilders who are willing to help fill the void, but they have got a  problem: not enough workers.   Down in Dallas, TX, one homebuilder named Joshua Correa has been  forced to delay home construction projects for months because he can't  hire field crews.   In his own words:         Immigration is very important for our workforce in the       United States . . . We're feeling [the shortage of workers] .       . . and if we're feeling it at the end of the day as builders       and developers, the consumer pays the price.    From building new homes to providing healthcare in our homes, we rely  on immigrants to fill critical roles; and in the absence of immigrant  workers, we as customers end up paying higher prices.   If we want to solve America's worker shortage, we need to drastically  increase the number of immigrants we welcome into this country. Don't  just take it from me. The CEO of the Chamber of Commerce of America has  called for doubling the number of legal immigrants into this country.   In her words:         If we can alleviate the worker shortage, it might be the       fastest thing [we can] do to impact inflation.    And that is just a short-term benefit for fixing America's broken  immigration system. In the long term, comprehensive immigration reform  would drive America's economic growth for years to come.   According to the Economic Policy Institute, undocumented immigrants  already pay nearly $12 billion in State and local taxes annually, but  many of them are not on the books. By providing them with a path to  legal status, we can double the amount of Federal tax revenue our  Nation collects from this group. That is money that will fund the  construction of roads and bridges and which will make Social Security,  Medicare, and Medicaid payments. That is especially important when you  consider the growing number of senior citizens in America who rely on  these programs. By the end of this decade, more than a fifth of our  population will be over the age of 65. These Americans need a reliable,  working-age tax base to support them.   A path to legal status for undocumented immigrants also would boost  our Nation's GDP by more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years and  create hundreds of thousands of jobs.   Passing immigration reform will also help keep America on the cutting  edge of innovation. Despite our former President's destructive  immigration policies, America is still one of the top destinations in  the world for innovators and entrepreneurs. In fact, more than half of  our Nation's billion-dollar startups were founded by an immigrant. Let  me repeat that. More than half of our Nation's billion-dollar startups  were founded by immigrants. Every day that we fail to enact immigration  reform, we are allowing a generation of potential innovators and  skilled workers to fall through the cracks.   I want to briefly share the story of one amazing person who almost  fell through the cracks. His name is Dr. Alfredo Quinones, but he is  more commonly known as Dr. Q. Today, Dr. Q--listen to this--is the  chair of neurologic surgery at the Mayo Clinic.   Decades ago, when he first arrived in the United States as a  teenager, he was an undocumented farmworker. He earned little more than  $3 an hour picking crops in the San Joaquin Valley in California.  Eventually, he began working as a welder for a railroad. One day, he  suffered a bad injury after falling into an empty petroleum tank. When  he woke up in the hospital, Dr. Q decided to pursue his passion.   He enrolled in the University of California at Berkeley and wrote his  honor's thesis on neuroscience. That caught the attention of admissions  officers at Harvard Medical School, where he was accepted as a student.  He studied hard and discovered his calling: neurosurgery. Today, he  removes about 250 brain tumors every year. Outside of the OR, Dr. Q  devotes countless hours to pioneering research. He has a very modest  goal--curing cancer--and is exploring novel methods, like using human  fat cells to fight brain cancer.   How many other Dr. Qs are out there, hiding in the shadows of our  immigration system? Isn't it time we found out?   In the meantime, I would like to pose a simpler question to my  Republican colleagues: If you are genuinely interested in addressing  inflation, will you help us move forward on this issue before the  election?   Your willingness to work on immigration reform will reveal the  answer. It is one of the most consequential steps we can take to combat  inflation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
