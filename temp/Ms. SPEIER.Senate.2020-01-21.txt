] I'd like to start with you, Mr. Kent. In your  testimony, you said that you had--``In mid-August, it became clear to  me that Giuliani's efforts to gin up politically motivated  investigations were now infecting U.S. engagement with Ukraine,  leveraging President Zelensky's desire for a White House meeting.'' Mr.  Kent, did you actually write a memo documenting your concerns that  there was an effort under way to pressure Ukraine to open an  investigation to benefit President Trump?          But we don't have access to that memo, do we?         And we have not received one piece of paper       from the State Department relative to this investigation.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent also  memorialized a September 15 conversation in which Ambassador Taylor  described a Ukrainian official accusing America of hypocrisy for  advising President Zelensky against investigating a prior Ukrainian  president. Mr. Kent described that conversation during his testimony.  He said:         But the more awkward part of the conversation came after       Special Representative Volker made the point that the       Ukrainians, who had opened their authorities under Zelensky,       had opened investigations of former President Poroshenko. He       didn't think that was appropriate.        And then Andriy Yermak said: What? You mean the type of       investigations you're pushing for us to do on Biden and       Clinton?    The conversation makes clear the Ukrainian officials understood the  corrupt nature of President Trump's request and therefore doubted  American credibility on anti-corruption measures.   Records of these conversations--and other notes and memorandum by  senior American officials in Ukraine--would flesh out and help complete  the record for the first Article of Impeachment. They would tell the  whole truth to the American people and to this body. You should require  the State Department to provide them.   To summarize, the Senate should issue the subpoena proposed and the  amendment requiring the State Department to turn over relevant text  messages and WhatsApp messages, emails, diplomatic cables, and notes.  These documents bear directly on the trial of this body--the trial that  this body is required by the Constitution to hold. They are immediately  relevant to the first Article of Impeachment. Their existence has been  attested to by credible witnesses in the House, and the only reason we  don't already have them is that the President has ordered his  administration, including Secretary Pompeo, to hide them.   The President's lawyers may suggest that the House should have sought  these materials in court or awaited further lawsuits under the Freedom  of Information Act, a.k.a. FOIA lawsuits. Any such suggestion is  meritless.   To start, the Constitution has never been understood to require such  lawsuits, which has never occurred--never occurred--in any previous  impeachment.   Moreover, the President has repeatedly and strenuously argued that  the House is not even allowed to file a suit to enforce its subpoenas.   In the Freedom of Information Act cases, the administration has only  grudgingly and slowly produced an extremely small set of materials but  has insisted on applying heavy and dubious redactions.   FOIA lawsuits filed by third parties cannot serve as a credible  alternative to congressional oversight. In fact, it is still alarming  that the administration has produced more documents pursuant to Freedom  of Information Act lawsuits by private citizens and entities than  congressional subpoenas.   Finally, as we all know, litigation would take an extremely long  time--likely years, not weeks or months--while the misconduct of this  President requires immediate attention. The misconduct of this  President requires immediate attention.   If this body is truly committed to a fair trial, it cannot let the  President play a game of ``keep away'' and dictate what evidence the  Senators can  [[Page S399]]  and cannot see bearing on his guilt or innocence. This body cannot  permit him to hide all the evidence while disingenuously insisting on  lawsuits that he doesn't actually think we can file--ones that he knows  will not be resolved until after the election he is trying to cheat to  win. Instead, to honor your oaths to do impartial justice, we urge each  Senator to support a subpoena to the State Department. And that  subpoena should be issued now, at the beginning of the trial, rather  than at the end so these documents can be reviewed and their importance  weighed by the parties, by the Senate, and by the American people. That  is how things work in every courtroom in the Nation, and it is how they  should work here, especially because the stakes, as you all know, are  so high.   The truth is there. Facts are stubborn things. The President is  trying to hide it. This body should not surrender to his obstruction by  refusing to demand a full record. That is why the House managers  support this amendment.   Mr. Chief Justice, the House managers reserve the balance of our  time.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   In the interest of time, I will not repeat all of the arguments we  have made already with respect to these motions. I would say one thing  before I turn it over to my cocounsel. Mr. Schiff came here and said he  is not asking you to do something he wouldn't do for himself, and the  House manager said: We were not asking you to do our jobs for us.   Mr. Schiff came up here and said: ``I call Ambassador Bolton.''  Remember Paul Harvey? It is time for the rest of the story. He didn't  call him in the House. He didn't subpoena Ambassador Bolton in the  House.   I have a letter here from Ambassador Bolton's lawyer. He is the same  lawyer that Charlie Kupperman hired. It is dated November 8. He said: I  write as counsel to Dr. Charles Kupperman and to Ambassador John Bolton  in response to, one, the letter of November 5 from Chairman Schiff,  Chairman Engel, and Acting Chair Maloney, the House chairs, withdrawing  the subpoena to Dr. Kupperman--I mentioned that earlier--and to recent  published reports announcing that the House chairs do not intend to  issue subpoenas to Ambassador Bolton.   He goes on to say: ``We are dismayed that committees have chosen not  to join in seeking resolution from the Judicial Branch of this  momentous Constitutional question.'' He ends the letter by saying: ``If  the House chooses not to pursue through subpoena the testimony of Dr.  Kupperman and Ambassador Bolton, let the record be clear: that is the  House's decision.''   They made that decision. They never subpoenaed Ambassador Bolton.  They didn't try to call him in the House. They withdrew the subpoena  for Charles Kupperman before the judge could rule, and they asked that  the case be mooted. Now they come here, and they ask you to issue a  subpoena for John Bolton. It is not right.   I yield the remainder of my time to Mr. Sekulow.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, the  managers said facts are a stubborn thing. Let me give you some facts.  It is from the transcripts.   Ambassador Sondland actually testified unequivocally that the  President did not tie aid to investigations. Instead, he acknowledged  that any leak he had suggested was based entirely on his own  speculation, unconnected to any conversation with the President.   Here is the question:         What about the aid? Ambassador Volker says that the aid was       not tied.        Answer. I didn't say that they were conclusively tied       either. I said I was presuming it.        Question. OK. And so the President never told you they were       tied?        Answer. That is correct.        Question. So your testimony and Ambassador Volker's       testimony is consistent, and the President did not tie       investigations, aid to investigations?        Answer. That is correct.    Ambassador Sondland also testified that he asked President Trump  directly about these issues, and the President explicitly told him that  he did not want anything from Ukraine. He said:         I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.       Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.    Similar comments were made to Senator Johnson.   Those are the facts--stubborn, but those are the facts.   No one is above the law. Here is the law. As every Member of Congress  knows and is undoubtedly aware, separate from even state sacred  privileges is the Presidential communication executive privilege to  communications in performance of a President's responsibilities. The  Presidential communication privilege has constitutional origins. Courts  have recognized a great public interest in preserving the  confidentiality of conversations that take place in the President's  performance of his official duties because such confidentiality is  needed to protect the effectiveness of the Executive decisionmaking  process. That is In re Sealed Case, which was decided in the District  of Columbia Court of Appeals.   The Supreme Court found such a privilege necessary to guarantee the  candor of Presidential advisers and to provide a President and those  who assist him with freedom to explore alternatives in the process of  ultimately shaping policies and making decisions and to do so in a way  many would be unwilling to express except in private. For these  reasons, Presidential conversations are presumptively privileged.   There is something else about this privilege. Communications made by  Presidential advisers--again quoting courts--and by the way, lawyer  lawsuits? Lawyer lawsuits? We are talking about the impeachment of a  President of the United States, duly elected, and the Members and the  managers are complaining about lawyer lawsuits? The Constitution allows  lawyer lawsuits. It is disrespecting the Constitution of the United  States to even say that in this Chamber, ``lawyer lawsuits.''   Here is the law. Communications made by Presidential advisers in the  course of preparing advice for the President come under the  Presidential communications privilege even when these communications  are not made directly to the President--even when they are not made  directly to the President--adviser to adviser. Given the need to  provide sufficient elbow room for advisers to obtain information from  all knowledgeable sources, the privilege must apply both to  communications which these advisers solicited and received from others,  as well as those they authorized themselves.   The privilege must also extend to communications authored or received  in response to solicitation by members of a Presidential adviser's  staff since in many instances advisers must rely on their staffs to  investigate an issue and formulate advice given to the President.   Lawsuits, the Constitution--it is a dangerous moment for America when  an impeachment of a President of the United States is being rushed  through because of lawyer lawsuits. The Constitution allows it, if  necessary. The Constitution demands it, if necessary.   Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mrs. Demings, you have 13 minutes for rebuttal, or  Mr. Schiff.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   Let me respond to some of my colleague's points, if I can.   First, counsel said: Well, the House would like to call John Bolton,  but the House did not seek his testimony during its investigation.   Well, first of all, we did. We invited John Bolton to testify. Do you  know what he told us? He said:         I am not coming. And if you subpoena me, I will sue you.    That was his answer: ``I will sue you.''   Mr. Bolton is represented by the same lawyer who represents Dr.  Kupperman, who actually did sue us when he was subpoenaed. So we knew  that John Bolton would make good on that threat.   Mr. Sekulow said something about lawyer lawsuits. I have to confess,  I wasn't completely following the argument, but he said something about  lawyer lawsuits and that we are against lawyer lawsuits. I don't know  what that means, but I can tell you this: The Trump Justice Department  is in court in that case and in other cases arguing that Congress  cannot go to court to enforce its subpoenas. So when they say  [[Page S400]]  something about lawyer lawsuits and they say there is nothing wrong  with the House suing to get these witnesses to show up and they should  have sued to get them to show up, their own lawyers are in court saying  that the House has no such right. They are in court saying that you  can't have lawyer lawsuits. That argument cannot be made in both  directions.   What is more, in the McGhan issue, which tested this same bogus  theory of absolute immunity--once again, that lawsuit involving the  President's lawyer, Don McGahn, the one who was told to fire the  special counsel and then to lie about it, that lawsuit to get his  testimony--Judge Jackson ruled on that very recently when they made the  same bogus claim, saying that he is absolutely immune from showing up.   The judge said:         That is nonsense. There is no support for that--not in the       Constitution, not in the case. That is made out of whole       cloth.    But the judge said something more that was very interesting. What we  urged John Bolton's lawyer was, you don't need to file a lawsuit. Dr.  Kupperman, you don't need to file a lawsuit. There is one already filed  involving Don McGahn that is about to be decided. So unless your real  purpose here is delay, unless your real purpose here is to avoid  testimony and you just wish to give the impression of a willingness to  come forward, you just want to have the court's blessing--if that is  really true, agree to be bound by the McGahn decision.   Well, of course, they were not willing because they didn't want to  testify. Now, for whatever reason, John Bolton is now willing to  testify. I don't know why that is. Maybe it is because he has a book  coming out. Maybe it is because it would be very hard to explain why he  was unwilling to share important information with the Senate; that he  couldn't show up for a House deposition or interview because he would  need court permission to do it, but he could put it in the book. I  don't know. I can't speak to his motivation. I can tell you he is  willing to come now, if you are willing to hear him.    Of course, they weren't willing to be bound by that court decision in  McGahn, but the court said something very interesting, because one of  the arguments they happened to make--one of the arguments that John  Bolton's lawyer had been making as to why they needed their own  separate litigation was, well, John Bolton and Dr. Kupperman, they are  national security people, and Don McGahn is just a White House Counsel.  No offense to the White House Counsel, but apparently it had nothing to  do with the national security so they couldn't be bound by what the  court in the McGahn case said. Well, the judge in the McGahn case said  this applies to national security stuff too.   So we do have the court decision. What is more, we have the court  decision in the Harriet Miers case, in the George W. Bush  administration, where, likewise, the court made short shrift of this  claim of absolute, complete, and total immunity.   Now, there were also comments made about Ambassador Volker's  testimony by Mr. Cipollone, and they were along these lines: Ambassador  Volker said the President never told him that the aid was being  conditioned or that the meeting was being conditioned on Ukraine doing  the sham investigation. So I guess that is case closed--unless the  President told everyone, called them into the office and said: Hey, I  am going to tell you now; and then: I am going to tell you now. If he  didn't tell everyone, I guess it is case closed.   Well, you know who the President did tell, among others? He told Mick  Mulvaney. Mick Mulvaney went out on national television and said, yes,  they discussed it, this investigation, this Russian narrative that it  wasn't Ukraine that intervened in 2016; it was Russia. I am sorry. It  wasn't Russia; it was Ukraine. Yes, that bogus 2016 theory; yes, they  discussed it; yes, it was part of the reason why they withheld the  money.   When a reporter said: Well, you are kind of describing a quid pro  quo, his answer was: Yes, get used to it--or get over it. We do it all  the time.   Now, they haven't said they want to hear from Mick Mulvaney. I wonder  why. The President did talk to Mick Mulvaney about it. Wouldn't you  like to hear what Mick Mulvaney has to say? If you really want to get  to the bottom of this, if they are really challenging the fact that the  President conditioned $400 million in military aid to an ally at war,  if Mick Mulvaney has already said publicly that he talked to the  President about it, and this is part of the reason why, don't you think  we should hear from him? Wouldn't you think impartial justice requires  you to hear from him?   Now, counsel also referred to Ambassador Sondland and Sondland  saying: Well, the President told me there was no quid pro quo. Now, of  course, at the time the President said to Sondland no quid pro quo, he  became aware of the whistleblower complaint, presumably by Mr.  Cipollone. So the President knew that this was going to come to light.  On the advice, apparently, of Mr. Cipollone, or maybe others, the  Director of National Intelligence, for the first time in history,  withheld a whistleblower complaint from Congress, its intended  recipient. Nonetheless, the White House was aware of that complaint. We  launched our own investigations.   Yes, they got caught. In the midst of being caught, what does he say?  It is called a false exculpatory. For those people at home, that is a  fancy word of saying it is a false, phony alibi. No quid pro quo. He  wasn't even asked the question was there a quid pro quo. He just  blurted it out. That is the defense? The President denies it? What is  more interesting, he didn't tell you about the other half of that  conversation where the President says no quid pro quo. He says: No quid  pro quo, but Zelensky needs to go to the mike, and he should want to do  it, which is the equivalent of saying no quid pro quo, except the quid  pro quo, and here is what it is. The quid pro quo is he needs to go to  the mike, and he should want to do it. That is their alibi?   They didn't also mention, of course--and you will hear about this  during the trial, if we have a real trial. Ambassador Sondland also  said: We are often asked was there a quid pro quo, and the answer is,  yes, there was a quid pro quo. There was an absolute quid pro quo.   What is more, when it came to the military aid, it was as simple as  two plus two. Well, I will tell you something. We are not the only  people who can add up two plus two. There are millions of people  watching this who can add up two plus two also. When the President  tells his Chief of Staff: We are holding up the aid because of this, as  the Chief of Staff admitted; when the President gives no plausible or  other explanation for holding up aid that you all and we all supported  and voted on in a very bipartisan way, has no explanation for it; when  in that call he never brings up corruption except the corruption he  wants to bring about, it doesn't take a genius, it doesn't take Albert  Einstein to add up two plus two. It equals four. In this case, it  equals guilt.   Now, you are going to have 16 hours to ask questions. You are going  to have 16 hours. That is a long time to ask questions. Wouldn't you  like to be able to ask about the documents in that 16 hours? Would you  like to be able to say: Counsel for the President, what did Mick  Mulvaney mean when he emailed so-and-so and said such and such? What is  your explanation for that because that seems to be pretty damning  evidence of exactly what the House is saying. What is your explanation  of that? Mr. Sekulow, what is your explanation?   Wouldn't you like to be able to ask about the documents or ask the  House: Mr. Schiff, what about this text message? Doesn't that suggest  such--what the President is arguing? Wouldn't you like to be able to  ask me that question, or one of my colleagues? I think you would. I  think you should.   But the backward way this resolution is drafted, you get 16 hours to  ask questions about documents you have never seen. You know what is  more? If you do decide at that point, after the trial is essentially  over, that you do want to see the documents after all and the documents  are produced, you don't get another 16 hours. You don't get 16 minutes.  You don't get 16 seconds to ask about those documents. Does that make  any sense to you? Does that make any sense at all?   I will tell you something I would like to know that may be in the  documents. You probably heard before about the  [[Page S401]]  three amigos. My colleague has mentioned two of the three amigos: Amigo  Volker and Amigo Sondland. These are two of the three people whom the  President put in charge of Ukraine policy. The third amigo is Secretary  Rick Perry, former Secretary of Energy. We know from Amigo Sondland's  testimony that he was certainly in the loop, knew exactly all about  this scheme, and we knew from Ambassador Volker's testimony and his  text messages and his WhatsApps that that amigo was in the loop.   What about the third amigo? Wouldn't you like to know if the third  amigo was in the loop? Now, as my colleagues will explain when we get  to the Department of Energy records, well, surprisingly, we didn't get  those either. Any communication between the Department of Energy and  the Department of State is covered by this amendment. Wouldn't you like  to know? Don't you think the American people have a right to know what  the third amigo knew about this scheme? I would like to know. I think  you should be able to ask questions about it in your 16 hours.   At the end of the day, I guess I will finish with something Mr.  Sekulow said. He said this was a dangerous moment because we are trying  to rush through this somehow. It is a dangerous moment, but we are not  trying to rush through this trial. We are actually trying to have a  real trial here. It is the President who is trying to rush through  this.   I have to tell you that whatever you decide here--maybe this is a  waste of breath and maybe it is already decided, but whatever you  decide here--I don't know who the next President is going to be; maybe  it will be someone in this Chamber, but I guarantee you this: Whoever  that next President is, whether they did something right or they did  something wrong, there is going to come a time where you, in this body,  are going to subpoena that President and that administration. You are  going to want to get to the bottom of serious allegations. Are you  prepared to say that that President can simply say: I am going to fight  all the subpoenas. Are you prepared to say and accept that President  saying: I have absolute immunity. You want me to come testify? Senator,  do you want me to come testify? No, no. I have absolute immunity. You  can subpoena me all you like. I will see you in court. And when you get  to court, I am going to tell you, you can't see me in court.   Are you prepared for that? That is what the future looks like. Don't  think this is the last President, if you allow this to happen, who is  going to allow this to take place.   Mr. Chief Justice, I yield back.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                               Motion to Table
