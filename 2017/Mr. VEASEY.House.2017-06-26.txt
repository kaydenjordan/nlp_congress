 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Plaskett for  yielding. I really do appreciate the gentlewoman heading up tonight and  coanchoring and talking about the contributions of Caribbean Americans,  and also talking about this health-scare bill that is going on right  now, because it seems to be what everybody is talking about.   Of course, the CBO score came out today: 22 million Americans will  lose their insurance, many of them that were able to get insurance for  the first time under the ACA. So that should be very frightening and  concerning to us.   The Senate is supposed to vote on this bill, Mr. Speaker, that will  have a health-scare effect on so many millions of Americans. It is  going to be much less affordable and it is going to be a lower-quality  healthcare. Unlike the Affordable Care Act, which boosted the African- American insured rate from 79 percent to 88 percent, the Senate  Republican's healthcare plan will decimate the progress that we have  made in the African-American community under the ACA.   Millions of Americans are at risks of losing their insurance, as the  gentlewoman pointed out earlier when she said that it is not just  people in the African-American community or the minority community that  are on Medicaid.   It is something that affects all Americans and something that should  be concerning to everyone, particularly when we talk about this opioid  addiction that I know many people in many of these Republican areas,  these conservative areas of the country, are hoping that they will be  able to use Medicaid to be able to deal with that particular issue  effectively. Because of this Senate Republican healthcare bill, they  are going to be locked out. They are going to be trying to figure out  how they are going to get themselves from under that addiction with  absolutely no help from Medicaid. It is going to be a very sad day for  them.   Many of these losses will come as States are forced to phase out  Medicaid over the coming years. That will hurt the African-American  population in particular.   Medicaid expansion under the ACA helped 15 million of the nearly 40  million African Americans in the U.S. gain healthcare insurance, and  many of those were for the first time--many of those were for the very  first time.   In addition to stripping our most vulnerable of healthcare, Senate  Republicans want to defund Planned Parenthood and block lifesaving  preventive care for hundreds of thousands of women in the district that  I represent and nationwide.   Let me tell you something about Planned Parenthood. Oftentimes, when  we start talking about Planned Parenthood, Representative Plaskett, the  issue revolves around abortion. But let me tell you something: you  cannot have a serious discussion in this country. You absolutely cannot  have a serious discussion about social service programs, about  Medicaid, and trying to reduce those programs unless you have a serious  discussion about family planning.                                time  1945    Family planning is something that people don't want to talk about.  Maybe in some circles, particularly Republican circles, it is a very  taboo subject, but it is something that needs to be discussed more  often and we don't talk about enough. We don't talk about it enough  with our kids, with our families.   When you do something like defund Planned Parenthood, it is going to  make that situation even worse. It is going to make people even more  needy and more in a situation to where they cannot be self-dependent.   Instead of supporting smart public health initiatives, Republicans in  the higher Chamber would rather repeal the ACA as another opportunity  to demonize one of the country's leading reproductive health  organizations, and that is Planned Parenthood that I talked about  earlier.   We need to be doing everything that we can to make sure that  Americans everywhere can lead a healthier life, but the Senate's cruel  and heartless bill will cause unnecessary suffering.   The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for many in the Black  community, and a full repeal will snatch that safety net out from under  our community. The Black community has a lot to lose under the  Republican healthcare plan, and we will not take an assault on  healthcare lying down.   We have got to fight this thing. We need to fight for every  grandmother out there. We need to fight for every aunt out there, every  mother out there, all of our loved ones out there who may be forced to  make the choice between whether or not they are going to have  healthcare or whether or not they are going to be able to pay for  groceries; and that is just not right.   We need to fight for all the single dads out there who are trying to  make ends meet, the single moms out there who are trying to make ends  meet, because we know that, if you take away Medicaid expansion, it is  going to force individuals like that to have to make some really tough  choices.   We need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to make sure  that we have access to quality healthcare, and that it is not reserved  for a few of the wealthy in our country. And when you look at the  Republican bill, Representative Plaskett, that is exactly what it does.   This is a vehicle that will deliver tax breaks to the very rich and  will leave individuals like we have been talking about in the Black  community, and not just in the African-American communities, but in all  communities out there that are out there working hard, suffering, in a  situation where they need Medicaid and they need insurance, it is going  to leave them locked out.   It is going to be a sad day in America when people who thought that  they were going to get insurance for the first time, or people who had  insurance for the first time, they were going to get those wellness  checkups, they were meeting with their family care physician on a  regular basis, and they have that stolen from them because of this  monstrous plan.
