 Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues and with  our country my enthusiastic support for Julie Su, my gratitude for her  ongoing work as Acting Secretary of Labor, and my support for President  Biden's nomination of Julie Su to lead the Department of Labor.   Throughout her career, Julie has worked tirelessly to level the  playing field for American workers as an advocate for trafficked  garment workers, running our Nation's largest State-level labor  department.   Two years ago, this Senate confirmed her to serve as Deputy Secretary  of Labor. And as Deputy to Secretary Marty Walsh, Julie helped lead a  resurgence in workforce training: expanding apprenticeships in in- demand industries like trucking, teaching, and cyber security; building  pathways to jobs and advanced manufacturing and clean energy technology  and semiconductors; ensuring that our country has the workforce we need  to meet the needs of our economy and ensuring that those jobs are good  jobs.   Julie has now led the Department for 5 months and has continued her  focus on creating good jobs, empowering workers, and enforcing our  labor laws.   Last month, she worked tirelessly to help avert a strike at our west  coast ports, bringing labor and management together to reach an  agreement that kept our ports up and running and our economy moving  forward.   This is the kind of leadership that we need on labor issues, in the  Department of Labor and across our country. Someone who will persevere  through difficult, tense negotiations. Someone who will work through  challenging issues and drive outcomes that are good for workers,  businesses, and our country.   Julie has done this hard work even while facing unwarranted attacks  on her record--a coordinated campaign of misrepresentation about a  dedicated public servant. I am confident that her toughness and drive  to serve will allow her to endure this opposition and continue to do  right by the American people and American workers.   In her time as Deputy Secretary, and now as Acting Secretary, Julie  Su has proven to this Senator and to the Senate as a whole that it was  wise for President Biden to nominate her and for the Senate to confirm  her 2 years ago.   I urge my Senate colleagues to once again support Julie Su and  empower her to lead the Department with the experience, expertise, and  deeply held values she brings to the job.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak about 17  nominees who will be confirmed in the wrap-up of this evening's  session--17 nominees to serve as Ambassadors for the United States  around the world or to represent us in international organizations.   I am grateful that we have been able to reach an agreement with those  Senators who have been blocking their confirmation. I, frankly, wish we  had been able to clear even further. There are 38 ambassadorial or  senior position nominees waiting for action on this floor, and it is my  hope that when we return in September, we will clear the remaining  ones.   But this evening, I wanted to speak about one nominee in particular,  the Honorable Jack Markell, who has been nominated and will this  evening be confirmed to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Italy and San  Marino.   I have known Jack and his wife Carla for more than three decades. As  Jack liked to say when he was Governor, Delaware is a ``State of  neighbors,'' and no one better epitomizes that friendly attitude, that  commitment to one another's well-being more than our former Governor  Jack Markell.   As treasurer, as Governor, as a businessman, now as Ambassador to the  OECD--the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development--Jack  is used to working cooperatively with others to get things done and to  do things the right way.   As Governor, he steered our State through an incredibly difficult and  demanding fiscal crisis, getting us back on track. Along the way, he  expanded opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities. He  created a national model for workplace experience and college credit  opportunities, and he launched a much lauded kindergarten language  immersion program.   As the White House Coordinator for Operation Allies worldwide, he  facilitated the vetting and resettlement of Afghans who served  alongside us during 20 years of conflict; and now as ambassador to the  OECD, he has worked with our partner nations to emphasize energy  security, sustainable development goals, and to support Ukraine against  a brutal Russian invasion.   Italy is, obviously, a key NATO ally. And Italy is facing some of its  biggest challenges in decades and has come out the stronger for it.  Italy is a committed partner in NATO to the United States and to  Ukraine as a nation fighting on the front lines of freedom.   Earlier today, I had the honor of joining our leader Senator Schumer  and the Republican Leader Senator McConnell in a meeting with Prime  Minister Meloni of Italy during her visit to the United States, on a  day when she met with our President, Joe Biden, to talk about how we  can further deepen and strengthen the transatlantic alliance.   And I was grateful to hear the strong bipartisan support of this  Chamber's two leaders for the continued effort to arm, to equip, to  support Ukraine in its important fight against Russian aggression.   I am also thrilled that in just a few moments, this Chamber will  confirm the nomination of Jack Markell to serve as our ambassador to  Italy and San Marino. This position has been vacant for more than 2  years, and we cannot ignore such a vital post any longer. In these  uncertain times, the United States has found greater strength in allies  and partner nations, and Jack is the consummate bridge-builder who  understands how important alliances are.   He will bring a little bit of the ``Delaware Way'' of working across  the aisle, of finding commonsense solutions, and of solving real  problems to his new post in Rome. So to a dedicated and capable public  servant with experience to match, to a friend of decades,  congratulations to Governor Markell, Ambassador Markell, as you embark  on this next chapter in service to our Nation.   I yield the floor.
