 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3469) to direct the Transportation Security  Administration to carry out covert testing and risk mitigation  improvement of aviation security operations, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3469         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Covert Testing and Risk       Mitigation Improvement Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. TSA COVERT TESTING AND RISK MITIGATION IMPROVEMENT.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the       Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration       shall implement the following:        (1) A system for conducting risk-informed headquarters-      based covert tests of aviation security operations, including       relating to airport passenger and baggage security screening       operations, that can yield statistically valid data that can       be used to identify and assess the nature and extent of       vulnerabilities to such operations that are not mitigated by       current security practices. The Administrator shall execute       annually not fewer than three risk-informed covert testing       projects designed to identify systemic vulnerabilities in the       transportation security system, and shall document the       assumptions and rationale guiding the selection of such       projects.        (2) A long-term headquarters-based covert testing program,       employing static but risk-informed threat vectors, designed       to assess changes in overall screening effectiveness.        (b) Mitigation.--        (1) In general.--The Administrator of the Transportation       Security Administration shall establish a system to address       and mitigate the vulnerabilities identified and assessed       pursuant to the testing conducted under subsection (a).        (2) Analysis.--Not later than 60 days after the       identification of any such vulnerability, the Administrator       shall ensure a vulnerability described in paragraph (1) is       analyzed to determine root causes.        (3) Determination.--Not later than 120 days after the       identification of any such vulnerability, the Administrator       shall make a determination regarding whether or not to       mitigate such vulnerability. The Administrator shall       prioritize mitigating vulnerabilities based on their ability       to reduce risk. If the Administrator determines--        (A) to not mitigate such vulnerability, the Administrator       shall document the reasons for the decision; or        (B) to mitigate such vulnerability, the Administrator shall       establish and document--        (i) key milestones appropriate for the level of effort       required to so mitigate such vulnerability; and        (ii) a date by which measures to so mitigate such       vulnerability shall be implemented by the Transportation       Security Administration.        (4) Retesting.--Not later than 180 days after the date on       which measures to mitigate a vulnerability are completed by       the Transportation Security Administration pursuant to       paragraph (3)(B)(ii), the Administrator shall conduct a       covert test in accordance with subsection (a) of the aviation       security operation with respect to which such vulnerability       was identified to assess the effectiveness of such measures       to mitigate such vulnerability.        (c) Compilation of Lists.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after completing a       covert testing protocol under subsection (a), the       Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration       shall compile a list (including a classified annex if       necessary) of the vulnerabilities identified and assessed       pursuant to such testing. Each such list shall contain, at a       minimum, the following:        (A) A brief description of the nature of each vulnerability       so identified and assessed.        (B) The date on which each vulnerability was so identified       and assessed.        (C) Key milestones appropriate for the level of effort       required to mitigate each vulnerability, as well as an       indication of whether each such milestone has been met.        (D) An indication of whether each vulnerability has been       mitigated or reduced and, if so, the date on which each such       vulnerability was so mitigated or reduced.        (E) If a vulnerability has not been fully mitigated, the       date by which the Administrator shall so mitigate such       vulnerability or a determination that it is not possible to       fully mitigate such vulnerability.        (F) The results of any subsequent covert testing undertaken       to assess whether mitigation efforts have eliminated or       reduced each vulnerability.        (2) Submission to congress.--The Administrator shall submit       to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and       Transportation of the Senate a comprehensive document       tracking the status of the information required under       paragraph (1) together with the Transportation Security       Administration's annual budget request.        (d) GAO Review.--Not later than three years after the date       of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the       United States shall review and submit to the Administrator of       the Transportation Security Administration and the Committee       on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the       Senate a report on the effectiveness of the Transportation       Security Administration's processes for conducting covert       testing projects that yield statistically valid data that can       be used to assess the nature and extent of vulnerabilities to       aviation security operations that are not effectively       mitigated by current security operations.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3469, the Covert  Testing and Risk Mitigation Improvement Act of 2019.   Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to recognize my dear  friend and colleague, Chairman Elijah Cummings, who sponsored this  legislation. Less than 2 months ago, the House lost a great leader.  Chairman Cummings dedicated his life to fighting for justice and  democracy for his constituents in his native city of Baltimore and for  the American people.   Today, the House will honor his legacy in the best way we can: by  passing a bill he wrote to ensure that TSA does effective oversight of  its airport screening operations that are essential to protecting  American lives.   Mr. Speaker, the Transportation Security Administration faces serious  challenges in identifying and resolving security vulnerabilities in its  airport security operations. Specifically, in April 2019, the  Government Accountability Office found that TSA was not conducting its  covert testing of screening operations in a risk-informed way and that  TSA has limited assurance that its tests were targeted at the most  likely threats.   H.R. 3469 seeks to make major improvements to TSA's covert testing  processes by requiring TSA to identify, document, and mitigate security  vulnerabilities found through these tests.   It requires TSA to develop a risk-informed process for its covert  testing program and conduct at least three tests a year to identify  vulnerabilities in the transportation security system.   Importantly, H.R. 3469 requires TSA to document all vulnerabilities  it identifies and how it plans to mitigate them.   Finally, it requires GAO to submit a report on the effectiveness of  TSA's covert testing program within 3 years of enactment.   Simply put, H.R. 3469 seeks to enhance TSA's capacity to identify and  mitigate vulnerabilities to the security of our transportation systems.   I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation, sponsored by  our beloved, departed colleague, to help ensure our transportation  security systems are as effective as they can be.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I  am prepared to close after the gentleman from Louisiana closes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we all know that the threats to our Nation's  transportation security are real. We also know that, as the main  Federal agency responsible for the security of our transportation  system, TSA has a critical mission for identifying and mitigating such  threats. To be effective, TSA must have a risk-informed covert testing  regime that allows it to do effective oversight of its security  operations.   H.R. 3469 would improve TSA's testing programs to ensure they can  identify vulnerabilities to the transportation system and properly  address them to keep our Nation safe.   Mr. Speaker, as such, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, H.R. 3469, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4761) to ensure U.S. Customs and Border Protection  officers, agents, and other personnel have adequate synthetic opioid  detection equipment, that the Department of Homeland Security has a  process to update synthetic opioid detection capability, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4761         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Opioid Detection       Resilience Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. STRATEGY TO ENSURE DETECTION OF ALL OPIOID PURITY                     LEVELS AT PORTS OF ENTRY.         Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of       this section, the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border       Protection (CBP) shall--        (1) implement a strategy to ensure deployed chemical       screening devices are able to identify in an operational       environment narcotics at purity levels less than or equal to       10 percent, or provide ports of entry with an alternate       method for identifying narcotics at lower purity levels; and        (2) require testing of any new chemical screening devices       to understand the abilities and limitations of such devices       relating to identifying narcotics at various purity levels       before CBP commits to the acquisition of such devices.       SEC. 3. PLAN TO ENSURE OPIOID DETECTION EQUIPMENT RESILIENCY.         Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of       this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall       implement a plan for the long-term development of a       centralized spectral database for chemical screening devices.       Such plan shall address the following:        (1) How newly identified spectra will be collected, stored,       and distributed to such devices in their operational       environment, including at ports of entry.        (2) Identification of parties responsible for updates and       maintenance of such database.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, every American community, in one way or another, has  been impacted by the opioid crisis. This crisis, already two decades  old, continues to grow and evolve.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more  than 28,000 people in the United States overdosed or died from  synthetic opioids in 2017 alone. Virtually all types of opioids,  whether finished heroin or potent synthetic opioids such as fentanyl,  cross our borders through our ports of entry.   Transnational criminal organizations hide illicit narcotics in  legitimate  [[Page H9368]]  cross-border cargo, making detection a significant challenge. The  potency of these narcotics also varies by the method used to smuggle it  into the country.   With fentanyl, we now know that shipments coming through our  international mail system often have higher purity levels than those  smuggled in cargo crossing our land borders. Often, the majority of  fentanyl and other opioids seized at land ports of entry have a purity  level of less than 10 percent, making it possible to sell these drugs  in our communities faster.   Fighting back against this tactic requires U.S. Customs and Border  Protection, CBP, to have adequate detection technology to interject  these opioids before they reach our communities.   However, in September of 2019, the Department of Homeland Security,  DHS, Office of Inspector General reported that CBP purchased technology  to screen for synthetic opioids that was unable to identify fentanyl  and other synthetic opioids with purity levels below 10 percent.   H.R. 4761, the DHS Opioid Detection Resilience Act of 2019, is a  bipartisan bill meant to address this capability gap. It requires CBP  to implement a strategy to ensure its chemical screening devices can  identify narcotics, including opioids and synthetic opioids, that are  less than 10 percent in concentration.   The bill also requires that CBP follow best practices and good  government standards by testing new devices to understand their  capabilities and limitations prior to deployment.   Recognizing that drug traffickers change their tactics and the  chemicals used as precursors, H.R. 4761 also requires DHS to take steps  toward developing a centralized database for chemical screening  devices. This would mean that, as new chemicals are identified, their  specific signatures will be more readily detected by the screening  devices used by CBP's frontline personnel.   DHS must continually adapt and stay ahead of the criminal  organizations seeking to exploit our systems. An effective and enhanced  detection capability is a critical tool to accomplishing that mission.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                  Washington, DC, November 20, 2019.      Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson: In recognition of the desire to       expedite consideration of H.R. 4761, the DHS Opioid Detection       Resilience Act of 2019, the Committee on Ways and Means       agrees to waive formal consideration of the bill as to       provisions that fall within the rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Ways and Means.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letter on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 4761.            Sincerely,                                                   Richard E. Neal,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                  Washington, DC, November 21, 2019.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neal: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 4761, the ``DHS Opioid Detection Resilience Act of       2019.'' The Committee on Homeland Security recognizes that       the Committee on Ways and Means has a jurisdictional interest       in H.R. 4761, and I appreciate your effort to allow this bill       to be considered on the House floor.        I concur with you that forgoing action on the bill does not       in any way prejudice the Committee on Ways and Means with       respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or       similar legislation in the future, and I would support your       effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this       legislation.        I will include our letters on H.R. 4761 in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of this bill.       I look forward to working with you on this legislation and       other matters of great importance to this nation.            Sincerely,                                                Bennie G. Thompson,                                                          Chairman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4761 is a bipartisan measure that received the full  support of the Committee on Homeland Security to address a capability  need identified by the DHS inspector general. The DHS Opioid Detection  Resilience Act of 2019 seeks to ensure that CBP personnel have the best  and most up-to-date technology to detect and prevent opioids from  entering the country and our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 4761, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4739) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  protect U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers, agents, other  personnel, and canines against potential synthetic opioid exposure, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4739         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Synthetic Opioid Exposure       Prevention and Training Act''.       SEC. 2. PROTECTION AGAINST POTENTIAL SYNTHETIC OPIOID                     EXPOSURE WITHIN U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER                     PROTECTION.

Protection against potential synthetic opioid exposure.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be speaking on behalf of my bill, the  Synthetic Opioid Exposure Prevention and Training Act.   We are at a crucial time in our fight against the opioid crisis in  our Nation. Less expensive and extremely lethal synthetic, chemically  laced, and derived drugs, rather than first-generation opioid  pharmaceuticals, now drive the addiction and overdoses that cripple and  break the hearts of the neighbors and families of our communities.   We must respond to this changed dynamic in the ongoing opioid crisis  with legislation targeted at reducing harm and saving lives.   Most of these deadly synthetics, such as fentanyl, are imported into  our country. This bill addresses a specific threat by seeking to  eliminate the risk of accidental exposure to synthetics for the workers  screening packages and cargo entering our country.   Much of this screening occurs only a few miles from the neighborhoods  I represent in New York's seaports and at the JFK International  Airport's International Mail Facility, the largest mail-screening  facility in America, where, every day, we are finding fentanyl hidden  in packages from places like China.   Whether cargo and packages are screened by CBP personnel near my  district or thousands of miles away, this bill is directly relevant to  the lives of my constituents. Unfortunately, these dangerous and  illegally manufactured substances get distributed in communities like  mine. This is, of course, true for every district across this country.   The universal threat posed by synthetic opioids is reflected by my  Democratic and Republican colleagues joining together as cosponsors of  this bill. I am grateful for their support and hope that we can  continue to fight the opioid crisis as a united and determined  legislative body.   While there is much left to do on this front, H.R. 4739 takes crucial  steps toward enhancing our ability to shut down the importation of  synthetic opioids. It requires that training for CBP personnel on  synthetics be regularly reviewed and updated to respond to the  developing threat environment. This includes making sure workers know  how to properly handle synthetic opioids and how to administer the  reversal drugs, which can save lives if accidental exposure occurs.   Furthermore, my bill requires CBP to ensure that these reversal drugs  are in hand at facilities where opioid screenings happen. Fentanyl,  according to the CDC, is up to 100 times more potent than morphine or  even heroin. Even the smallest dose can kill unless drugs like naloxone  are available and quickly administered.   If the workers screening packages for substances like fentanyl don't  have the training and tools they need to be confident they can do their  job safely, more of these deadly opioids will make their way into our  communities, and more families will be added to the opioid crisis list  of victims.   I ask each of my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill, the  Synthetic Opioid Exposure Prevention and Training Act.   I reserve the balance of my time.

Dear Chairman Neal: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 4739, the ``Synthetic Opioid Exposure Prevention and       Training Act.'' The Committee on Homeland Security recognizes       that the Committee on Ways and Means has a jurisdictional       interest in H.R. 4739, and I appreciate your effort to allow       this bill to be considered on the House floor.        I concur with you that forgoing action on the bill does not       in any way prejudice the Committee on Ways and Means with       respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or       similar legislation in the future, and I would support your       effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this       legislation.        I will include our letters on H.R. 4739 in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of this bill.       I look forward to working with you on this legislation and       other matters of great importance to this nation.            Sincerely,                                                Bennie G. Thompson,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, transnational criminal organizations are constantly  developing new forms of synthetic opioids and new methods for smuggling  these drugs into our country. To combat such activity, Congress must  ensure that CBP officers serving on the front lines are protected from  accidental exposure.   This bill is one step of many that must be taken to slow the opioid  crisis and end the devastation brought to our communities by this  epidemic. By protecting the CBP officers and agents who operate as our  frontline defenders against the importation of synthetics, this bill  ensures that they will remain safe and equipped to respond to the  constantly changing threat posed by synthetic opioids.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4739, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
