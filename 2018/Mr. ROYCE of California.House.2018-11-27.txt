 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5273) to reduce global fragility and violence by  improving the capacity of the United States to reduce and address the  causes of violence, violent conflict, and fragility in pilot countries,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5273         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Global Fragility and       Violence Reduction Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) According to the United Nations, an unprecedented 68.5       million people around the world, the highest level ever       recorded, are currently forcibly displaced from their homes.        (2) According to the World Bank, violence and violent       conflict are now the leading causes of displacement and food       insecurity worldwide, driving 80 percent of humanitarian       needs, with the same conflicts accounting for the majority of       forcibly displaced persons every year since 1991.        (3) According to the World Health Organization, preventable       forms of violence kill at least 1.4 million people each year.       According to the Institute for Economics and Peace, violence       containment costs the global economy $14.76 trillion a year,       or 12.4 percent of the world's GDP. If violence were to       decrease uniformly across the world by just 10 percent, the       global economy would gain $1.48 trillion each year.        (4) Violence and violent conflict underpin many of the       United States Government's key national security challenges.       Notably, violent conflicts allow for environments in which       terrorist organizations recruit and thrive, while the       combination of violence, corruption, poverty, poor       governance, and underdevelopment often enables transnational       gangs and criminal networks to wreak havoc and commit       atrocities worldwide.        (5) According to new research by the University of Maryland       and University of Pittsburgh, exposure to violence increases       support for violence and violent extremism. Research       increasingly finds exposure to violence as a predictor of       future participation in violence, including violent       extremism.        (6) United States foreign policy and assistance efforts in       highly violent and fragile states remain governed by an       outdated patchwork of authorities that prioritize responding       to immediate needs rather than solving the problems that       cause them.        (7) Lessons learned over the past 20 years, documented by       the 2013 Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction       Lessons Learned Study, the 2016 Fragility Study Group report,       and the 2018 Special Inspector General for Afghanistan       Lessons Learned Study on Stabilization, show that effective,       sustained United States efforts to reduce violence and       stabilize fragile and violence-affected states require       clearly defined goals and strategies, adequate long-term       funding, rigorous and iterative conflict analysis,       coordination across the United States Government, including       strong civil-military coordination, and integration with       national and sub-national partners, including local civil       society organizations, local justice systems, and local       governance structures.        (8) The ``Stabilization Assistance Review'' released in       2018 by the Departments of State and Defense and the United       States Agency for International Development states, ``The       United States has strong national security and economic       interests in reducing levels of violence and promoting       stability in areas affected by armed conflict.'' The Review       further states, ``Stabilization is an inherently political       endeavor that requires aligning U.S. Government efforts--      diplomatic engagement, foreign assistance, and defense--      toward supporting locally legitimate authorities and systems       to peaceably manage conflict and prevent violence.''.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to--        (1) ensure that all relevant Federal departments and       agencies coordinate to achieve coherent, long-term goals for       programs designed to prevent violence, stabilize conflict-      affected areas, and address the long-term causes of violence       and fragility, including when implementing the Global       Fragility and Violence Reduction Initiative described in       section 5(a);        (2) seek to improve global, regional, and local       coordination of relevant international and multilateral       development and donor organizations regarding efforts to       prevent violence, stabilize conflict-affected areas, and       address the long-term causes of violence and fragility in       fragile and violence-affected countries, and, where       practicable and appropriate, align such efforts with       multilateral goals and indicators;        (3) expand and enhance the effectiveness of United States       foreign assistance programs and activities to prevent       violence, stabilize conflict-affected areas, and address the       long-term causes of violence and fragility, including       programs intended to improve the indicators described in       section 5(d)(1);        (4) support the research and development of effective       approaches to prevent violence, stabilize conflict-affected       areas, and address the long-term causes of violence and       fragility; and        (5) improve the monitoring, evaluation, learning, and       adaptation tools and authorities for relevant Federal       departments and agencies working to prevent violence,       stabilize conflict-affected areas, and address the long-term       causes of violence and fragility.       SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ASSISTANCE FOR THE GLOBAL                     FRAGILITY AND VIOLENCE REDUCTION INITIATIVE.         It is the sense of Congress that the President, the       Secretary of State, the Administrator of USAID, the Secretary       of Defense, and the heads of other relevant Federal       departments and agencies, should work with Congress to       provide sufficient types and levels of funding to--        (1) allow for more adaptive program planning and       implementation under the initiative and priority country or       regional plans required under section 5, including through       exemptions from specific and minimum funding levels when such       exemptions would make programs better able to respond to       monitoring and evaluation or changed circumstances in       relevant countries;        (2) better integrate conflict and violence reduction       activities into other program areas where appropriate; and        (3) contribute to the creation of transparent and       accountable multilateral funds, initiatives, and strategies       to enhance and better coordinate both private and public       efforts to prevent violence, stabilize conflict-affected       areas, and address the long-term causes of violence and       fragility.

In this Act--        (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--        (A) the Committees on Foreign Relations, Armed Services,       and Appropriations of the Senate; and        (B) the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Armed Services, and       Appropriations of the House of Representatives.        (2) Relevant federal department or agency.--The term       ``relevant Federal department or agency'' means the       Department of the Treasury and any other Federal department       or agency the President determines is relevant to carry out       the purposes of this Act.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, since the horrific attacks of September 11, 2001, the  United States has committed lives and treasure to help stabilize  countries plagued by conflict and insecurity. We undertake these  efforts because unchecked instability abroad threatens our economic,  humanitarian, and security interests here at home.   Of course, the United States cannot achieve its objectives alone. We  need to coordinate with willing and able partners. We need to engage  local leaders, empower civil society, and work with the private sector.  We need to improve coordination among our own national security  agencies to ensure they are working together to advance clearly defined  objectives and eliminate duplication and waste. Through this process,  they learn and adapt.   Last June, the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International  Development, and the Department of Defense released a security  assistance review that set out a framework to improve U.S. security  assistance programs, including stabilization. The legislation we are  considering today builds on that effort.   This legislation requires the Secretary of State, in coordination  with the Administrator of USAID, the Secretary of Defense, and the  heads of other relevant Federal departments and agencies, to develop a  comprehensive initiative to address global violence and instability.   Within 6 months, the Secretary of State will submit to Congress an  implementation plan that sets out clear goals and objectives,  identifies priority countries and regions, defines the roles and  responsibilities of each U.S. department and agency, and describes  efforts to improve coordination and private sector engagement.   Then, building off that initial survey, the Secretary will submit to  Congress a 10-year implementation plan for each identified priority  country and region that aligns the diplomatic, development, and  security activities of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, this is a timely bill that will help ensure the  effective use of U.S. foreign assistance, reduce violence and  insecurity abroad, and keep America safe. It enjoys bipartisan support.  And it just makes sense.   I would like to thank the sponsors--Ranking Member Eliot Engel; the  chairman of the Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade Subcommittee, Ted  Poe; the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Mike McCaul; Bill  Keating of Massachusetts--and their bipartisan cosponsors for their  work on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas, Judge Ted Poe, chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), chairman of the Committee on  Homeland Security and a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking Mr.  Engel, the author of this measure, and I express my deep appreciation  for his help in all that we have undertaken with our committee.   There are, as Eliot knows, 70 million men, women, and children who  have been displaced by conflict around this globe. While the United  States is the most generous provider of humanitarian assistance, it is  really true that no amount of tents and sheeting will stop the  suffering and the misery that these people feel.   We need solutions to get at the roots of these problems, and the  legislation we are considering today helps us down the right path to do  that. While it does not obligate the United States to take on  stabilization efforts, it does provide the framework for improved  coordination so that we can be more strategic, more efficient, and more  effective with our diplomatic development and security assistance.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1567) to promote economic partnership and  cooperation between the United States and Mexico, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1567         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``United States-Mexico       Economic Partnership Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The United States and Mexico have benefitted from a       bilateral, mutually beneficial partnership focused on       advancing the economic interests of both countries.        (2) In 2013, Mexico adopted major energy reforms that       opened its energy sector to private investment, increasing       energy cooperation between Mexico and the United States and       opening new opportunities for United States energy       engagement.        (3) On January 18, 2018, the Principal Deputy Assistant       Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs at the       Department of State stated, ``Our exchange programs build       enduring relationships and networks to advance U.S. national       interests and foreign policy goals. . . The role of our       exchanges. . . in advancing U.S. national security and       economic interests enjoys broad bipartisan support from       Congress and other stakeholders, and provides a strong return       on investment.''.        (4) According to the Institute of International Education,       in the 2015-2016 academic year, more than 56,000 United       States students studied in other countries in the Western       Hemisphere region while more than 84,000 non-United States       students from the region studied in the United States, but       only 5,000 of those United States students studied in Mexico       and only 16,000 of those non-United States students were from       Mexico.        (5) In March 2011, the United States launched the 100,000       Strong in the Americas Initiative, which seeks to increase       educational exchanges between the United States and other       countries in the Western Hemisphere region so that 100,000       United States students are studying in other countries in the       Western Hemisphere region and 100,000 non-United States       students from the region are studying in the United States       per year by 2020.        (6) In January 2014, the United States established the       100,000 Strong in the Americas Innovation Fund, which seeks       to realize the goals of the 100,000 Strong in the Americas       Initiative by facilitating a public-private partnership       between the Department of State and nongovernmental       organizations, corporations, and universities in the United       States and other countries of the Western Hemisphere region.        (7) To date, the 100,000 Strong in the Americas Innovation       Fund has awarded more than 100 grants to more than 250 higher       education institutions from 25 countries in the Western       Hemisphere region, and has raised $9,000,000 in investments,       75 percent of which was from corporations, foundations, and       regional governments.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States--        (1) to continue deepening economic cooperation between the       United States and Mexico; and        (2) to seek to prioritize and expand educational and       professional exchange programs with Mexico, including through       the framework of the 100,000 Strong in the Americas       Initiative.       SEC. 4. STRATEGY TO PRIORITIZE AND EXPAND EDUCATIONAL AND                     PROFESSIONAL EXCHANGE PROGRAMS WITH MEXICO.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of State shall develop a       strategy to carry out the policy described in section 3, to       include prioritizing and expanding educational and       professional exchange programs with Mexico through the       framework of the 100,000 Strong in the Americas Initiative.        (b) Elements.--The strategy required under subsection (a)       shall--        (1) encourage more academic exchanges between the United       States and Mexico at the secondary, post-secondary, and post-      graduate levels, especially with communities and through       academic institutions in the covered United States-Mexico       border region;        (2) encourage United States and Mexican academic       institutions and businesses to collaborate to assist       prospective and developing entrepreneurs in strengthening       their business skills and promoting cooperation and joint       business initiatives across the United States and Mexico,       with a focus on initiatives in the covered United States-      Mexico border region;        (3) promote energy infrastructure coordination and       cooperation through support of vocational-level education,       internships, and exchanges between the United States and       Mexico, particularly in the region in which the Eagle Ford       Shale is located and in proximity to such region; and        (4) assess the feasibility of fostering partnerships       between universities in the United States and medical school       and nursing programs in Mexico to ensure that medical school       and nursing programs in Mexico have comparable accreditation       standards as medical school and nursing programs in the       United States by the Accreditation and Standards in Foreign       Medical Education, in addition to the Accreditation       Commission For Education in Nursing, so that medical students       can pass medical licensing board exams, and nursing students       can pass nursing licensing exams, in the United States.        (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to       Congress a report on the strategy required under subsection       (a).       SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) 100,000 strong in the americas initiative.--The term       ``100,000 Strong in the Americas Initiative'' means the       initiative established in March 2011 by the United States       Government to increase educational exchanges in the Western       Hemisphere.        (2) Covered united states-mexico border region.--The term       ``covered United States-Mexico border region'' means those       portions of the United States and Mexico that are within 100       kilometers of the international boundary between those       countries.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative Cuellar and  Representative Castro as well as the ranking member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee, Mr. Engel, and the chairman of the Homeland Security  Committee, Mike McCaul, for their work on the legislation that we are  considering here today.   The United States and Mexico share strong economic and cultural ties.  As our neighbor to the south, a strong, stable Mexico benefits the  United States. Realizing this, we already have many professional and  educational exchanges between our two countries to help see that young  people in Mexico graduate from school and enter the workforce with the  skills, the credentials, and the experience that they need in the 21st  century.   In the 2015-2016 school year, 5,000 U.S. students studied abroad in  Mexico while 16,000 Mexican students studied in the U.S. They did this  through various exchange programs.   These are good numbers, true, but more can be done to ensure that our  young people are taking advantage of existing opportunities to study in  both countries, and this bill builds on existing programs to expand and  strengthen these exchanges.   In particular, the bill focuses on exchanges in four important areas,  and these are higher education, medical school, entrepreneurship, and  the energy sector. These are all areas from which the U.S. and Mexico  stand to mutually benefit from greater cooperation.   There are, of course, areas in which the U.S.-Mexico relationship can  improve. For example, Mexico needs to do more to combat the rampant  corruption that has taken its toll on its citizens' trust.   But this does not mean that our two countries cannot work together to  ensure a brighter, more successful future for young people in both of  our countries. Educational and professional exchanges are key to that  goal, so I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to again stress that this is  one of America's most important relationships.   I would also like to stress my appreciation for the work of  Congressman Henry Cuellar not just on this bill, but on the overall  relationship with Mexico. I have had the opportunity to work with him  in the past. I know his passion on this, and I appreciate his  effectiveness.   I thank Representative Castro as well, and, of course, the ranking  member of this committee, Mr. Engel. And I should mention the work,  also, of the chairman of our Homeland Security Committee, Mike McCaul.  They all worked on the legislation we are considering today.   I think that educational and professional exchanges really allow  young American and Mexican students and young professionals the chance  to not only experience a new culture for them, but also to ensure that  our young people graduate from school and enter the workforce with the  skills, the credentials, the experience, and the knowledge also about  our neighbors, the knowledge they need in the 21st century.   I urge all of my colleagues to join us in supporting this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4591) to impose sanctions with respect to Iranian  persons that threaten the peace or stability of Iraq or the Government  of Iraq, as amended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume   Mr. Speaker, this past September, thousands of Iraqis protested  throughout the south of the country calling for Iran to stop meddling  in their democracy. Yet, as these protesters shouted out, ``Iran out,''  their pleas were met with bullets by militias funded by and commanded  by Iranians.   This latest bout of violence in Iraq is not surprising. Iran has used  the fight against ISIS as an excuse to expand its footprint inside Iraq  and to fund tens of thousands of militia forces. Even as ISIS has  receded in Iraq, Iranian-backed militias have continued to expand  throughout the country and to expand into Syria, where these militias  have helped the brutal Assad regime commit countless war crimes.   These Iranian-backed militias not only threaten the Syrian and Iraqi  people, they also pose a serious threat to U.S. personnel serving  overseas, and I will tell you why.   Mr. Speaker, 2 months ago, one of these militias launched mortars at  the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, prompting a stern warning from the  administration that the U.S. will hold the Iranian regime accountable  for any attack by these militias against any U.S. personnel or U.S.  Government facility.   These militias also pose a direct threat to Israel. Some have formed  a so-called Golan Liberation Brigade, with the explicit intent to  attack Israel. The U.N. Ambassador, Nikki Haley, has cited reports  alleging that Iran has begun transferring ballistic missiles to these  militias that are in Iraq.   Despite all this, many of these Iranian-backed militias have not been  designated as terrorist organizations nor are they otherwise subject to  U.S. sanctions, despite being affiliates of Iran's Revolutionary Guard.  This oversight could allow these militias to access the U.S. financial  system.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legislation will allow support and it  will bring that support to democracy in Iraq, and it will counter  Iran's deadly influence there. This bill is narrowly tailored to go  after those militias directly funded and commanded by the IRGC--the  same militias that have attacked our soldiers; the same militias that  continue to threaten those in the region.   I am pleased that this bill also includes provisions to establish a  watch list of Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, which will allow  Congress to continually monitor Iran's activity in the country,  including new militias which may emerge in the future.   The Iraqi people deserve and want genuine political reform and  democracy, and above all else, they want peace. This cannot happen so  long as Iran continues to fund and command militias within Iraq.   Empowering Iranian militias is a step backwards for Iraq. Instead, it  would introduce the Hezbollah model and all the chaos that goes along  with it. Iranian influence will only perpetuate the cycle of violence  and increase the sectarian polarization, once again creating the  conditions for the reemergence of ISIS, al-Qaida, and other radical  Islamist groups.   For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                        House of Representatives,                                     Committee on the Judiciary,                                  Washington, DC, November 27, 2018.      Hon. Edward R. Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Royce: I write with respect to H.R. 4591, the       ``Preventing Iranian Destabilization of Iraq Act.'' As a       result of your having consulted with us on provisions within       H.R. 4591 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on the Judiciary, I forego any further       consideration of this bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.        The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 4591 at       this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our       committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our       committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation and asks       that you support any such request.        I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 4591 and would ask       that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, November 27, 2018.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 4591, the Preventing Iranian       Destabilization of Iraq Act, so that the bill may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this bill or similar legislation in  [[Page H9595]]       the future. I would support your effort to seek appointment       of an appropriate number of conferees from your committee to       any House-Senate conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 4591 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.

Hon. Edward R. Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Royce: I write to you regarding H.R. 4591,       the ``Preventing Iranian Destabilization of Iraq Act of       2017'', which the Committee on Ways and Means has       jurisdictional interest.        As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions       in H.R. 4591 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Ways and Means, including asset blocking, I       agree to waive formal consideration of this bill. The       Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the mutual       understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and       the Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       the bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues that fall within our       jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the right to seek       appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any       House-Senate conference involving this or similar       legislation, and requests your support for such request.        I would appreciate your response confirming this       understanding with respect to H.R. 4591 and ask that a copy       of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the       House floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, November 27, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to forgo a sequential       referral request on H.R. 4591, the Preventing Iranian       Destabilization of Iraq Act, so that the bill may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this bill or similar legislation in the future.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 4591 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward       to continuing to work together as this measure moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger). A member of the Committee on  Foreign Affairs, he is the author of this bill, and his service to our  Nation includes the time he spent as an Air Force pilot serving in Iraq  and in Afghanistan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, chairman emeritus of the  Foreign Affairs Committee, who chairs the Subcommittee on the Middle  East and North Africa.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas, Judge Ted Poe, chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues for  their bipartisan work on this important legislation. This measure will  send a clear message to the Iraqi people that the U.S. supports them in  their quest for peace and stability and democracy.   Still recovering from the atrocities and desolation left by ISIS, the  Iraqi people deserve a chance to establish a stable democracy free of  Iranian meddling.   To be clear, these Iranian-backed militias are not just a threat to  the Iraqi people. These same militias have launched mortars at the U.S.  Embassy in Baghdad and continue to threaten Israel. It is well past the  time that these militias face justice and accountability for their war  crimes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 6207) to support democracy and accountability in  the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 6207         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Democratic Republic of the       Congo Democracy and Accountability Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         (a) In General.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the Democratic Republic of Congo has historically faced       election-related political instability, endemic corruption,       armed conflict, gross human rights abuses, and humanitarian       crises, which destabilizes the region and causes massive       human suffering;        (2) the United States has provided billions of dollars to       help stabilize the Democratic Republic of the Congo,       including through humanitarian aid, development assistance,       and support for peacekeeping operations, since the end of the       civil and regional war in 2003;        (3) the stability of the Democratic Republic of the Congo       is a strategic priority for the United States on the African       continent and it is in the national security interest of the       United States to support accountable governance in the       Democratic Republic of Congo;        (4) United States policy with respect to the Democratic       Republic of Congo should focus on helping the country become       more stable and democratic, including through supporting       legitimate state authority, such that the Government of the       Democratic Republic of Congo is better able to respond to and       provide for the basic needs of its citizens and live in       peaceful coexistence with its neighbors;        (5) the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo       should comply with all obligations under its Constitution,       the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights       ratified on November 1, 1976, and the December 2016 Saint       Sylvestre agreement brokered by the Congolese Conference of       Catholic Bishops, by--        (A) immediately lifting restrictions on the freedoms of       assembly, expression, and association;        (B) releasing all political prisoners, including those       detained for peacefully exercising their rights;        (C) ensuring that state security forces protect the rights       of peaceful demonstrators;        (D) bringing to justice security force personnel accused of       serious abuses against citizens, including against protesters       or opposition supporters; and        (E) allowing private media outlets to operate freely;        (6) the United States should continue to support efforts to       hold free, fair, and democratic elections in the Democratic       Republic of the Congo, including by supporting the completion       of an inclusive, transparent voter registration process and       civic education, preventing or mitigating violence, and       facilitating credible election observation by the African       Union, the Southern African Development Community, and other       appropriate civil society entities.        (b) Sense of Congress on Humanitarian Assistance for the       People of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.--It is the       sense of Congress that the Secretary of State, in       coordination with the Administrator of the United States       Agency for International Development, should continue to       provide humanitarian and development assistance to the people       of the Democratic Republic of the Congo through credible and       independent nongovernmental organizations, including local       partners, human rights organizations, women-led       organizations, and faith-based or non-faith-based       organizations. In providing such assistance, the Secretary       and Administrator should prioritize--        (1) promoting partnerships with organizations that have had       a long-term presence in the country and have achieved       measurable impact, including by building the capacity of       local partners, human rights organizations, women-led       organizations, or faith-based or non-faith-based       organizations to address local needs;        (A) placing the country on a trajectory toward ending the       need for foreign assistance; and        (2) evaluating the comparative merits of grants,       cooperative agreements, contracts, and other methods for       providing foreign assistance.        (c) Sense of Congress on Support for Democratic Governance       and Conflict Mitigation Mechanisms in the Democratic Republic       of the Congo.--It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary       of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency       for International Development should--        (1) continue to--        (A) support long-term peace and stability in the Democratic       Republic of the Congo by strengthening democratic       institutions and promoting respect for the rule of law at the       national, provincial, and local levels;        (B) support the capacity of civil society actors to promote       transparency, accountability, freedom of expression, and       anti-corruption efforts;        (C) support conflict prevention and mitigation activities       where appropriate, particularly in the Kasai region, the       Tanganyika Province, the North and South Kivu Provinces, and       the Ituri Province; and        (D) work to address the root causes of chronic violence and       fragility, with a focus on youth empowerment, education, and       the promotion of justice and accountability mechanisms; and        (2) seek to work directly with and through credible,       independent, nongovernmental organizations, including local       partners, human rights organizations, women-led       organizations, and faith-based or non-faith-based       organizations, to--        (A) defend internationally recognized democratic rights;        (B) support freedom of expression, including through media       broadcasting;        (C) combat public corruption; and        (D) improve the transparency and accountability of       governing institutions in the Democratic Republic of the       Congo.       SEC. 3. SUPPORT FOR EFFORTS AT THE UNITED NATIONS ON THE                     DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO.         The President should instruct the Permanent Representative       of the United States to the United Nations to use the voice,       vote, and influence of the United States at the United       Nations to--        (1) emphasize the importance of implementing the December       2016 Saint Sylvestre agreement to the Government of the       Democratic Republic of the Congo, including the need to lift       restrictions on the freedoms of assembly, expression, and       association, and the need to conduct free, fair, and       democratic elections;        (2) keep the humanitarian and political crisis in the       Democratic Republic of the Congo on the regular agenda of the       United Nations Security Council until the completion of a       peaceful transfer of power through free, fair, and democratic       elections;  [[Page H9598]]         (3) ensure that the United Nations Organization       Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo       has an appropriately focused mandate tailored to security and       governance conditions on the ground with a particular focus       on civilian protection, and that the mission has sufficient       means, including specialized personnel and effective       leadership, to execute its mandate; and        (4) improve Member states' implementation of United Nations       Security Council-imposed sanctions on individuals and       entities violating the United Nations arms embargo,       threatening the peace and security of the Democratic Republic       of the Congo, engaging in human or resource trafficking, or       perpetrating gross human rights violations in the Democratic       Republic of the Congo.       SEC. 4. CODIFICATION OF SANCTIONS RELATING TO THE DEMOCRATIC                     REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO.         (a) In General.--United States sanctions provided for in       Executive Order 13671 (79 Fed.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. This is the Democratic  Republic of the Congo Democracy and Accountability Act.   Mr. Speaker, I would begin by thanking Congressman Smith and  Congresswoman Karen Bass, they are the chairman and ranking member of  the Africa Subcommittee, and I thank the ranking member of this  committee, Mr. Engel, for their work on this bipartisan legislation.   Long overdue elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are  scheduled now for December 23, 2018. But we all know that simply  holding elections is not enough.   President Kabila already has remained in power 2 years past his  constitutional mandate. And while I am pleased that he will reportedly  step aside, the corruption of the Kabila government runs much deeper  than just the presidency. Government officials and security forces  continue to use their positions of power to undermine the election and  to stoke instability in the country.   Peaceful protests have been met with violence, with mass arrests.  They have even been met with torture. New reports of abuse and  intimidation against journalists and against activists by government  forces emerge now every day.   Meanwhile, arbitrary legal impediments have barred prominent  opposition candidates from running. The government insists on using  untested and confusing voting machines, leaving the election vulnerable  to vote manipulation and to rigging.   Throughout all of this, the government continues to boycott  international efforts to support election preparations and to increase  humanitarian assistance, and continues to deny, in the face of serious  and mounting evidence, that there is a problem.   I have been on three trips to the Congo over this issue over the  years. The people of the Congo are suffering and the humanitarian  situation is dire. Over 4 million Congolese are internally displaced.  More than 13 million people are in urgent need of humanitarian  assistance, including 7 million facing acute food insecurity. And  another Ebola outbreak is threatening the lives of thousands.   We know that government security forces are responsible for horrific  human rights abuses and for provoking instability across the DRC. Just  last year, two researchers were killed investigating human rights  abuses in the country. One of these researchers was an American. The  government continues to block efforts to fully investigate and hold  individuals accountable. This cannot stand.   The U.S. must be fully engaged in support of the Congolese people and  their struggle to freely choose their next leader. This legislation we  are considering today is a call to action. It requires a determination  on individuals responsible for undermining peace and security, impeding  the democratic process, committing human rights violations, and  engaging in corruption so  [[Page H9599]]  that they can be sanctioned. It calls for a focus on those that are  blocking the democratic process.   Mr. Speaker, we have seen this sad situation before in the DRC. We  have seen instability and conflict spill into neighboring countries and  undermine the entire region. We cannot let this cycle continue. A  failed election in December would surely inflame the violence. This is  why we must take decisive action to hold individuals accountable and  ensure free and fair elections this December.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Smith), and I ask unanimous consent that he may control  that time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by recognizing  the efforts of Mr. Smith, Chair of the Subcommittee on Africa, Global  Health and Global Human Rights, and Ranking Member Engel for their  strong leadership on this critical issue.   Mr. Speaker, for seven years, the world has watched the brutal  dictator Assad inflict untold suffering on the Syrian people. Since the  beginning of the conflict, half a million people have been killed and  13 million--largely women and children--remain in dire need of basic  humanitarian assistance in Syria.   Over the course of this deadly conflict, we have seen Assad and his  backers--Russia in the air, and Iran on the ground--commit atrocious  war crimes, including using chemical weapons on civilians. I am sure I  am not the only one who will never forget the footage shown before our  Committee of a Syrian doctor trying to revive two young children,  foaming at the mouth, after chlorine bombs rained down on their  village; or the testimony of Caesar, a former regime police  photographer, who bravely smuggled thousands of images cataloguing the  gruesome and methodical torture in Assad's prisons out of Syria.   But the brutal Assad regime is not the only terror the Syrian people  have had to endure--his brutality paved the way for ISIS to expand in  the country as well. Exploiting the chaos created by the conflict in  Syria, ISIS burst onto the scene in 2014 by declaring themselves and  their supposed ``caliphate''--and committing obscene, horrific acts in  an effort to spread their nihilistic, death-filled ideology.   Today, thanks to the service of our brave men and women in uniform,  ISIS is receding. But we cannot forget the incredible evil they  unleashed--while in power, they committed unfathomable violence against  Christians and Yezidis in Syria and Iraq, and terrorized the Muslim  communities unlucky enough to fall under their ``caliphate.''   Congress played a critical role in calling these atrocities by their  correct name--genocide. This was a very important first step--allowing  for assistance to get to minority communities desperately in need. Even  now, there is still an urgent need for assistance to these vulnerable  communities, which have been devastated by ISIS' efforts to wipe them  out. These ancient communities, whose roots go back centuries, include  Christians, Yezidis, Assyrians, Syriacs, Turkomens, and many others.  Their presence in Iraq and Syria is crucial to the social fabric of  these nations.   H.R. 390 offers additional, immediate relief for these vulnerable  communities and also directs the State Department to do more to support  efforts to collect and preserve evidence of ``genocide, crimes against  humanity, and war crimes'' so that someday, justice might be served.   I urge Members to support this bill and send it straight to the  President so that the possibility of justice and accountability for  these atrocities can give hope to those suffering today.
