 Mr. Speaker, my colleagues across the aisle appear eager  to investigate and hold hearings on just about anything, but when 200  Republicans and I urged the Speaker to investigate the origins of  COVID-19 a month ago, the Speaker did nothing.   Evidence is now mounting that COVID-19 may have escaped from a lab in  Wuhan, China, and the Chinese Communist Party worked to cover it up.   Pointblank, this coverup by the CCP cost American lives, shuttered  tens of  [[Page H3138]]  thousands of businesses, and altered life as we know it.   Yet, here we stand, almost a month later, and we are still no closer  to a House investigation, not even a hearing to get to the bottom of  what happened.   The simple fact of the matter is that the Chinese Communist Party is  an adversary, and they have not been truthful or honest about anything,  especially not their role in covering up the origins of COVID-19.   Since the very beginning, the Chinese Communist Party has blocked  American scientists from participating in a full-scope investigation,  refused access to reporters from Wuhan, manipulated the World Health  Organization's report on the origins of the virus, and strong-armed  anyone who disagreed with the narrative they invented.   It is infuriating that Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats are willing  to cover for the Chinese Communist Party and let them off the hook for  this disaster, simply to achieve a political end.   We cannot and should not accept anything less than absolute certainty  about the origins of COVID-19. We must investigate, hold China  accountable, and ensure nothing like this ever happens again.                            ____________________
