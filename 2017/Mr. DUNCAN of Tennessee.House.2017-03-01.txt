 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Georgia for yielding, and I want to say that, in a short time in the  Congress, he has become one of our greatest Members, and I appreciate  him leading this effort tonight.   It is sad, it is unfortunate that, with any big government program, a  small number of individuals or companies find ways to manipulate the  system and become wealthy. That is why 6 or 7 of the 10 wealthiest  counties in the U.S. are suburban counties to Washington, D.C., and  that is wrong.   I have read for years about the revolving door at the Pentagon, about  the defense contractors hiring all the retired admirals and generals.  The same thing has happened with the Food and Drug Administration, that  the big drug giants have hired all the former top people at the FDA,  and we have a drug price crisis in this country today. There are many  parts of it, but we want to talk tonight about one that most don't know  about and you almost have to be a pharmacist to really understand what  is going on.    But I rise tonight, Mr. Speaker, to join my colleagues in exposing,  as I say, an almost unknown culprit in our Nation's drug price crisis,  pharmacy benefits managers, also known as PBMs.   PBMs are essentially middlemen between pharmacies and drug  manufacturers, but the legal relationships among PBMs, pharmacies, and  drug and insurance companies have become increasingly entangled and  complex.   For instance, one of the largest pharmacy chains also operates its  own PBM, and one of the largest medical insurance companies also  operates its own PBM.   PBMs are supposed to be helping keep down the costs of drugs by  negotiating discounts and helping pharmacies with managing drug plans,  as they often claim to do. Despite these PBM promises, though, I have  heard from several pharmacy owners in my district who say that many  PBMs are, in reality, ripping them off by drastically raising drug  costs.   PBMs have tricks of the trade that include retroactively charging  pharmacies more for drugs that they have already sold and processed. I  am also told that PBMs also take too long to update the market value of  the drugs on their covered drug lists. But these tricks are just two.  PBMs use many more.   According to one expert and pharmacy owner in my district, he has  seen three primary causes for recent increases in prescription drugs:  one, FDA involvement, including requiring ``modern clinical trials'' of  old drugs that have worked for decades; two, drug manufacturers  needlessly hiking the price of generic drugs; and three, PBMs charging  ridiculous prices for drugs and pocketing the profits.   According to my constituents, PBMs are the main culprit of the three.  This pharmacist recently met with me and shared an eye-opening example.  One of his senior customers came in with a prescription for a fairly  common drug. The prescription had a real or actual cost of $23.40, but  the pharmacist found that the PBM was charging a copay of $250, over 10  times the actual cost of the drug. The pharmacist chose to just absorb  the PBM's ridiculous copay, and only charged his customer the actual  cost of the drug.   Another pharmacist in my district emailed me, describing how PBM  practices are accelerating seniors into the Medicare part D coverage  gap, or doughnut hole. He said: ``All of these PBMs have these types of  unfair compensations . . . This is not fair, and it hurts our  seniors.''   Even more pharmacists in my district have also reached out to me,  saying that they only get pennies on the dollar for the drugs they  sell. PBM actions are forcing pharmacies to deny patients access to  critical medications, or to give drugs away for free.   The Daily Times in Blount County, in my district, recently ran a  story on PBMs called ``Sworn to Secrecy.''                                time  1900    The article cites a pharmacist in Pennsylvania, Eric Pusey, who says  that his patients' copays for drugs are often higher than out-of-pocket  costs. Why? Because of PBM clawbacks. Mr. Pusey says that if he  explains clawbacks to his customers, some get fired up and don't even  believe what we are telling them is accurate.   Another pharmacist in Houston says: We look at it as theft--another  way for the PBMs to steal. Most people don't  [[Page H1452]]  understand. If their copay is high, then they care.   Susan Hayes, a pharmacist in Illinois, says that these PBM clawbacks  are like crack cocaine, the PBMs just can't get enough.   Some PBMs are facing lawsuits with accusations such as defrauding  patients, racketeering, breach of contract, and violating insurance  laws. Since 1987, when the first of the three largest PBMs  incorporated, drug prices have increased 1,100 percent, Mr. Speaker,  and per capita expenditures have jumped by 756 percent.   The three largest PBMs make up about 80 percent of the drug market,  which includes about 180 million patients. These PBMs often conduct  business through mail order practices. They sometimes will  automatically fill prescriptions month after month even if the patient  no longer needs the medication, resulting in terrible waste. Patients  include veterans and Medicare beneficiaries--endangering them, wasting  their benefits and taxpayer dollars, and driving up the cost of drugs.   As we heard President Trump say in his address last night, we need to  look into the artificially high drug prices right away. A good place to  start is PBMs. Mr. Speaker, PBMs must be more transparent in their  operations so that they can be held to their promises and to the law.   I will just close by saying that PBMs must no longer be able to get  away with conducting their business with such unethical methods that  they are using now. In short, PBMs must be held accountable for their  roles in the Nation's drug price crisis. I join in supporting our  community pharmacists.
