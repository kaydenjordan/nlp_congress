 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Pastor  Reginald Alton Pope, a beloved faith and community leader in Los  Angeles.   Under Pastor Pope's direction, Bethel Missionary Baptist Church went  beyond the walls of the church to offer support services to its  neighbors, did outreach to the unhoused, provided unemployment  services, and much more.   I witnessed this work after worshipping with the church on a Father's  Day morning.   It was a moving service. Pastor Pope preached that this country is  big enough for all our children. I will always remember Pastor Pope's  passion and his compassion.   Pastor Pope founded the Watts Area Ministers as a force for positive  community change. I was honored to participate in their annual Martin  Luther King Day festivities, always first-rate, service-focused events.   After a life of service to our community, Pastor Pope passed away on  June 16, 2021.   He is missed.  [[Page H3589]]                                ____________________
