 Mr. Speaker, as compared to other historic viruses and  outbreaks in recent years, the coronavirus, so far, is a lesser threat.   Let's compare it to H1N1, also known as the swine flu of 2009. The  CDC has estimated that approximately 60 million people in the U.S.  contracted H1N1 during that 2009 outbreak, leading to the death of  around 12,000 Americans.   Even more alarming, during this current 2019-2020 flu season,  approximately 18,000 people, unfortunately, have died as a result of  the more conventional flu. Currently, in the U.S., there are 105  confirmed cases of coronavirus, resulting in the unfortunate death of  six people so far. We expect these numbers will go up.   While this outbreak is, indeed, a problem, the CDC, not politicians,  continue to claim that the American public are unlikely to be exposed  to coronavirus.   During the Republican majority in Congress, we made several strategic  investments in key health resources to prevent the spread of a virus  like this one, including a 24 percent increase in CDC funding and a 70  percent increase in infectious disease response.   So, instead of sounding an alarm, I encourage my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to continue to remind Americans that our country  will adapt to the challenges coming.   For people, individually: Work on limiting your own risk by washing  your hands frequently.                            ____________________
