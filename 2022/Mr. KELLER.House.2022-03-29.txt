 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia. I rise  in support of the Securing a Strong Retirement Act. As part of the  Education and Labor Committee, our goal is to provide employers and  employees with opportunities to access a safe, effective, and  productive workplace.   We also work on policy that encourages people to save for retirement  and provides opportunities for their families. This bill accomplishes  both by improving employer-sponsored benefits to help workers make good  decisions that will serve them well in the future.   The bill increases access to retirement accounts, lowers the cost of  administering programs for small businesses, and provides incentives  for workers to voluntarily put money towards savings.   It also requires the Department of Labor to review existing reporting  and disclosure requirements, making them easier to comply with and  understand, updates the dollar threshold for automatic distributions by  plans to participants which was last updated in 1997.   It streamlines the collection of contributions to pooled employer  plans and updates benchmarking guidelines to accommodate different  investment products. The bill also adds tax incentives for small  businesses that offer employee stock ownership plans, a great tool and  benefit for employees to have a stake with their employer.   The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 set a foundation  for today's policies, but the measure needs to be updated to reflect  the 21st century workforce.   I urge my colleagues to support this important measure and look  forward to this legislation becoming law.
