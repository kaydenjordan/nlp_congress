 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained.  Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 174.                             Personal Explanation     Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act.   America has long been the standard of leadership, freedom, and  innovation. We do not allow other countries to take advantage of us.   While H.R. 9 has many issues, my opposition is founded in its attempt  to strip our President of his constitutional executive authority and  force us to remain locked in an agreement that hurts American  taxpayers.   After the Obama administration's international apology tour, it is a  refreshing change to have a strong hand at the wheel. I am glad to see  President Trump defending our exceptionalism instead of sacrificing our  economy for the sake of other countries.   My colleagues across the aisle would have us believe that we are  headed for doom within a decade, that Americans are behind the curve.  In reality, we lead the world in reducing greenhouse gas emissions,  while other countries are growing emissions; yet America is paying the  lion's share in the Paris Climate Accord.   American innovation and technological advancements are second to  none. These are the same qualities of American excellence that made us  the greatest country on this planet. We should not lower our standards  and allow other nations to take advantage of us.   This poorly negotiated deal will do nothing to address the growing  emissions from China and other industrial countries. It only hurts  American jobs, especially the energy industry that employs hundreds of  thousands of people in Oklahoma and brings high-paying jobs to my  district. These are people who are hurt by the continuation of the  Paris Climate accord.   I applaud President Trump's leadership on this issue and support his  authority to remove us from the Paris climate accord.
