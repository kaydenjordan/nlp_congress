 Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of Brad and  Jan Cundy, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming's 2022 honorees.   The Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming was established in 1969  to create a youth-friendly organization promoting character development  among young boys. Today, it is so much more. Both boys and girls now  develop character and leadership skills, athletic abilities, and a  healthy lifestyle. They are encouraged to expand their educational  aspirations through their local Boys and Girls Club.   The mission of the club is to ``inspire all youth, especially those  who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive,  responsible, and caring citizens.'' This organization would not be  possible without the thousands of adult mentors and volunteers who  dedicate their time, setting exceptional examples for youth every day.  Each year, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming honors one or  more individuals for their continued support and mentorship of  Wyoming's youth.   On the morning of September 14, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central  Wyoming will host their 24th Annual Awards and Recognition Breakfast in  Casper. They will honor Brad and Jan Cundy for their tireless  dedication to the youth of central Wyoming. Brad and Jan's exemplary  character and commitment to Wyoming's youth are remarkable. With this  award, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming affirms their  deepest gratitude for Brad and Jan Cundy and their continued work.   Born and raised in Wyoming, Brad and Jan established deep Wyoming  roots with their educational achievements at Casper College, business  pursuits in Gillette and Casper, and charitable statewide outreach.  Brad and Jan raised three children in Wyoming, Chad, Matthew, and Dawn,  and currently have five grandchildren, Braedyn, Blaine, Evelyn, Taylee,  and Treyson.   Brad and Jan's first business, Cundy Asphalt Paving Construction,  Inc., established in 1980, served the Gillette community for 21 years.  Brad and Jan did not stop there. In 2002, they embarked on a new  business adventure in Casper. They started Keyhole Technologies, Inc.,  a traffic control company still operating today.   Along with their successful business ventures, Brad and Jan engage in  volunteer work. Jan serves on the board of directors for the Boys and  Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming. In this role, she secures funding for  youth programs, helping create new opportunities for youth to develop  and enhance their skills.   Brad is a member of the Rotary Club of Casper, building mutually  beneficial relationships on behalf of the community. He also dedicates  his time to the Boys and Girls Club as a youth mentor.   In 2011, their son, Matthew, took his own life. In response, their  daughter, Dawn, created the Mattie Project, a nonprofit organization  focused on suicide prevention for young teens and adults. Brad and Jan  helped initiate the Wyoming Chapter for the American Foundation for  Suicide Prevention. The Cundy family remains dedicated to Wyoming's  focus on mental health. They wish to honor Matthew and to prevent  future deaths.   Brad and Jan received multiple accolades in response to their  resolute dedication to their businesses, community, and family. Jan was  nominated for the 2020 Wyoming Woman of Influence. Both Brad and Jan  received the Mick and Susie McMurry Cowboy Try Award in 2021. They  embody the Cowboy Code to the fullest.   On September 14, Brad and Jan Cundy will be recognized as the Boys  and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming's 2022 honorees. They are an  inspiration to the people of Wyoming.   It is with great honor that I recognize and celebrate this remarkable  couple. They are the epitome of the cowboy spirit and are notable  pillars of our community. They represent the best of Wyoming. My wife,  Bobbi, joins me in extending our congratulations to Brad and Jan Cundy  upon their selection for this special award.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Brad  Hopkins, recipient of the 2022 Mick and Susie McMurry Cowboy Code Try  Award.   Brad will receive the award in front of over a thousand attendees at  the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming's 24th Annual Awards and  Recognition Breakfast in Casper.   The Try Award recognizes people in our community who live the Cowboy  Code to its fullest. ``The Try'' is described as ``that special  characteristic which contributes to success in life--along with  perseverance, hard work, and loyalty. It's that quality within  [[Page S4436]]  oneself that allows a person to overcome obstacles with courage and  tenacity.'' It is a remarkable distinction.   Each year, a bronze sculpture crafted by acclaimed artist Chris  Navarro is given to the Try Award honoree. The sculpture is titled  ``Cowboy Code'' and depicts a cowboy on his horse, with the phrases,  ``Always Finish What You Start'' and ``Protect and Help The Weak''.   Brad Hopkins has served as executive director of the Wyoming Rescue  Mission since 2012. Born in Dallas, TX, Brad is an ordained minister  and earned his master of theology from the Dallas Theological Seminary.  He completed postgraduate studies at the University of Wisconsin and  the University of Colorado-Denver.   While in Colorado, Brad was a contributor to Denver's Road Home, the  Denver Commission to End Homelessness, and the Denver Mayor's Clergy  Council. He served as an advisor to the Colorado Governor's Interagency  Council on Homelessness.   Brad was a founding board member of the Wyoming Governor's Homeless  Collaborative. He is also a member of the Casper Homeless Collaborative  and a board member for the Emergency Food and Shelter Program.   Brad's spiritual leadership is as strong as his organizational  leadership. Under his direction, the Wyoming Rescue Mission raised  funds to triple their space to allow adequate housing for their guests.  Brad and the mission oversee the restoration work of 2,500 homeless  individuals and families. They serve 70,000 hot meals and 42,000 nights  of stay each year. Under Brad's leadership, the mission opened two  thrift stores, which provide revenue and job placement opportunities  for their guests.   Participants in their Discipleship Recovery Program progress through  a yearlong, Bible-based, addiction recovery model. This program offers  them an opportunity to transition to independent living as healthy,  productive men and women. Their program advancement and graduation  ceremonies are an inspirational experience.   Brad's passion and compassion for those less fortunate comes from a  shared experience with vulnerability. He described an early failed  career move that left him and his wife homeless for a time.  Consistently an example of the ``Try'' mentality, he continues to give  his time and talents to help others. He and his wife Christine have  been married for 29 years. They have lived in Casper since 2012.   Brad, like the Try Award's namesakes Mick and Susie McMurry,  epitomizes the Code of the West. The Cowboy Code teaches us to live  each day with courage and to take pride in our work. Brad's dedication  and spiritual guidance empower others to find their own courage,  leading them to a more fulfilled and productive life. Casper and  Wyoming are fortunate to have him as a member of our community.   It is with great honor that I recognize this outstanding member of  our Wyoming family. My wife, Bobbi, joins me in extending our  congratulations to Brad Hopkins upon his selection for this special  award.                            ____________________
