 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, throughout the Presidential campaign,  President Biden spoke often about the need to unify the country. He  talked about the need for people across our great Nation to come  together to empathize with one another and to mend the divisions that  exist in our society. He echoed that same theme in his inaugural  address, saying:         Without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury.       No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state       of chaos.    I agree with President Biden that there is an imperative to restore  unity and civility throughout our country, but for all of the talk of  uniting, compromising, and working together, the early pages of this  new chapter read quite differently.   For starters, there are the actions of our Democratic colleagues who  are trying to eliminate the legislative filibuster. They have echoed  and praised the President's call for unity and bipartisanship while  threatening to tear down the very rules that force us to work together  in a bipartisan way. We know that the filibuster, or the cloture  requirement that requires 60 votes to close off debate, is designed to  encourage a fulsome debate of the issues that confront 330 million  Americans. It is what distinguishes the Senate from other legislative  bodies. Unlike in the House of Representatives, where you need a simple  majority in order to work your will, the Senate requires 60 votes to be  in agreement in order to close off debate before a bill can be passed  with 51 votes or more. It really forces us to do what sometimes we  resist, which is to work together in a bipartisan way. The American  people may believe that it is in our best interest for us to pass  things on a partisan basis, but it is certainly not in their best  interest. So the cloture requirement, or the filibuster rule, is  designed to prevent either party from steamrolling the other, and that  is a good thing   The new majority leader, the Senator from New York, has threatened to  blow up the filibuster and clear a path for a sweeping, radical  agenda--this despite the fact that our Democratic friends have  themselves relied on the filibuster over the last 6 years as the  minority party and that President Biden himself, based on his 36 years  of experience in the U.S. Senate, has affirmed the importance of this  60-vote requirement. I am glad that two of our colleagues on the other  side of the aisle--one from West Virginia and one from Arizona--have  offered their assurances that they will not vote to end the legislative  filibuster, but I am disappointed that only two of our Democratic  colleagues have done that. This should not be controversial or  newsworthy to begin with. So far, the majority of Senate Democrats has  made no legitimate effort to pursue President Biden's call for unity or  bipartisanship.   Unfortunately, it is not just the actions of our Democratic  colleagues which have caused concern. President Biden himself has acted  unilaterally, time and again, by issuing a lengthy list of Executive  orders within hours of his inauguration. The policies that President  Biden is addressing in his Executive orders should be addressed here in  Congress with bipartisan legislation. One of those was a 100-day  moratorium on enforcing bipartisan immigration laws, which was enjoined  by a Federal judge in my State earlier today.   It would be better for the country if our Democratic colleagues tried  to legislate instead of litigate these Executive orders in court. I  think the experience with DACA, or the experience with the Deferred  Action for Childhood Arrivals, is instructive. President Obama, back in  2012, decided to take it upon himself to enact this new policy. It has  been tied up in the courts for the ensuing 8, now going on 9 years. I  support providing a permanent solution for DACA recipients, but it has  to be done here on a bipartisan basis, not just ordered unilaterally  from the Oval Office, or else we are going to see these bogged down in  lawsuit, after lawsuit, after lawsuit, which, I think, will be  satisfying to virtually no one.  [[Page S144]]    On top of the DACA Program, President Biden has now been piling on  additional immigration-related actions, and he is expected to issue  more in the coming days, but some of the most aggressive and  controversial moves we have seen so far have related to energy policy.  Within hours of the inauguration, President Biden canceled the permit  for the Keystone XL Pipeline.   There is no question that one of the biggest losers from that  decision is the energy worker who stood to benefit from the jobs being  created by the pipeline construction, and lest anybody think this is  going to stop the flow of oil from Canada to the United States, what is  going to happen--and what previously happened--is that oil will be  loaded into railroad car tankers and trucks and shipped to their  destinations. So it is not really stopping the oil from flowing where  it is needed for low-cost and reasonably cost energy. It is just  providing a more expensive and, indeed, a more dangerous alternative.  At a time when our energy industry is already suffering as a result of  the pandemic, this project would have led to a positive, cascading  economic impact. Good-paying jobs, tax revenues, and economic benefits  to local communities will evaporate because of this move.   I would note that, in the Rio Grande Valley, right along the U.S.  Texas border with Mexico, that President Trump performed surprisingly  well among Hispanic voters. People wrongly assume that Hispanic voters  only care about immigration laws. The truth is they care about jobs and  their families and their ability to pursue the American dream, which is  why they overperformed what they typically would and why President  Biden underperformed what he typically would in a largely Democratic  stronghold there in the Rio Grande Valley, but the buck doesn't stop  there.   The same day, the Biden administration halted all new leasing permits  on Federal lands and waters. Rather than harvest our natural resources,  which is one of the greatest benefits that nature has conferred on our  country, it appears the Biden administration is carrying out its  campaign to transition from oil and gas. I am all for transitioning to  cleaner forms of energy, but we have to deal with the reality--for  example, the fact that there are 280 million cars with internal  combustion engines on our roads. How are families going to get to work,  take their kids to school or live their lives if, all of a sudden, the  very natural resources they depend on for their cars is no longer  available?   This industry, according to one study, directly or indirectly  supports one in six jobs in my State and is a pillar of our State's  economy. Through higher tax revenue, high-paying jobs, and downstream  economic gains, communities across my State reap the benefits of our  thriving oil and gas industry every day. It is also what happens to  finance higher education in Texas from a dedicated, permanent  university fund. If, in fact, our ability to produce this oil and gas  from the ground is going to be curtailed, that is going to have  dramatic, unintended consequences, too.   This also makes sure that folks across the country who don't produce  this energy can get access to affordable and reliable energy. In  November of 2019, for the first time on record, the United States  exported more crude oil and fuel than we imported; that is, rather than  being dependent on other countries, we exported more than we imported.   Beyond the obvious economic benefits, this provides a serious boost  to our national security and that of our allies. There is a reason we  have been engaged in the Middle East for a long time. Ever since  Winston Churchill, as the Lord of the Navy in Britain, decided to move  from coal to oil to power the British Navy, we have been dependent on  sources of oil and gas primarily from the Middle East. So this has not  only economic consequences; it also has national security consequences.   It also allows us to provide our friends and allies around the world  with a dependable alternative. They no longer have to rely solely on  the tender mercies of Vladimir Putin, for example, for their energy  supplies, which can, obviously, be used as a weapon in and of itself.  All of these gains are possible because of the hard-working men and  women who work in the field and in the refineries in energy-producing  States like Texas.   While COVID-19 has had an impact on American energy producers because  demand has dropped precipitously, we don't expect that downtick to last  forever. Indeed, it is coming back already as the economy continues to  open up and now that more and more people are being vaccinated for  COVID-19. We have hope that, later this year, people will resume their  daily commutes to work; that the lights in their office buildings will  flicker back on; that nonessential travel will pick back up; and that  energy producers will be running at full speed once again.   Rather than laying the foundation for a strong recovery, the Biden  administration is issuing Executive orders that will harm American  energy and send more business to our international competitors.   And the administration is carrying out these changes without any  input from Congress.   I understand the President's desire to bolster renewable energy, and  I think he would find that if he explored energy policies with us in  Congress, he would meet more friends than foes.   I support the effort to drive down emissions, and, in fact, natural  gas that transitions from coal-fired powerplants to natural gas has  been a big driver of the progress we have made in doing just that. But  we shouldn't stop there. We need to continue to invest in new clean  energy technologies that will reduce emissions while providing low-cost  access to electricity that the American people need to live and to  work.   The United States' energy-related emissions dropped by almost 3  percent in 2019, largely due to the use of natural gas for power  generation.   But I am a strong supporter of renewable energy too. We truly, in my  State, believe in an ``all of the above'' energy policy. We are the No.  1 producer of electricity from wind turbines in the country. We produce  one-quarter of all wind energy in the United States, and if Texas were  a country, we would be the fifth largest wind energy producer in the  world.   But even the strongest supporters of renewable sources of energy can  tell you that, right now, renewables alone are not feasible to fuel our  economy. After all, there are some times when the Sun doesn't shine and  when the wind doesn't blow, so we need a backup or baseload source of  energy.   Last year, renewables accounted for less than 18 percent of our total  electricity generation, and I am all for having that number grow. For  comparison, natural gas, though, currently accounts for double that.   While the development and expansion of renewable sources like wind  energy are important, we can't shut out our key sources of energy that  we need today. We have been supporters of an ``all of the above''  energy strategy, like I said. My State, I think, is proof positive that  you can support the oil and gas energy that is so important for our  economy and for people's livelihoods; you can support renewables; and  you can support innovative technologies that lower emissions, all while  creating high-paying jobs and providing affordable and reliable energy.   I would like to work with the administration and our Democratic  colleagues in the Senate, as I have in the past, to enact lasting  policies and deliver reliable energy to the American people and our  friends and allies around the world while prioritizing conservation.   This is not the time to implement unilateral, heavyhanded,  shortsighted regulations. Our energy industry is still reeling from the  effects of the pandemic, and the administration and Congress need to  take action to support its recovery, not stand in its way.   I agree with President Biden's call for unity, and I hope that the  next 4 years will be filled with more bipartisan cooperation than the  first days of this new administration have been.   We have learned, time and time again, that the legislative process,  which forces us to work together in a consensus-building exercise is  far more durable--far better--than unilateral Executive actions. I  admit that both parties, when they are in the White House, have used  Executive actions, but, frankly, I would think as an institution, we  here in Congress would be  [[Page S145]]  leery of encouraging more Executive action. That means most of the  power here in Washington is exercised out of the White House and not  done here in the people's House, here in Congress.   I encourage the administration to lead by example and encourage all  of us to do the same--to try to work together for our shared priorities  and create real and lasting change for our country.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
