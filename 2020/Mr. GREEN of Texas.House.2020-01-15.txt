 And still I rise, Mr. Speaker, because I love my  country. I rise today to address the trial that will start in the  Senate, the trial to impeach the President of the United States of  America.   This trial, Mr. Speaker, will not end until the last person has  testified. In a sense it is like an opera, and, as you know, Mr.  Speaker, the opera isn't over until there is a song that is sung; and  until the last witness sings, the opera isn't over, this political  opera as it were.   There are witnesses who must be heard. I believe that there are 51  Senators who will find agreement with what I have said. I believe that  there are Senators who understand that when they take that oath, they  have to step outside of the normal rhetoric that they may have  espoused. I think they have to stand on the Constitution, and I think  the Constitution requires them to hear all of the relevant and material  evidence.   There are documents that should be heard. There are witnesses that  must be heard. I believe that the Senators will vote such that  documents and witnesses that have not been produced will be produced  and the witnesses will be heard.   I believe that this is one of the seminal moments in time for the  Members of the Senate, and I think they will understand that this is  not just about this time, it is about all time. It is about what  historians will say about this date, about the days that will follow.   It really is about who we are and what we stand for in the eyes of  the world. Because it is not just about the Members of the House  examining what is going on; the people of our country, and, indeed, the  people of the planet Earth are viewing this, and they are doing so with  great anticipation. They fully expect that the United States that has  been a champion for liberty and justice for all, the United States that  has the Statue of Liberty, the United States of America that stands for  freedom around the world, that the United States of America will live  up to its billing, will live up to what we have said, will live up to  what we have done in the past, and will allow all evidence to be  presented. I believe this.   I also believe that if all of the evidence is properly presented, no  one can say that there wasn't a fair trial. The verdict may not be  something that I would agree with, but there will have been a fair  trial. If you don't do this, then it is not a fair trial. It is just a  fake trial.   If you don't do this, there is no need to have the Chief Justice of  the Supreme Court present if all you are going to do is receive reports  from the House, that is just a briefing. You don't need the Chief  Justice of the Supreme Court there with all of the majesty of the  court. You don't need it.   I say have a trial, not a briefing. If we only have a briefing, this  will be justice delayed if not denied. There is a court of appeals and  that court of appeals will assemble in November of this year because  the Senate itself is on trial. The court of appeals in November will  make decisions as to whether or not the Senate has governed itself  under the Constitution and has presented itself such that it should  continue with its current makeup. The people of this country will have  the last word.                            ____________________
