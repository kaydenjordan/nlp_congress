 Mr. President, my colleague from Massachusetts has  referred to the tragedy that we all watched unfold late on Sunday  evening in Las Vegas, NV--the tragedy, the horror, the shock of so  many. Alaska has felt the brunt of that tragedy as well. We lost two  Alaskans; at least one other was injured. Mr. Adrian Murfitt from  Anchorage, a commercial fisherman, lost his life that evening. Dorene  Anderson, who is a mom and self-described hockey promoter, will not be  returning to Alaska with her family. Rob McIntosh, who is a realtor  [[Page S6275]]  from the Fairbanks-North Pole area, was also injured. Our prayers are  with him and with all of the families.   Whether they are from Alaska or from around the country, the tragedy,  the loss, is just a shocking emotion that has been brought to this  Nation. It is really horrifying on so many different levels. I express  my condolences not only to the families of the Alaskans whom we have  lost but to all of those who are suffering.
