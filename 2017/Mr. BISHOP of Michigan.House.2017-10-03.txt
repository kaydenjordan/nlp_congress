 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to  an incredible constituent in my district, Richard Thelen.   Seventy-two years ago, Mr. Thelen was aboard the USS Indianapolis  with nearly 1,200 others when it was hit by two Japanese torpedoes and  sank within a matter of minutes. He and 318 men of the crew survived 5  days in the ocean surrounded by sharks without any food or drinking  water. He defied truly remarkable odds.   After this ordeal, Mr. Thelen went on to finish high school and was  honorably discharged from the Navy. He was a truck driver for more than  40 years and raised six children. Today, he is 89 years young, and it  is a privilege to have him as a part of the Eighth District community.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform this body that I am prepared to  introduce legislation to honor Mr. Thelen of Lansing, Michigan, and the  rest of his shipmates, with the Congressional Gold Medal award.   As we remember the survivors of this terrible tragedy, those we lost,  and the recent finding of the ship itself, we thank you, Mr. Thelen,  for your valiant service to our country.                            ____________________
