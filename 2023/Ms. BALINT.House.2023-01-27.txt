 Mr. Speaker, over 65 million Americans rely on Social  Security benefits. They shouldn't have to choose between essentials  like medication, food, or housing. That is why it is our job to expand  and shore up Social Security and not gut it.   Cutting these programs hurts the poorest and most vulnerable among  us. We must support seniors to age with dignity. We must ensure that  Americans with disabilities receive the security they depend on. Social  Security is an essential tool that lifts up 9 million American women  out of poverty.   Two-thirds of my home State, Vermont, are middle-aged or older. We  need to expand the infrastructure and funding to fully support them in  their retirement. We owe them this.   I want Vermonters and all Americans to know I will not stop fighting  to protect their hard-earned benefits.                            ____________________
