 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Arizona and all those who have spoken, obviously, so emotionally and so  passionately about protecting the unborn.   Mr. Speaker, I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 36. I am a strong  believer in the sanctity of life. I believe each and every person, born  and unborn, is a child of God.   Our children are our future and a gift to all of us, and respecting  the right to life is one of the strongest values we hold as Americans.  That is why I come to the floor today to urge my colleagues to support  the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would stop late- term abortions.   Studies have shown that unborn children can feel pain in the womb 20  weeks after pregnancy, an agonizing fact with disturbing indications  that we know that this is a gruesome act against the unborn.   As a proud father of three, we know, when those babies come into this  world, that their cries are cries of joy; it is a cry of life. That is  what we are protecting. No child of God should be subjected to the  torturous pain that comes as a result of a late-term abortion.   Mr. Speaker, it is clear that my constituents sent me to Washington  to promote a culture and respect for life. They know as well as I do  that it is vital for us to fight for those who have no voice and cannot  be heard.   This bill shows the world that America will stand up to protect the  most vulnerable amongst us. I strongly urge my colleagues to support  the passage of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.   Let this Congress and the vote of each and every Member be known as  the one who stood up for life by speaking out against the horrors of  abortion.
