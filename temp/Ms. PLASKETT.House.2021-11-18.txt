 Mr. Speaker, with the Build Back Better Act, we are  investing in a strong economy, in jobs, and ensuring that children,  families, and all of our communities can compete and succeed equitably  in the 21st century.   This will tremendously benefit all districts, including districts  whose Members will not vote for the bill. No doubt many of them will  try to take credit for this as they stand against this transformative  investment in our economic future.   Build Back Better fights inflation because it is paid for and because  it helps working people return to work, increasing supply. Build Back  Better reduces the deficit, as we have seen from scoring that has been  released as we developed the package.   Americans overwhelmingly support Build Back Better because the  American people broadly agree we face an urgent choice between  Republicans who insist on keeping the economy that serves the  wealthiest and the biggest corporations or the Democrats who are giving  middle-class families a hand up at achieving the American Dream.   We have millionaires and billionaires paying lower tax rates than  teachers, cops, and firefighters.   Stop pretending you care about balancing the budget, the deficit, and  the middle class. We saw what you cared for in the 2017 tax grab.   Mr. Speaker, vote to build back better.
