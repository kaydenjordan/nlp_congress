 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding me this time and for his hard work on this issue as well.  [[Page H5375]]    Mr. Speaker, this is a very good bill. It is not something that was  cooked up overnight. This bill was introduced 6 months ago. It is based  upon legislation that has passed out of the Judiciary Committee in  previous Congresses, and some of it in this Congress. It is a good  effort to make sure that we are addressing all three aspects of  immigration law that need to be addressed.   It has a very good proposal with regard to the DACA recipients. They  get a legal status permanently for the rest of their lives, renewable  every 3 years, as long as they don't commit a crime. And that is a  statutory protection.   That is not something that is subject to court challenges. That is  not something that is subject to the whims of any President, past,  present, or future. It is something that allows them, then, to avail  themselves of existing pathways to citizenship, and it is something  that will allow them to work in the United States, live in the United  States, own a business in the United States, and travel in and out of  the United States.   I think it is a good first step in addressing this situation.   Secondly, the President has made it very clear, and people watching  the news coverage know, the difficulties that the administration--any  administration, this administration, the Obama administration, the Bush  administration before it--has with laws that need to be corrected to  make sure that loopholes are not followed at our border.   We have, now, a waiting list of 600,000 people applying for asylum.  Historically, asylum, which is a very good part of our immigration law,  has been granted to 5,000--some years, maybe as many as 10,000--people.   Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the great Soviet dissident, who wrote ``The  Gulag Archipelago,'' got political asylum in the United States. But  when everyone who is apprehended coming across the border illegally  trying to avoid detection, when they are apprehended then says, ``Oh, I  am here for political asylum,'' and you create a backlog 600,000 people  long and then they are released into the interior of the country and  don't return for their hearings in many, many, many instances, that is  a very flawed aspect of our immigration system. This bill addresses  that, as it does the problem with unaccompanied minors.   Children 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 years of age, mostly young boys, coming  across all of Mexico and then through the desert or across the Rio  Grande River and then thinking that this is an acceptable thing for  them to do to enter our country, they need to be returned safely home,  and the laws need to be reformed to accomplish that.   We need to reform many other aspects of our border security laws,  close these loopholes.   We need to have greater technology. We need to have, along some  segments of our border, improved wall technology. We have fences and  some walls already. The fences have big holes in them. People come with  chain cutters and cut holes through them in a matter of seconds and go  through them when it is foggy there in San Diego or other times when  they have that opportunity.    We need to have a more secure border both with technology and with a  wall in some places and with the necessary personnel to handle this,  including not just Border Patrol, but the judges and other officers who  are necessary to process people when they are apprehended. This is a  very serious problem, and it is addressed in this legislation.   We also need to move toward a merit-based immigration system.   We have, as the gentleman from Texas has repeatedly noted, the most  generous immigration policy in the world. We have tens of millions of  people who come to visit this country every year: some to work, some to  go to school, some to conduct business. For more than 75 different  categories of reasons they come here.   We also have more than a dozen immigrant visa categories that allow  people to come to the United States, and we give out, on average, about  1.1 million green cards a year to people who go through the process  lawfully. That is the most generous system in the world. We need to  recognize that as we do that, we have to move toward a system where we  are meeting the needs of American citizens, as well, as we do it.   Areas where we have shortages so that we can keep businesses in the  United States rather than having them move elsewhere in the world where  they can find the workers they need is an important part of this. So  eliminating things like the visa lottery, where we give 55,000 green  cards out for no good reason at all other than the pure luck that  people attain from that and instead use those to have a new system  where we have the opportunity to move towards a merit-based system,  which is not in this bill but should be the successor to this bill, is  an important thing to do.   I think that all of those measures are contained in this legislation.  I think it is very, very good legislation.   But this bill contains two important provisions that are not in the  second bill, and I want to particularly address those.                                time  1115    First, we have in this bill the E-Verify program. This is a program,  a very fine program, that exists today. More than 800,000 businesses  use it. Many large businesses use it. I would bet that probably a  majority of the people who process job applications today utilize it.  But it is certainly not utilized by everybody.   As a consequence, it is not being totally effective, because the  people who aren't using it either don't want to know whether somebody  is lawfully present in the United States, or they think they are  unlawfully present and don't want to have a system that uncovers that.   But this bill, applying prospectively only--you don't have to apply  it to your current employees--works 99.7 percent of the time. It is  very, very accurate. And most importantly, it has a safe harbor for  both the worker and the employer. So that if you get a false positive,  and if you are getting that three-tenths of a percent of the time--that  is still a significant number of people when you use the E-Verify  system--the new law actually gives them a way to work out the catch-22  situation that workers and employers find themselves in.   Because under the current law, we use the I-9 forms. Oftentimes,  someone will look at it and say: I am not sure these are genuine  documents. But if they refuse to hire the individual and it turns out  that they are genuine documents, they can be sued for discrimination.   And on the other hand, if they hire the worker and it turns out they  are unlawfully present, they can be prosecuted for hiring someone  unlawfully present in the United States.   And so the safe harbor says, you can go ahead and hire that person  until we work out whether it is a false positive or a false negative  without that consequence, and only until we know that, will you then  have to not employ that person. You will face no consequences in doing  that. That is good for the worker and it is good for the employer as  well.   When you do that--there is no doubt that there are sectors of our  economy where we have a lot of people who are not lawfully present in  the United States working. And by far, the number-one sector that is  affected by that is our agricultural workforce. There are some  estimates that as many as 80 or 90 percent of people working in  agriculture, beyond the actual family members who own a farm, are not  lawfully present in this country.   Some estimate that more than 1 million people who are working, are  not lawfully present in this country. Wouldn't it be great if we could  turn that workforce into legal workers where they have the opportunity  to go back and forth across the border, to go home to where their  family is without the fear of being apprehended and prosecuted?   That is what this bill does. It gives farmers a much more reliable  workforce. It gives them a much better program where they can self- certify, where the worker can come in for up to 2 years at a time. And  in the dairy industry where they have no program at all today, or in  processing plants, raw-food processing plants, they have no program at  all today, we have the ability to help those farmers.   This is an area of our economy that is very much affected by  international competition. It is exceedingly important that we pass  this legislation to  [[Page H5376]]  move immigration in the direction it needs to move, and this is an  enlightened way to do it. It is not a bad bill. It is a good bill for  the American people.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 954, I call  up the bill (H.R. 4760) to amend the immigration laws and the homeland  security laws, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4760.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.R. 4760, along with  Michael McCaul,  Martha McSally, and Raul Labrador, to provide an equitable and  permanent legal status for unlawful aliens who grew up in America after  their parents brought them here as children. Just as importantly, we  want to strengthen our borders, close gaping loopholes, curtail endemic  fraud, and enhance interior immigration enforcement so that our Nation  won't face the same dilemma in a few years.   President Trump did the right thing and tried to end President  Obama's blatantly unconstitutional DACA program. As a Federal court  ruled in enjoining DACA's sister program, DHS cannot ``enact a program  whereby it not only ignores the dictates of Congress, but actively acts  to thwart them. . . . The DHS Secretary is not just rewriting the laws;  he is creating them from scratch.'' President Trump also did the right  thing by immediately turning to us, asking Congress to fix the problem.   As he asked for, H.R. 4760 solves the DACA conundrum. It provides  DACA beneficiaries with an indefinitely renewable legal nonimmigrant  status allowing them to live and work in the United States without  worry and travel abroad as they choose. It also allows them to receive  green cards on the same terms as any other intending immigrant around  the world.   As I indicated, the bill will help ensure that the distressing DACA  dilemma does not recur. It ends catch and release at the border,  battles asylum fraud, and ensures that unaccompanied minors caught at  the border will be treated equally, regardless of their home country.  It will ensure that the law no longer tempts minors and their parents  to make the dangerous illicit journey to the United States and to line  the pockets of cancerous cartels with hundreds of millions of dollars.   The bill will also take away the other magnet that draws millions of  persons to come to the United States illegally: the jobs magnet.  Through the inclusion of Lamar Smith's Legal Workforce Act, it makes E- Verify mandatory. After two decades of constant improvement, E-Verify  has become an extremely effective, reliable, and easy way for employers  to ensure that they have hired a legal workforce. Three-quarters of a  million employers currently use E-Verify, which almost instantaneously  confirms the work eligibility of new hires 99 percent of the time.   The bill will also allow DHS to deport members of MS-13 and other  virulent criminal gangs and allow it to detain dangerous aliens who  cannot be removed. It will combat the public safety menace of sanctuary  cities in multiple ways, including by allowing the Justice Department  to withhold from them law enforcement grants.   The bill makes significant reforms to our legal immigration system.  It puts an end to extended family chain migration and terminates the  diversity visa green card lottery, which awards green cards at random  to people with no ties to the United States or any particular skills.   In addition, it replaces the dysfunctional H-2A agricultural  guestworker program. The H-2A program is slow, bureaucratic, and  frustrating, often forcing growers to leave crops to rot in the fields.  They also must pay an artificially inflated wage rate, along with  providing free housing and transportation. In doing the right thing, H- 2A users are almost always repaid by being placed at a competitive  disadvantage in the marketplace.   The bill provides growers with streamlined access to guestworkers  when sufficient American labor cannot be found. It finally provides  dairies and food processors with year-round labor needs with access to  a guestworker program. It avoids the pitfalls of the H-2A program, and  it will remain at its core a true guestworker program. As growers  learned the hard way after the 1986 amnesty, illegal farmworkers will  leave en mass and flock to the cities when provided with permanent  residence.   The Agricultural Guestworker Act contained in this bill is supported  by the American Farm Bureau Federation, the dairy industry, and over  200 distinct agricultural organizations from across the United States.   Following introduction of this legislation, I have sat down with my  colleagues for months to learn of any concerns and to strive to improve  the bill. The product of this intensive work is better legislation.  While I am disappointed that the rule did not allow me to include all  of the improvements made possible by the input of so many Members, I am  gratified that I could include the refinements to the H-2C agricultural  guestworker program.   To give just one example, the bill now clarifies that the Department  of Homeland Security will issue documents to unlawful alien farmworkers  who have been sponsored by growers to join the program, authorizing  them to return to the United States without the need for visas after  completing their initial touchbacks. This will create certainty for  growers, allowing them to receive pre-approval of their H-2C petitions  for current workers before they leave the country and precertification  of the workers' admission back into the United States before they  leave.   Congress has a unique opportunity to act before the country ends up  with another large population who crossed the border illegally as  children. Let's take this historic moment to come together and support  vital legislation that provides commonsense, reasonable solutions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join President Trump and support  H.R. 4760, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for the opportunity to       review the relevant provisions of the text of H.R. 4760, the       Securing America's Future Act of 2018. As you are aware, the       bill was primarily referred to the Committee on the       Judiciary, while the Agriculture Committee received an       additional referral.        I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this       legislation before the House in an expeditious manner.       Accordingly, I agree to discharge H.R. 4760 from further       consideration by the Committee on Agriculture. I do so with       the understanding that by discharging the bill, the Committee       on Agriculture does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       on this or similar matters. Further, the Committee on       Agriculture reserves the right to seek the appointment of       conferees, if it should become necessary.        I ask that you insert a copy of our exchange of letters       into the Congressional Record during consideration of this       measure on the House floor.        Thank you for your courtesy in this matter and I look       forward to continued cooperation between our respective       committees.            Sincerely,                                                K. Michael Conaway,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                      Washington, DC, June 20, 2018.      Hon. K. Michael Conaway,      Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Conaway: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on the Judiciary and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 4760, the ``Securing America's       Future Act of 2018,'' so that the bill may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your foregoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 4760 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                      Washington, DC, June 20, 2018.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: I write concerning H.R. 4760, the       ``Securing America's Future Act of 2018''. This legislation       includes matters that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of       the Committee on Homeland Security.        In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 4760, the       Committee on Homeland Security agrees to forgo action on this       bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual       understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill would       not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment       of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the       subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation       that fall within the Committee on Homeland Security's Rule X       jurisdiction. I request you urge the Speaker to name members       of the Committee to any conference committee named to       consider such provisions.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response into       the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure       on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this       matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                      Washington, DC, June 20, 2018.      Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on the Judiciary and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 4760, the ``Securing America's       Future Act of 2018,'' so that the bill may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your foregoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this bill or similar legislation in the future.

I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Smith), who is the author of an important provision in this  bill related to electronic verification of employment, and he is the  former chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.  [[Page H5425]]         Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume to respond to some of the false charges that we are hearing  here.   First of all, with regard to E-Verify, unfortunately, there is a  misconception that it is our intention to implement the new H-2C  program and mandate E-Verify for agriculture simultaneously. This could  not be further from the truth.   The AG Act, under that act, E-Verify would not be mandated for  agriculture until the H-2C is properly up and running and no sooner  than 24 months after enactment of the legislation. In addition, E- Verify will only apply to future hires.   Secondly, I want to respond to those who complain about what we are  doing for the DACA recipients in this legislation. I want to make it  very, very clear we are going to do something that is legal, something  that is constitutional for them instead of something that was illegal  and unconstitutional, and it is going to be superior in this bill to  what was done for them there, because they  [[Page H5426]]  will be allowed to remain in the United States permanently, renewing  every 3 years. They are only excluded if they do not meet certain  criteria.   The fact of the matter is we will have an opportunity for them to  avail themselves of existing pathways to citizenship. If they are  married to a United States citizen, as it would be logical that a great  many of these DACA recipients are because of the fact that they have  grown up here, they will be able to benefit from that. They could not  do that under the Obama executive order. So this is much better than  how the Democrats have treated the DACA recipients.   Lastly, whether the labor workforce status quo is sustainable for  American agriculture, under current law in California and other States,  farmers are facing chronic employee shortages. Last fall, the  California Farm Bureau announced the results of an informal survey of  its members. The survey showed that 69 percent of those surveyed were  experiencing labor shortfalls. Despite all the efforts California  farmers and ranchers have made to find and hire people to work on their  operations, they still can't find enough willing and qualified  employees.   California Farm Bureau President Paul Wenger said: ``Farmers have  offered higher wages, benefits, and more year-round jobs. They have  tried to mechanize operations where possible and have even changed  crops or left ground idle, but employee shortages persist.''   The labor force status quo is simply unsustainable for American  agriculture. Clearly, this is not a situation that is going to be  solved by granting permanent resident status to farmworkers. In fact,  that is the opposite of what is needed.   Granting permanent resident status to illegal farmworkers will not do  anything to ensure that farmers and ranchers have access to the labor  they need for years to come. It is shortsighted and does nothing to  relieve employers or legal farmworkers of the unnecessary burdens and  competitive disadvantage they face under the outdated H-2A program.   Americans' food can be grown in other countries where land and labor  are far cheaper. To ensure that our meat and produce continue to be  grown in America and that our Nation's agricultural industry thrives in  the global marketplace, the U.S. needs a flexible, workable, and fair  guest worker program like the H-2C program established in the AG Act  and contained in the legislation that we are debating right now.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is  remaining on each side.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Idaho (Mr. Labrador), the chairman of the Immigration and Border  Security Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Barton).    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, this bill has been mischaracterized and  was just again.   This bill makes provisions for when the immigration service  prosecutes somebody at the border. It doesn't tell them when to do  that. So it is entirely incorrect to make that assertion.   I see the conflicting news reports about what the intention of the  administration is today on that issue, but that does not change the  fact that that has nothing to do with the good measures in this bill  that correct the problems that we are speaking about.    The overwhelming majority of the American people want children to be  with their parents, and I have just seen a poll a few minutes ago that  shows that the overwhelming majority of them want those children  detained with their parents, not to have the parents and the children  released into the interior of the country where they never return for  their hearing.   That kind of open border policy that is supported by the advocates on  the other side of the aisle is not good for America, and it is not good  for sound immigration policy.   We are a nation of immigrants. There is not a person in this room who  can't go back a few generations or several generations and find someone  in their family who immigrated to the United States. But we are also a  nation of laws, and respect for the rule of law and following our legal  immigration system is the foundation of our society.   So, to me, when you say that it is not good enough to do better for  the DACA recipients than Barack Obama did, where do you get that idea  from?   When you say that we are not a generous country with regard to  immigration and that this is an anti-immigration bill when it sustains  far more legal immigration than any other country on Earth, they are  completely wrong.   But at the same time that we do that and we promote that in this  bill, good legal immigration policy and something fair for the DACA  recipients, we must also have secure borders in our country, and we  must give any administration, not just this one, the tools it needs to  close the loopholes to secure the border and to end crazy programs like  the visa lottery program that gives 55,000 green cards to people just  based on pure luck. There are better things to do with those green  cards to move to a merit-based immigration system.   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, reject  the negative ideas of the opposition, and move forward with a policy  that does both something important for the DACA recipients but also  secures America's national security interests and the interests of our  citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  motion to recommit.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this  effort to distract us from the major problems that we are attempting to  address in our country. This motion to recommit only--only--deals with  amnesty for a far larger population of people than the American people  expect to have addressed. The people who are the DACA recipients are  people who arrived here as young children before June 15, 2007.   This bill does nothing to solve the problem with the surge of people  at the border of our country. It does nothing to create a new border  security wall and fencing system, technology and personnel who are  needed, and judges in courtrooms to process the huge number--the  600,000 backlog--of amnesty cases that we have.   This does nothing to close the loopholes that are allowing people to  enjoy what is called catch and release. When they come into the  country, some of them even turn themselves in knowing that, ultimately,  they are going to be released into the interior of the United States.  We need to give the administration the tools they need to stop this  problem. It is not a new problem.   The Obama administration wanted a number of the changes that are in  this bill with regard to clarifying things like the terrible Flores  decision, which is at the heart of the problem we have with young  children being separated from their parents.   We fix those things in this legislation, and yet this would  substitute all of that for something that is just targeted at what the  other party wants to do. And they call upon us to work in a bipartisan  fashion.   This bill addresses all of the areas that need to be addressed, and  they give lip service to the other areas, but they do not address them.  This is proof of that by the fact that it only deals with amnesty.   We need to have a movement to a merit-based immigration system. We  need to end the terrible visa lottery system, which is a national  security problem and which is something that does not benefit the  American economy.   We need to move from chain migration to a merit-based system, and we  need to make sure that we treat the DACA recipients better than they  are treated under the unconstitutional, illegal Obama process, but not  at the cost of not doing the other three pillars that we are seeking to  address.   We need to address border security and interior enforcement; we need  to end the visa lottery and move to a merit-based system; and we need  to end chain migration.   It also doesn't have anything about E-Verify or helping 1 million  agricultural guest workers who want to work in this country legally and  the farmers who want to have a system that allows them to do that  legally.   This is the bill that we need to pass, not this motion to recommit. I  urge my colleague to oppose the motion to recommit and support the  underlying legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 953, I  call up the bill (H.R. 6136) to amend the immigration laws and provide  for border security, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 6136.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker,  Michael McCaul, Carlos Curbelo, Jeff Denham, and I  introduced H.R. 6136 to be a consensus bill designed to bring Members  together. It is the product of fruitful negotiations and will offer us  a path forward toward true immigration reform.   As with the Securing America's Future Act, this bill provides a  legislative resolution of DACA, which was imposed through an  unconstitutional abuse of executive power by President Obama. But in  addition to a renewable legal status, this bill expands relief to those  who were eligible for DACA but never applied. Many did not apply  because they thought that DACA was simply unconstitutional.   H.R. 6136 also creates a merit-based green card program that the  recipients of the bill's contingent nonimmigrant status can apply for.  This program is the first-ever point system based on education,  vocational training, apprenticeship, employment experience, English  proficiency, and military service under U.S. immigration law.   Aliens with similar life experiences to DACA recipients can also  apply: those who were brought to the United States as minors by parents  on temporary work visas and grew up in the United States. All other  DACA legislation that I am aware of discriminates against such persons  simply because they and their parents haven't violated our laws.   To be clear, there is no special path to citizenship for DACA  recipients or DACA-eligible individuals.   Importantly, this bill will help ensure that the DACA dilemma does  not recur after a few short years. As with H.R. 4760, it will end  ``catch and release,'' battle asylum fraud, and require that  unaccompanied minors caught at the border be treated equally,  regardless of their home country. As with H.R. 4760, it will ensure  that the law no longer tempts minors and their parents to make the  dangerous, illegal journey to the United States or to line the pockets  of cartels.   We must turn off the irresistible ``jobs magnet,'' if we are ever to  effectively deal with illegal immigration. While expansion of the  hugely successful E-Verify program is not contained in H.R. 6136, I am  pleased that the leadership has committed to bringing such legislation  to the floor this summer.   As with H.R. 4760, the bill will make it easier to deport gang  members who are aggravated felons, or who have multiple DUIs.   H.R. 6136 modernizes our legal immigration system. It will reduce  extended family chain migration and terminate the diversity visa  program, which awards green cards by random lottery to people with no  ties to the United States. It reduces overall immigration numbers over  the long term, and shifts to a first-in-line visa system by eliminating  the per-country cap on employment-based green cards. The bill begins a  shift to a merit-based system by establishing the new merit-based green  card program that I described.  [[Page H5482]]    As with H.R. 4760, the bill corrects the disastrous Flores settlement  to ensure that minors apprehended at the border with their parents are  not separated from their parents when the parents are placed in DHS  custody. Importantly, H.R. 6136 addresses family separation in light of  the zero-tolerance prosecution initiative by mandating that DHS, not  DOJ, maintain the custody of aliens charged with illegal entry along  with their children. This would only apply to those who enter the  country with children and would not permit those charged with felonies,  or any other criminal activity, to be detained along with children. The  bill allocates funding for family detention space to facilitate this  requirement.   Congress has a unique opportunity to act now, before the country ends  up with another large population who crossed the border illegally as  children. Let's take this historic moment to come together and support  vital legislation that provides commonsense, reasonable solutions.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join President Trump and  support this important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my  time.                                          House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Agriculture,                                      Washington, DC, June 20, 2018.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for the opportunity to       review the relevant provisions of the text of H.R. 6136, the       Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2018. As you       are aware, the bill was primarily referred to the Committee       on the Judiciary, while the Agriculture Committee received an       additional referral.        I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this       legislation before the House in an expeditious manner.       Accordingly, I agree to discharge H.R. 6136 from further       consideration by the Committee on Agriculture. I do so with       the understanding that by discharging the bill, the Committee       on Agriculture does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       on this or similar matters. Further, the Committee on       Agriculture reserves the right to seek the appointment of       conferees, if it should become necessary.        I ask that you insert a copy of our exchange of letters       into the Congressional Record during consideration of this       measure on the House floor.        Thank you for your courtesy in this matter and I look       forward to continued cooperation between our respective       committees.            Sincerely,                                                K. Michael Conaway,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                      Washington, DC, June 20, 2018.      Hon. K. Michael Conaway,      Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Conaway: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on the Judiciary and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 6136, the ``Border Security and       Immigration Reform Act of 2018,'' so that the bill may       proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your foregoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 6136 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                      Washington, DC, June 20, 2018.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: I write concerning H.R. 6136, the       ``Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2018''. This       legislation includes matters that fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security.        In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 6136, the       Committee on Homeland Security agrees to forgo action on this       bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual       understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill would       not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment       of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the       subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation       that fall within the Committee on Homeland Security's Rule X       jurisdiction. I request you urge the Speaker to name members       of the Committee to any conference committee named to       consider such provisions.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response into       the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure       on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this       matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                      Washington, DC, June 20, 2018.      Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on the Judiciary and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 6136, the ``Border Security and       Immigration Reform Act of 2018,'' so that the bill may       proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your foregoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 6136 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,                                                          Chairman.                                time  1830     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Georgia (Mrs. Handel), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I just want to say there are complaints that this is  not a bipartisan bill, and yet we addressed the issues that Democrats  expressed concern about.  [[Page H5484]]    We have a very good way to address the DACA population in this  legislation, and yet when we look to the other side for help with  securing our border, with taking the current fencing--and if you have  ever been along that border, particularly in San Diego where they have  a very high fence, but all it is is a fence. You can take a saw, an  electric saw and cut through that in a matter of seconds and be on the  other side. But where is the help for addressing those kind of security  measures? I don't see it.    We have addressed in this legislation the family separation issue in  a very good way. We agree: families should be unified. If it is simply  a matter of a misdemeanor charge that the parents are facing, we want  the children to be detained with them. But where is the help that we  get from the other side in terms of addressing problems like catch-and- release; problems like asylum fraud; problems like unaccompanied minor  status, where we have a disparity between how we handle unaccompanied  minors coming across the border from Canada or Mexico who are Canadian  or Mexican, but if they have come from somewhere else in the world  through Canada or Mexico, we can't treat them the same way. All of  those things are addressed in this bill.   We are addressing the concerns of the American people on how to  address immigration reform through the four pillars: making sure we do  something appropriate for the DACA population, including opportunities,  not for a special pathway to citizenship, but to ultimately attain  citizenship if they earn it; and we are also addressing the other three  categories, border security and closing the loopholes in our laws,  ending the visa lottery and moving to a merit-based immigration system,  and moving towards a family-based immigration system that is the  nuclear family, your spouse and your children, not extended family  members.                                time  1845    I don't see anything addressing most of that coming from any  legislation from the Democrats, and I certainly would welcome seeing  their proposals on what they would do for a wall and fencing and other  security measures along our border. I would be very interested in  seeing what they do to help us move from an overwhelmingly family-based  immigration system to one that is a merit-based system.   Countries like Canada and the United Kingdom and Australia, they give  their immigrants visas in 50, 60, 70 percent of their cases based upon  education, job skills, job offers, training. We are at 12 percent. That  is unacceptable.   This bill moves us in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to  support it, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Flores).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is  remaining on each side.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                            Parliamentary Inquiry     If the gentlemen will yield, I don't control the floor  schedule so I can't answer the question as to the timing of when the  gentleman's opportunity to offer a motion to recommit, which the rules  provide for, will be afforded to him. I don't know the answer to that.    If the gentleman will yield, again, I don't control  the floor, and I don't have any direct advice on when that will take  place.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of closing on our side, I  yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Curbelo).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1915
