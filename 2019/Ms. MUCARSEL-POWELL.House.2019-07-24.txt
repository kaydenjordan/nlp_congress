 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill  which incorporates the Coast Guard Shore Infrastructure Improvement Act  that I introduced with Representative Garret Graves of Louisiana. It  directs the Commandant of the Coast Guard to tackle the maintenance  backlog of its shore infrastructure.   The Coast Guard currently has a $2.6 billion project backlog, and 25  percent of its assets have exceeded their service lives.   We must rebuild our Coast Guard in a strategic way, one that accounts  for stronger storms that will only worsen with climate change.   This bill will ensure that the Coast Guard has the processes in place  to carry out crucial shore infrastructure repairs. Coasties often spend  their personal time working on infrastructure improvements. It is  unacceptable that they have to sacrifice their rest time and family  time to repair crumbling buildings.   Passing this bill will ensure America's security, the success of our  Coast Guard, and the well-being of our servicemembers.
