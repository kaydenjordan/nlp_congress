 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the House for  passing the Pandemic is Over Act, the Freedom For Health Care Workers  Act, the SHOW UP Act, and for ending the national emergency.   I was in the New York State Assembly when the COVID vaccine mandate  was passed, and I argued vociferously against it. Even then we knew it  would cause irreparable damage to our healthcare facilities, forcing  thousands of healthcare workers out of their jobs, and we were right.  That is why it is so important for Congress to take this step and right  that wrong.   Another refrain I hear over and over again from my constituents is  that we need to end the national emergency declaration. We get calls  every day in my office from small business owners, teachers,  carpenters, and other constituents who simply don't understand why we  haven't fully reopened our State and country.   COVID cases have dropped dramatically across the country, and the  number of cases today compared to the same date last year are down over  600,000 cases. The fact is that this no longer constitutes a national  emergency, and we should absolutely end the declaration.    Mr. Speaker, I urge the Senate to pass these important pieces of  legislation and encourage the administration to accelerate their  timeline on this important matter.                            ____________________
