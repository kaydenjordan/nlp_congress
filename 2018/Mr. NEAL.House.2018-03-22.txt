 Mr. Speaker, the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to  H.R. 1625, showing the text of the Consolidated Appropriations Act,  2018, before the House for debate today includes tax provisions,  including technical corrections to tax legislation enacted prior to  2017. These tax technical corrections are important to provide clarity  to taxpayers and to the administration of the law. As Ways and Means  Committee Chairman and Ranking Member, Kevin Brady and I asked the  staff of the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation to make available  to the public a technical explanation of the tax provisions of this  legislation. The technical explanation expresses the Committee's  understanding and legislative intent behind the tax provisions of this  legislation. It is available on the Joint Committee's website at  www.jct.gov. It is document JCX-6-18, Technical Explanation of the  Revenue Provisions of the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to  H.R. 1625 (Rules Committee Print 115-66).
