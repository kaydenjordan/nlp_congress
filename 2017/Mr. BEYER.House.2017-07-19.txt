 Mr. Chairman, I am proud to co-lead this amendment with my  colleagues, Ms. Tsongas and Mr. McGovern.   FERC, as it is currently structured, is not adequately protecting our  most valued public lands designed for recreation and conservation, and  this bill will only make this particular mismanagement worse. We are  witnessing this firsthand in my Virginia.   At stake is one of our Nation's treasured landscapes, the Appalachian  National Scenic Trail, the A.T., and the surrounding national parkland  and national forestlands. The A.T. was congressionally dedicated as a  national scenic trail nearly 50 years ago, and it is one of the most  significant land features in the Eastern United States. It is famous  around the world.   Its cultural heritage, its recreational options, its natural  resources all serve crucial roles in the lives and communities of the  Appalachian region, but it is at risk.   The proposed Mountain Valley Pipeline route impacts 19 prominent  views over nearly 100 miles of the Appalachian Trail. Tinker Cliffs,  the Dragon's Tooth, even the totally iconic McAfee Knob all will be  corrupted by this pipeline.   I am not anti-pipeline. I am not anti-energy. I am an avid  Appalachian Trail hiker. I have crossed almost all of the 60 pipeline  crossings that exist on the trail. But the Mountain Valley's proposal  route doesn't take the least impactful route. It doesn't cross the  trail. It runs alongside it for almost 100 miles.                                time  1515    You will be able to see the impact day after day after day. It  doesn't sound like the developers thought about minimizing their impact  on this important cultural icon.   It has also become clear that the proposed route would require an  amendment to the Jefferson National Forest management plan, which was  carefully constructed and well balanced.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and protect  one of America's most treasured natural places.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, it is a great honor to come after this  bipartisan discussion between Mr. Lynch and Mr. Upton. I hope a  precedent has been set, Mr. Chairman.   I offered this amendment to improve the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission's public comment period and transparency process.  [[Page H6010]]    This amendment would require FERC to issue a supplemental  environmental impact statement if there is critical new information  relevant to a pipeline proposal, and to require mitigation plans for  adverse impacts if not already provided.   The case of the Mountain Valley Pipeline demonstrated how the current  FERC process has failed us and why this amendment is necessary.   I recently wrote a letter to FERC on this very issue, asking that  they initiate a supplemental environmental impact statement before  moving forward with the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience  and Necessity.   Quite simply, the process was flawed.   In response to a September 2016 draft environmental impact statement,  Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC, had to present more information and an  updated route for the pipeline proposal to FERC. Originally, Mr.  Chairman, they offered 1,000 pages of updates for public comment, but  then their updates extended beyond the public comment period, which  ended in December 2016, and included thousands of additional pages of  crucially important information--20,000 pages of crucially important  information. Think about how long it would take to read 20,000 pages.   What is most egregious is that, because this document dump came after  the public comment period had ended, affected stakeholders weren't able  to offer their comments for FERC consideration. They had already closed  the public comment period, but the pipeline company was still  submitting thousands of pages.   Even more ridiculous, the developers have continued to add more  documents, even after FERC issued the final environmental impact  statement. So apparently it wasn't final in the eyes of the developers.   For many, FERC's recent decision to issue this final statement for  the proposed Mountain Valley Pipeline is patently alarming.   The appropriate course would be to issue a supplemental environmental  impact statement and allow for public comment on those 20,000 pages.   Let's fix this woefully incompetent process.   Local communities affected most by proposed energy infrastructure  projects naturally have concerns regarding the projects near them.   On my extensive visits to southwest Virginia last summer, there were  two kinds of signs everywhere, Mr. Chairman. There were ``Make America  Great Again, Donald Trump for President,'' and there were ``No Mountain  Valley Pipeline.''   They deserve the opportunity to express their views fully and to  participate in a robust public engagement process, especially for  projects which will use eminent domain to seize their private land from  homeowners and farmers.   If there are major changes offered after the public comment period is  open, let's make sure the public has the ability to weigh in with their  proposals.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I very much agree with the lead sponsor of the bill, Mr. Upton, that  we don't want any more uncertainty, and we certainly don't want more  delays.   In fact, this amendment was originally in a bipartisan bill sponsored  by my Republican friend from Virginia, Morgan Griffith. I literally  lifted it word for word.   What we want to do is make sure that all of the information is on the  table at the beginning. It is just not fair to the people who are  affected by a pipeline that an environmental impact statement is issued  and they wouldn't have a chance to comment on it.   So let's make sure that the developers are putting all of the  information out first. And if they put it out and the public comment  period closes and then they give you the rest of the information, then,  clearly, FERC has made the decision without all that, and the public  has been cheated out of the ability to comment on what is going to  happen to their land and to their homes. It is just not fair.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this good, bipartisan amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
