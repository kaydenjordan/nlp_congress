 I had a discussion with Ambassador Bolton both       after the meeting in his office, a very brief one, and then       one immediately afterward, the subsequent meeting.         Well, I just want to highlight, first of all,       that Ambassador Bolton wanted  [[Page S391]]       me to hold back in the room immediately after the meeting.       Again, I was sitting on the sofa with a colleague--         Yes, but he was making a very strong point that       he wanted to know exactly what was being said. And when I       came back and related it to him, he had some very specific       instruction for me. And I'm presuming that that's--         The specific instruction was that I had to go to       the lawyers--to John Eisenberg, the senior counsel for the       National Security Council, to basically say: You tell       Eisenberg Ambassador Bolton told me that I am not part of       this--whatever drug deal that Mulvaney and Sondland are       cooking up.         I took it to mean investigations for a meeting.         I certainly did.         I relayed it, precisely, and then more of the       details of how the meeting had unfolded, as well, which I       gave a full description of this in my October 14 deposition.    Ms. Manager LOFGREN. There was something wrong going on here, and  White House officials were told repeatedly: Go tell the lawyers about  it--Dr. Hill, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, and Mr. Morrison, who  reported to Mr. Eisenberg at least two conversations. We need the notes  of those documents to find out what was said. Again, attorney-client  privilege cannot shield information about misconduct from the  impeachment trial of the President of the United States.   It is interesting. This amendment is supported by 200 years of  precedent. It is needed to prevent the President from continuing to  hide the evidence, and that is why the specific documents requested are  so important for this case. It is faithful to the Constitution's  provision that the Senate shall have the sole power to try all  impeachments.   The final point I will make today concerns urgency. The Senate should  act on this subpoena now, at the outset of the trial. In 14 of the  Senate's 15 full impeachment trials, threshold evidentiary matters,  including the timing, nature, and scope of witness testimony, and the  gathering of all relevant documents, were addressed at the very outset  of the trial. There are practical considerations as to why the  subpoenas need to be issued now. Resolving whether a subpoena should  issue now would let us immediately engage with the White House to  resolve asserted legitimate privilege issues, if any exist, and ensure  you get the documents as soon as possible so they can be presented to  the Senators in advance of witness testimony. Waiting to resolve these  threshold matters until after the parties have presented their case  would undercut the process of a genuine credible trial.   Thus, common sense, tradition, and fairness all compel that the  amendment should be adopted, and it should be adopted now.   Members of the Senate, for all of the reasons I have walked through  today, I urge you to support the amendment to issue a subpoena for  White House documents--documents that are directly relevant to  evaluating the President's scheme.   The House did its job. In the face of the President's obstruction and  categorical commitment to hide the evidence, we still gathered direct  evidence of his conduct and determined that his conduct required  impeachment.   The President complains about due process in the House investigation.  But he was not only permitted to participate; he was actually required  to participate. Yet he refused to do so. He refused to provide  witnesses and documents that would tell his side of the story. So now  it is up to you.   With the backing of a subpoena, authorized by the Chief Justice of  the United States, you can end President Trump's obstruction. If the  Senate fails to take this step, if it will not even ask for this  evidence, this trial and your verdict will be questioned.   Congress and the American people deserve the full truth. There is no  plausible reason why anyone wouldn't want to hear all of the available  evidence about the President's conduct.   It is up to this body to make sure that happens. It is up to you to  decide whether the Senate will affirm its sole power and constitutional  duty to try impeachments and whether and when it will get the evidence  that it needs to render a fair verdict. Don't surrender to the  President's stonewalling. It will allow the President to be above the  law and deprive the American people of truth in the process.   A fair trial is essential in every way. It is important for the  President, who hopes to be exonerated, not merely acquitted by a trial  seen as unfair. It is important for the Senate, whose vital role is to  continue to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,  which has preserved our American liberty for centuries. And, finally,  it is important for the American people, who expect a quest for truth,  fairness, and justice.   History is watching, and the House managers urge that you support the  amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Cipollone.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief Justice, Patrick Philbin will  present our opposition.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Very well.   Mr. Philbin.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Thank you.   Mr. Chief Justice, Majority Leader McConnell, Democratic Leader  Schumer, and Senators, it is remarkable that after taking the action of  the breathtaking gravity of voting to impeach the duly elected  President of the United States and after saying for weeks that they had  overwhelming evidence to support their case, the first thing that the  House managers have done upon arriving, finally, at this Chamber, after  waiting for 33 days, is to say: Well, actually, we need more evidence.  We are not ready to present our case. We need to have subpoenas, and we  need to do more discovery because we don't have the evidence we need to  support our case.   This is stunning. It is a stunning admission of the inadequate and  broken process that the House Democrats ran in this impeachment inquiry  that failed to compile a record to support their charges. It is  stunning that they don't have the evidence they need to present their  case and that they don't really have a case.   If a litigant showed up in any court in this country on the day of  trial and said to the judge, ``Actually, Your Honor, we are not ready  to go; we need more discovery; we need to do some more subpoenas; we  need to do some more work,'' they would be thrown out of court, and the  lawyers would probably be sanctioned. This is not the sort of  proceeding that this body should condone.   We have just heard that this is so important. Let's consider what is  really at issue in the resolution here and the amendment. It is a  matter of timing. It is a matter of when this body will consider  whether there should be witnesses or subpoenas for documents.   Why is it that the House managers are so afraid to have to present  their case? Remember, they have had weeks of a process that they  entirely controlled. They had 17 witnesses who testified first in  secret and then in public. They have compiled a record with thousands  of pages of reports, and they are apparently afraid to just make a  presentation based on the record that they compiled and then have you  decide whether there is any ``there'' there--whether there is anything  worth trying to talk to more witnesses about.   Why is it that they can't wait a few days to make their presentation  on everything they have been preparing for weeks and then have that  issue considered? It is because they don't think there is any ``there''  there, and they want to ram this through now. They want to ram this  through now when it is something that they, themselves, failed to do.   I want to unpack a couple of aspects of what they are asking this  body to do. Part of it relates to the broken process in the House and  how that process was inadequate and invalid and compiled an inaccurate  record, and part of it has to do with what accepting their request to  have this body do their job for them would do to this institution going  forward and how it would forever alter the relationship between the  House and the Senate in impeachment proceedings.   First, as to the process in the House. What the House managers are  asking this body to do now is to really do  [[Page S392]]  their job for them because they didn't take the measures to pursue  these documents in the House proceedings. There have been a number of  statements made that they tried to get the documents and no executive  privilege was asserted, and things like that.   Let's look at what actually happened.   They issued a subpoena to the White House, and the White House  explained. And we were told a few minutes ago that the White House  provided no response, provided no rationale. That is not true. In a  letter of October 18, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone explained in  three pages of legal argument why that subpoena was invalid. That  subpoena was invalid because it was issued without authorization.   We have heard a lot today about how the Constitution assigns the sole  power of impeachment to the House. That is right. That is what article  I, section 2, says, that it assigns the sole power of impeachment to  the House, not to any Member of the House. And no committee of the  House can exercise that authority to issue subpoenas until it has been  delegated that authority by a vote of the House. There was no vote from  the House. Instead, Speaker Pelosi held a press conference, and she  purported, by holding a press conference on September 24, to delegate  the authority of the House to Manager Schiff and several other  committees and have them issue subpoenas. All of those subpoenas were  invalid. That was explained to the House, to Manager Schiff, and the  other chairmen of the committees at the time in that October 18 letter.    Did the House take any steps to remedy that? Did they try to dispute  that? Did they go to court? Did they do anything to resolve that  problem? No, because, as we know, all that they wanted to do was issue  a subpoena and move on. They just wanted to get through the impeachment  process as quickly as possible and get it done before Christmas. That  was their goal. So those subpoenas were unauthorized.   Now, what about some of the other things they brought up: the  witnesses, the witnesses who were directed not to testify. In part on  this, we have heard Manager Schiff say several times that the White  House never asserted executive privilege. Well, let me be clear on  that. That is a lawyer's trick because it is technically true that the  White House didn't assert executive privilege because there is a  particular situation in which you do that and a particular way that you  do that.   There is another doctrine of immunity of senior advisers to the  President that is based on the same principles as executive privilege,  and that has been asserted by Presidents of both political parties  since the 1970s at least.   This is what one Attorney General explained about that: `` . . . the  immunity such advisers enjoy from testimonial compulsion by a  congressional committee is absolute and may not be overborne by  competing congressional interests.''   That was Attorney General Janet Reno in the Clinton administration  explaining that senior advisers to the President are immune from  congressional compulsion. That doctrine, that immunity, is rooted in  the same principles of executive privilege that has been asserted by  all Presidents since the 1970s, and that was the basis on which a  number of these advisers whose pictures they put up were directed not  to testify.   Did they try to challenge that inquiry? Did they go to court on that  one? Did they try to go through the constitutionally mandated  accommodations process to see if there was a way to come up with some  aspect of testimony to be provided? No, none of that. They just wanted  to forge ahead, rush through the process, not have the evidence, and  then use that as another charge in their charging sheet for the  impeachment, calling it obstruction of Congress.   And what that is, as Professor Turley explained, is this idea that,  when there is a conflict between the executive branch and the House in  seeking information and the President is asserting constitutionally  based privileges, that is part of the operation of separation of  powers. That is the President's constitutional duty to defend the  prerogatives of the office for the future occupants of that office. It  is not something that can be charged as an impeachable offense, as the  House Democrats have tried to say here. To do that is an abuse of  power. That is what Professor Turley explained. It is Congress's--it is  the House Democrats' abuse of power.   We just heard Manager Lofgren refer to executive privilege as a  distraction. She was asserting that these issues of executive privilege  are just a distraction that shouldn't hold things up. This is what the  Supreme Court has said about executive privilege in Nixon v. United  States; that the protections for confidentiality and executive  privilege are ``fundamental to the operations of government and  inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the  Constitution.''   Inextricably rooted in the separation of powers. That is why it is  the President's duty to defend executive branch confidentiality and  interests, and that is what the President was doing here.   Now, the process they pursued in the House abandoned any effort  beyond issuing the first subpoena that was invalid to work out an  accommodation with the White House and, instead, just tried to rush  ahead to have the impeachment done by Christmas. What does that lead to  now? They are coming to this body after a process that was half-baked,  that didn't compile records sufficient to support their charges, and  asking this body to do their job for them.   Now, as Leader McConnell pointed out in some comments earlier today,  to allow that, to accept the idea that the House can bring in an  impeachment here that is not adequately supported, that has not been  investigated, that has not got a record to support it, and turn this  body into the investigatory body would permanently alter the  relationship between the House and the Senate in impeachment  proceedings. It is not the role of the Senate to have to do the House's  job for them. It is not the role of the Senate to be doing an  investigation and to be doing discovery in a matter like the  impeachment of a President of the United States. If the House has not  done the investigation and cannot support its case, it is not the time,  once it arrives here, to start doing all that work. That is something  that is the House's role.   So this is something that is important for this institution, I  believe, not to allow the House to turn it into a situation where this  body would have to be doing the House's work for it. If there is not  evidence to support the case, if they haven't done their investigation,  then they are not going to be able to support their case.   Again, what is at issue here--and I think it is important to recall-- on the issue of this amendment, is not whether the Senate, whether this  body, will be considering whether there should be witnesses or not but  when that should be considered. There is no reason not to take the  approach that was done in the Clinton impeachment. One hundred Senators  agreed then that it made sense to hear from both sides before making  determination on that, to hear from both sides to see what sort of case  the House could present and the President's defense.   That makes sense. In every trial system there is a mechanism for  determining whether the parties have actually presented a triable  issue, whether there is really some ``there'' there that requires the  further proceedings. This body should take that commonsense approach  and hear what it is that the House managers have to say.   Why are they afraid to present their case? They had weeks in a  process that they controlled to compile their record, and they should  be able to make that presentation now.   The one point that I will close on is we heard Manager Schiff say  several times that we have to have a fair process here. I was struck by  it that at one point he said, if you allow only one side to present  evidence, the outcome will be predetermined. The outcome will be  predetermined.   That is exactly what happened in the House. Let's recall that the  process they had in the House was one-sided. They locked the President  and his lawyers out. There was no due process for the President. They  started in secret hearings in the basement. The President couldn't be  present or, by his counsel, he couldn't present evidence. He couldn't  cross-examine the witnesses. Then there was a second round in public  where, again, they locked the President out.  [[Page S393]]    We have heard--and they just said that the President had an  opportunity to participate in the third round of hearings that they  held before the Judiciary Committee. After one hearing on December 4,  Speaker Pelosi, on the morning of December 5, went out and announced  the conclusion of the Judiciary Committee proceedings. She announced  that she was directing Chairman Nadler to draft Articles of  Impeachment. That was before the day they had set for the President to  even tell them what rights he wanted to have and to exercise in their  proceedings.   It was all already predetermined. The outcome had been predetermined.  The Judiciary Committee had already decided it was not going to have  any fact hearings. There was no process for the President. He was never  allowed to participate.   So when Chairman Schiff says here that, if you only allow one side to  present evidence, that predetermines the outcome, that is what they did  in the House because they had a predetermined outcome there, because it  was all one-sided. For him to lecture this body now on what a fair  process would be takes some gall. A fair process would be, when you  come to the day of trial, be ready to start the trial and present your  case and not ask for more discovery.   The President is ready to proceed. The House managers should be ready  to proceed.   This amendment should be rejected. Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The House managers have 8 minutes remaining.   Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief Justice, the House is certainly not  asking the Senate to do the House's job. We are asking the Senate to do  its job, to hold the trial. Have you ever heard of a trial that doesn't  have evidence, that doesn't have witnesses? That is what this amendment  is all about.   Just a moment about the subpoenas. The President--President Trump-- refused to provide any information to the House, ordered all of his  people to stonewall us. Now, it has been suggested that we should spend  2 or 3 years litigating that question. I was a young law student-- actually working on the Nixon impeachment--many years ago, and I  remember the day the Supreme Court issued its unanimous decision that  the President had to release the tapes. I think United States v. Nixon  still governs the President. The House and the Senate should not be  required to litigate United States v. Nixon back in the Supreme Court  and down again for it to be good law. It is good law. The President has  not complied with those requirements, to the detriment of the truth.   This isn't about helping the House. This isn't about helping the  Senate. This is about getting to the truth and making sure that  impartial justice is done and that the American people are satisfied  that a fair trial has been held.   Mr. Chief Justice, I would yield now to my colleague Mr. Schiff.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Philbin says that the  House is not ready to present its case. Of course, that is not  something you heard from any of the managers. We are ready.   The House calls John Bolton. The House calls John Bolton. The House  calls Mick Mulvaney. Let's get this trial started, shall we? We are  ready to present our case. We are ready to call our witnesses. The  question is, Will you let us? That is the question before us.   Mr. Philbin says: Well, if I showed up in court and said I wasn't  ready, the judge would throw me out of the court. Of course, we are not  saying we aren't ready. You know what would happen if Mr. Philbin went  into a court and the judge said: I have made a deal with the defendant.  I am not going to let the prosecutor call any witnesses. I am not going  to let the prosecutor present any documents.   You know who would get thrown out of court? The judge. The judge  would be taken out in handcuffs.   So let's step out of this body for a moment and imagine what a real  trial would look like. It would begin with the government receiving  documents, being able to introduce documents, and being able to call  witnesses. This trial should be no different.   Mr. Philbin makes reference to the Cipollone letter on October 18,  which followed a Cipollone eight-page letter on October 8, saying: We  are not going to do anything you ask.   Part law, part diatribe. Mostly diatribe. You should read it. It is a  letter, basically, that says what the President said on that TV screen,  which is we are going to fight all subpoenas.   The doctrine of absolute immunity that counsel refers to has, yes,  been invoked or at least attempted by Presidents of both parties and  rejected uniformly by the courts, including the most recent decision  involving Don McGahn, the President's former White House Counsel, where  the court said: That would make him a King. He is no King, and this  trial has determined that he shall not become a King, accountable to no  one, answerable to no one.   What is more, this idea of absolute immunity, this fever dream of  Presidents of both parties, it has no application to documents. Again,  this amendment is on documents. There is no absolute immunity from  providing documents.   As Representative Lofgren illustrated, when this case has gone to the  Supreme Court, in the Nixon case, the Court held that the interest and  confidentiality in an impeachment proceeding must give way to the  interests of the truth and the Senate and the American people.   You cannot invoke privilege to protect wrongdoing. You cannot invoke  privilege to protect evidence of a constitutional crime like we have  here.   Finally, with respect to those secret hearings that counsel keeps  referring to, those secret depositions in the House were so secret that  only 100 Members of Congress were able to be there and participate-- only 100. That is how secret that Chamber was.   Imagine that, in the grand jury proceedings in the Clinton  investigation or in the Jaworski and the Nixon investigation--imagine  inviting 50 or 100 Members of Congress to sit in on those. Imagine, as  the President would like here, apparently, the President insisting on  having his lawyer in the grand jury because it was a case being  investigated against him.   We had no grand jury here. Why is that? Why did we have no grand jury  here? Why was there no special prosecutor here? Because the Justice  Department said they are not going to look into this. Bill Barr's  Justice Department said there is nothing to see here. If it were up to  that Justice Department, you wouldn't know anything about this. That is  why there was no grand jury. That is why we, and the House, had to do  the investigative work ourselves, and, yes, just like in the Nixon  case, just like in the Clinton case, we used depositions.   Do you know what deposition rules we used, those terribly unfair  deposition rules we used? They were written by the Republicans. We used  the same rules that the GOP House Members used. That is how terribly  unfair they were.   My gosh, they used our rules. How dare they? How dare they?   Why do we do depositions? Because we didn't want one witness to hear  what another witness was saying so they could either tailor their  stories or know they just had to admit so much and no more. It is how  every credible investigation works.   Counsel can repeat all they like that the President didn't have a  chance to participate, didn't have a chance to have counsel present in  the Judiciary Committee or to offer evidence. They can say it as much  as they like, but it does not make it any more true when they make the  same false representations time and again. It makes it that much more  deliberate and onerous.   The President could have presented evidence in the Judiciary  Committee. He chose not to. There is a reason for that. There is a  reason why the witnesses they have talked about aren't material  witnesses. They don't go to the question of whether the President  withheld the aid for this corrupt purpose. They don't go to any of  that, because they have no witnesses to absolve the President on the  facts.   You should want to see these documents. You should want to see them.  You should want to know what these private emails and text messages  have to say. If you are going to make a guess about the President's  guilt or innocence, if you are going to make a decision about whether  he should be removed from office, you should want to see what these  documents say.  [[Page S394]]    If you don't care, if you have made up your mind--he is the President  of my party or, for whatever reason, I am not interested, and what is  more, I don't really want the country to see this--that is a totally  different matter, but that is not what your oath requires. It is not  what your oath requires. The oath requires you to do impartial justice,  which means to see the evidence--to see the evidence. That is all we  are asking. Just don't blind yourself to the evidence.   I yield back.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                               Motion to Table     The specific instruction was that I had to go to       the lawyers--to John Eisenberg, the senior counsel for the       National Security Council, to basically say: You tell       Eisenberg Ambassador Bolton told me that I am not part of       this--whatever drug deal that Mulvaney and Sondland are       cooking up.         I took it to mean investigations for a meeting.         I certainly did.    Mr. Manager NADLER. These statements of events are reason enough to  insist that Ambassador Bolton testify. He can explain the misconduct  that caused him to characterize the Ukraine scheme as a drug deal and  why he directed his subordinates to report their concerns to a legal  counsel. He can tell us everything else he knows about how Ambassador  Sondland, Mr. Mulvaney, and others were attempting to press the  Ukrainians to do President Trump's political bidding. Once more, only  Ambassador Bolton can tell us what he was thinking and what he knew as  this scheme developed. That is why the President fears his testimony.  That is why some Members of this body fear his testimony.   Ambassador Bolton's involvement was not limited to a few isolated  events; he was a witness at key moments in the course of the Ukraine  scheme, especially in July, August, and September of last year. I would  like to walk through some of these events. Please remember, as I am  describing them, that this is not the entire universe of issues to  which Ambassador Bolton could testify; they are only examples that show  why he is such an important witness and why the President is desperate  to block his testimony.   We know from Ambassador Bolton's attorney that there may be other  meetings and conversations that have not yet come to our attention. To  take one example, we know from witness testimony that Ambassador Bolton  repeatedly expressed concerns about the involvement of President  Trump's personal lawyer, Mr. Giuliani.   In the spring and summer of 2019, Ambassador Bolton caught wind of  Mr. Giuliani's involvement in Ukraine and soon began to express  concerns. Ambassador Bolton expressed strong concerns about Mr.  Giuliani's involvement in Ukraine matters.   When Ambassador Bolton described Mr. Giuliani as ``a hand grenade  that was going to blow everybody up,'' it was based on his fear that  Mr. Giuliani's work on behalf of the President, his attempts to have  Ukraine announce these investigations--these sham investigations--and  his campaign to smear Ambassador Yovanovitch would ultimately backfire  and cause lasting damage to the President. It turns out he was right.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          He did, yes.
