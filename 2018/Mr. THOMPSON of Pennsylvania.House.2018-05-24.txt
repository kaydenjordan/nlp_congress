 Mr. Speaker, this weekend our Nation  marks one of the most solemn occasions, Memorial Day. It is a time when  we honor the sacrifices made by our fallen military members.   Tomorrow marks the American Legion National Poppy Day. Each year  members of the American Legion distribute poppy flowers with the  request that those receiving a flower making a donation to support our  veterans, active servicemembers, and military families.   At the end of the First World War, the poppy flourished throughout  Europe because of the lime in the rubble left over from the war. The  red poppy is a nationally recognized symbol of sacrifice that has been  worn by Americans since World War I to honor those who served and died  for our country in all wars. It reminds Americans of the sacrifices  made by our veterans while protecting our freedoms.   Mr. Speaker, I will proudly wear a poppy tomorrow to honor our fallen  servicemembers, and it is my hope that all Americans will do the same.                            ____________________
