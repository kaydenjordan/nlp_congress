 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jillian  Larrabee from Durham High School in northern California for winning the  giant slalom race during the California-Nevada Interscholastic Ski and  Snowboard Federation championships.   As a resident of Durham, Jillian lived on her family's farm during  the week and drove to Lake Tahoe on the weekends to train and pursue  her dream of professional skiing.   Her high school never had a ski and snowboard team, so Jillian  petitioned the Durham Unified School Board in hopes of bringing a team  to her school. Earlier this year, the board approved her request for  the 2020 season.   Jillian was the lone competitor to make the championship from Durham  High during their inaugural year. She finished her first run in 1  minute and 13 seconds and then narrowed that time by clocking a run of  1 minute and 9.6 seconds, which finished a full second faster than the  second-place skier in the giant slalom.   As a result of her outstanding performance, Jillian was named to the  all-State team, the only member from the Butte County area.   From hard work and persistence comes great success for her and her  school. Congratulations, Jillian.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Budd for yielding and for  working on this issue even though he is not from a State that has as  much of it as California.   Indeed, I have seen so much happen to my population at home that many  are giving up for a host of reasons, but this is one right near the top  of the list for leaving our State, to go to others that don't have  sanctuary cities or sanctuary State policies.   If you go back in time, what really was at the front of this issue  that put it on a lot of people's radar around the country was the Kate  Steinle tragedy that happened in San Francisco. An illegal immigrant  was here, having been deported many times over, and still had this  opportunity for whatever the circumstances that took the life of Kate  Steinle.   Time and time again, in my home State, people are fed up. I had a  chance to sit down with some members of ICE here the other day. They  are just trying to do their job. They are just trying to uphold the  law.   Indeed, what some of my colleagues have talked about here this  evening is that we have people actually causing the law to be broken  that are elected officials--people that swore an oath to the  Constitution, to the laws of this country, and to my home State--now  causing one of the worst things: an increase of crime you can see in  California.                                time  1700    The exodus from California comes from the root cause of things like  not only the high cost of doing business but the crime wave that is  hitting California, and that is rooted in this sanctuary city, illegal  immigration, and the things that they cause to make our communities  less safe.   So, at this point, I am proud to be able to join in this bill that  Mr. Budd is bringing.   We need to have sanctions against States and cities and, as Mr.  Steube talked about, hold accountable the public officials that are  causing their own cities, their own jurisdictions, to be defying the  law.   How are we supposed to teach our kids or anybody that the law has  value when we have people making it a contest to see how much they can  defy the Trump administration and the law itself?   Madam Speaker, I appreciate this time tonight and Mr. Budd's effort  on this.
