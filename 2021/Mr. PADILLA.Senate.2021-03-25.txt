 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the life  of Ms. Marlene Bane.   Marlene answered the highest calling of dedication to her country,  her State, and her local community. Along with her husband, Assemblyman  Tom Bane, she carved out a unique niche in State government through a  blend of intelligence, soft-spoken charm, organization, and, most of  all, dear friends and  [[Page S1811]]  relatives. She spent a lifetime engaged in political consulting and  nonprofit projects such as lupus research and the Jewish Home for the  Aging.   Marlene worked tirelessly to improve California and serve those most  in need. She was also well known and loved throughout L.A.'s Jewish  community for her civic activism and support for Israel.   Marlene was renowned for mentoring an amazing number of our political  leaders on how to serve constituents with honor and commitment. Up to  the last week of her life, she threw herself into the cause of  supporting candidates. She believed in the commandment of Tikkun Olam,  that she must leave the world better than she found it. It is  undeniable that she left those who knew her better off for having known  her.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to include in the  Record the following obituary for Mr. Antonio Gonzalez, written by his  children.   The material follows:         Beloved Antonio Gonzalez made his transition the night of       December 30, 2020. Born in Calera in the state of Zacatecas,       Mexico on March 30, 1964, he was the eldest of four children       born to Antonio Gonzalez and Antonia Del Villar. The Gonzalez       family spent their early years living with Antonio's maternal       grandparents in a small town in Calera. Antonio shared fond       memories of times spent on his grandparent's abundant ranch.       He described what seemed to him an endless landscape of       rolling hills, trees, livestock and horses (his favorite).        Hard times fell on the young family around the time Antonio       turned eight. A sudden regime change resulted in his dad       losing his job, forcing them to set their sights ``north'' in       search for work and a better life. Their trek north ended in       what was (at the time) a small dusty town just south of the       California border. It was there, in Tecate, BC where he and       his three siblings, Antonio (Tony Chico), Margarita and Maria       de la Luz were raised and attended school. But, with a lack       of good paying jobs, times remained tough in Tecate. Antonio       recalled working odd-end jobs throughout his childhood and       adolescence; a shoe shiner, sweeper--anything to help ensure       that there was food on the table.        As a young adult, Antonio set his sights on completing the       journey north--to the U.S. In 1971, shortly after marrying       Florentina ``Nina'' Herrera, he made his way to Los Angeles.       They settled in the San Fernando Valley--a sleepy suburb of       LA at the height of rock and roll, disco, and bell bottoms.        Antonio worked just about anywhere where hard work was       needed--maintenance work at a convalescent hospital,       landscaping, you name it. But his fate would change when he       landed a job at a large construction company. I'm not sure       what it was about ``construction'' that he loved. Perhaps it       was the job stability or the early start to the day where he       could greet the sunrise on his drive into downtown. Or maybe       it was the art of building--the satisfaction of erecting a       structure where only a plot of land existed--a tangible       outcome only accomplished by hard work and sweat. Over the       years, he had become somewhat of an infrastructure historian,       recalling with such clarity the buildings he helped build and       rehabilitate in the San Fernando Valley, Downtown LA, Santa       Monica, and Malibu.        He dedicated most of his life to erecting buildings and       homes, whether for work or building homes for his family both       in the San Fernando Valley and in Tecate, BC. Antonio built       his family home, simple and unpretentious yet on a solid       foundation with strong bones. In fact, as time would prove,       there's nowhere else his family would prefer to be in an       earthquake but under the protection of those strong beams       hammered together with pride and affection. Even in his       retirement years, Antonio never stopped building.        Antonio was a great provider for his family. Through his       hard work and dedication, he showed his children that the       true American dream could be achieved--of buying a home,       raising a family and ensuring a better future for the next       generation.        He is survived by his wife, ``Nina'', son David, daughter       Maria Ines and son-in-law Jose, daughter Sandra and son-in       law James, son Cristian and grandchildren Javier, Sienna and       Julian. Siblings Antonio, Margarita and Maria de la Luz and       many loving cousins, nieces and nephews. He was preceded in       death by his father Antonio Gonzalez and mother, Antonia       Gonzalez Del Villar.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to recognize the life of  Mr. Joe Lozano.   Joe ``Pinoy'' Lozano was born on December 26, 1934, in Pacoima, CA,  as one of 10 children. Joe had every job you can imagine. He shined  shoes and worked in the fields as a young boy. He joined the U.S.  Marine Corp in 1954 and served during the Korean war as an infantryman.   After the service, he married the love of his life, Virginia. They  were married for 60 years and had 6 children, 21 grandchildren, 26  great-grandchildren, and 1 great-great-grandchild.   Joe was a community-oriented person. After his family, his community  came first. He painted over graffiti, he helped beautify the streets,  and he even mowed the grass on the center divider of his street when  the city was too busy to do it.   Joe worked as a prop maker for the studios for many years. He had  tons of stories, and he loved his job. He retired, went back to work,  and only stopped again to care for his wife when she became ill.   Since 2004, Joe worked with the annual San Fernando Valley Veterans  Day Parade organizing committee so that Veterans could be honored on  Veterans Day.   He will be missed by many.                            ____________________
