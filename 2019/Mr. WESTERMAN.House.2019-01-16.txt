 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about a fundamental  human right, a right declared to be an inalienable right by our  Founders who proclaimed we are all created equal and have the God-given  right to live--to live freely and to pursue happiness.   Our Founding Fathers carefully articulated that life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness are the human rights that encompass the  American way and are the logical foundation for freedom.                                time  1115    Unfortunately, it seems that Planned Parenthood has a logic problem.  The CEO of Planned Parenthood tweeted just last week that the  organization's ``core mission is providing, protecting, and expanding  access to abortion and reproductive healthcare.'' And she called the  procedure of an abortion a ``fundamental human right.''   Mr. Speaker, abortion is not a human right. Abortion, to the  contrary, is death. Abortion is the antithesis of life, the fundamental  human right.   For years, we have been fed the same argument that Planned Parenthood  operates to ensure women's health and prenatal care, but straight from  their CEO, we know this is not the truth. Planned Parenthood's mission  is abortion. Planned Parenthood's mission is death, and their actions  prove it.   Planned Parenthood ended the fundamental right to life through  321,384 abortions in 2016. That is 881 abortive deaths per day. This  means that every 98 seconds a life was extinguished by Planned  Parenthood.   The CEO said in the same tweet that the organization ``will never  back down from that fight'' to not only expand access to abortion but  to deem it a human right.   Mr. Speaker, as freedom-loving Americans, we must stand on our core  principles that all are created equal, and we cannot back down from the  fight to preserve life and to protect those who can't protect  themselves.   I look forward to continuing work to ensure that our taxpayer dollars  do not fund death and abortion, a procedure that denies the right to  live and contradicts the core founding principles of our freedom and  our Nation.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I would like to first thank my colleague  from California, Representative Panetta, for his cosponsorship of this  bipartisan amendment. I also would like to thank Representative  McCollum from Minnesota for her support of this amendment.   Madam Chair, this amendment simply adds $10 million to the State and  private forestry fund. The purpose of this is to prevent some of these  catastrophic wildfires that we have been seeing over the past few  years.   What we have here is a map that shows what the Forest Service has  delineated as a wildland-urban interface. This is where forestry and  urban areas intersect, and this is where we have potential for  significant loss of property and lives.   There are already programs in place to manage these wildland-urban  interfaces, and what we hope to do with this additional appropriation  is just to help the State forestry units manage these areas better.   We talk a lot in Congress about Federal lands and how we need to  manage those, but across the country, over half of all forestland is  owned by private forest landowners. There are literally millions of  these private forest landowners, many of them on very small parcels of  forestland, and they have no incentive to manage them to help stop the  spread of catastrophic wildfire.   What the State and private forestry program does is allows State  foresters to go in and help these private landowners to understand how  to manage their forests and give them the assistance they need so that  we can make these wildland-urban interfaces safer places.   Madam Chair, if we managed everything perfectly on the Federal lands  and these wildland-urban interfaces, you still have the issue of all  the private lands. The map shows wildland-urban interfaces in places  you would expect out in California and other Western States, but  because of the population density, we see a lot of these wildland-urban  interfaces are in the East where there is more dense populations.   So these funds, although rather small in relation to this huge bill-- as a matter of fact, they make up only eight one-hundredths of 1  percent of the total funds in this bill--would have a huge impact all  across the country in making our communities more resilient to  catastrophic wildfire, would really help to save property and lives in  the future, and would also save a lot of future disaster supplemental  funding that the Federal Government would have to dish out.   So, again, I am just asking for this amendment to help State and  private forests with a $10 million plus-up to their funds.   Madam Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Panetta).    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta).    Madam Chair, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman  from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, this bill, again, would help State and  private forests. It would help to reduce the risk of catastrophic  wildfires. It is sound environmentally, and it is a good investment for  the Federal Government.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
