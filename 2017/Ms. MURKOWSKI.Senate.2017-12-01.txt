 Mr. President, I strongly oppose this motion to  strike. This is our opportunity to provide jobs, to create revenues and  resources, and to protect an environment that as Alaskans we know how  to protect. We are seeking with this energy title to develop 2,000  acres out of 19.3 million acres, one ten-thousandths of all of ANWR,  and we are seeking to do it with a smaller, limited footprint, using  the technologies that have become available over the decades that we  have been seeking to advance these opportunities--opportunities for  Alaska, opportunities for the Nation.   I would implore colleagues. For 40 years now we have been looking for  the opportunity to best protect our long-term energy and national  security. This is our chance.    The pending amendment No. 1717 would cause the underlying legislation  to exceed the Energy and Natural Resources Committee's section 302(a)  allocation of new budget authority or outlays. Therefore, I raise a  point of order against this measure pursuant to section 302(f) of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
