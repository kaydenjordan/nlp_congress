 Madam President, after more than 25 years of  service--first as an officer, then as executive director of the  Louisville Metro Police Foundation, LMPF--Tracie Shifflett has  announced that she will retire from the foundation in September.   The LMPF is an independent, private nonprofit organization, the only  organization authorized to raise funds on behalf of the Louisville  Metro Police Department. LMPF supports special community programs to  strengthen relationships between police and the communities they serve,  purchase equipment and training programs, and grants for the Officers  in Distress Program.   Shifflett took on leadership of the LMPF in 2016 after retiring from  the Louisville Metro Police Department as a lieutenant over the  training academy. The rank of lieutenant is the highest achievable rank  on your merit within the department.   ``I always felt our officers were like my kids,'' Shifflett said. ``I  felt like my work with the Foundation was a way I could truly help  them.''   During her tenure as its leader, the foundation has grown from less  than $700,000 in total assets to $2.4 million. Tracie dealt with many  challenges and faced all of them with grace, love, and a great sense of  humor. She has put her own life on hold many times to be there for  ``her'' officers, the board, and the Louisville community. She has  repeatedly set new records for fundraising at the LMPF's annual event  by sharing the unvarnished truth of what officers face every day while  serving. Her passion both while serving on LMPD and for the LMPF was to  make sure ``her babies'' were taken care of, that they felt loved, and  had the support needed to continue to make a difference every day.   ``I'm especially proud that we have been able to positively impact at  least 50 officer families each year that have faced injury, medical  diagnosis, or other critical needs,'' Shifflett said. ``Since 2016, we  have granted $1.7 million to officer families who are facing life- altering difficulty.''   Some of the foundation's key accomplishments under Shifflett's  leadership include training programs, purchasing equipment, and the  Officers in Distress Program.   Tracie has partnered with many officers and helped to strengthen  their bonds in the community with programs like Shop with a Cop, Gang  Resistance, and Education Training. The department has also helped  build and provide bedding to 100 kids in the community, purchased new  bleachers for the California Community Center, and launched the Help Us  Give fund. She also secured funding for seven mounted patrol horses,  purchased nine K-9s for patrol work and narcotics detection, some of  which went on to win the National K-9 Olympics Competition, and  obtained K-9 trauma kits and K-9 protective vests for all LMPD K-9s. In  her last few weeks with the foundation, she secured two Kid ID Kits for  LMPD to use in the community.   Jim Ellis, chairman of the Louisville Metro Police Foundation, said  the following about Tracie in her evaluation:   ``Tracie has become the go-to person for many members of LMPD when  they have a gripe, concern, or problem. I believe that is a great  demonstration of the trust the officers have in our Foundation and our  Executive Director. Tracie receives inquiries from other Foundations  around the county on how we implement and apply checks and balances to  each of our grants. Tracie maintains confidentiality with sensitive and  life-altering data and information that comes into the Foundation. This  confidentiality helps protect the safety of the LMPD and the  Foundation's board members. Tracie is unique in that she is a former  police officer and understands what the men and women of the LMPD want  and need to make Louisville safer. She lets them know what is possible  to achieve and what may be beyond the Board's ability to obtain or  provide. She hates to deny any request, but if it is denied, she works  to solve the problem. Tracie has become somewhat of a parental figure  for many members of LMPD.''   Almost every targeted foundation project was obtained under her  leadership. One of the things that Tracie was proud to have  accomplished during her tenure at the foundation is securing funding  for high-velocity bulletproof vests for every LMPD officer, which  recently saved the life of an officer. Another highlight of her career  was receiving her master's degree in education.   She is incredibly proud of her close family: her mother, Judy, her  late father, Benjamin, her son, Ben, her daughter, Alex, and her  husband, John, a retired police officer.   I am proud to salute Tracie for her dedicated career in making our  community a safer place to live.                            ____________________
