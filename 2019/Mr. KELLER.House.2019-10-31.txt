 Madam Speaker, last week I joined several dozen of my  colleagues at the SCIF in protest of the secret impeachment inquiry.   Seventy-five percent of the elected Members of Congress have been  shut out of this impeachment inquest. This whole inquiry is a sham led  by the Speaker of this House and her impeachment czar, the chairman of  the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.   Their attempt today to try and open these proceedings is nothing  short of Soviet glasnost--a fake transparency that only leads to less  participation, more secrecy, and less due process.   Madam Speaker, this is too little too late. You can't unring the bell  on this sham process that is your high watermark in seeking to undo the  2016 election at all costs.   Case in point: while saying there will be a resolution to try and  bring transparency to these proceedings, this inquiry has continued to  take depositions in secret. Democrats in this Chamber have been acting  like bank robbers after they have tripped an alarm and they are trying  to shove as much money in the bag as they can before the police get  there.  [[Page H8705]]    We demand due process.                            ____________________
