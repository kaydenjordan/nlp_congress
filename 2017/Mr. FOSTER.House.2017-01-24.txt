 Madam Speaker, this weekend we saw millions of Americans  march in cities and towns across the country and around the world--far  more than attended the inauguration the day before.   I joined the march in Chicago, where one of the most visible concerns  was women's reproductive freedom. Today, House Republicans, roughly 90  percent of them White males, responded by showing the women of America  exactly how little they respect those rights.   Madam Speaker, a party that lost the popular vote by almost 3 million  votes does not have a mandate to deny women the right to make their own  healthcare decisions.   Perhaps I should remind my Republican colleagues that unless you are  their doctor, they don't need your opinion. Women in the Federal  workforce, low-income women, women in the military, women employed by  small businesses are all perfectly capable of having a conversation  with their doctor about their health.   So I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the bill and ``no'' to  disrespecting the women of America.
