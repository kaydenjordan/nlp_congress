 Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my support for  H.R. 6865, this year's Coast Guard Authorization Act, which is named in  honor of our departed colleague, Mr. Don Young, who tirelessly  advocated for the Coast Guard and maritime issues in his many decades  of public service.   With his legacy in mind, I wish to express my thanks for the  leadership of Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Sam Graves, and  Subcommittee Ranking Member   Bob Gibbs that created this bipartisan  agreement.   H.R. 6865 will renew and enhance support for the critical missions of  the United States Coast Guard. Every day Coasties work to protect our  national security and enforce the laws in the maritime environment.   They maintain our Nation's waterways for the sake of commerce, save  lives, and protect the oceans from pollution. These brave  servicemembers have time and time again demonstrated their  resourcefulness, but they need our support today.   The increased authorizations in today's bill signals our confidence  in the excellence of the Coast Guard and starts down the road to  providing the resources Coasties need to successfully complete their  missions.   H.R. 6865 also tackles current challenges to our Nation's supply  chain which have recently caused frustration in not only the  transportation industry, but in the average families who are being  confronted with shortages and increasing costs for basic household  goods.   H.R. 6865 reauthorizes the Federal Maritime Commission, the entity in  charge of promoting fairness and competition in ocean shipping.   And it includes the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2021 which would  provide the Federal Maritime Commission with the authority to directly  address international shipping's contribution to the inflation we are  experiencing.                                time  1530    As chairman of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation  Subcommittee, I am proud that this bill also includes my legislation to  amend an archaic 171-year-old maritime law that prevented victims and  their families from seeking fair recourse against vessel owners who  were found to be liable for maritime incidents. This provision was  developed in response to the Conception dive boat fire in my district  in 2019, which was the largest loss of life in a U.S. marine casualty  in decades.   Finally, with this bill, we can make significant strides toward  stamping out sexual assault and sexual harassment from the maritime  industry. Provisions in H.R. 6865 strengthen transparency surrounding  companies' sexual assault and sexual harassment policies, provide  protections for mariners, and remove bad actors from the industry. Such  criminal behavior and incidents have no place in the maritime industry.   I am proud to have worked with my colleagues on this important  legislation, and I look forward to ensuring that it becomes law.
