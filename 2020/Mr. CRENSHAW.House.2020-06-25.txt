 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this bill,  which is unfortunate because it doesn't have to be this way. There is  actually a lot of agreement on much of this bill.   Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised when I read it, and if we voted  on this section by section, I believe there are some areas where there  would be an overwhelming bipartisan majority for some necessary and  crucial reforms. There are other parts where, if we just worked  together and made some changes, we would likely get to yes on a lot of  these. But as it stands now, it doesn't directly defund the police, but  it certainly will result in less policing.   Needless to say, that hurts the communities we are trying to help the  most. There isn't a community meeting out there that is asking for less  police. Minority neighborhoods or high crime neighborhoods want more  police. Now, they want better policing, but they want more of it.   In the Senate, Democrats wouldn't even debate Senator Scott's bill.  Here in the House, Democrats won't let Republicans offer a single  amendment.   What reason could the majority possibly have for refusing to work  with us?   When Americans are demanding that we work together toward common  goals, why won't Democrats do so?   This is sad, cynical politics. The Speaker of the House would rather  call Republicans murderers than work with us on solutions.   But it was never really about police reform. The majority's eyes and  actions are fixed on November, not police reform.   It is not too late. I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and  work with us to send a bill that the President will sign.
