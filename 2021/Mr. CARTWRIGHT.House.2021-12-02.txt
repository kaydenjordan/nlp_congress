 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the continuing  resolution. At the same time, I join my colleagues in calling on the  other side of the aisle to join in helping enact a year-long  appropriations act, the way we are supposed to do, rather than relying  on this kind of stop-and-go government funding or a full-year  continuing resolution, as has also been threatened.   Look, a full-year continuing resolution would be disastrous to our  country in so many ways. It would greatly limit or reduce essential  investments in our Nation's future.   As for the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies  appropriations bill, as reported out of committee earlier this year, it  provides funding increases aimed at creating jobs in distressed  communities, enforcing our trade laws, fighting crime and supporting  community involvement with law enforcement, ensuring civil rights,  advancing American scientific research, fighting the opioid epidemic,  confronting the climate crisis, among so many other critical public  investments. These funding increases are only possible with an  appropriations agreement.   I urge support, both for the short-term CR, and to quickly finalize a  full-year appropriations agreement.
