 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, the ranking member,  for yielding, and I want to start by congratulating him on his new role  on the Financial Services Committee. Certainly, he makes our home  State, the Old North State, proud.   I also want to congratulate the new chair on her position as chair of  our committee, and I look forward to working with her in a bipartisan  fashion whenever I can.   I also have to thank my colead on H.R. 56, the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch), for his leadership on illicit financing  issues, and this bill in particular. I always enjoy teaming up with  him, and I value his input and expertise on these issues. I am hopeful  we will see some movement on his kleptocracy legislation soon, and I am  proud to be coleading that bill with the gentleman.   Today, Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bipartisan  legislation, the Financial Technology Protection Act. I have said this  many times before, but I will say it again because it bears repeating:  Illicit financing networks are the linchpin of any terrorist group,  criminal organization, or rogue state's operations.   As we move into an increasingly digital and virtual world, criminals  and terrorists will start to use new technologies that are available to  them. This shouldn't shock anyone. Of course, we all recognize the good  that comes with innovation and new technology, but there will always be  bad actors as well.   The bottom line is that the Federal Government has to be one step  ahead of the illicit actors in this new space without threatening  technological innovation, and that is what this bill will do. It will  do this by giving the private sector additional tools to protect their  new technology, hence the name for the bill, the Financial Technology  Protection Act.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 56 is a culmination of months of work with outside  groups all over the political spectrum, from national security groups  that appreciate the task force to trade and industry groups that  appreciate the new tools being given to them that will help them  better protect their industry and livelihood.    I think that this bill strikes an impressive balance and is an  example of some bipartisan areas that we can work together on in the  116th Congress. Specifically, Mr. Speaker, my legislation will do the  following things:   First, and perhaps most importantly, H.R. 56 establishes the Fintech  Leadership in Innovation and Financial Intelligence Program, which will  be used for grants and rewards in the fintech space for ideas and  programs to combat terrorist use of digital currencies. These  technologies would be open access and open source. Experts in the  private sector can track illicit use of these currencies and perhaps do  a better job of leveraging their talent to create tools and programs  through the Fintech Leadership and Financial Intelligence Program. We  need to give them the ability to try, and that is exactly what this  bill does.   Secondly, it establishes the Independent Financial Technology Task  Force to Combat Terrorism and Illicit Financing, which will improve  coordination and start conversations between the private and public  sectors for new ways to combat illicit use. In my view, industry and  the Federal Government should be coming together to find best practices  and solutions to stop this new terrorist funding threat.   H.R. 56 includes language from H.R. 5227, the Preventing Rogue and  Foreign Actors from Evading Sanctions Act, introduced last Congress by  my friend, Mark Meadows of North Carolina. This language directs the  Treasury Department to develop a strategy that identifies and describes  the potential uses of virtual currencies and other related emerging  technologies by states and nonstate actors, terrorist organizations to  evade sanctions, finance terrorism, or launder monetary instruments and  threaten the United States' national security. Again, the development  of a national strategy to combat illicit use strikes me as common  sense; therefore, we are excited to have it included in the bill and to  have Mr. Meadows' support.   Finally, this Budd-Lynch legislation establishes a targeted rewards  program for information leading to the capture of terrorists or illicit  actors involved with terror digital currency networks. The government  should be encouraging individuals with knowledge of illicit use of  virtual currencies to come forward through the offerings of rewards for  successful convictions.   Here is the bottom line: H.R. 56 is legislation that sparks private- sector innovation to deal with terror and illicit financing when it  comes to virtual currencies, which ultimately benefits the underlying  technology, the blockchain.                                time  1800    I think that Congress should be promoting programs and technologies  that give industry the tools they need to save their technology and  industry from illicit use and, hopefully, save them from further  negotiation down the road.   I am very excited that this bill is up for a vote in the House today  and has such strong bipartisan support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of my bipartisan legislation and, once  again, thank everyone who has had a hand in bringing this to the floor.  It is an exciting day when we can focus on fintech, and I am hopeful  for the future of this committee and the 116th Congress.
