 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand in support of  the LGBTQ community and to recognize this Pride Month.   This month is one of reflection: reflection on the strides our  country has made toward acceptance and inclusion and on the struggles  that still exist today.   From Stonewall, to the AIDS epidemic, to attacks on transgender youth  across our country today, the struggle for equality continues.   This month is one of recognition for the trailblazers of decades past  and the advocates on the ground today who make this country welcoming  for everyone.   But most of all, this month is one of celebration. I am here to say  loudly and clearly to all of my LGBTQ constituents in Nevada's Third  District, you are respected and loved, and I have your back here in  Washington.   While we mark 6 years of marriage equality this week and have  continued to reach milestones in the time since, we have more work to  do.   I am proud to have voted to pass the Equality Act out of the House,  and it is time for the Senate to join us.   I hope you all take time this month to celebrate who you are. And  from the bottom of my heart, Happy Pride Month.                            ____________________
