 Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Dr.  Alan Crandall, of Salt Lake City, Utah, who passed away on October 2,  2020. A leader in the ophthalmologic community, Dr. Crandall was senior  vice chair and director of glaucoma and cataract at the University of  Utah John A. Moran Eye Center.   Alan was born on June 13, 1947. In 1969, he received his  undergraduate degree from the University of Utah, where he stayed to  earn his medical degree in 1973. He later returned to the University of  Utah as a professor and chairman of the Department of Ophthalmology and  Visual Sciences.   In his career, Crandall pioneered several surgical techniques and  participated in clinical studies used to impact the future of  ophthalmology and used his skills to further the next generation of  ophthalmologists through training and mentoring surgeons. As founder of  the Global Outreach Division of the Moran Eye Center and past president  of the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery, Dr.  Crandall spent nearly four decades helping those in need access high- quality eye care. Dr. Crandall's service to the field of ophthalmology  continued as a member of the National Board of Medical Examiners and  the American Board of Ophthalmology.   His philanthropy was widespread, performing free surgeries in his  local community and in dozens of developing countries around the globe.  I traveled with Dr. Crandall to Guatemala and Haiti to help perform  vision restoring cataract surgeries and saw firsthand his compassion  and commitment to curing preventable diseases.   Dr. Crandall's humanitarianism was so renowned that he received  numerous international awards for his work. He is the only physician to  have received four of the most prestigious humanitarian awards in  ophthalmology from the American Glaucoma Society, the American Academy  of Ophthalmology, the American Society of Cataract and Refractive  Surgery, and the Chang Family Foundation. Additionally, Rotary  International awarded him with both the Health Care Heroes Award for  Excellence in Health Care and Community Outreach and the Vocational  Excellence Award for Humanitarian Service.   On behalf of all ophthalmologists, together we mourn the loss of an  outstanding surgeon and even greater man. Alan was a steadfast  ambassador to the field of ophthalmology, and his true selflessness  will certainly never be forgotten.                            ____________________     Mr. President, 50 years ago--several years before  the landmark Roe v. Wade decision--a young mother was so moved by a  news story calling for the legalization of abortion in Kentucky that  she began to share her concerns with family, friends, and anyone who  would listen. Out of her passion, the Kentucky Right to Life was born,  and for 50 years, Margie Montgomery has nurtured, grown, and led this  organization. Last week, Margie announced her retirement. We celebrate  alongside her that countless lives have been saved through the efforts  of Kentucky Right to Life over the past five decades. She leaves a  strong organization in place that will continue to protect the unborn  who are, in Margie's words, ``unique, living human beings, made in the  image of God.''                            ____________________
