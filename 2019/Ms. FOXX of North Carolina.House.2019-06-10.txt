 Madam Speaker, I rise to applaud the  Trump administration for its proactive steps to ban fetal tissue  research.   Last week, HHS terminated the NIH's $13 million contract with the  University of California, San Francisco for research involving human  fetal tissue from elective abortions.   Madam Speaker, we should not use aborted babies for research, period.  Furthermore, we don't need to because there are scientifically credible  alternatives, and this administration is expanding them.   Just last December, NIH announced $20 million for finding ethical  alternatives to fetal tissue research. Yet the Democratic Party  supports research with aborted baby parts, refuses to protect babies  born alive after an attempted abortion, and even decries the Hyde  amendment, the most basic of protections for taxpayer money.   Thankfully, our pro-life President will ensure that only forward  steps will be taken to protect all human life.                            ____________________
