 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to recognize  Petty Officer Second Class Margaret Nicol of the United States Coast  Guard.   A fellow resident of Sammamish, Washington, Maggie grew up in a large  boating community in Florida. She found out all too well at the early  age of 8 that the Coast Guard is an elite group of individuals whom we  can always count on when she had to be rescued by them. Driven by a  desire to give back, she enlisted in the Coast Guard Reserves during  high school.   After attending college, she completed 2 years of Active-Duty service  in Iraq, responded to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and went on to  pursue registered nursing.   After relocating to the Seattle area in 2017, she rapidly qualified  well ahead of deadlines to earn her response boat-small coxswain and  boarding team member qualifications. To support her colleagues, she  amassed over 130 hours helping to train and qualify crew members,  significantly increasing Station Seattle's Reserve mobilization  readiness.   But Petty Officer Nicol's commitment to our country does not stop at  the armed services. She is a business owner of FLWA Holdings, providing  affordable housing for those in need in Washington and Florida. She  volunteers at Food Lifeline, serves local schools in the community, and  engages with the Diveheart Foundation for disabled children, adults,  and veterans.   Among her accolades, Petty Officer Nicol has earned the Global War on  Terror Service Medal, the Humanitarian Service Medal, and, most  recently, the high honor of being named the 2018 Coast Guard Enlisted  Person of the Year. She epitomizes the Coast Guard's core values of  honor, respect, and devotion to duty. Most importantly, she leads by  example, champions a humanitarian spirit, and has devoted her life to  serving others.   Thank you, Maggie. Washington State and the Coast Guard would not be  the same without you.                     Tahoma High School, State Champions     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Tahoma High  School, State champions.   Congratulations to the students of Tahoma High School from Washington  State's Maple Valley on their 10th consecutive statewide victory and  23rd victory in the last 25 years in the Center for Civic Education's  We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution annual tournament.   These smart and ambitious students from the Eighth District will  represent Washington State in the 32nd annual We the People finals  later this month right here in D.C., where they will demonstrate their  knowledge and understanding of the Constitution to distinguished panels  of scholars, lawyers, and leaders from across the Nation. They will no  doubt uphold the standards of excellence for which Tahoma High School  is known and champion the values inscribed in our founding documents.   I would especially like to recognize Gretchen Wulfing, Tahoma High  School's dedicated teacher and coach for civic education. She has  coached the Tahoma High School team for 11 years, was honored as one of  Washington's Civic Educators of 2016, and received Washington's Civic  Educator of the Year distinction in 2011. We are grateful for her  dedication to our schools and to our next generation of leaders.   Congratulations to Gretchen and the hardworking students from Tahoma  High School for being true warriors of the Constitution. You are  exemplars of young people leading the way in the 21st century. Good  luck. Washington could not be more proud of you.                        We Are a Nation of Immigrants     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleague, Mr.  Green of Texas.   We are a nation of immigrants. It is our responsibility to welcome  refugees  [[Page H3137]]  and to not close our doors to those seeking asylum. We are a good  country at heart. We should not separate children from parents. We are  better than that.                            ____________________
