 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Dr. George Mulcaire-Jones of Silver Bow County for his  tremendous impact on lives of folks in Butte and surrounding areas.   Dr. Mulcaire-Jones has spent over 30 years practicing medicine, each  of which he committed to improving the health of those around him. He  founded Maternal Life International, which goes above and beyond, to  provide training and program development in Africa and Haiti. Over the  course of his career, Dr. Mulcaire-Jones has also focused on addressing  the growing issue of substance abuse among pregnant and postpartum  moms.   Dr. Mulcaire-Jones led the fight to address the growing drug crisis  in pregnant and postpartum moms across Montana. Dr. Mulcaire-Jones  directed an initiative that defines symptoms for these moms and ensures  they receive the proper medical care. He was instrumental in a $150,000  grant awarded to a local hospital that works to treat these moms. Dr.  Mulcaire-Jones also worked hard to ensure that other care providers in  the industry have the training they need to properly treat those  patients.   I congratulate Dr. Mulcaire-Jones on his proactive approach in  recognizing the signs of drug abuse in pregnant and postpartum mothers.  Through his efforts, Dr. Mulcaire-Jones has paved the way for other  communities around Montana to combat this growing epidemic.                            ____________________
