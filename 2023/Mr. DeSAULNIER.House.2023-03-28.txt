 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose H.R. 1. H.R. 1 reverses our hard- fought progress for clean water, and it also severely undermines  States' abilities to protect water quality under the Clean Water Act.  Under this bill, States like California would have their hands tied in  their efforts to maintain water quality for drinking, recreation, and  protecting our natural environments.   California has always been a leader in clean water issues, and this  bill is a direct assault on our efforts to counteract pollution and  protect both public health and the health of the environment.   What is more, H.R. 1 will dangerously limit States from protecting  their own natural resources and bodies of water. It will limit  California's efforts to conserve water, which is especially important  given the extreme drought that we were in and will continue to see in  the face of changing climate.   Maintaining section 401 of the Clean Water Act is vital. My friends  on the other side of the aisle claim the proposed changes in the bill  will prevent States from hijacking the permitting process and  preventing important energy projects. However, in the past 50 years,  California State water agencies have processed thousands of section 401  permit requests without issue. Only a handful each year are denied. The  States have utilized this section to rightfully protect against  violations of their own State water quality standards.    We see this legislation for what it truly is: a giveaway to corporate  polluters at the expense of our environment.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this bill and the larger movement it  stands for. We cannot and should not roll back these bedrock  environmental laws.
