 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  Senators be permitted to speak prior to the scheduled vote: myself for  up to 15 minutes, Senator Cruz for up to 25 minutes, and Senator  Stabenow for up to 10 minutes.    Mr. President, we are moving from disaster to catastrophe  at our southern border. Last week, the Biden administration announced  that title 42 COVID-19 restrictions, which had provided for the  immediate deportation of those who crossed the border illegally, will  end in May.   Now, it is ironic that just as the administration presses for more  COVID funding, it is apparently declaring COVID is over at the border.  Now, I just want everybody to think about the inherent contradiction in  what is being said here. By ending title 42, the administration says,  for all intents and purposes, the pandemic is over; it is over at the  border. But, today, it was announced that the student loan program-- repayments on student loans--would be extended until the month of  August. Why? Presumably because of the pandemic.   There is still a policy in place, Mr. President, if you can believe  this--yesterday, I had the chance to question, at the Senate Finance  Committee, Secretary Becerra of the Health and Human Services  Department about a policy that is in place right now that has not yet  been repealed that requires children under 5 in Head Start facilities  to wear masks--masks not just when they are in the classroom but when  they are outside on the playground--children under 5, to wear masks.   Now, who says that is a bad idea? Well, for one, the World Health  Organization. The World Health Organization isn't exactly a  conservative-leaning institution. The World Health Organization says  that it is not necessary for children under 5 to wear a mask because  there is no discernible health or safety benefit derived from that.   So that policy is still in place. Kids under the age of 5 at Head  Start facilities still have to wear masks, not just inside but when  they are outside.   Now student loans, again, have been deferred. You don't have to repay  your student loans at least until August. It has been extended again.   These policies reflect a belief on behalf of the administration that  we are evidently still in a pandemic that requires these policies to  stay in place.   So the student loan deferral request has been made or is going to  happen. They are just going to do it. So they are doing that by fiat.  And this rule that requires children under 5 to wear masks suggests we  are still very concerned about the pandemic and about the spread of  COVID-19. Yet, Mr. President, title 42 is going to be lifted at the  border, which is a pandemic measure. It was put in place as a result of  the pandemic and has enabled our officials at the border, Customs and  Border Protection, to be able to at least somewhat manage the flow of  illegals coming across the border. Think about that. Think about the  inherent contradiction, the messages that you are sending--in addition,  I would add, to the $10 billion, which was originally $15 billion, that  is being requested by the administration to deal with COVID.   So you are asking for more funding. You are requiring kids to wear  masks. You are extending the deferral on student loan repayments. Yet  you are lifting title 42 restrictions.   Let me tell you what that means. Once title 42 restrictions are  officially lifted, the flood of illegal immigration across our southern  border is expected to become a tsunami. The Department of Homeland  Security expects as many as 18,000 per day to attempt to cross our  southern border after the policy is lifted--18,000 per day. That adds  up to more than half a million migrants per month.    To put those numbers in perspective, in fiscal year 2021, Border  Patrol encountered more than 1.7 million individuals attempting to  cross our southern border. That was the highest number ever recorded in  a single year. Now we are talking about a rate of migration that would  lead to our hitting that 1-year record in just over 3 months.   Title 42 restrictions were never intended to be a permanent border  solution, and lifting them would not be a problem if the President had  some meaningful plan in place for dealing with the border crisis that  has been going on since he took office, but he doesn't--again,  evidenced by the fact that the President has no interest in visiting  the border, nor has his border czar, the Vice President of the United  States. Neither has been to the border.   Lifting title 42 without a plan to curb illegal immigration is  nothing more than an invitation for our current crisis to get  exponentially worse, which is exactly, exactly what the Department of  Homeland Security expects is going to happen.   Now, you don't have to take my word for it on these problems with the  administration's decision. Here is what one Democratic Senator had to  say about the administration's title 42 decision:         This is a wrong decision. It's unacceptable to end Title 42       without a plan and coordination in place to ensure a secure,       orderly, and humane process at the border.        This is a wrong decision. It's unacceptable to end Title 42       without a plan and coordination in place to ensure a secure,       orderly, and humane process at the border.    That is from a Democratic Senator.   Another Democratic Senator noted:         I think this is not the right time and we have not seen a       detailed plan from the administration. We need assurances       that we have security at the border and that we protect       communities on this side of the border.    Another Democratic Senator.   This is another Democratic Senator, a third one:         Today's announcement by the CDC and the Biden       Administration is a frightening decision. Title 42 has been       an essential tool in combatting the spread of COVID-19 and       controlling the influx of migrants at our southern border. We       are already facing an unprecedented increase in migrants this       year, and that will only get worse if the Administration ends       the Title 42 policy. We are nowhere near prepared to deal       with that influx.  [[Page S1996]]         We are nowhere near prepared to deal with that influx.    Again, a third Democratic Senator on the subject of ending title 42.   Mr. President, under the Biden administration, we have had 12  straight months of border encounters in excess of over 150,000. In  February, U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountered 164,973  individuals attempting to cross our southern border illegally--the  highest February number in more than 20 years. And, of course, those  numbers only reflect individuals the Border Patrol has succeeded in  apprehending. There is no question that many other illegal immigrants  have crossed the border in the past year without being apprehended and  have disappeared into the United States. The President is largely  responsible for this situation thanks to the series of actions he has  taken to weaken border security and immigration enforcement since his  administration began.   Mr. President, illegal immigration is a very serious problem for  several reasons. First of all, it is dangerous for any country not to  know who is entering the country, who is crossing its borders. Illegal  border crossings are not confined to individuals wanting to build a  better life for themselves. Weak borders are an invitation to human  traffickers, drug smugglers, gangs, and even terrorists.   We currently have a very serious fentanyl problem in this country. In  fact, fentanyl overdose is the leading cause of death for U.S. adults  between the ages of 18 and 45. And where is this fentanyl coming from?  It is being trafficked across our southern border. In fact, Mexico has  replaced China as the dominant source of fentanyl in the United States.  There is no question that the worse the situation at the border gets,  the easier it is for drug smugglers to evade detection and capture.   Our Border Patrol officers do heroic work, but they are stretched  incredibly thin and have been for the past year. It is simply common  sense to acknowledge that the greater the flood of illegal immigration  they have to contend with, the easier it is going to be for bad actors  to get across the border.   So there are real security concerns that illegal immigration  represents. There are also serious humanitarian concerns. The journey  to our southern border for those attempting to cross illegally is  frequently fraught with danger, and there is nothing compassionate  about encouraging individuals to undertake that journey, to run the  risk of exploitation and disease and exposure.   Finally, encouraging or tacitly endorsing illegal immigration shows a  real disregard for the rule of law. I am a strong supporter of legal  immigration. I am one generation removed from immigrants in this  country, and I hope this country will always serve as a refuge for  individuals seeking a new life for peace and for freedom. But  immigration laws are not exceptions to the principle that the law must  be respected.   We can and should make changes to immigration laws as needed to  address problems or to expand opportunities, but immigration must  proceed according to the law. To suggest otherwise is to cultivate  contempt for the rule of law, not to mention how unfair it is to those  who have done what is required to come here legally.   As President, President Biden has a particular responsibility to care  for the country's security. When it comes to the border, at least, he  is failing in that responsibility, and he is betraying the duty he owes  to the American people, who should be able to count on their President  to care about security concerns, including border security.   We are less than 2 months away from the end of title 42 restrictions  and the border surge that we expect to follow. I hope that the  President will use that time to get serious about developing a plan to  secure our southern border because he owes the American people nothing  less.   I yield the floor.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Nebraska (Mr. Sasse).
