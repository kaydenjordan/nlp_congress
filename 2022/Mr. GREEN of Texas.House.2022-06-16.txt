 Madam Speaker, and still I rise. And I rise today  with an expression of gratitude and great appreciation.   I thank the many persons who voted for H.R. 2543, the Financial  Services Racial Equity, Inclusion, and Economic Justice Act. I rise to  thank persons for this because I was fortunate enough to have the  opportunity to manage the bill on the floor.   The Honorable Maxine Waters is the sponsor of this piece of  legislation. It is a compilation of some 13 bills that were used and  packaged so that we could bring about some racial justice in this  country. Racial justice that is long overdue, I might add.   The Honorable Maxine Waters, but for her, I can say without  reservation, hesitation, or equivocation, this bill would not have come  to fruition. She has been a champion for those who have been left out,  left behind, locked out, those that I label as being among the least,  the last, and the lost.   The least, those who don't inherit a legacy of wealth but, rather, a  legacy of poverty. The least, those are persons who are still finding  themselves living in the streets of life.   The last, those are the last hired and the first fired.   The lost, those who are lost in the richest country in the world, but  lost perhaps in chemical consumption, drugs, if you will, lost because  of mental issues, but they are lost in the richest country in the  world. She has been a champion for them.   I will always be grateful to her for working with me to help me to  acquire a position on the Financial Services Committee. I think that  probably but for her, I might not have the position that I have. So I  know that she is not doing well today, but she will be back, and I want  her to know today that I am appreciative for the many opportunities  that I have acquired by virtue of her being there at the right time  when these opportunities were available.   I also thank the Members who had those bills, the 13 bills: Mrs.  Joyce Beatty, Mr. Auchincloss, Mr. Cleaver, Mr. Meeks, Ms. Garcia of  Texas, Mr. Torres, and of course, Ms. Waters, had a bill as well. I had  two bills associated with this package.   This package, the Financial Services Racial Equity, Inclusion, and  Economic Justice Act, why is it needed? Why is it needed on this day  some few days away from Juneteenth? And I celebrate Juneteenth, by the  way. I commend my colleague, Ms. Jackson Lee, for her work on  Juneteenth.   I knew the father of Juneteenth, Al Edwards. Al Edwards was a State  representative in Texas, and he was a person who was tenacious about  Juneteenth. It was his legislation that passed the Texas House and  Senate and was signed by the Governor of the State of Texas, making  Juneteenth a holiday at a time when, quite frankly, people thought that  it was impossible to get it done.   Al Edwards, the father of Juneteenth, I always remember him, a dear  friend. We celebrated Juneteenth together on many occasions. We  traversed the State together. He was one of my supporters. I know his  family. His brother was a banker, Redick Edwards. He was my banker, as  a matter of fact. So I have a relationship with this family. I want the  world to know that I am appreciative for what he did to lay the  foundation for Juneteenth as a holiday at the national level.   I also express my appreciation for what Juneteenth is all about.  General Gordon Granger came into Galveston, Texas, in 1865. The  Emancipation Proclamation had been signed. The war had ended, but in  Texas, the slaves were not accorded their freedom. Some people say that  the word hadn't reached Texas. I differ. The word reached Texas, but  the slaveholders saw those slaves as personal property, and they saw no  reason to give up their personal property simply because Mr. Lincoln  signed an Emancipation Proclamation or simply because the war was over.  That was their personal property.   It is said that someone was sent, an envoy, if you will, to make it  known to people in Texas that the slaves had been freed. This is prior  to General Gordon Granger arriving in Galveston, Texas in 1865. Well,  they said that that person didn't quite get the message across, and one  can well understand why, given the behavior of Texas, a State that  seceded from the Union and also seceded from Mexico because of slavery.                                time  1315    They were recalcitrant--and that is being kind--about the desire to  maintain slavery. But President Lincoln sent General Gordon Granger.   To say that he sent General Gordon Granger, quite frankly, is an  incomplete statement. He sent General Gordon Granger and 2,000 troops.  General Gordon Granger, being the wise man that he was, brought those  troops with him, but they also had some friends with them. They had Mr.  Winchester, Smith & Wesson. They were well equipped to present this  message to the slaveholders. When it was presented with 2,000 troops  who were well armed, it was received.   It was the next year that the first Juneteenth celebration took  place. That was in 1866, the first celebration.   This is what Al Edwards shared with me about Juneteenth, the actual  moniker, the name for the holiday. It was his position that it became  known as ``Juneteenth'' because there was some question about the date  that General Gordon Granger arrived, within the minds of the slaves,  whether it was on the 18th or the 19th. Rather than continue a debate  about the actual date, it simply became ``Juneteenth,'' and folks can  fill in the blank as they choose. 1866 was a big celebration of  Juneteenth, a celebration of freedom.   Again, I commend the father, Al Edwards, and I commend my colleague,  Ms. Jackson Lee, for her stellar work here in Congress to work  Juneteenth through to the point that it is now a Federal holiday. I  commend both of  [[Page H5640]]  them. I commend the many people who voted for it.   Today, I thank the people who voted for that holiday, but I also  thank the people who voted for H.R. 2543. I greatly appreciate the fact  that you voted for the Financial Services Racial Equity, Inclusion, and  Economic Justice Act because that act is needed.   There has to be some question as to why it is needed more than 150  years after the end of slavery. Why would we need a Financial Services  Racial Equity, Inclusion, and Economic Justice Act these many years  later?   Well, rather than give you my opinion about it, I am going to read to  you from a report presented by the Brookings Institution. Brookings is  well known and well respected. Let's just see what Brookings says. This  was published on February 27, 2020. Not a lot has changed since  February 27, 2020, so let's examine what they at the Brookings  Institution have shared with us with reference to the Black folk in  this country.   It is styled, the article, ``Examining the Black-White Wealth Gap.''  Hear now the words of the Brookings Institution: ``A close examination  of wealth in the U.S. finds evidence of staggering racial disparities.  At $171,000, the net worth of a typical White family is nearly 10 times  greater than that of a Black family, which is $17,150.'' This was in  2016.   2016, White family's worth: $171,000. This is the net worth. Black  family's net worth: $17,150. Over 150 years since the end of the Civil  War, more than 400 years since the first Africans were brought here as  slaves in 1619, 400 years have passed, and we still have this wage gap.   It goes on to read: ``Gaps in wealth between Black and White  households reveal the effects of accumulated inequality and  discrimination, as well as differences in power and opportunity that  can be traced back to this Nation's inception.''   ``Traced back to this Nation's inception.'' This is the Brookings  Institution. ``Traced back to this Nation's inception.''   ``The Black-White wealth gap reflects a society that has not and does  not afford equality of opportunity to all its citizens.''   Equality of opportunity is the opportunity--these are my words--to  succeed on your merits or fail on your demerits, the opportunity for  you to pull yourself up by your bootstraps. The society, according to  Brookings, does not afford equality of opportunity to all its citizens.   It goes on to indicate: ``Efforts by Black Americans to build wealth  can be traced back throughout American history. But these efforts have  been impeded in a host of ways, beginning with 246 years of chattel  slavery followed by congressional mismanagement of the Freedman's  Savings Bank.''   This bank was established after the slaves were freed to provide them  an opportunity to accumulate wealth. They were free, but they were just  free to the elements. They didn't have property that they owned. They  were free to have persons abuse them. They were in a hostile  environment. They were among people who had held them as property,  people who had no desire to see their property taken from them.   So they were free, but they were free to the wind, the rains, the  elements, free to starve, and free to survive if they could. But that  level of freedom was supposed to be curtailed with the Freedman's  Savings Bank.   Well, the bank started with the best of intentions. According to the  history I have read, it was the idea of Frederick Douglass and was  supposed to give the freed slaves an opportunity to acquire wealth, to  save money, to understand the process of saving money, by the way. For  people who had never had money--imagine this--never had money, what do  you do with it if you acquire some? Many of them were working for the  Union Army, and they were getting paid. So what do you do with this  thing called money?   Well, this bank was a place where they were supposed to be able to  save. Unfortunately, there was mismanagement. Congress did not put in  the proper safeguards so that it could continue to exist in perpetuity,  and it left some 61,144 depositors with losses of nearly $3 million in  1874.   Then, there were persons who sought to move ahead, notwithstanding  circumstances, and there was this area in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Tulsa's  Greenwood District.   Here is what is said by Brookings with reference to Greenwood. It  reads: ``The violent massacre decimating Tulsa's Greenwood District in  1921, a population of 10,000 that thrived as the epicenter of African- American business and culture, commonly referred to as `Black Wall  Street,' ''--Black Wall Street was decimated. This was an opportunity  for people to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, to find a means  by which they could have commerce among themselves. They were of no  threat to the broader community, but they had Black Wall Street taken  away from them, literally destroyed.    Thereafter, we had the discriminatory policies throughout the 20th  century, including Jim Crow-era Black codes, laws that applied  specifically to Black people. If you weren't working, you could be  incarcerated if you were Black.   This is not contained here, but you had the convict leasing that took  place, which was another form of slavery. A person would be arrested  for some minor offense and then placed in the hands of a landowner to  work--leased, as it were, from the State. Some of these persons would  work for the rest of their lives for some minor offense. They became  slaves by another name, leased convicts.   So, we had Black codes limiting opportunities in many Southern  States.   Along came the GI Bill. We are fast-forwarding now, and this is part  of the article that I am reading. The GI Bill benefited and still  benefits--a good many people who are right here in this Congress  benefited from the GI Bill. Few Black people did. Very few Black people  benefited from the GI Bill. The statistical information is overwhelming  in terms of the number that did not, small numbers.   Of the thousands that initially benefited from it, numbers less than  10 were Black. Thousands, with 10 maybe, or less, that were Black.  There are some people who give a specific number on it at less than 10.  But let's just leave it with the fact that there were less than 10 who  benefited from it among thousands.   Here is why they didn't benefit. They didn't benefit because if you  wanted to get a mortgage to buy property, which is what the GI Bill  would afford you, the banks wouldn't lend money in Black neighborhoods.  If you were Black and you walked into the bank, that in and of itself  was a denial of the loan. Your presence, your skin complexion, that was  the denial of your loan because banks were not lending to people living  in Black neighborhoods.   Well, someone would say: But, Al, how did they know they were living  in a Black neighborhood? Because you couldn't live in a White  neighborhood. You couldn't live among people who could get loans. There  were restrictive covenants. The law said they couldn't live there, and  they were denied the opportunity to acquire land, which was another  means of amassing wealth.   By the way, this was not the first time people of color were denied  the opportunity to acquire land. In the early years in this country, if  you could fence in land and you could protect it, you could squat. It  became yours. All you had to do was fence it in and protect it. Black  people were not afforded that opportunity.   So, here we are, a few days away from Juneteenth, which I will  celebrate and appreciate, but I want you to understand why there was a  need for H.R. 2543, the Financial Services Racial Equity, Inclusion,  and Economic Justice Act. There was a need for it. There is a need for  it, and it passed this Congress.                                time  1330    So we find ourselves now with the GI Bill and other circumstances  that did not inure to the benefit of Black people.   According to this article, another circumstance was redlining.  Redlining is where literally a red line was drawn around certain areas,  and those who were in the business of selling and buying real estate,  they rarely wanted to buy that land, so it became a place where people  of color lived and the people of color could not get loans to upgrade  their property, they could not get the loans needed to improve their  lives because the banks were not lending.  [[Page H5641]]    So this wealth that many people have, the wealth that they have is  something that they acquired in ways that were associated with the  government that locked Black people out. This--according to the article  now--history matters for contemporary inequality, in part, because its  legacy is passed down generation to generation. Repeat. This history  matters for contemporary inequality, meaning the inequality we see  today, in part, because its legacy is passed down generation to  generation through unequal monetary inheritances which make up a great  deal of current wealth, meaning a good many of the people who have the  current wealth they acquired this wealth by being born.   A good many people make their first million dollars by being born,  just coming into the world, coming into the world in the right family.  And these inheritances are passed down from generation to generation  through unequal monetary inheritances, which make up a good deal of the  current wealth.   Interesting fact: In 2020 Americans are projected to inherit about  $765 billion in gifts. In 2020, Americans are projected to inherit  about $765 billion in gifts and bequests. I assure you only a marginal  amount of this will be inherited by Black people.   Excluding wealth transfers to spouses and transfers that support  minor children, inheritances account for roughly 4 percent of annual  household income. Black people have little to pass on, therefore, there  is very little that is inherited. And as a result there is no transfer  of wealth from one generation to the next to speak of.   It is really a sad state of affairs when you really think about it.  We have been so conditioned to accept our circumstances in life that  this sad state of affairs is just normal to us. It is just as we have  embraced it almost. It is just the way things are. Things don't have to  be this way. That is why H.R. 2543 is needed.   Let me remind you one more time that Black people in this country  have wealth that is about one-tenth of what White people have, about  one-tenth of what they have. That, my friends, is something that is  unacceptable. And it is not because Black people won't work hard. It is  not because they don't have good work ethics. No, it is because a  system that we exist within has been so structured that not only did we  fail to acquire wealth, couldn't acquire it early on in the history of  the country, but this system still prevents Black people from acquiring  wealth.   I come to the floor and talk about these issues quite regularly, and  there are some people who have asked me why am I so passionate about  these issues?   Well, why do I persist when I could easily just go on with my life?   And I have had people tell me: You are doing all right. You are doing  well. You have all of the trappings of a middle-class person. Why would  you do this?   Because I haven't always been where I am now, and because I have a  memory.   I know what it is like to live in poverty.   I know what it is like to be discriminated against. I am a son of the  segregated south. Those rights that the Constitution recognized as  belonging to me, my friends and neighbors took them away. They denied  them.   I know what it is like to drink from a colored water fountain.   I know what it is like to go to a back door to get your food. And I  know what it is like for the law to say that you have to go to that  back door to get your food.   I know what it is like to stand in a separate line in the supermarket  and have to wait until all of the persons who are White are served  before you can be served.   I know what it is like to be born in a racist society. Believe me. I  was born into the south. I am 74 years old. I know what racism smells  like. I know what it looks like, I know what it tastes like, I know  what it sounds like, and I know what it hurts like.   So my passion emanates from the suffering and the understanding of  what it is like to live in a hostile environment.   My friends, Black people are still living in a hostile environment.  We don't like to acknowledge it, we want to believe otherwise, but it  is a hostile environment. It is a hostile environment.   When you go in to get a loan and you are qualified, and you cannot  get the same loan that a person of a different hue can acquire who is  equally as qualified as you, you are equally as qualified as that  person, that is hostile to you in terms of your economic status. H.R.  2543 seeks to remedy that. H.R. 2543 makes it a crime to discriminate  against a person in lending.   I must tell you, the Honorable Maxine Waters has more courage than we  can measure. There is no way to measure the amount of courage this  woman has to bring this kind of legislation to this floor. And I have  to acknowledge that the other leadership in the House, it was pretty  courageous of them, too, to let this kind of bill come to the floor for  a vote. And I congratulate and thank every person that voted for it.  Because it ought to be a crime to defraud a person out of a loan.   For edification purposes, if you defraud the bank, you can face a  fine of up to $1 million, up to a $1 million fine. And you can be  imprisoned. There is no such fine if the bank denies you a loan,  defrauds you of your loan that you are entitled to.   That changed with the passage of H.R. 2543. This is historic. You are  not going to read about it in the newspapers. But you are going to hear  about it from me right here on this floor of the House.    I didn't come here to hide the good news. We want to let the world  know about the good news. The challenge would be, of course, to get it  through the Senate. I believe this President will sign it but getting  it through the Senate will be a challenge.   But back to where we were. So we find ourselves acclimating to the  hostile environment we have. We find ourselves accepting our  circumstance. And there are others who would say that you are free, you  can just make your way as others have made their way, pull yourself up  by your bootstraps.   Well, let's see where we are with bootstraps. Bootstraps would first  require that you have boots. Black folk don't have the boots. The boots  are at the banks.   People in this country who have little acquire some things with their  hard work and then they are in a position to borrow money. If we are  not given a fair opportunity to borrow money, which would give us the  boots, and then we can have straps added to the boots, you are not  going to be able to pull yourself up by the bootstraps when you don't  have boots. It just doesn't happen. And that is the circumstance we  find ourselves in.   There are many people who will say that by doing what I am doing I am  just making excuses. Well, tell that to the people at the Brookings  Institution. Convince them. They compile this statistical information,  the empirical evidence I have shared with you. This is not Al Green  speaking in the sense of Al Green compiled the information that you  have heard. No. This is the Brookings Institution. I am just the  messenger. They compiled the message.   So we find ourselves in this hostile environment as it relates to the  economy.   It is a hostile environment in many other ways, as well. It is a  hostile environment just in terms of our living. Still discriminated  against when it comes to housing. Still discriminated against. And it  took the death of Dr. King to get the Fair Housing Act through  Congress.   It is amazing how many of the seminal pieces of legislation that  impact the lives of people of color are signed in ink, but they were  written with the blood of people who made great sacrifices, Dr. King's  life, John Lewis and the Edmund Pettus Bridge. But for John Lewis and  the Edmund Pettus Bridge, additional civil rights laws would not have  been signed into law. It took blood on the bridge to bring about the  Civil Rights Act of 1965.                                time  1345    So my dear friends, we are in a hostile environment. People don't  like to talk about the hostile environment. When people say Jews will  not replace us--when they say Jews will not replace us--my friends,  many of those people work in restaurants.   One can but only imagine what happens to the food of a Jewish person  when you have a person working in the restaurant who says Jews will not  replace us. Given that this theory--this  [[Page H5642]]  fake theory, this myth--there are some other words that can be used  that my mother taught me not to use, but these prevarications are  associated with this myth.   Friends, the myth is that Jews are going to use Black people to  replace White people--which is ridiculous. But that means that there  are some people that are very hostile to Black people since they think  Black people are going to take over--and minorities and immigrants.   Just imagine what it can be like to go into a restaurant, and you  have persons who don't find favor with treating us fairly. We have to  be careful where we eat--we do--if you understand the environment you  are living in. Hostile environment.   Can you imagine some of these persons--Jews will not replace us-- persons who are up in Idaho dressed in this military regalia, can you  imagine one of them being a physician? You have got to go into this  office, you need help, maybe you are going into the emergency room. It  is a hostile environment.   You can't appreciate it if you don't understand the consequences that  can emanate from people who scream Jews will not replace us, people who  burn crosses, people who say that they are a part of a superior race.   You don't think it is a hostile environment? Ask the ghosts of the  people who went into the Tops Food Store. Ask the ghosts if it is a  hostile environment. He went there to kill Black people. If you don't  think it is a hostile environment, ask the spirits of the people who  were in the Walmart store in Texas. It is a hostile environment.   It is hostile if you understand and appreciate what is going on  around you. I don't say it is hostile to the extent that we can't  overcome it. I don't say it is hostile to the extent that we should  simply surrender and throw up our hands. That is why we have H.R. 2543,  and there are other aspects of it requiring transparency. We need to  know who is integrating their business.   Sometimes when people have to announce their circumstance, they  change that condition. H.R. 2543 will provide a lot of transparency.  This is needed when you are in a hostile environment.   I would say to you, my dear friends--as Brookings puts it--just how  large and persistent are these racial wealth gaps? Brookings has made  it very clear that at least $17,150 for a Black family in terms of  wealth is about one-tenth of the $171,000 net worth of a White family.   My hope is that we will remember yesterday as a moment in time that  will hopefully accelerate the time that we will need to bring about a  closing of this wealth gap. I think that what happened yesterday is a  great step in that direction. It is not the last step. It is really not  the first, there are other things that have been done, but it is a step  in that direction. We need to close the wealth gap.   Madam Speaker, I pledge to do all that I can to close it. I want to  let you know that in doing all of these things and saying what I am  saying to you, explaining it in terms that many people will find  uncomfortable, I still say that I love my country.   I still say I love my country. I still say I salute the flag. I am  not some person who hates America. I am the guy who wants America to  become America for all Americans. I want equality of opportunity. I  want America to live up to its promise.   As I celebrate Juneteenth, I assure you, I will do the things that  are customarily done in terms of the food and the drink and just having  a great time celebrating freedom. It does not mean that I am going to  forget the need for more work to be done.   I have great respect for and appreciation for Mr. Hoyer. I can't tell  you how much I appreciate and respect him. He has said things here on  this floor that I appreciate with reference to discrimination. Others  have said things, too, that I greatly appreciate, it is just that I  have sort of built a relationship with him.   I appreciate his indicating that Slavery Remembrance Day is something  that is on his agenda. I am going to celebrate Juneteenth, but that  doesn't mean that I won't commemorate August and Slavery Remembrance  Day, that is a day of commemoration.   Madam Speaker, I am going to enjoy Juneteenth, but remembering that  there is still great work to be done. I remember as a child my  grandfather reminding me that I would have to be willing to make  sacrifices that others would not have to make if I wanted to succeed in  life in this country. Sacrifices that others would not have to make. I  assumed that we all make the same sacrifices, but my grandfather taught  my differently--that is not the case.   While I celebrate, I still have some appreciation for the sacrifices  that have been made and have to be made. I understand that we need the  Maxine Waters of the world who work hard to make sure that while she  has the gavel that the change that she can bring about will take place.   I appreciate the Sheila Jackson Lees of the world who worked hard to  make Juneteenth a holiday. It is a holiday and it is a time to  celebrate. I also think we need a day to commemorate because in Texas  there is a desire to not allow slavery to be taught--the history of  African Americans as it relates to slavery to be taught in the schools.  You can't teach it if Texas has its way.   Madam Speaker, I celebrate and commemorate. I thank God for the  opportunity to serve in this House. I thank those persons who voted for  the bill that we brought to the floor, H.R. 2543. I appreciate you,  each of you, and I will be sending you a written thank you, but I  didn't want too much time to pass without saying it to the world. I  appreciate it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
