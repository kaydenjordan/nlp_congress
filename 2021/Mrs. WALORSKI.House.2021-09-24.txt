 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   In America, the condition of a child's birth doesn't determine the  outcome of their life, for every single person, born or unborn, should  have the opportunity to live the American Dream.   But this abortion on demand bill would destroy our country's future.  Today, we are embarking on the biggest step backward in our Nation's  history. This vote could be the most consequential vote that any of us  take.   Today, the science is even more clear than it was in 1973, that a  child in the womb is a living person. And yet, my colleagues on the  other side remain obsessed with killing unborn babies in the name of  female empowerment.    Many supporters of this bill, like me, call us pro-life Americans  extreme. I have heard it already this morning.   But I have seen extreme. I have witnessed the cruelty of abortion and  it is ugly.   In South Bend, Indiana, Dr. Ulrich Klopfer provided abortions for  decades. When he died in 2019, his family found the medically preserved  remains of 2,411 children hidden in his garage. That is 2,411 human  babies preserved in formaldehyde in jars in his garage. It was national  news for a week. This abortionist left a legacy of death and  destruction. That is what extreme looks like.   Abortions sold as healthcare is a sickening violation of human  dignity that Americans should not and cannot tolerate.   So I will ask this question: Will we allow this to happen again?   As a nation, we have an obligation to future generations to reject  abortion on demand and to fight for life. I implore my colleagues here  today, join me in opposing this bill and standing for life.  [[Page H5143]]    The truth is on our side, and, in the end, the truth is going to  prevail.
