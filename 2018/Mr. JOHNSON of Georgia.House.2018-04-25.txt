 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Music  Modernization Act, and I am also proud to be a cosponsor. This  comprehensive music bill will help create an efficient and fair music  licensing system.   Currently, streaming services have to obtain licenses on a song-by- song basis. The Music Modernization Act would reform section 115 of the  Copyright Act by establishing a collective to offer blanket licenses to  streaming services for mechanical rights.   Under current law, only sound recordings made after 1972 receive  payments from digital radio services under Federal law. This bill would  benefit legacy artists and music creators who recorded music before  1972 by establishing royalty payments whenever their music is played on  digital radio.   That is why this section of the bill is supported by Dionne Warwick,  Duke Fakir of the Four Tops, Tina Turner, and the estates of Miles  Davis and Otis Redding, among many others. The bill provides producers  a right to collect  [[Page H3539]]  digital royalties and provides a process for studio professionals to  receive royalties for their contributions to the creation of music.  This bill would, for the first time, add producers and engineers who  play an important role in the creation of sound recordings to the U.S.  copyright law.   Music organizations representing U.S. music publishers, record  labels, songwriters, composers, artists, and performance rights  organizations support this bill. The reforms made by this bill are  critical because the royalty system has not kept pace with the digital  age. These changes will benefit consumers, creators, and the entire  music marketplace.   I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill. I commend the efforts of  Doug Collins, Hakeem Jeffries, and Chairman Goodlatte, as well as  Ranking Member Nadler for shepherding this legislation to this point.
