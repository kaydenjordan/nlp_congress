 Mr. Speaker, for 244 years, America has stood  as the world's bellwether of democracy. Last week, the world saw  America at perhaps her lowest moment. It was crazy. We all took the  same oath when we swore to protect this country from enemies, both  foreign and domestic; and now with a domestic enemy having arisen that  is crazy, only the Vice President has the power to invoke the 25th  Amendment and protect this country from this domestic enemy.   The 25th Amendment was written for this moment. If not now, when  would its use ever be appropriate?   Vice President Pence, you have an opportunity to put country before  self by implementing the 25th Amendment. Please muster the courage to  protect America from maniacal behavior that threatens the very  foundations of our democracy. Stop the violence, Mr. Vice President.
