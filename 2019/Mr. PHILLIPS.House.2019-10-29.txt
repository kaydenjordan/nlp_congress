 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4842) to authorize the Secretary of State to provide funds  for a United States pavilion at Expo 2020 Dubai, and for other  purposes, as amended.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 4842.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the Expositions Provide  Opportunities Act, or the EXPO Act of 2019.   When I took the oath of office on January 3 of this year, my  extraordinary team and I set an ambitious goal: To visit every city and  town in Minnesota's Third Congressional District within the first 6  months of my  [[Page H8586]]  service; and to listen and learn from the local leaders who know our  communities best, and bring their voices to Washington, because  representation begins with listening.   In Bloomington, Minnesota, we heard something unexpected, and I knew  we had to help. The city of Bloomington is determined to bring the eyes  of the world to Minnesota by bidding for host city of the 2027 World  Expo.   For generations, the United States has showcased our leadership,  innovation, and industrial advancement through brilliant displays  called pavilions at world expos around the world. But for the past 3  decades, the U.S. has fallen short of its historic leadership role and  fundraising for 7 of the last 10 American pavilions has been paltry.   In fact, the United States is the only G7 country that relies on  private donations to guarantee its presence at world expos, and the  only country that relies entirely on private funding for the creation  of its pavilion.   Madam Speaker, that has left a vacuum, which our strategic  competitors, like Russia and China, have been all too happy to fill.   As a result, American cities like Bloomington, Minnesota, and  Houston, Texas, have been overlooked for hosting rights; missing  important opportunities to build strong international relationships,  showcase the strength of American ingenuity, and boost local economies.   A critical component in competing for host city status is a country's  pavilion at the current world expo. In this case, the next opportunity  to make the case for an American host city is the Dubai 2020 World  Expo, happening next October.   That is why I am honored to stand with the city of Bloomington,  Global Minnesota, the entire Minnesota House delegation, and a group of  like-minded colleagues from both sides of the aisle, like Ranking  Member McCaul, and Representatives Pete Olson, Lizzie Fletcher, and my  colleague, Ted Yoho to change all of that with the Expositions Provide  Opportunities Act, the EXPO Act of 2019.   Our bill does three things. First, it provides authorization for the  State Department to use funds to build a pavilion for the 2020 Dubai  World Expo, so that cities in the U.S., like Bloomington and Houston,  can compete to be the host city at the 2027 World Expo.   Next, it requires the State Department to seek out matching funds  from the private sector in order to alleviate the cost burden.   Finally, it requires a series of reports from the State Department  which shall contain the following items:   One, an estimate of the investment a pavilion could bring to the  United States;   Two, a report on the human rights record of the United Arab Emirates;  and   Three, ensures that all applicable labor laws in the UAE are followed  during construction of our pavilion.   Madam Speaker, we could not have brought this bill to the floor  without help. I would like to thank Speaker Pelosi, Leader Hoyer, and  Leader McCarthy for their support and their staffs' work on this  important bill.   I would also like to thank Ranking Member McCaul for his support and  his staff's expertise in crafting the bill. And thanks also to Chairman  Engel and his staff, especially Janice Kaguyutan, who was instrumental  in helping us get to the finish line.   The root of this effort started in Minnesota with former Minnesota  Secretary of State and now Global Minnesota President, Mark Ritchie. He  was and will always be steadfast in his advocacy on behalf of  Minnesota.   Most of all, I am grateful to the city of Bloomington, Minnesota,  especially Mayor Gene Winstead and City Manager Jamie Verbrugge, for  their counsel and advocacy on behalf of all Minnesotans.   Madam Speaker, this is how democracy should work; Democrats and  Republicans in Congress, working with stakeholders, constituents, and a  government agency to craft legislation which will benefit both  localities and the Nation as a whole.   So I urge my colleagues to support this important, bipartisan  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), my good friend, for  his remarks as well.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this very important  and bipartisan bill which allows America to compete on the world stage.   As I said before, representation starts with listening and if we pass  this bill, we will have shown the American people that Democrats and  Republicans can put their differences aside, listen to their  constituents, and get something done.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
