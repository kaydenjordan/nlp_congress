 Mr. Speaker, this week, Penn State  University recognizes Military Appreciation Week, which is in  conjunction with its homecoming celebration.   The Penn State Homecoming and Military Appreciation game will take  place, and appropriately so, on Veterans Day, Saturday, November 11,  against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights in Beaver Stadium. This game will  celebrate both Penn State and its commitment to alumni and others in  the community who have served in our military.   I am so pleased to see the Penn State community honoring  servicemembers, veterans, and their families, expressing appreciation  to them and recognizing the sacrifices of Gold Star families.   Faculty, staff, and students from around the university and within  the community are engaging in planning and recognizing Active-Duty and  veteran military personnel and their families.   Mr. Speaker, the State College Borough and Centre County have also  joined with University Park to present numerous events for veterans and  their families during Military Appreciation Month. Events began on  October 2 with the Penn State Veterans Career Fair and will continue  through the end of this week.   The Vietnam Veterans Traveling Memorial Wall came to University Park  during the month's events. I had the opportunity to participate in both  the opening and closing ceremonies for the wall, and it was a moving  tribute to all those who served during the Vietnam war.   The theme for the Centre County event was ``Welcome Home.'' We all  know that, in many instances, our Vietnam veterans did not receive a  warm welcome home when they actually returned home from war. This is a  scar on our history and one that we are working to heal. The Traveling  Wall served as a reminder of the efforts to promote liberty and freedom  that our Vietnam veterans put forth.   Military Appreciation events continue this week in conjunction with  homecoming. There will be a Veterans Day ceremony in front of Old Main  on Friday, a tailgate before the Military Appreciation football game  Saturday, and a Freedom 5K for post-traumatic stress disorder, to  benefit those suffering with it, on Sunday.   The 6-week regional celebration culminates Sunday afternoon with  Military Appreciation basketball games for both the Penn State men's  and women's teams at Bryce Jordan Center.   Mr. Speaker, caring for our veterans and military has been one of my  top priorities since beginning my congressional service. It has a  special place in my heart, not just because of all our veterans have  done, but because I have seen firsthand the magnitude of their  sacrifice.   As a military father, I know that wearing the uniform is about  service and sacrifice.   I thank all those who serve and have served this great Nation, and I  look forward to honoring their service this week at Penn State and in  every corner of our country.   May God bless our veterans, the United States of America, and the  Nittany Lions for a homecoming win.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, the Nation  celebrates Veterans Day. Originally called Armistice Day, November 11,  1919, marked the end of World War I.   In 1926, Congress passed a resolution for an annual observance, and  November 11 became a national holiday in 1938. In 1954, the holiday was  renamed Veterans Day.   Mr. Speaker, we all want to thank our veterans for their service to  this Nation, and there is no better way to do so than to care for them  when they return home. That is why I encourage my colleagues to support  the Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine Support Act, or the VETS Act.   This bill will be on the floor this afternoon, and it will allow VA  health professionals to practice telemedicine across State borders to  care for more of America's veterans. This Nation has the technology  available today to provide care for our veterans, no matter where they  reside. This bill upholds our promise to be there for our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the VETS Act and work to  give our veterans access to the best care possible, no matter where  they are or where they live.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and  ranking member for their support and their kind words.   Mr. Speaker, I do rise today in support of H.R. 2123, the Veterans E- Health and Telemedicine Support Act, also known as the VETS Act.   Years ago, a constituent approached me to discuss the barriers to  care that his fellow veterans were experiencing through the VA system.  As an Active-Duty soldier, he told me stories of his friends coming  home from deployment and falling through the cracks of the system. Some  were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, TBIs, and  depression and required the care of specialists. Others had difficulty  traveling from their rural communities to VA medical centers because of  injuries sustained during combat. Too many of those wound up taking  their own lives.   It broke my heart to hear the stories of this soldier's friends and  comrades not receiving the care that they deserve. What made it more  difficult was the fact that this constituent soldier was my son.   After numerous conversations trying to figure out how we can help our  servicemembers when they return home, we determined that expanding  access to telehealth would be a great start. Many of our veterans live  in rural areas and are unable to travel far distances. Allowing them to  see their healthcare provider in the comfort of their home would  increase their access to care. This is why Representative Julia  Brownley and I introduced the VETS Act.    The VETS Act will allow VA-employed healthcare providers to practice  telehealth across State lines, no matter where the doctor or the  patient is located. It also commissions a report to study the  effectiveness of telemedicine programs utilized by the Department of  Veterans Affairs.   While the VA has made major strides and is a leader in advancing  telehealth access, outdated barriers limit its  [[Page H8558]]  growth. Currently, each State has its own licensing requirements for  healthcare providers to practice medicine within its borders. For  example, if a doctor practices in Pennsylvania and Ohio, they must hold  a license from each State.   VA-provider licensing requirements are different. As long as a doctor  is licensed and in good standing with a single State, they can practice  in-person care within the VA system in any State. This reciprocity,  however, is not afforded to the practice of telehealth. VA providers  seeking to provide telehealthcare to patients must also be licensed in  the State where the patient is located. These outdated regulations are  hurting our Nation's veterans.   The Department of Veterans Affairs has successfully been using  telemedicine for quite some time. Since 2002, more than 2 million  veterans have received telehealthcare through the VA. In 2016 alone,  more than 12 percent of veterans receiving VA care utilized telehealth  in some aspect. Forty-five percent of these veterans live in rural  areas.   Veterans who have accessed telehealth are overwhelmingly pleased with  the quality of care and access they received. Those receiving at-home  care, for example, through telehealth cite an 88 percent satisfaction  rate.   While the VA has done a great job of expanding telehealth access to  veterans across the country, more needs to be done. Our veterans  deserve the best care available to them, and this starts with the  passage of the VETS Act.   I thank Representative Brownley, Committee Chairman Dr. Phil Roe,  Ranking Member Tim Walz, and Chairman Bilirakis for bringing this bill  to the floor today.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the bill to give our  Nation's veterans access to quality, proven healthcare.
