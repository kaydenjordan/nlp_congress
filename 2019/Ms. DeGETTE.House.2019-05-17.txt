 Mr. Speaker, it is a fundamental precept of our  beautiful country that we have equality for all. But, sadly, in this  Nation, we have not had equality for every person until now.   Two-thirds of the LGBTQ community have faced discrimination, and this  is simply wrong, and it is simply un-American.   I thank Mr. Cicilline for bringing this important piece of  legislation to the floor.   How ironic that my LGBTQ constituents can get married to each other  but still, in 29 States, can be discriminated against in their jobs, in  public education, and even in their jury service.   This is wrong; this is un-American; and today's bill, the Equality  Act, rights this wrong that has been so long in coming.   I congratulate everybody.   I urge all of my colleagues to send a strong bipartisan statement:  This is America; everybody has equal rights in all areas.                                time  1100
