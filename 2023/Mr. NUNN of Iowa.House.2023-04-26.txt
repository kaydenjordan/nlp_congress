 Mr. Speaker, Americans are demanding action. The  President cannot put forth a budget that is 55 percent higher than it  was at prepandemic levels. We must get together and work with what  Chairman Arrington and the Speaker and House Republicans have put  forward: A budget that holds our government accountable, a budget that  addresses the debt ceiling now, gets Federal spending under control,  and grows our economy by letting Americans keep more of the money they  have earned.   That is why I am honored as part of the Iowa delegation to hold firm  in that America's fiscal security, energy security, and food security  can be led with us.   In Iowa, we will not allow government to balance its budget on the  backs of America's farmers. That is why I am proud that this bill makes  critical investments in biofuels. Biofuels empower American energy  independence. Biofuel infrastructure decreases the cost of fuels  overseas and helps our families at the pump. Biofuels grow our Main  Street businesses. Biofuels empower our farmers for what they need to  both feed and fuel the world.   I salute the Iowans and the Americans who have worked to balance  their own budgets every month, those who don't spend tirelessly and put  it on their credit card.
