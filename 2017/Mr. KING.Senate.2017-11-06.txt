 Mr. President, today we remember the life of Bernard  ``Bernie'' Shaw, who passed away earlier this year at the age of 88. As  a lifelong resident of Maine, a wonderful husband and father to three,  and a champion for agriculture, future generations will continue to  remember Bernie by the lasting impact he has left on the State.   Originally from Limestone, Bernie attend the Limestone schools and  later the University of Maine. It was after this that he met his  beloved wife, Norma. In over 65 years of marriage, Bernie and Norma  raised three children--Steve, Susan, and Sara--all while running a  successful family farm and giving back to their community in numerous  ways.   Bernie first began farming with Norma's father, Herman Ward, and  eventually took over the family business, before moving to Augusta in  1987. From 1988 to 1994, Bernie served the State of Maine as the  commissioner of agriculture. Over the years, he served on local, State,  and national level agriculture committees, drawing from his own  experience as a former Aroostook County potato farmer. Only a few out  of the many groups he championed for, Bernie devoted his time to the  Maine Potato Council, the Maine Potato Board, the Agricultural  Bargaining Council, and the Land For Maine's Future Board.   After retiring, Bernie devoted much of his time to volunteering at  the Augusta Food Bank, and the Windsor Fair. He was honored for this  commitment back in 2012, when he received the Agriculture  Commissioner's Distinguished Service Award, along with his wife, Norma.  Both were lauded for their weekly efforts with the food bank and their  success in expanding the number of families able to be helped.   Bernie Shaw represented in so many ways the values we hold dear in  Maine: family, faith, community, service, and tradition. We have much  to be thankful for in Maine because of Bernie's dedication and service  to the State, and he will be deeply missed by many.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  significance of Maine Veterans Cemetery-Caribou and the individual and  community spirit of generosity that sustains it as an honored and  hallowed resting place for our Nation's veterans.   Conceived in 1998, the Maine Veterans Cemetery in Caribou was created  because of a small but determined grassroots effort in Aroostook  County, ME, that I was proud to support when I was Governor of Maine  and am proud today to acknowledge as Senator for Maine. A diverse team  of dedicated people came together to create the Northern Maine Veterans  Cemetery Corporation, NMVCC, comprised of members from various veteran  service organizations, community members, and veterans themselves who  knew the significance of this undertaking. Since the first concept many  hands have helped develop and beautify these 46 acres which provide  inground burial for 12,000 and columbarium wall niches for over 1,000  more of our honorably discharged veterans. But this cemetery represents  so much more than a final resting place.   It is fitting to include in this statement the name of John T. Noble,  the distinguished veteran who epitomizes the efforts behind this  cemetery. John would not want all the credit to go to him, and indeed  there were many who worked tirelessly to make their dream come to  fruition; however, it was the late John T. Noble, along with his wife  Joyce, who made the first significant and lasting donation of 33 acres  of his family's land to honor veterans and their families for their  service and sacrifice. They went on to donate even more land and  provide countless donations to ensure this cemetery was one to be proud  of. John lived by example as a person of great ethics, compassion, and  generosity. He possessed these traits throughout his life as a member  of the U.S. Armed Forces, a businessman, a husband, and a quiet  philanthropist who didn't seek recognition for his good works. His  motivations were never about himself but about how he could give back  to others.   Our veterans risk their lives in the service to our great Nation.  They make countless personal sacrifices to protect freedom, and many go  on to continue to find ways to serve others--like the honorable efforts  of a small community in northern Maine to turn what once was farmland  into a reverent final resting place for those who gave so much. It is  my honor to recognize the Maine Veterans Memorial Cemetery-Caribou and  to pay tribute to John and Joyce Noble. Due to the generosity they  demonstrated, the northern region of Maine is able to provide a proper  final resting place for our brave veterans.                            ____________________
