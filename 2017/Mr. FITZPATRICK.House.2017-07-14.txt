 Mr. Chairman, perfluorinated compounds, namely PFOA  and PFOS, have been found in public and private drinking water wells in  communities surrounding over 600 military installations nationwide,  including several in my own district, impacting 70,000 Pennsylvanians.   While the military does not dispute its responsibility for the water  contamination, the response thus far has been unacceptable. For all of  our constituents, they all have the right to safe, clean drinking  water, and they deserve to know if PFOS or PFOA have compromised their  long-term health.   The bipartisan amendment I have introduced instructs the Secretary of  Defense to consult with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease  Registry to carry out a study on any health effects experienced by  those exposed to PFOS and PFOA at military installations or former  military installations.   While this study alone will not fix the serious concerns about water  contamination, it will provide us with critical information about the  health impact these unregulated chemicals may have, and aid the Federal  Government in conjunction with State and local agencies to reverse the  contamination and protect the health and welfare of our residents.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Mr. Speaker, this weekend, Bucks County,  Pennsylvania, welcomes the Vietnam Traveling Memorial Wall to Penndel  Memorial Field.   Fifty years ago, many brave women and men from Bucks and Montgomery  Counties were among the tens of thousands who would give their lives in  the Vietnam war. The traveling wall is a large-scale replica of the  memorial here in Washington, D.C. It moves around the Nation, providing  remembrance and healing to local communities like Bucks County, where  136 soldiers were killed or MIA during the Vietnam war.   I am proud of the Penndel-Hulmeville Memorial Day Parade Committee,  Ed Preston; Mike Fitzpatrick; Rich Rush; Vince and Lori Muscato; Mike  Sodano; Tom Preston; Ray Mongillo; Walt Davidson; Vicki McLaughlin;  Paul Shanahan; Paul and Alexandria Schnider; Dale Walton, Jr.; Carol  Beauchamp; Greg Woodrow; and all the volunteers and veterans for their  relentless effort to bring the Vietnam Traveling Memorial Wall to Bucks  County.   As we honor those who died in service of our Nation, we, too, thank  all of those who have served, and we pause to thank and think of those  who are defending our country today.                            ____________________
