 Mr. Speaker, an extraordinary highlight  for me on Friday was to live a momentous historic event live on FOX  News with the talented Harris Faulkner.   During a scheduled interview on the upcoming North Korean talks, it  became a prelude for the breaking news of the North Korean envoy  arriving at the White House to deliver the letter to President Donald  Trump from Kim Jong-un.   The past year has been a success for President Trump. We were  awaiting delivery of a letter to the White House instead of a  threatened delivery of a North Korean missile to vaporize the patriotic  American territory of Guam.   Beginning with the selection of Vice President Mike Pence, the  President has capable associates to work for peace through strength,  including Chief of Staff John Kelly, Secretary Mike Pompeo, Ambassador  John Bolton, and Ambassador Nikki Haley.   American families are safer today, and the China model for North  Korea is available for working with America, maintaining its leadership  while its citizens are enriched.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Congratulations, Harris Faulkner, on the book out today, ``9 Rules of  Engagement: A Military Brat's Guide to Life and Success.''                            ____________________
