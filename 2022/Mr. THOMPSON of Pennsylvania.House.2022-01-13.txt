 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address  President Biden's COVID crisis.   Sadly, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in the United States have  reached record highs in the past week. Many Americans are having  trouble finding COVID at-home tests and difficulties in scheduling a  time to be tested with their healthcare provider.   What is President Biden's response?   In a recent COVID Zoom meeting with Governors, President Biden said:  ``There is no Federal solution.''   Now, this mishandling of the pandemic is disappointing. Operation  Warp Speed, developed under the previous administration, provided  significant vaccines in record time. This initiative also established a  robust distribution plan, innovative treatments, medical equipment, and  ever-growing testing capacity.   Madam Speaker, in addition to this, our families are struggling to  pay for everyday goods as inflation reaches a 40-year high. We are  facing a self-inflicted economic crisis as this administration  encourages our workforce to stay home. Our students continue to face  uncertainty in their learning with last-minute school closures despite  schools receiving ample COVID relief funding.   To distract from these failures, President Biden and congressional  Democrats are trying to change the rules in the Senate to pass their  Socialist agenda.                            ____________________
