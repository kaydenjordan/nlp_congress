 Mr. Chair, I want to speak about the production  of the Tomahawk cruise missile.   The Tomahawk is a battle-tested weapon that has been used in combat  over 2,300 times. Tomahawks were launched in 2016 and again in April of  this year in response to the Syrian regime's use of chemical weapons.  The Tomahawk continues to be a credible, standoff weapon that provides  lethal effects while keeping American fighting men and women in  relative safety.   The 2018 National Defense Strategy prioritizes action against near- peer nations with significant area-denial capabilities. The Tomahawk is  the Nation's preferred weapon to carry out this difficult mission.  Halting production and devastating the missile's industrial base is  ill-advised as the threat of near-peer warfare increases.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the committee's support  for the program and was encouraged to see additional funding for  increased Tomahawk missile production in FY18. I would like to  emphasize that this funding was provided at the Navy's request.  However, I understand that the Navy recently informed the committee  that they intend to utilize this for purchasing support equipment  instead of missiles, as the committee intended.    Mr. Chair, I agree with the chairwoman that the  Navy's disregard for congressional direction and intent is  unacceptable. I appreciate her support for this important war-fighting  capability. I look forward to resolving this issue in conference.
