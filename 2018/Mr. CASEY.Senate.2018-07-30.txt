 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about an  important anniversary. Today marks 53 years since the Medicare and  Medicaid Programs have been created. I will speak specifically today  about Medicaid. Many Americans are familiar with all of the benefits  that Medicaid provides to so many Americans, but I don't know if people  have a sense of the scope of it.   First of all, Medicaid helps 70 million individuals and families in  every stage of life. Medicaid covers nearly half of every birth in the  United States of America. Medicaid covers 40 percent of all children  across the country. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, it is also  true that roughly 40 percent of all of the children have their  healthcare covered through Medicaid. Roughly 50 percent of the people  with disabilities in our State are covered by Medicaid, and about 60  percent of those who need skilled care, so-called nursing home care-- about 2 million Pennsylvanians--are covered by Medicaid.   Medicaid is currently considered the ``gold standard'' for children's  healthcare, which includes the early and periodic screening, diagnosis,  and treatment benefits, known as EPSDT. It doesn't get a lot of  attention, but a lot of the professionals who understand pediatrics and  children's healthcare will stress the importance of early and periodic  screening, diagnosis, and treatment.   Medicaid helps to prevent moms and dads from being forced into  deciding whether to put food on their tables or take a child to see a  doctor. Through Medicaid, 15 million people with disabilities receive  assistance with their healthcare or with durable medical equipment,  such as wheelchairs or assistive speaking devices, long-term supports  for daily living, such as personal care attendants, and so many other  benefits.   If you just focus on the category of Americans with disabilities who  are children, 60 percent of children in America with disabilities are  covered by Medicaid. Medicaid helps Americans afford their Medicare  premiums. That is the interplay between both the Medicaid Program and  the Medicare Program. Medicaid pays for nursing home care for older  relatives who otherwise would incur $75,000 per year of expenses, which  would force countless middle-class families out of their homes and  deprive them of their hard-earned savings.   How about our schools? Forty-eight percent of school districts use  Medicaid funds to provide medical and therapy services in schools for  children who receive special education.   Medicaid also funds transportation for eligible individuals to  receive medical services.   Finally, on this long list, Medicaid is the primary payer for the  treatment and services of opioid addiction, as well as for substance  use disorder services.   All of those issues are critically important to the American people  and especially, of course, to the American family. That is why last  year--and continuing into 2018--the efforts that have been made to  repeal the Affordable Care Act have had an adverse impact on Medicaid  by, in one sense, decimating the program and badly injuring our ability  to deliver all of those healthcare benefits to children, to people with  disabilities, to seniors. In virtually every bill that has been  considered in the Senate or the House, the effect on the opioid crisis  has been devastating because of what has happened to the expansion of  Medicaid as opposed to the original Medicaid Program itself.   I hope our Republican friends will consider all of those benefits and  the impact on Medicaid when they are proposing repeal legislation and  similar legislative proposals.   I will make a point about one family, which I think, in so many ways,  is emblematic of a lot of other families when it comes to Medicaid. In  Pennsylvania, I received a letter from a mom in Southeastern  Pennsylvania. Her name  [[Page S5446]]  is Pam Simpson. She was writing to me about her son, Rowan. The impact  on Rowan Simpson's life, like a lot of children's lives, is  incomparable. It is hard to comprehend how beneficial it has been.    As I said, his mom Pam sent me a note. Here is what she said, in  pertinent part. I will not read all of it, just an excerpt. She said:         In late January 2016, I applied for Medicaid assistance.    Medical Assistance, I should say. That is the Medicaid Program in  Pennsylvania, Medical Assistance.         After Rowan was awarded this assistance, we were able to       obtain wrap-around services, which included a Behavioral       Health Consultant (BSC) and a Therapeutic Staff Support       worker (TSS). . . . The wrap-around services have been a       Godsend.    Toward the end of the letter, Pam Simpson said:         Without Medicaid, I am confident that I could not work full       time to support our family. We would be bankrupt, or my son--    Meaning Rowan--       would go without the therapies he sincerely needs.    Pam Simpson concludes the letter this way:         Please think of my dear Rowan and his happy face, his big       blue eyes, and his lovely strawberry blonde hair. Please       think of me and my husband working every day to support our       family. Please think of my 9-month-old daughter, Luna, who       smiles and laughs at her brother daily; she will have to care       for Rowan later in her life after we are gone. Overall, we       are desperately in need of Rowan's Medicaid Assistance and       would be devastated if we lost these benefits.    That is one mom talking about her son in Pennsylvania, but of course  they are representative of so many families across the country.   All of us here know--it is pretty evident from the data on where we  are positioned in the world--that we are the strongest country in the  world--meaning the strongest economy--and that we are also the  strongest military power in the world. There is no question about that.  But that same country, that same strong country, over time has figured  out a way to take care of the American family, especially through a  program like Medicaid.   Hubert Humphrey said it well years ago. He may have even said this on  the Senate floor when he was representing Minnesota. Hubert Humphrey  said: ``The moral test of government is how it treats those who are in  the dawn of life . . . those who are in the twilight of life . . . and  those who are in the shadows of life.'' In a sense, he is talking about  children in the dawn of life, those with disabilities and others who  might be in the shadows of life, and those who are senior citizens in  the twilight of life.   No program touches more Americans than the Medicaid Program, and we  must continue to work to fight to keep Medicaid strong not just for the  next 50 years or 53 years--today is the anniversary--but for many years  after that.   I yield the floor.
