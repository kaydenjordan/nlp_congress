Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the  conclusion of my remarks, the Senator from Rhode Island be recognized.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern  with the tax reform bill that the Senate Finance Committee is likely to  approve later this week. The latest version of this massive tax bill,  which will impact every single American, was only released to the  public late Tuesday night. Less than 48 hours later, the Finance  Committee is ramming through this bill on a party-line vote without any  hearings and without a thorough review of the bill.   I strongly disagree with the closed-door process of developing the  substance of a bill which skews the benefits to the wealthy at the  expense of middle-class families and with this bill's irresponsible  cost of $1.7 trillion over 10 years. I also want to tell my colleagues  and the President that there is still an opportunity for us to do the  right thing and to work together on tax reform.   We should follow the example of the last time there was successful  tax reform enacted by Congress. This was led by Republican President  Ronald Reagan, Democratic Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill, and Members  of Congress from both parties, who worked together back in 1986 to pass  major tax reform legislation. Sure, they had strong disagreements, but  they held lengthy public debates, compromised on both sides of the  aisle, and eventually passed a major tax reform bill that was  bipartisan, was fair, and did not add to our deficits and national  debt.   For some reason, my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten the  example of the last time the Congress actually passed tax reform. It  happened because both parties worked together. It happened because both  parties compromised. And while I believe there is still time for us to  undertake this approach, what we are seeing right now is the exact  opposite. I think that is a big mistake.   When I am on the train back to Wilmington or when I am at home in my  State of Delaware hearing from my constituents, my message about this  bill is simple: I am worried what this bill will do to our fiscal  health as a country and the middle class, and you should be too.   Let me start by quoting a story from the Washington Post today whose  headline reads ``Senate tax bill cuts taxes of wealthy and hikes taxes  on families earning under $75,000 over a decade.'' Let me repeat that.  The Senate tax bill cuts the taxes of the wealthy and hikes taxes on  families earning under $75,000. The story is based on a report from the  nonpartisan Joint Commission on Taxation which shows that the claims  from President Trump and my Republican colleagues that this bill is all  about tax relief for the middle class are simply wrong.   I will quote from this story:         By the year 2027, Americans earning $30,000 to $75,000 a       year--    Solidly middle-class folks--       would also be forced to pay more in taxes even though people       earning over $100,000 would continue to get substantial tax       cuts.    Unfortunately, though, that is not the end of my concerns with this  legislation. I am also alarmed by how much this bill would add to our  Nation's budget deficits and by the long-term impacts it would have on  our debt.   According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, this tax  bill--this Republican-only tax bill--will cost over $1.7 trillion over  10 years. That is $1.7 trillion with a ``t.'' What happened to my  colleagues who spent years talking about the danger posed by a growing  national debt? Now these very same Senators and Representatives are  willing to put almost $2 trillion on our Nation's credit card. It is an  astounding figure--more than twice as large as the emergency stimulus  package Congress passed in 2009 to prevent the next Great Depression.  It is more than twice as much as the much maligned so-called bailout  that Congress authorized to prevent the collapse of the financial  system.   What does $1.7 trillion buy us? What is the great return on  investment that would justify borrowing $1.7 trillion--mostly from  China--in a time of near record-low unemployment? The Speaker of the  House, Paul Ryan, publicly bragged that their tax plan would produce 1  million jobs. That sounds good but not when you consider the cost. My  math may not be great, but if you spend $1.7 trillion to get 1 million  jobs, that is $1.5 million per job. That is not a great return on  investment.    To add insult to injury, the majority believes they can use this bill  to also cut access to healthcare for millions of Americans because they  have decided at the last moment to include a repeal of the Affordable  Care Act's individual mandate--a critical part of that bill--law, which  helps ensure a healthy risk pool, which, in turn, lowers premiums.   Those who actually work in healthcare know this is a bad idea. That  is why the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family  Physicians, the American Hospital Association, and America's Health  Insurance Plans have all come out against the inclusion of the  individual mandate repeal in this bill, saying that ``eliminating the  individual mandate by itself likely will result in a significant  increase in premiums, which would substantially increase the number of  uninsured Americans.''   The nonpartisan CBO agrees. They found that repealing the mandate  will cause 13 million people to lose their healthcare by 2027, and  average premiums would increase about 10 percent each year.   The inclusion of the mandate repeal to pay for corporate tax cuts  will hurt middle-class families across our country. It is politics at  its worst, throwing aside the needs of our constituents to ensure that  a small group of the wealthy get wealthy. That is because the core of  this bill is based on a promise proven false time and again--that tax  cuts for the richest Americans and most profitable corporations will  somehow trickle down to help the majority of working Americans. We know  that is not how our economy has actually worked. Even President  Reagan's own budget director, David Stockman, said yesterday that this  bill isn't going to increase wages for the middle class.   The Senate bill proposes we cut the top corporate rate nearly in  half; exempt more wealthy individuals from the estate tax, which  impacts only the top 0.2 percent of Americans; repeal the alternative  minimum tax, which affects those making hundreds of thousands annually;  and cut tax rates for those earning over $1 million.   Altogether, the core elements of this plan amount to $1.7 trillion in  tax cuts, and my Republican colleagues are simply asking us to trust  them that the benefits will somehow reach the middle class.   If that isn't enough to prove that this bill being rushed through in  today's markup is bad policy, my colleagues in the majority went one  step further in this latest version by eliminating all tax breaks for  middle-class families in 8 years while making the tax cuts for  corporations permanent. This means that millions of middle-class  families will see a tax hike in the future in order to fund permanency  for corporate tax breaks. That is just not right.   So here is what I think we should do. Let's slow down. Let's work  together, Republicans and Democrats, to pass a bill that is actually  good for all Americans. I believe we can get that done. I think it is  our job and our duty. We don't have to start from scratch. There are  bipartisan ideas. There are introduced, bipartisan tax bills that could  make our code simpler and fairer and more effective.   I will mention two examples of bills I have introduced--one with  Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito and another with Republican  Senator Pat Roberts--that encourage manufacturers to use made-in- America parts and incentivize companies that invent something here to  make it here. I have introduced another bill with Republican Senator  Jerry Moran--it has eight bipartisan cosponsors--and with Republican  Congressman Ted Poe that would alter the Tax Code to boost  [[Page S7283]]  every aspect of the American energy industry, from oil and gas to the  latest renewable and clean energy technologies. These are just a few  ideas, but they represent a simple truth: that we can and should work  together on tax reform instead of making this one more pointless,  partisan battle.   The same thing is true for our healthcare system. The American people  have overwhelmingly said they want a bipartisan and open process to fix  healthcare, not a one-party scheme by either party that throws our  system into chaos with no plan to replace it.   I encourage President Trump and Republican leaders to stop trying to  pass tax reform with only Republicans and to reach across the aisle to  work with Democrats and pass something we can all get behind.
