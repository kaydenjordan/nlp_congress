 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate the newly- elected national FFA president, Cole Baerlocher, who hails from the  great State of Washington. Cole, a native of Colfax, is now honored  with this tremendous opportunity to represent our State and our entire  Nation.   For more than 90 years, FFA has provided students with premier  leadership training through agricultural education and advocacy. As a  former FFA member myself, I can attest that my experience not only  helped shape my career as a farmer, but helped prepare me to represent  the Fourth District of Washington in Congress.   Throughout his year of service to FFA, Cole and his fellow national  officers will lead workshops and conferences across the country,  cultivate relationships with national agriculture leaders, and help set  policies that will guide the future of FFA.   Cole: Washington's entire agricultural community is proud to have you  representing us, and we look forward to following your journey on  behalf our Nation's producers.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to please join me in  congratulating our national FFA officers.                            ____________________
