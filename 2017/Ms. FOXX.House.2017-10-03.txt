 Mr. Speaker, I would like to share some information about  the Unified Tax Reform Framework that was released last week by  Republicans in the House of Representatives.  [[Page H7682]]    I think it is important that, with all of the sad news coming out  this week in the country, particularly in Puerto Rico and Las Vegas, we  do share with the American people some information that will be so  important to them long term and will help our economy get a good jump  start.   Incidentally, last quarter, our economy grew at 3.1 percent, but very  few people have heard about that, and it is important that we point  that out.   Mr. Speaker, the material provided by the Ways and Means Committee is  extraordinarily valuable, and I also would encourage people to go on  the Ways and Means' website and on my website and on individual  websites of Members to gain more information about this framework.   First, it lowers the rates for individuals and families. The  framework shrinks the current seven tax brackets into three: 12  percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent. And actually, Mr. Speaker, many  more Americans will pay no taxes as a result of the tax reform, because  we are going to double the standard deduction and enhance the child tax  credit.                                time  1100    The framework roughly doubles the standard deduction so that typical  middle class families will keep more of their paycheck. It also  significantly increases the child tax credit. It eliminates loopholes  for the wealthy and protects bedrock provisions for the middle class.  It repeals the death tax and alternative minimum tax.   Mr. Speaker, dying should not be a taxable event. It is important  that we not tax people, particularly farmers and small businesses, at  the death of a businessowner or farmowner.   It creates a new lower tax rate structure for small businesses. It  will help to create jobs and promote competitiveness by lowering the  corporate tax rate. So that Americans can compete on a level playing  field, the framework reduces the corporate tax rate to 20 percent,  below the 22.5 percent average of the industrialized world.   It will boost the economy by allowing for expensing of capital  investments. The framework allows, for at least 5 years, businesses to  immediately write off or expense the cost of new investments, giving a  much-needed lift to the economy.   It moves to an American model for competitiveness. The framework ends  the perverse incentives to offshore jobs and keep foreign profits  overseas. It levels the playing field for American companies and  workers by allowing the profits achieved overseas to come back by  imposing a one-time low tax rate on wealth that is already accumulated  overseas so there is no tax incentive to keep the money offshore.   Mr. Speaker, we need to get our economy booming again to create jobs  and to make our country much greater than it is today. I endorse this  framework put out by the Ways and Means Committee and look forward to  the work that is going to be done by the committee as it refines the  framework and brings forth a bill for us to vote on.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Georgia for her  leadership on this issue.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn  Child Protection Act.   The United States currently stands alongside North Korea, China, and  Vietnam as one of only seven countries that allow elective abortion to  occur after 20 weeks postfertilization.   At this point in their life, unborn babies have a well-developed  brain and nervous system as well as pain receptors. This fetal  development is observed by surgeons who routinely see these unborn  children react to pain. In fact, doctors administer anesthesia to these  children in the womb during fetal surgeries.   I am proud to support this bill, also known as Micah's Law, because  we must care for these unborn children, not cruelly inflict pain and  deny them their inherent dignity by treating them as objects.   One day, I hope that a cultural life will take hold in the United  States and that all children will be protected under the law. However,  until that day comes, it remains my solemn duty to stand up for life.  Regardless of the length of this journey, I will continue to speak for  those who cannot.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote to protect the Nation's  most vulnerable children and ensure they are not subject to  unimaginable pain and to affirm life by voting in favor of this bill.
