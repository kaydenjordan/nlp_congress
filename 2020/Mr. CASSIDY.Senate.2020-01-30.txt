 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on  behalf of myself and Senator Risch to both the House managers and the  White House counsel. And although I cannot pick, ideally, it would be  Manager Lofgren.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question from Senators Cassidy and Risch for  both parties is as follows:         In the Clinton proceedings, we saw a video of Manager       Lofgren saying, ``This is unfair to the American people. By       these actions you would undo the free election that expressed       the will of the American people in 1996. In so doing, you       will damage the faith the American people have in this       institution and in the American democracy. You will set the       dangerous precedent that the certainty of Presidential terms,       which has so benefited our wonderful America, will be       replaced by the partisan use of impeachment. Future       Presidents will face election, then litigation, then       impeachment. The power of the President will diminish in the       face of the Congress, a phenomena much feared by the Founding       Fathers.''        What is different now? If the response is that the country       cannot risk the President interfering in the next election,       isn't impeachment the ultimate interference? How does this       not cheat those who did and/or would vote for President Trump       from their participation in the democratic process? I ask       Manager Lofgren to address the question directly and to not       avoid, as Manager Jeffries did with a related question last       night.    The President's counsel answers first.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S713, January 30, 2020, second column, the following  appears: Oh. The President's counsel answers first.      The online Record has been corrected to read: The President's  counsel answers first.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the  Senate.   Well, as I have said before, I agree 100 percent with Manager  Lofgren's comments from the past, and I think they should guide the  Senate. There is really no better way to say it.   What they are doing here--they keep falsely accusing the President of  wanting to cheat, when they are coming here and telling you ``take him  off the ballot'' in a political impeachment. Talk about cheating. You  don't even want to face him.   And let me say one more thing while I am up here. I listened to  Manager Schiff come up here and say he won't even dignify a legitimate  question about his staff with a response because he won't stand here  and listen to people on his staff be besmirched--who will join his  staff.   Since the beginning of this Congress, Manager Schiff, the other House  managers, and others in the House have falsely accused the President-- and they have come here and done it--the Vice President, the Secretary  of State, the Attorney General, the Chief of Staff, lawyers on my  staff--false accusations, calumny after calumny, in dulcet tones. And  that is wrong.   And when you turn that around and say he will not respond to a  legitimate question that I ask--it is a legitimate question: Who  communicated with the whistleblower? Why were you demanding something  that you already knew about?   I asked him, in another part of my October 8 letter that doesn't get  a lot of attention from Mr. Schiff--I said: You have the full ability  to release these documents on your own. No response.   So I think--I think you deserve an answer to that question, and I  think it is time in this country that we start--that we stop assuming  that everybody has horrible motives, in the puritanical rage of just  everybody is doing something wrong except for you--you cannot be  questioned. That is part of the problem here.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, I was a member  of the House Judiciary Committee during the Clinton impeachment, and I  was a member of the staff of a member of the Judiciary Committee during  the Nixon impeachment. And during the Clinton impeachment, I found  myself comparing what we were doing in Clinton to what we were doing or  had done with Nixon, and here is what I saw and I still see today: a  special prosecutor started with Whitewater, spent several years, until  they found DNA on a blue dress. And they had a lie. The President lied  about a sexual affair under oath, and that was wrong. It was a crime,  but it was not a misuse of Presidential power.   Any husband caught would have lied about it. It was wrong, but it was  not a misuse of Presidential power. And so, throughout the Clinton  matters, I kept raising the issue that it was a misuse--and it turned  out to be a partisan misuse--of impeachment to equate a lie about a  sexual affair to a high crime and misdemeanor.  [[Page S714]]    Mr. Markey said they rubbed out the word ``high'' and made it ``any  crime and misdemeanors.'' That was what was wrong in the Clinton  impeachment, compared to the Nixon impeachment where Richard Nixon  engaged in a broad scope, upending the constitutional order, corrupting  the government for his own personal benefit in the election.    I would add, unfortunately, that I never thought I would be in a  third impeachment. Unfortunately, that is what we see in this case with  President Trump.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Ms. Manager.   The Senator from West Virginia.
