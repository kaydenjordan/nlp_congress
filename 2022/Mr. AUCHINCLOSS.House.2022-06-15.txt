 Mr. Speaker, our economy has not always worked for  everyone equally. This is evident in the glaring wealth disparities for  American families emphasized in the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances  Federal Reserve report. Chairwoman Waters' Financial Services Racial  Equity, Inclusion, and Economic Justice Act is an effort to ease  economic disparities across racial and ethnic groups. The bill will  also expand access to financial services for consumers and small  businesses in underserved communities.    Consumers should have access to affordable banking services, which  requires competition in the market. Over the last several decades,  there has been consolidation amongst banks and credit unions. This has  effectively limited the products available to consumers and  artificially driven up costs while closing banking branches for people  who already did not have many choices.   The Financial Services Racial Equity, Inclusion, and Economic Justice  Act includes my bipartisan bill, the Promoting New and Diverse  Depository Institutions Act, which is the first step to expand  competition and increase the supply of banking services. My bill  directs banking regulators to work together to address the challenges  that new depository institutions, including MDIs and CDFIs, face when  applying for a charter.   Starting and maintaining a new bank or credit union is hard work. It  is the banking regulators' responsibility to measure and mitigate the  challenges that new banks face. My bill will help new banks, and in  doing so will expand access to affordable services for underbanked  communities.   The legislation we are considering today also includes other  necessary equity bills, such as Congresswoman Garcia's, which expands  language access in mortgage services. Congressman Green's bill would  clarify that sexual orientation and gender identity are protected  classes under credit discrimination.   I applaud Chairwoman Waters' leadership on this bill, and I urge my  colleagues to support it.                                time  1300     Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Pride Month  by recognizing an LGBTQ-owned local business, The Good Hound.   The Good Hound offers off-leash hikes, pet sitting, training, and  socialization in my hometown of Newton. I first met owner Shannon Wood  when my dog, Donut, joined the group of dogs he helps take care of  every day. Every June, we look forward to seeing Donut and all her  friends sport pride bandanas as they join Haley for jaunts around our  neighborhood.   Pride Month is a time to celebrate the LGBTQ individuals we all know  and love who are crucial parts of our communities, economy, and  families. Congress must stand up and support small, LGBTQ-owned  businesses across the country that serve our constituents every day. My  family and Newton as a whole are better for the dedication, cheer, and  openness Shannon brings to The Good Hound.                            ____________________
