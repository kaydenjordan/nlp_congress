 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy,  and I appreciate his leadership on this issue.   I have listened to my friends on the other side of the aisle, and I  am saddened that they somehow feel that this is boiling down to some  sort of notion of choice, discrimination against African Americans.   Let's get a grip here. The cigarette is the only product which, if  used as directed, will kill you. That is why Big Tobacco has become a  genius at marketing. They have to replace their customers that they  kill every day by the thousands.   That is why they are looking at being able to hook, especially, young  people who are more impressionable, and they will smoke longer if they  are addicted.   That is how they hooked my father. He was part of the GIs in the  Pacific who got free cigarettes and became addicted. It killed him.   This is the latest chapter in this insidious marketing juggernaut.   I am sorry, it is not discrimination against African Americans who  somehow have a genetic predisposition toward menthol flavoring. That is  the result of tactics by Big Tobacco, by using advertising, politics,  culture to target this population, and it has been successful. Their  use is much higher than the general population.   Dealing with vaping and e-cigarettes is the latest chapter in that  recruitment that they have to replace the customers who die.   Well, I would suggest that, first and foremost, it is widely  understood that taxation is the single most effective mechanism to  discourage use, especially for young people. We are doing it in this  legislation, and it is important.   Now, I have heard my friends on the other side of the aisle, my good  friend from Oregon, holding up two charts, products that will be  illegal, that are widely available now, and then talking about cannabis  products and that there is no regulation.                                time  1045    Well, that is because we have failed to actually deal with regulating  cannabis. That is like regulating flavored  [[Page H1275]]  heroin. When we tax and regulate cannabis--and we have legislation that  has passed out of the Judiciary Committee that would enable us to have  regulation. The Commerce Committee is looking at being able to  research, but we are prohibited by outmoded Federal law from actually  being able to research this.   The challenge that we have now is to be able to move forward, to be  able to protect young people and the public.   Cannabis is a red herring. If we tax and regulate it, then we can  deal with the products they are talking about. But unless and until, as  two-thirds of the States have done, we actually tax and regulate it, we  can't deal with that. That doesn't matter.   But today we can do something. Today, we can move this legislation  forward to protect young people, to have a reasonable tax mechanism, to  be able to finally strike a blow against the Big Tobacco marketing  juggernaut that is e-cigarettes and flavored tobacco.   I strongly urge support of this legislation. I appreciate what has  been done going forward. We should not fall for the phony argument that  somehow because we haven't regulated cannabis, we haven't solved the  problem.
