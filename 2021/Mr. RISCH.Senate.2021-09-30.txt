 Mr. President, first of all, I ask permission to use an  item to demonstrate in the speech that I am going to give, please.    Mr. President, fellow Senators, and the American public, I  rise today to underscore a travesty that is about to take place here in  about an hour on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I am talking about the  BLM matter, the Bureau of Land Management matter, the nominee the  President of the United States has made to run the Bureau of Land  Management as the Director of the Bureau of Land Management. That  person is Tracy Stone-Manning.   I think the facts have pretty well been laid out already in the  media. At the same time, there is tremendous outrage, I can tell you,  amongst not only BLM employees but among the people who earn their  living and recreate on the millions of acres of BLM. It is incredible,  it is astonishing, and it is an embarrassment for this administration  to nominate a person who is an ecoterrorist and a person who has  perjured themselves before the committee that she appeared before on  her confirmation and, in addition to that, has espoused a ``let it  burn'' philosophy for people's homes that she will take an oath to  defend if she becomes head of the BLM, which I believe she is going to  before the Sun goes down today.   It is amazing to me that the administration would put this person in  this position. There are 330 million people in America. Almost every  single one of those people, including some high school kids, could do  this substantially better than she could and would not tarnish the name  of the BLM, which is going to happen when she is confirmed as the  Director of the BLM.   So what did she do? Well, she engaged in acts of ecoterrorism. She  engaged in a conspiracy to kill other people. She engaged in acts with  Earth First! that put her squarely in the target of the U.S.  Government, along with her cohorts with whom she lived in a house in  Montana at the time. But she got off the hook. She didn't get  prosecuted because she turned on the others and turned state's  evidence. She hired an attorney, and that attorney  [[Page S6822]]  negotiated with the U.S. attorney there, and she wound up testifying  against the others, so she wasn't convicted. Nonetheless, she was as  deeply involved in this as they were.   Let me read for you a letter that she wrote. She admits to writing  this letter:         To whom it may concern, this letter is being sent to notify       you that the Post Office Sale in Idaho has been spiked       heavily.    The post office sale was a Forest Service sale of standing timber in  the Clearwater National Forest in Idaho. She writes this letter  regarding that.         The reasoning for this action is that this piece of land is       very special to the earth. It is home to the Elk, Deer,       Mountain Lions, Birds, and especially the Trees.    She is absolutely correct on that.   The next paragraph describes what she did.         The project required that eleven of us--    Most of whom lived in that house in Montana--         spend nine days in God awful weather conditions spiking       trees. We unloaded a total of five hundred pounds of spikes       measuring 8 to 10 inches in length.    For people who don't understand what spiking trees is, and most  people in America wouldn't, you think, how could it be harmful in going  out and putting a spike in a tree?   This is a spike. It is not a particularly large one, but it doesn't  take a particularly large one. What they do is they drive this item  into a tree. They drive it in far enough that you can't see it. It then  stands there until some unsuspecting logger comes along and cuts the  tree down. That logger could be injured, but it is unlikely they will  be, but they could be because of the hidden spike that was in the tree.   The tree is then, after it is cut down, cut into length--usually 16  foot--put onto a truck, and hauled to the mill. Once it gets to the  mill, it is put in a millpond. It is then pushed eventually into the  mill, and when it enters the mill, it goes on a carriage, and the  carriage carries it to a saw. The saw may move back and forth, cutting  the wood that is on this log in the carriage, or more likely, the  carriage itself will move against the moving saw.   There are a couple kinds of saws. One is a circular saw. It could be  5 feet. Depending on the size of the mill, it could 5 feet, 6 feet, 10  feet. But in today's world, more often than not, it is a bandsaw. A  bandsaw is a piece of metal stripping that is a quarter-inch thick or  so and probably a couple inches wide with teeth, and it circulates in  the mill between the first floor, the second floor, even the third  floor. As the carriage hits it, it then saws the log into boards.   All is well unless there is one of these in the log. What happens  when that saw hits this item in the log? In the best description I can  give you, it is much like a hand grenade going off, except that  there is no fire explosion, but there is just as much shrapnel that  goes out of this at a speed that is very, very fast because all of the  moving parts are moving very fast. And what does it do? It kills, and  it injures log workers who are right there on the floor.    These are innocent people. They are people who are working to make a  living for themselves, for their families, for their children. They are  people who go to work in the morning and do not come home because  someone knowingly, intentionally, maliciously, with a black and an  abandoned heart, stuck one of these in the tree. That is the only  reason you put one of these in a tree, is to kill and maim fellow human  beings who are absolutely innocent and who have done nothing wrong.   She was involved in this. This person whom the administration wants  to run the Bureau of Land Management, which manages millions of acres,  the largest tracts of land in the United States of America--they want  to put this woman in charge of this Agency. They sell timber all the  time. She will be in charge of that. There is no need for this woman to  be in charge of this Agency. There are plenty of people who could do  this.   Today, in the Clearwater National Forest, those trees are still  there. Some of them will be there for 100 or more years. It is very  possible one of these is going to kill somebody working in one of the  mills at some point in time after all of us are dead and gone.   They will ask at that time: How did this happen?   They will say: Well, a woman who eventually became head of the BLM  was involved in putting these spikes in these trees here.   People will shake their heads and say: What were those people  thinking? That is shameful. It is despicable.   Yet that is what is about to happen here.   Now, that was a while ago that this happened, but what has happened  recently?   She will be in charge of firefighting. Firefighting is absolutely  critical on public lands in the West. We need it on Forest Service  land; we need it on Bureau of Land Management land. But, like I said,  she has embraced the idea that letting fires burn and burning down the  houses that are in the interface zones is perfectly fine.   How do we know this? It is in writing. It is absolutely in writing.  There was an article written, fortuitously, by her husband in 2018 but  which she embraced on September 15, 2020, in a tweet, and I will get to  the tweet in a minute. But this is the view that her husband takes of  what should happen to houses--perfectly innocent people's houses--that  are built near public lands. The idea is, let it burn.   He says:         But the federal government then needs to make fighting       wildfires--a social process--subject to a social contract.       Perhaps the feds should commit themselves to refusing to send       in the troops to any county that has not taken such measures.       Perhaps the solution to houses in the interface is to let       them burn.    He says:         There's a rude and satisfying justice in burning down the       house of someone who builds in the forest.    She embraced this. Just a little over a year ago, she put out a tweet  and said:         Not a bad time to revisit this piece from my husband,       Richard Manning, from two years ago. [This is a] clarion       call.    ``Let them burn,'' she says; a clarion call to let people's homes  burn.   She put that out on September 15, 2020, just a little over a year  ago. This is the person we are going to confirm to fight fires and  protect people's homes in the West.   All of us in the West live relatively close to the interface zones,  and many people, millions of people, live in the interface zones. She  is saying it is a clarion call to let them burn, and, indeed, they will  get a rude and satisfying justice in burning down the houses that were  built in the interface zone.   You can't make this stuff up. If someone wrote a book about this,  someone would toss it and say: That is too ridiculous. This could never  happen.   This is the woman this U.S. Senate is going to confirm on a straight  party-line vote in about an hour here.   So she comes before the committee, and although we didn't have all of  the facts at the time, as has been alluded to by my colleagues here, we  were aware that she had attachments to ecoterrorist groups. So some  questions were put to her, and as always happens before the committee,  they are required to be signed under oath, which she did, and she was  asked whether or not she had ever been arrested or charged or been the  target of an investigation involving spiking. She says--now under oath  after solemnly swearing to tell the truth--``No, I have never been  arrested or charged, and to my knowledge, I have never been the target  of such an investigation.''   She hired an attorney to negotiate with the U.S. attorney because she  was a target of the investigation, had received a target letter, and  had been told she was a target of that.   What are we doing here? How in the world can somebody come before a  committee, take an oath that they would tell the truth, and then flat  lie?   She was also asked: Did you have personal knowledge of--did you have  personal knowledge of--participate in, or in any way, directly or  indirectly, support activities associated with the spiking of trees in  Idaho's Clearwater National Forest on March 29, 1989?   We read the letter she wrote where she admitted that she was involved  in that.   Her answer to that: ``I had no involvement in the spiking of trees.''  Under oath, she said that. We know otherwise.   She said, ``Eleven of us [spent] nine days in God awful weather  conditions  [[Page S6823]]  spiking trees,'' and she under oath says, ``No.''   Next question: Did you have personal knowledge of, participate in, or  in any way, directly or indirectly, support activities associated with  the spiking of trees in any forest during your lifetime?   Answer: ``No.''   We know better. She admitted to signing this letter where she fessed  up to it.   Well, look, I know I am not going to talk the Democrats out of  confirming her. I can tell you that this is a shameful, shameful thing  for the administration to do. It is a shameful thing for my friends in  the majority to confirm her.   What I can tell you is, when she comes before the committee that we  sit on, where we have oversight of the BLM--and we have the Director in  regularly because we have oversight responsibility--how will we believe  one word she says when she has already perjured herself?   This is wrong. It is a shameful moment for this administration. I can  tell you the employees of the Bureau of Land Management are going to  have a very difficult time working under a person who is an  ecoterrorist and who is a perjurer. She should not be confirmed.   I yield the floor.
