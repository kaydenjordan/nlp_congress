 Mr. Speaker, too many Americans face severe  discrimination because of whom they love.   LGBTQ rights are civil rights. They are human rights.   Participating and contributing equally, regardless of gender identity  or sexual orientation, brings us closer to the self-evident truth that,  while we are not all created the same, in a just democracy, we are all  created equally.   Despite State Republican hostility, City of Austin ordinances have  long protected against the same discrimination we are combating today.  City contractors have complied with these ordinances, whose  requirements set the standard for our community.   Both Austin and San Antonio enjoy perfect municipal Equality Index  scores from the Human Rights Campaign. With this bill, we set the same  type of standard for our entire country.   Mr. Speaker, 1,400 businesses in the Texas Competes coalition have  sent a clear message in favor of inclusion and against discrimination.   We need strong Federal enforcement. That is what this bill does.    Mr. Speaker, we need strong Federal enforcement since  local governments have imperfect tools and often have been stifled by  narrow-minded State legislatures.  [[Page H3946]]    No American's civil rights should depend upon their ZIP Code. Don't  stand in the doorway. Let's pass the Equality Act today.   Among many who have been strong advocates for this act, I  particularly honor Sam Smoot and Robert Salcido with Equality Texas;  Julian Tovar and Sissi Yado with the Human Rights Campaign; and, of  course, our colleagues, Congressman Cicilline and Congressman Pocan.
