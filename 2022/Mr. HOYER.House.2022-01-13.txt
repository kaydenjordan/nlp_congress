 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am old enough to have grown up and become cognizant of  public affairs in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It is ironic that  today, I am hearing the language of interposition of States' rights.  There were a lot of States' rights in the 1950s and the 1940s and  1960s. And John Lewis will tell you those States' rights kept people  from voting, from participating, from playing a role.   Now, we have legislation before us that will ensure, as the Voting  Rights Act of 1965 assured, that people would not be shut out by  States' rights by people who wanted to keep certain other people from  voting and participating in their State's elections, in their county's  election, in their municipal election, in their city election.   I have heard a lot about States' rights. I am old enough to have  heard about what States' rights meant. They meant don't butt in to  assure that  [[Page H163]]  every United States citizen, one nation, under God, indivisible. But we  were divisible. We were divisible by color and by other arbitrary and  unjustified distinctions. So we are here today to say that is not  America. That is not one nation under God, indivisible.   So, yes, all the States will be covered because we want all States to  comply, and they will not have a thing to worry about under this  legislation if they have not had violations within the 20-year period.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, we will mark what would have been Dr. Martin  Luther King, Jr.'s, 93rd birthday. When he was born in 1929, it had  only been 9 years, just 9 years from the date of his birth that women  were given the opportunity to vote in America. How sad that it took us  so long. When he was born in 1929, it had only been 9 years since the  19th amendment had been passed, and it had only been 64 years since the  amendments ending slavery and ostensibly guaranteeing the right to vote  for African Americans.   But that constitutional amendment was not honored. And ways and means  were found to prevent people from voting, from registering. And so,  yes, the Supreme Court passed the decision in Shelby v. Holder, Shelby  in Alabama, a county that had discriminated greatly and was  discriminating at that point in time. And as soon as the Supreme Court  said this is no longer necessary, we saw a cascade of new laws to  restrict access to the ballot box--a cascade.   When Dr. King was born, neither African-American men or African- American women could cast ballots and participate in our democracy in  many States and jurisdictions, North and South. Before he was killed,  at just 39 years of age, Dr. King led a movement to correct the  injustices that had come about because for so long many Americans had  no recourse to participate in our democracy or pursue opportunities  equally because their States felt they had the right to discriminate.  That is what State rights were in my generation. And apparently, the  concept still exists, but that is the right.   The right to vote is the guarantee to all others. Dr. King joined by  other giants of the Civil Rights Movement, including our dear friend  and brother. My, my, my, G.K. and I were just saying how sad we are  that John Lewis is not on this floor, who gave blood and almost his  life but lived his life to assure that every American had the right to  vote and was facilitated in that right.   Dr. King, joined by other giants of the Civil Rights Movement,  including our friend and brother, John Lewis, used the tools of  nonviolent, peaceful protest in organizing to expose the hypocrisy of a  system that called itself a democracy but did not allow all of its  citizens to share in electing leaders.   Each year, on Martin Luther King, Jr.'s, birthday, Americans reflect  on the lessons of his life and on the Civil Rights Movement as though  they formed a chapter in America's past. Would that they mirrored  simply the past. But if we look around us today, there can be no doubt  that the fight for our democracy is very much a part of our present.   Now, this is a radical bill that will allow process of the United  States Senate that is a failing practice. The majority will rule on  debating this bill--the majority. It is not a radical proposal that the  majority of the Senate that is for this bill. When people get up and  say, Oh, this bill can't pass. The only reason it can't pass is because  the minority will stop it, if they can. I hope they can't. I hope they  change the rules. I am an opponent of the filibuster. It is  undemocratic, and as Hamilton said, it poisons democracy.   The right to vote has not been so endangered since Dr. King walked  among us. But there is a remedy. It is not perfect but it will go a  long way toward turning back the tide of voter suppression in  protecting the fundamental right to vote. One nation, under God,  indivisible. All of us could vote. The legislation incorporated into  this bill represents the boldest and most consequential voting rights  reforms in a generation.   I was the sponsor of the Help America Vote Act. It was called then a  very consequential bill. It was not nearly as consequential as this  bill will be in empowering every person eligible to vote. And by the  way, every citizen, from my perspective, to vote, so there is no  mischaracterization of my view.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler, Representative Sewell,  Representative Sarbanes, Chairwoman Beatty, and the entire  Congressional Black Caucus, and literally hundreds of Members who  through the years have fought to protect this sacred right.   In addition to providing for automatic online and same-day voter  registration, the Freedom to Vote Act will make Election Day a Federal  holiday--a holy day, if you will--in the pursuit of our secular  commitment to democracy. It will guarantee at least 15 days of early  voting.   Isn't that terrible? Well, it must be terrible because many States  throughout the country are cutting those days down. Why? I don't know.  If you vote on Tuesday as opposed to Thursday, is there more fraud  involved? I don't know. It will guarantee those days and two weekends  while ending requirements for difficult-to-obtain photo ID. It doesn't  eliminate ID. If States have ID, it does not eliminate that.   Importantly, this legislation will restore voting rights to those who  have paid their debts to society. And it will ensure that those who  cast eligible ballots provisionally in the wrong precincts will still  have their votes counted.   As the sponsor of the Help America Vote Act in 2002, that provision  was in the Federal law. This bill would limit partisan gerrymandering  and remove the corrosive influence of dark money. My mother used to  tell me, consider the source. If the money is dark and you don't know  who is paying the bill for the talk that is being given to you, you  can't make that judgment. You can't determine who the source is. When  it comes to defending the integrity of our elections and our democracy,  this legislation is absolutely needed in America.   Not only will it prohibit the removal of election officials without  cause, which is happening because a President calls up and says,  ``Can't you find some more votes?'' That was the asking of some elected  official, Secretary of State of Georgia, to commit a crime. Talk about  fraud in elections.   This will enable the EAC to provide State and local boards of  election with grants to upgrade outdated voting equipment and protect  against hackers and cyber threats. It wasn't until 2003 that the  Federal Government paid part of the election costs incurred in electing  Federal officials, also restoring the full force of the 1965 Voting  Rights Act, which was undermined by Shelby v. Holder, applying it to  every State--not discrimination.   If you break the law in any State, if you preclude people from  legitimate voting in any State, you are covered under this legislation.  We don't pick out any actor. Every State is included. We apply it to  every State. And updating it for the 21st century, the Freedom to Vote  Act has the power to restore trust that our elections are fair and that  every eligible voter will be able to participate.   House Democrats have passed voting rights measures multiple times,  this Congress sending both H.R. 1 and H.R. 4 to the Senate. The  majority is for it, but the filibuster stops it. The minority controls  the majority.                                time  1015    Madison said that was not democracy. Now, the Senate must act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Senators to come together on Monday and approve  this historic voting rights legislation for our time. We have the  opportunity.   I share G. K. Butterfield's sadness that John Lewis is not on this  floor to cast his vote. Very frankly, I would have yielded all the time  I have taken to John Lewis to talk to us about how important this  legislation is and how many people gave their lives and their blood and  their time and their talent to accomplish an America where no person  would be shut out of the ballot box.   In future years, I hope Americans will be able to celebrate Martin  Luther King Jr. Day by reflecting not only on how our country overcame  Jim Crow in the 20th century but how we prevented its return in 2022.   I know we have heard, ``Oh, this is not Jim Crow.'' No matter how  subtle the discrimination may be, it is discrimination.  [[Page H164]]    I ask Members to cast your vote for this bill today, so our citizens  can cast their votes without hindrance and share equally in the making  of our laws and in the shaping of our future. Vote ``yes.''    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Scalise for yielding.   Madam Speaker, on Tuesday the House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning  hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business with votes postponed, as  usual, until 6:30 p.m.   On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning  hour and 12 p.m. for legislative business.   And again, as usual, on Friday the House will meet at 9 a.m. for  legislative business.   The House, Madam Speaker, will consider Senate 2959, the Supplemental  Impact Aid Flexibility Act under suspension of the rules. This bill  passed the Senate unanimously. It is on suspension in the House. It is  coauthored by Representative   Joe Courtney of the House.   This bipartisan legislation allows local educational agencies  participating in the Impact Aid Program to use the student count or  Federal property valuation data from their fiscal year 2022 program  applications for their fiscal year 2023 applications.   This, Madam Speaker, will prevent schools from losing substantial  funding upon which they have relied to address COVID-19 learning loss  by giving them more flexibility to use prepandemic data to calculate  funding needs.   The House may consider other bills under suspension of the rules. The  complete list of suspension bills will be announced by the close of  business tomorrow.   The House will also consider H.R. 4673, the EVEST Act sponsored by  Chairman Mark Takano of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the rule for  which we adopted this week.   This legislation would automatically enroll eligible veterans into  the VA healthcare system so that no veterans are left behind when it  comes to receiving quality, affordable healthcare.   Lastly, Madam Speaker, the House stands ready to act on the Build  Back Better Act, as well as the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act  should the Senate amend them and send them back to us.   Additional legislative items, of course, are possible.    Madam Speaker, because I don't have it in front of me, and  I haven't read it as carefully as perhaps I should have, I don't know  the specific answer to that question.   What I do want to say, however, is that we need to have kids in  school. Everybody says that the learning experience is substantially  compromised by virtual learning. It is better than nothing, and it has  been pursued very vigorously and with great positive effect.   But having said that, we all think that young people ought to be back  in schools. But I don't know whether this bill, which passed the Senate  unanimously, deals with that particular aspect that the gentleman asked  about. But let me say this: I think that every school system has  adopted the premise that in school is better.   Clearly, we have been assaulted by a virus whose transmissibility is  substantially more than the previous virus, the delta variant. The  omicron variant, as we know, one of the problems is it is easily caught  and easily transmitted.  [[Page H176]]    The good news is if you have taken a vaccination and had a booster,  the likelihood of you going to the hospital is much smaller, and if you  go to the hospital, you are much less sick. But having said that, we  continue to have a challenge to get this under control. And the  administration, properly so, and the overwhelming majority of the  medical community, properly so, and the overwhelming majority of  scientists are recommending that we wear a mask, that we wear a KN95 or  N95 mask because they are much better than the surgical masks or the  cloth masks, that we continue to wash our hands regularly, and we  continue to keep our distance.   But the gentleman and I agree that we need to ensure that--to the  extent that it is possible and that parents will send their children to  school because of being dissuaded by the transmissibility of this  disease--we need to have kids in school.    Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, I think everybody is concerned about this.  Certainly, every parent in my district and your district is concerned  about this, and anybody who is concerned about the welfare of our  children is concerned about it.   But I think it would be appropriate for me to say that the teachers  of America--and my wife was a teacher, and I happen to believe that  teachers are the most important people in any society because they  educate the leadership and the citizens of tomorrow--have been put to  an extraordinary challenge.   And I have a granddaughter who has four children, so I have four  great-grandchildren, three of whom are in school and were in school in  2020 and 2021. And Judy, my granddaughter, who is named after my wife,  has told me on numerous occasions what extraordinary ends her  children's teachers--there were three different teachers at different  levels in the school system--went to make sure that while they were  home, while they were learning virtually that they had a positive,  productive experience. But all of them felt, I think, it is a lot  easier to have kids in school if they can do so safely. I think that  bears saying.   Like medical personnel, teachers have been put through extraordinary  stress, as have parents generally have been put through stress.   So I think the gentleman's concern is rightfully placed, and we need  to do everything we can to make sure kids get back in school and have a  learning experience like you and I had in the classroom.    Madam Speaker, I understand the gentleman's position,  which is held by a number of people.   My own view is that employers make a reasonable decision when they  say to an employee--for the sake, not only of the employee but for  everybody else in the workplace with whom they work--that you are  required to be vaccinated because we believe that science and medical  personnel tell us that is a much safer route. But I understand there is  a difference on that.   But even then, I know Governors who have been against vaccines are  not necessarily against the employer requiring that as an employee  requirement as opposed to a governmental requirement.    Madam Speaker, first of all, let me say inflation is a  serious challenge confronting American families, particularly working  families in this country.   I live alone, and because I am just one person, I buy relatively  small amounts of food at the grocery store. And I go to the grocery  store nowadays and whether it is the price of bacon, which is at $12 a  pound for Hormel or another meat packing, it is high, and I think to  myself how a family not doing as well as I am doing and with kids to  feed, how tough it is on them. So this inflation is very tough.   It is a worldwide phenomenon. It is a phenomenon that is caused  obviously by a pent-up demand asking for a lot of goods and chasing a  lot of goods. And elementary economics, that any of us took in college,  is that there are a lot of resources chasing few resources, i.e., a lot  of money chasing a short supply of goods, and you have that demand so  that it drives prices up.   This pandemic has had a global effect on the supply chain. The supply  chain has been substantially affected. This was not the fault of,  frankly, either Biden or his predecessor in terms of what happened to  the supply chain. In Singapore they shut down companies, as you know,  for months at a time. They just shut them down, which is one of the  things that has led to this chip shortage, which has had ramifications.   So I want to assure the gentleman that the administration, our side  of the aisle--I know your side of the aisle is very concerned about the  inflationary pressure that is putting such a stress on America's  families. This pandemic has caused extraordinary, historic things to  happen. That is the bad news.   The good news is we have created more jobs in the last year and 2  months than were created--of course, net we lost jobs for the previous  4 years; over 2 million jobs net lost. So the good news is that we have  a number of economic statistics that are, in fact, positive. However,  having said that, we do need to be very concerned about inflation. The  administration has expressed their concern.   We believe that the infrastructure bill will have a positive impact  on inflation, assuming the Build Back Better Act passes, which I assume  at some point it will.                                time  1145    I think that is going to have a very positive affect on inflation  because it will help the supply chain, help the  [[Page H177]]  health of the people, the employees, it will make people more able to  get out. Childcare. It is going to help people get back to work, which  will have a positive impact on the supply chain and on the availability  of goods and services. So I think we are moving in the right direction.   Unemployment, as the gentleman knows, which is down 3.9 percent. So  while inflation is up and unacceptably high, historically high, over  the last 4 years, we need to get it down. And we see this phenomena  happening all over the world. This is not the fault of the President or  the Congress, it is the fault of an extraordinary, invasive, and  widespread disease that has caused extraordinary disruptions within our  society and economy.   But we need to get a handle on it. We need to take action. So I will  talk to the gentleman about what issues he believes would be helpful in  that regard.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Of course, as you  know better than probably anybody, the Speaker appointed a task force  to look exactly at that issue of the $800 billion and what has been  done, what has been spent to make sure that it has been properly spent,  because you are the ranking member on the committee headed up by  Jim  Clyburn that is looking at those issues. I know you had a hearing this  past week.   Yes, we have a difference of opinion. The difference of opinion, you  call it spending, I call it investment. We are investing in our  children. We are investing in our families. We are investing in small  businesses. We are investing in growth and opportunity. And we are  investing in the ability of those folks that you talk about that are  not in the workforce, the restaurant can't hire. Why can't they hire  them? Because they are not paying sufficient amount to justify a mom  getting childcare because childcare is so expensive. Or she is caught-- or a single dad--is caught in the catch-22 situation. If I go to work,  I will earn money but I will pay it all to childcare. If I am going to  pay it all to childcare, it is much better for me as a parent to be  with my child, if the net result is going to be pretty much a wash.   We are investing in that. We are investing in childcare in the Build  Back Better Act. We are investing in early childhood education, three-  and four-year-olds. We believe that is investment. And it also is very  important for that small business so that that mom or dad who has that  child who is then going to go and be in a preschool environment can  have time to themselves so that they can, in fact, pursue employment  without simply putting it from one pocket to another pocket, none of  which is their pocket.   So the difference, I think, really is you look at it as spending, we  look at it as investment. We think it will have big, big return for our  country. And that is what Build Back Better is about. The building back  better you say it was not related to the pandemic. It clearly was  related to the pandemic. The pandemic hit us in the gut. It hit  everybody throughout the world in the gut. We have recovered better  than anybody else in the world. And that is because we invested,  sometimes in a bipartisan way, and sometimes in a partisan way, but we  invested in our people, in our children, in our families, in our  businesses, and in our health, generally of our country and indeed  trying to help other parts of the world as well because this is a  global pandemic that affects us all.    But I think the real difference is, we perceive this as an  investment. We think it will help grow America. I am sure you have  heard me talk about, from time to time, the Make It In America agenda.  Our investment in both the infrastructure bill and the Build Back  Better will have a positive effect on Make It In America.   So we see it, Mr. Whip, as investment. We think it will have a  positive effect. We think it is having a positive effect. And as I say,  unemployment is down below 4 percent and jobs are up over 6 million  over the last 11 months. So that is a good accomplishment. Is it  enough? Do we still have people who aren't working for a varied number  of reasons, many of which are related to COVID-19?   So we see it as an investment, and I am hopeful the Build Back Better  Act will pass and I hope that will have a positive effect not only on,  as the President says, the next 5 years, but on the next five  generations. So we are continuing to pursue that.   But inflation, which is how we started this discussion, is a problem  and we need to deal with it. I would be glad to talk to the gentleman  about what he thinks will be helpful to do that. I know part of that is  stop spending money. I think if we stop investing money, our country  will not get to where it wants to be and where it is now with respect  to the rest of the world, leading the rest of the world in terms of  economic recovery from the pandemic. We are not there yet but we are  going to get there    Right.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  would say at the outset, I believe the committee on which he serves  with Mr. Clyburn is one of the committees, among many, who ought to be  looking at those facts.   But let me say this, because in stating the facts, as you just did,  the appearance is that substantial progress has not been made. I don't  think that premise is correct. Let me read you some statistics.   Last year, the first year the President came into office, testing in  America was molecular in at-home tests per day. The beginning of last  year, 1.7 million per day. Today, 11.7 million tests per day are being  conducted.   So to imply that somehow there has not been substantial progress,  that is a 10-fold increase in the testing available to Americans every  day. And when Biden took office, zero at-home rapid tests were  available to consumers--zero. Today, 300 million at-home rapid tests  are on the market each month.   Enough? No. Are more coming? Yes.   Has the government used the Defense Production Act to accomplish  greater production? They have. The administration started using, as I  said, the Defense Production Act. The Biden administration is  increasing places people can get free tests, for instance.   You talk about a plan. When Biden took office, there were only 2,500  pharmacies offering free testing. Today, there are 20,000 sites, an 8- fold increase. The administration is purchasing 500 million at-home  rapid tests to be distributed for free to Americans who want them, with  initial delivery starting this month.                                time  1200    The administration is distributing up to 50 million free at-home  self-tests to community health centers and rural health clinics. In  addition to already covering PCR tests, the administration is requiring  private insurance plans to cover at-home tests starting on January 15,  just a couple of days from today. A lot is happening.   Is enough happening? Enough is not happening until everybody has  immediate availability. ``Immediate'' may overstate it, but easy  access. The fact is that some people are having problems finding the  at-home tests now, and we need to work on that.   Those statistics show you that extraordinary increases have occurred  under the Biden administration, and that is their plan, to make sure  that these tests are available, because we know that testing will make  a difference. If you find out you are sick, you quarantine.   I suggest to the gentleman that the Biden administration has made an  extraordinary difference. Is the situation where we want it to be?  Absolutely, it is not.   Do we have a new variant that apparently came out of South Africa or  was first identified in South Africa that spiked up?   I talked to Dr. Monahan yesterday, and apparently, just in recent  days, we have had a fall-off in disease recognized. I hope that is the  case. I hope it keeps going down because we are perhaps now using the  KN-95 or N-95 masks and keeping our distance a little more  conscientiously. Let's hope all of that works for the people, for the  country, and for the globe.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, this has been a calm discussion so far. Let me remind  the gentleman that the previous President said in February or March of  2020 that this is going to go away in about 30 days: Don't worry about  it. It will go away.   A lot of your Members said we don't need a mask; we don't need to  keep distance; we don't need to wash our hands; this is going to go  away. It is here today and gone tomorrow. That was the previous  administration's plan.   I agree with you. The science community, the private-sector  community, and government on Operation Warp Speed did a good job-- extraordinary work in the private sector, extraordinary work around the  world. Because of the computer age in which we live, they were able to  share information instantaneously, in real time, and say that this  alternative doesn't work, which accelerated greatly the ability to get,  within a year, an extraordinary accomplishment, largely from our  scientific and medical community but facilitated by Warp Speed. No  doubt about that. Give credit where credit is due.   Very frankly, the leader--unlike President Biden, who said this is a  problem; we have to be careful; we have to pursue it; we have to  invest--said no problem. The gentleman conveniently forgets that.   He also ignores the statistics I just gave where we have had a  tenfold, eightfold increase in the availability of testing and  pharmaceutical access for literally millions of people. This is per day  that we are talking about, 11.7 million people per day.   It doesn't take too long at that rate that the whole country, all 330  million people, in about a month and a few days has been taken care of.  When you say we have to make progress, we have made extraordinary  progress.    Our view is--and I know we differ on this--we have made investments  in the American Rescue Plan Act to deal with the pandemic crisis; in  the infrastructure bill to create jobs, additional manufacturing  capacity, and training and apprenticeships for our people; in the Build  Back Better bill to make sure that our families can keep their heads  above water and can, in fact, have childcare that they can rely on and  feel their children are safe so they can take a job, be productive  citizens, and add to the growth of our economy.   We believe we are doing that. Are we doing it perfectly? None of us  do it perfectly. Perhaps we need to do more, as the gentleman implies,  and have hearings.   The gentleman says he was in a hearing. Private or public, I presume  the gentleman had an opportunity to ask questions. I don't know who the  witnesses were, so I don't know what expertise they have.   I can't believe that if you requested of Mr. Clyburn that you have  relevant witnesses to come by and that you want to question about the  progress that either has been made or you think ought to be made or  further things that could be done, I can't believe that he wouldn't  agree to do that.   In any event, great progress is being made, but the entire world--not  the Biden world, not America--the entire world is confronting a crisis  and is having a tough time getting ahold of it. We have done it better  than anybody else in terms of growing our economy and keeping our  people's heads above water. That is to be applauded.   Do we still have a challenge? We do. Are we still working on it? We  are. Do we need to continue? Yes.    For a long time, the former President of the United  States--apparently, he changed his view now and criticized DeSantis for  not pursuing mask wearing, et cetera, et cetera. The fact of the matter  is, of course, the former President discouraged wearing masks early on.  He discouraged it: Oh, no, you don't need to wear a mask.   He had events that were spreader events, as we call them.   The gentleman heard me say that I think the President followed good  advice and made a decision on Warp Speed that was helpful. As the  gentleman noted, it was the scientists at NIH and scientists in the  private sector and scientists throughout the world, but mainly our  people, who did an extraordinary thing in an extraordinarily short  timeframe--never been done before--to develop this kind of vaccine.   You talk about the three vaccines. The three manufacturers, it had  never been done before. It was a wonderful event. Unfortunately, too  many people are advising: Don't take the vaccine. You don't have to  take the vaccine. Don't sweat it.   The government tells people they have to vaccinate their children to  send them to school. Why? So other children don't get sick.  [[Page H180]]    I told you I had those great-grandchildren, three of whom are in  school. They have a child that sits in front of them, a child that sits  to the right, a child that sits to the left, and a child that sits  behind them. I want all of them well because I don't want my great- grandchild getting sick.   I don't think there was a very successful effort either by the former  President or by many on your side of the aisle to say--you talk about  science--do what the scientists tell you to do. Now, I notice most of  your Members are doing so now, but still some wear it as a badge of  courage and raise money off of it. I think that is harmful to our  communities.   I think you sort of just set aside no plan. Well, no plan has  resulted going from 1.7 million to 11.7 million tests per day. That is  the plan. We invested in March, in the American Rescue Plan Act, in  making sure that health services could respond properly. A lot of money  went into health and testing in the American Rescue Plan.   You keep saying there is no plan. We have adopted plans, and we think  they are positive plans. We think, hopefully, that we are going to get  better soon.   Neither President Trump nor President Biden was responsible for this  extraordinary virus. Our view is President Trump laid back for a long,  long time before he really engaged heavily in this, and now he has  changed his tune to a much more positive ``listen to the scientists''  kind of attitude, which we welcome.                                time  1215    I disagree with the gentleman that there is not a plan. We adopted  together in 2020 five major pieces of legislation to address this  challenge, and we have adopted in a partisan way, unfortunately, bills  that continue to fight that fight, and I think it is fighting it, not  as successfully because we have a new variant, much more transmissible,  a different type. It has metastasized into a more communicable disease.  That has caused us a challenge, we are addressing that, and we are  accelerating the availability of resources to do so.    I just want to say in terms of where we are today, the  overwhelming percentage--I am talking about 90 percent--of people who  are getting really sick are people who are not vaccinated. And for the  government to say: You need to be vaccinated because we don't want you  coming to the office, we don't want you coming with other people who  are being careful, who have been vaccinated, and who have done the  responsible thing and getting them sick. Because what we have seen,  unfortunately, even with vaccination, is that people who are  vaccinated, of our own Members on both sides of the aisle who have been  vaccinated, have gotten--thankfully--mild cases of COVID.   But when we talk about the President wanting people to get  vaccinated--and my friend indicates that he and I both are advocates of  that, and/or requiring them to get vaccinated--the reason you require  people to get vaccinated, the more people you have unvaccinated, the  more hosts this virus has to metastasize and to grow into a different  type of virus that can attack in different ways. That is why you do  that. That is why they talk 70 percent. Now we just have about 70  percent in America now. Very frankly, if we had a higher percentage we  would be better off. So let's hope that we can work together to make  sure that we give encouragement to people to do what the scientists  advise.   My friend talks about the reason we were so successful in that year  under Warp Speed of getting those three vaccines is because the  scientists knew what had to be done. They found out and they had quick  discoveries and eliminated a lot of dead-ends relatively quickly  because of our computer capability and transformation of information  around the world and dead-ends.   If we listen to them, we would be better off. But an awful lot of  people are saying: Don't listen to them. Don't do it.   When the gentleman says for health reasons, there are hundreds,  probably billions, I don't know what the billions are, people who have  been vaccinated with a miniscule and almost undetectable adverse  reaction. So I don't know what the gentleman talks about for health  reasons. I know Djokovic is saying he is doing it for health reasons. I  don't know what those are. Maybe my friend does. I am not an expert  enough to know what that is. But all the doctors I talk to--and  certainly our own doctor here whom we consult with on a regular basis,  I know both of us have done that--say get the vaccine.   So I would hope that all of us would ask our constituents to get the  vaccine. It is good for you, it saves your lives, it saves your  families, and it saves others. Get it.
