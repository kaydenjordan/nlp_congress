As if in legislative  session, I move to concur in the House amendment to the Senate  amendment to H.R. 6 under the previous order. The PRESIDING  OFFICER. The motion is pending. The Senator from South Dakota.    ========================= END NOTE =========================                             FAA Reauthorization Act     Madam President, it is oftentimes easy to believe the news  reporting on how the Senate is broken and bipartisanship is dead, but  then you work with your colleagues--both Democrats and Republicans,  from the House and the Senate--on something like the FAA  Reauthorization Act, which we just passed, and you are reminded that we  can still come together and get things done for the American people.   The bill we just overwhelmingly passed and sent to the President's  desk is the longest FAA reauthorization since the 1980s, and it will  improve our aviation system for travelers, manufacturers, and  innovators alike.   The bill also reauthorizes the Transportation Security  Administration, ensuring improved screening technologies and more  explosive detection K-9s, additional focus on security and surface  transportation to public areas, and new pathways to mitigate airport  security delays for an overall better travel experience.   It also reauthorizes the National Transportation Safety Board,  providing key reforms to modernize and improve transparency in this  important safety agency's investigations, recommendations, and Board  member discussions. These important provisions are just the three- quarters of the  [[Page S6468]]  bill in the jurisdiction of the Senate Commerce Committee, of which I  have the privilege to serve as chairman.   As chairman, I would like to personally thank the members of our  committee for all of their hard work this Congress and especially  Senator Nelson, the committee's ranking member; Senators Blunt and  Cantwell, the chairman and ranking member of our Aviation Subcommittee;  and Senators Fischer and Peters, the chairman and ranking member of our  Surface Transportation Subcommittee.   I would also like to acknowledge, on the House side, Chairman Shuster  and Ranking Member DeFazio of the House Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure, Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson of the  House Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and  Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson of the House Science  Committee. They have been great partners, and I appreciate their  efforts in helping to get this bill across the finish line.   Finally, I would like to thank all of the staff from both Chambers  who worked tirelessly, including many late nights and weekends, on this  bill. Without their efforts, the final product would not have been such  a success. While everyone on the team worked hard on this bill, on my  staff I would like to especially thank Nick Rossi, Adrian Arnakis, Mike  Reynolds, Simone Perez, Jackie Keshian, Missye Brickell, Fern Gibbons,  Jason Smith, Andrew Neely, Isaiah Wonnenberg, Chance Costello, Alison  Graab, Fredrick Hill, and Brianna Manzelli.   On Senator Nelson's staff, thanks should go to Kim Lipsky, Mohsin  Syed, Tom Chapman, Chris Day, Laurence Wildgoose, and Danny Blum.   I would also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the  names of the staffers who are part of the committees in the House who  played key roles in the legislation and, of course, the staff members  from the committee Chairman Shuster chairs, the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee in the House, which was very instrumental in  getting this bill across the floor in the House and ultimately over to  us in the Senate and then the ranking member, as I mentioned, Peter  DeFazio's staff.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the names of  their staffs to whom we are grateful.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Chairman Shuster's staff who should be thanked include:       Chris Vieson, Geoff Gosselin, Fred Miller, Holly Woodruff       Lyons, Naveen Rao, Hunter Presti, Cameron Humphrey, and       Hannah Matesic.        From Ranking Member DeFazio's staff: Kathy Dedrick, Alex       Burkett, Rachel Carr, Michael Tien, and Luke Strimer.     Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent to have  printed in the Record the names of Chairman McCaul's staff and Ranking  Member Thompson's staff.   Also, we are grateful to the staff of Chairman Smith, who chairs the  House Science Committee. There was a good amount of science policy that  was ultimately included in this legislation.   Also, we are very grateful to Ranking Member Johnson's staff, Pam  Whitney and Allen Li.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         From Chairman McCaul's staff: Brendan Shields, Kyle Klein,       Alex Rosen, Emily Trapani, and Forrest McConnell.        From Ranking Member Thompson's staff: Hope Goins, Alex       Marston, and Rosalyn Cohen.        From Chairman Smith's staff: Chris Wydler, Ashley Callen,       Mike Mineiro, and Sam Amber.     I am sure there will be people whom I have left off this  list, and I apologize for that, but it just underscores the amount of  collective effort that underpins our work.   I could also easily expand that list to include those at the  Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration  who provided valuable assistance and technical expertise. We look  forward, now that this bill has passed and headed to the President's  desk for his signature, to working with them on its implementation.   So again, I say thank you to my colleagues who supported this bill  and all of those who were involved in bringing us to a conclusion. This  is the culmination of many months of hard work, bipartisan negotiation.  Frankly, it wasn't easy, and that is a great credit to the staff  members I mentioned and to the individual members of our committee and  the other committees who were so involved in seeing this get across the  finish line.   So I say thanks to the Members on the floor and the members of our  committee.   With that, I yield the floor.
