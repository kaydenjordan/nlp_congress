 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  legislation.   It is very simple. It directs the Comptroller General of the United  States to submit a report to the Congress on alternative uses for Plum  Island.                                time  1430    The report underscores its ecological significance, that is what it  would do; the need to be protected; and it would be an important step  toward identifying conservation alternatives to selling Plum Island.   I believe that Plum Island should be a unit of the National Wildlife  Refuge System, ensuring that we would safeguard the island's sensitive  wildlife and ecological value.   Plum Island is the largest area in southern New England, where seals  can rest on dry land. Its 843 acres are home to two threatened bird  species: the piping plovers and the roseate terns.   We need to proceed very carefully when considering the future of Plum  Island. This is a refuge for wildlife and native plants, and once it is  developed, it cannot be restored, which is why the legislation is so  important.   By evaluating the alternative uses for Plum Island fully rather than  selling it to the highest bidder, we can ensure that this ecological,  historical, and cultural treasure can be protected for generations to  come.   I am proud to join with my colleagues, Congressman Zeldin and  Congressman Courtney, on a bipartisan basis to ensure that the  environment is respected in our region and across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I thank  the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) for yielding me the time.
