 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize Hy- Capacity of Humboldt, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Hy-Capacity was founded by James ``Scratch'' Olson in 1978 in  Pocahontas, IA, as a remanufacturer of agricultural farming equipment.  In 1980, the business was relocated to Humboldt and focused on  clutches, water pumps, and torque amplifier modifications. The  company's name refers to Scratch's ability to take existing tractor  parts and modify them for ``higher capacity'' uses for farmers. Hy- Capacity has evolved over the years and expanded to offer a wide range  of agricultural equipment, including cab kits, radiators, and engine  overhaul kits. They have grown their products globally and currently  export their parts to Canada and Mexico.   Hy-Capacity is an exemplary family business. Scratch's sons Jeff and  Steve work at Hy-Capacity. Steve became the president in the 1990s  after working there since the company's inception. Steve currently  serves as CEO, and his daughter Molly Varangkounh served as president  from 2001 until 2022. Steve's son David now runs the day-to-day  business operations. A fourth generation of the Olson family, Molly's  daughter Claire, joined the family business as an intern from 2017  until 2021. Scratch Olson's legacy includes a multigenerational  workforce and a thriving business committed to hard work, community  involvement, and dedication to farmers. In 2023, Hy-Capacity celebrated  its 45th business anniversary.   The Hy-Capacity team does not only work hard, but they also give  back. In 2009, they won the Iowa Governor's Environmental Excellence  Award and the Recycling Project/Facility of the Year by the Iowa  Recycling Association. Hy-Capacity is involved with the Iowa Future  Farmers of America, where they became the official sponsor for tractor  seats at events in 2014. Another important partnership for Hy-Capacity  is the Humboldt County Memorial Hospital. During the COVID-19 pandemic,  Hy-Capacity shifted gears and started manufacturing masks and gowns for  the hospital. In addition to the masks and gowns Hy-Capacity provided,  they were able to assemble a group of volunteers that helped produce  almost 200 additional masks.   Hy-Capacity's commitment to providing high-quality tractor parts to  farmers throughout North America while maintaining their Humboldt roots  is clear. I want to congratulate the Olson family and the entire team  at Hy-Capacity for their continued dedication to providing affordable  and high-quality parts to Iowans. I look forward to seeing their  continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Northwestern Steakhouse of Mason City, IA, as the Senate Small Business  of the Week.   Greek immigrants Pete Maduras and Tony Papouchis founded the  restaurant in 1920 under the name ``Pete's Place.'' The original  location was in the Northwestern Row neighborhood of Mason City. During  the early 20th century, Mason City was experiencing an increase in  business development due to the opening of the Northwestern State  Portland Cement Plant in 1906 and the Lehigh Portland Cement Company in  1910. Many of the workers moving to Mason City were European immigrants  like Pete and Tony. During the early history of the restaurant, Pete  handled the business side, while Tony was the head chef. Tony spent 3  years in the Greek Army and used the recipes he learned from his  service to inspire the menu. Pete's Place moved to its second location  on North Federal Avenue in  [[Page S2284]]  1932, before moving again to the current location on 16th Street NW in  1954.   In 1965, Pete retired, and the restaurant was rebranded to  Northwestern Steakhouse. Tony planted a garden next to the restaurant,  where he used fresh produce in his meals, including his famous fresh  salads. On Sundays, Tony offered a special menu that paid homage to his  Greek roots. Tony worked at the restaurant every day until his passing  at 98 years old in 1991. Today, Tony's son Bill Papouchis runs the  restaurant with his wife Ann. Bill and Ann continue to honor Tony's  legacy by using the recipes he created and keeping the menu consistent  with Tony's vision.   The Northwestern Steakhouse team is well-recognized for their hard  work. In 2019, Business Insider listed them as the Iowa winner of ``The  most famous restaurant in every state'' article. Additionally, online  food, drink, and travel publication Thrillist recognized them in ``The  Most Iconic Restaurant in Every State'' article. In 2020, while  celebrating its 100th anniversary, Northwestern Steakhouse won the  ``Business of the Year Award'' from the Mason City Chamber of Commerce.  The same year, Mason City mayor Bill Schickel awarded the restaurant  the key to the city. Northwestern Steakhouse also gives back to the  community. In March 2021, they hosted their first ``Wonderful  Wednesday,'' which raised over $1,000 for Habitat for Humanity of North  Central Iowa.   Northwestern Steakhouse's commitment to providing quality food and  dining in North Central Iowa is clear. I want to congratulate the  Papouchis family and the entire team at Northwestern Steakhouse for  their continued dedication to providing an iconic culinary experience  to Iowans. I look forward to seeing their continued growth and success  in Iowa.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Total Detailing Auto Spa of Bettendorf, IA, as the Senate Small  Business of the Week.   As a child, Bettendorf resident Tim Lofgren cleaned cars in his  neighborhood as a part-time business. He came up with the name ``Total  Detailing'' at the age of 15 after he determined that he could turn his  childhood hobby into a small business. Total Detailing Auto Spa was  founded in 1998 and started out at a residential home, then a location  in downtown Bettendorf. In 2008, Tim and his wife Susan acquired an  11,200-square-foot facility in Bettendorf, IA, which serves as the  current location for their business.   Total Detailing Auto Spa offers complete interior and exterior car  detailing. In addition to their detailing services, they also provide  full-service carwash, boat detailing, and motorcycle detailing in the  Quad Cities. Total Detailing Auto Spa also operates a retail showroom  where antique cars are on display for customers to admire while their  car is being serviced, with the showroom currently displaying a 1929  Ford Roadster. The facility has four bays, including an oversized one  for boats, recreational vehicles, and tractors. Over the years, Total  Detailing Auto Spa has significantly expanded its workforce from a two- person shop to more than 30 employees.   Total Detailing Auto Spa has built up a loyal following over the  years. In November 2019, Bettendorf resident Lou Riojas received his  500th car wash from Total Detailing Auto Spa. Lou has relied on Total  Detailing Auto Spa to wash his red G-6 Pontiac several times a week.  The Total Detailing team has also given back to the Quad Cities  community by providing services to charity auctions and local school  benefits. Total Detailing Auto Spa's hard work has paid off as they are  celebrating their 25th anniversary this year.   Total Detailing Auto Spa's commitment to providing quality car washes  and auto detailing services in Bettendorf, IA, is clear. I want to  congratulate Tim and Susan Lofgren and the entire team at Total  Detailing Auto Spa for their continued dedication to providing car  detailing services to Iowans. I look forward to seeing their continued  growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
