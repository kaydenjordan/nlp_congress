 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act.   From skyrocketing prescription drug prices to rising premiums, too  many Kansans are struggling to afford the basic costs of healthcare and  access to coverage, a problem that has only grown during this public  health crisis.   And just last week, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, this  administration asked the Supreme Court to strike down every last  protection and benefit afforded by the Affordable Care Act.   A new report found that a number of Americans would lose health  coverage if this lawsuit succeeded. Twenty-three million people,  including 94,000 Kansans, would lose their health insurance.   We need to build on the progress of the Affordable Care Act to lower  the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs, not rip away people's  healthcare at such an important time during this global pandemic. And  that is exactly what the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Enhancement Act would do.   This essential legislation would help lower the cost of healthcare,  bring down the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs, crack down on  junk insurance plans, and strengthen protections for people with  preexisting conditions.   Importantly, it would also help States like Kansas expand Medicaid,  providing an estimated 150,000 Kansans with affordable, quality  healthcare.   I have long been pushing for Kansas to join the 36 other States that  have already expanded Medicaid so we can lower the costs of healthcare  and increase access to health coverage, meaning more people are  protected during emergencies like the coronavirus pandemic.   I am proud to have helped secure vital provisions in this legislation  that would give Kansas more urgently needed money to expand Medicaid.   By renewing the ACA's original expanded Federal match, we could both  incentivize States to expand their Medicaid programs and ensure a  smooth transition for those that do so.   While this administration works to tear down the ACA in court, I am  working alongside my House colleagues to strengthen the ACA and help  ensure that everyone can receive affordable, quality healthcare.   Because during this time of uncertainty, no Kansan should have to  worry about whether she will receive the care that they need and that  their families need to stay healthy.                            ____________________
