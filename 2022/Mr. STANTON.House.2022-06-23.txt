 Madam Speaker, for 126 days now, Brittney Griner has  been wrongfully detained by Russia.   Every single day that goes by is a lifetime for her wife, Cherelle,  her family, friends, and teammates on the Phoenix Mercury.   As mayor of Phoenix, I was so lucky to watch her develop and grow as  a professional athlete and also as a respected leader in the Phoenix  community. One of the best basketball players of our generation, she  has won gold medals representing the United States twice at the Olympic  Games. Like many WNBA players, she needed to supplement her income by  playing professional basketball in Russia, and she was proud to do so.   But, now, Brittney finds herself a prisoner of the Russian  Government. Her legal hearings continue to be delayed without good  reason. It is unacceptable.   It is time for the House to speak with one unified voice and call for  Brittney's safe return and to show support for every American  wrongfully detained in Russia.                            ____________________
