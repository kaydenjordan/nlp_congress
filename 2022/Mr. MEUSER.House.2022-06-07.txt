 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mr.  Luetkemeyer, for his leadership on this bill and in committee.   The EIDL program, Madam Speaker, was established to deliver relief to  struggling small businesses during the pandemic. This is why I rise  today in support of H.R. 7334.   Unlike the public-private partnership that was Paycheck Protection  Program, the EIDL program was a direct loan program administered by the  SBA, not in partnership with private lenders.    The SBA's inspector general has estimated that there is approximately  $84.4 billion in potential fraudulent EIDL activity, over 20 percent of  all EIDL loans extended.   With this massive level of potential fraud, it is imperative that  this House passes Ranking Member Luetkemeyer's bill to extend the  current 5-year statute of limitations for SBA grants and loans to 10  years. In doing so we can allow for authorities to investigate the  egregious amount of potential fraud in the EIDL program and ensure  accountability for those who took advantage of the EIDL program to  defraud the American people.   Madam Speaker, I note that this bill had strong bipartisan support  and passed out of the Small Business Committee by voice vote last  month. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.    Madam Speaker, as Americans struggle to afford the  record-high price of gas and the cost to keep their homes comfortable  this summer, they are losing their cool with President Biden's attempts  to develop a plan to tame skyrocketing inflation while playing the  blame game.   Harry Truman said and was known for ``the buck stops here.'' The  Biden mantra seems to be ``pass the buck.''   While the President puts the blame on the Federal Reserve for  inflation and taps the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to provide a few  pennies a gallon off the price of gas, Americans continue to pay  historic prices at the pump, face sticker shock at the supermarket, and  wonder which utility company will raise their rates next.   We have gone from an energy independent Nation to one that is at the  mercy of OPEC and Russia with consequences that are rattling the world  economy. Yet, the President tells us this is the most robust recovery  in modern history.   It is time to embrace the truth and do what works: Responsible  domestic energy production; lower taxes to rev up our economy; stop the  reckless spending; and reduce the economic burden on Americans.   We need the courage to change course.                            ____________________
