 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to plead with my colleagues  to address the ongoing crisis at our borders.   Just last week, Federal agents made the largest fentanyl bust in U.S.  history at a checkpoint along our border with Mexico. These drugs were  headed into our communities.   Some of our colleagues will say the fact that the bust occurred at a  legal point of entry is proof that we are doing enough to keep our  Nation secure and our neighborhoods safe.   I ask you, if these drug dealers are bold enough to try to sneak this  much contraband through a known checkpoint, how much are they smuggling  across our porous borders in the dark of night or through the open  desert?   The answer is, more than we know. And it is far too much, Mr.  Speaker.   Whether it is the promise of work and entitlements or the promise of  an illegal drug market, we must demagnetize the attraction to our  country for those who disregard our sovereignty and rule of law. We  must secure our country and deal with the human trafficking and  narcotics trafficking crisis that exists at our southern border.                            ____________________
