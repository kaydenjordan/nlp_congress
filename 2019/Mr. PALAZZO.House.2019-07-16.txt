 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Ms.  Emily Kathryn Goss of Caesar, Mississippi, whose life was unfortunately  cut short on July 12 at the age of 17.   Emily was a captain of the cheer team at Hancock High School, where  she would have been a senior this upcoming fall semester. She was a  hardworking honor student who stayed active in various clubs. When she  wasn't at school, Emily worked at the Country Side Diner and was also a  babysitter.   Emily is remembered for being a loving, kindhearted young woman who  was always smiling and loved life. She was a faithful member of her  youth group at Union Baptist Church.   She is survived by her parents, Kevin and Christina Goss, as well as  her sister, Elise, whom she shared an inseparable bond with. My  thoughts and prayers are with her loved ones as they grieve the loss of  Emily.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to join me in a moment of silence to  honor the life of Ms. Emily Kathryn Goss                            ____________________
