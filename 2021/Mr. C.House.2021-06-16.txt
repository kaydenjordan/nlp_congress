 Scott  Franklin), who represents Florida's Fifth Congressional District.    SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight because  our country is facing a growing economic crisis, a crisis of the Biden  administration's making.   With his massive and reckless spending programs, President Biden has  mortgaged our economic security. Long after this current administration  has skipped town, future generations of hardworking Americans will be  stuck holding the bill.   It is human nature to like free stuff, I suppose, and as long as  Uncle Sam is willing to dole out money to everyone and everything in  sight, it is easy to understand why people are happily lining up for  their fair share.   It is also a universal truth that there is no such thing as a free  lunch. Unchecked spending doesn't just hurt us in the future. It is  also destructive in the near term.   My Democrat colleagues have tried for months to convince the American  people that it is only the rich who will pay for reckless spending  policies, but people know better. Americans across the country are  starting to feel the pinch of this unbridled spending.   They are certainly noticing it back in my home State of Florida,  where drivers are paying more for gas than they have in nearly a  decade. They see it when they go to the grocery store, where prices on  everything from a jar of peanut butter to a gallon of milk have spiked  sharply. They are feeling the pain on nearly everything they buy, with  consumer costs rising at the highest rate in nearly 13 years.   This inflation President Biden has created is an immediate tax on  workers, causing each hard-earned dollar to be worth less than it was  before. At the same time, skyrocketing costs of materials are making it  even harder for small business owners to reopen.   With high unemployment, record job openings, and spiraling inflation,  it is time for the Biden administration to acknowledge that their bad  medicine is hurting the patient. Congress has the authority and the  responsibility to rein in this reckless spending, and the time to act  is now.
