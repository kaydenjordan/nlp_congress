 Madam Speaker, this is a bright day in the history of the  House. We are going to provide relief to people who are innocent.   We have the debate about immigration, no question about it. But we  are talking about children, infants, in some cases, who were brought  here through no decision of their own. They then went to school here,  began a career here, built a family here. In many cases, they served in  the military here and served as first responders.   This is finally an opportunity for those Dreamers to have legal  status, 2.5 million of them.   We are also going to provide temporary protected status to other law- abiding people living and contributing here.   This is a big deal in Vermont. First, for the people, for those  affected, it is  [[Page H4241]]  relief. It is about time. Second, they are contributing to the economy  with the jobs that they perform and the taxes that they pay, about $3.5  million in Federal taxes and $2 million in State and local taxes.   One, in particular, is a student at the University of Vermont Medical  School, Juan Conde. He was brought here from Mexico when he was 9 years  old. His mom later died of cancer.   His goal in life is to help cancer victims. First, he got a master's  degree in chemistry and a Ph.D. in molecular biology, doing research to  advance a cure for cancer. Now he is a student at the University of  Vermont Medical School, and he is dedicating his life to cancer  research and cancer treatment.   What a win it is for this country to have the services of this  bright, idealistic young man. This legislation is going to allow him to  have the security that we all need in order to be the best that we can  possibly be as a contributing member of society.   A confident nation welcomes people who are law-abiding citizens. Pass  this legislation overwhelmingly.
