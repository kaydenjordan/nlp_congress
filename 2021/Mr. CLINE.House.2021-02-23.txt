 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Parry McCluer  High School boys' basketball team that won the Virginia Class 1 State  championship this weekend.   After trailing by 8 in the first quarter to Altavista, the Fighting  Blues lived up to their name and battled back--leading by 2 at  halftime. In the locker room, Coach Cartolaro told his team to go out  and attack in the third quarter. And attack they did. Quickly  outscoring 10-2, the Blues opened up their lead and never looked back.  When the final buzzer sounded, Parry McCluer had pulled off a 17-point  victory, securing the school's best-ever boys' basketball championship  and closing the season with an impressive 12-1 record.   I applaud Coach Cartolaro and the entire team for their fortitude and  perseverance these past few months. They overcame every obstacle  presented to them and brought home the trophy to Buena Vista.   Congratulations to the Blues. This achievement is well-deserved and  their community is proud of their hard work.                            ____________________
