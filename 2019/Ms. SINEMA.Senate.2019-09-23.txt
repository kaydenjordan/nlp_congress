 Mr. President, today I recognize the 40th  anniversary of Univision Arizona. As one of Arizona's leading  television networks, Univision Arizona has been on the front lines of  delivering important news to our State, earning nationwide recognition  by winning 23 Emmy Awards this year. Throughout its 40-year history,  Univision Arizona has evolved and adapted to the needs of its viewers  by crafting engaging content and shedding light on important stories  that deserve to be heard.   As the leading source of Spanish-language media and news in our  State, Univision Arizona serves 1.6 million Arizonans through two  television stations, four radio stations, and other digital and social  platforms. With the fast-changing pace of news and technology,  Univision Arizona has grown into an innovative news source, while  maintaining and staying true to its original mission.   Univision Arizona serve all Arizonans, especially the Hispanic  community, which has richly contributed to our State. I am proud to  recognize Univision Arizona's 40th anniversary milestone, while  celebrating the contributions of Arizona's Hispanic community during  Hispanic Heritage Month. Univision Arizona's mission, its dedicated  reporters and staff, and the stories they share are truly  representative of the profound and powerful role the Hispanic community  plays in our State.                            ____________________
