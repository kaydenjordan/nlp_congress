 Mr. Chair, the so-called ``Lower Energy Costs Act'' is an  attempt by the majority to strip environmental protections fought for  by Congress over decades. The current leadership wishes to allow broad  polluting, strip limitations on greenhouse gas emissions, and remove  provisions of the Clean Water Act that not only protect our Nation's  waters, but also affect the clean drinking water of everyday Americans.   Division C, the Water Quality Certification and Energy Project  Improvement Act, will neither improve energy projects nor streamline  the water quality certification process.                                time  1800    This section guts the Clean Water Act section 401 authority. The  previous administration tried to significantly limit this authority in  the interest of preventing oversight and accountability for those who  polluted water sources. Now the majority is, again, attempting to gut  this critical protection  [[Page H1512]]  authority in favor of unclear, imprecise, and irresponsible policy,  which would allow significant increases in water pollution without  holding polluters accountable.   This issue is particularly important to the District of Columbia  because we are entirely reliant on the Potomac River for our drinking  water. Under this bill, the headwaters of the Potomac River can be  freely polluted in West Virginia, jeopardizing the water source of most  of Northern Virginia, all of D.C., and much of southern Maryland.   We are no strangers to this kind of pollution. Before the Clean Water  Act, the Potomac River was rife with agricultural runoff, trash, and  other pollution. But today it is a much cleaner and healthier river and  used for all manner of recreational activities. This bill would  jeopardize all the progress we have made for the entire Potomac River  ecosystem.    Under this bill, a project could threaten water quality,  water supply, fish populations, or many other things, and D.C. and  other jurisdictions would not get any say in preventing it. Polluters  can act freely and to the extreme detriment of their neighbors  downstream, affecting the accessibility of clean water.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
