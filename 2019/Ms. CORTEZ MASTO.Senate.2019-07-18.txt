 Mr. President, I had expected to be able to  vote on the confirmations of Mr. Clifton Corker to the U.S. District  Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, Ms. Lynda Blanchard to be  Ambassador to the Republic of Slovenia, and Mr. Donald R. Tapia to be  Ambassador to Jamaica. Instead, I am in Nevada for a funeral.   On the question of the confirmation of Mr. Clifton Corker to the U.S.  District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, I would have  voted no.   On the question of the confirmation of Ms. Lynda Blanchard to be  Ambassador to the Republic of Slovenia, I would have voted no.   On the question of the confirmation of Mr. Donald R. Tapia to be  Ambassador to Jamaica, I would have voted yes.   Thank you.                            ____________________
