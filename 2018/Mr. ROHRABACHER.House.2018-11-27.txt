Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on S. 1768, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1768, the National Earthquake  Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act of 2018.   The bill before us is the same text of H.R. 6650, the bill I  introduced in the House earlier this year to reauthorize a Federal  program that improves America's earthquake preparedness, and which the  Senate agreed to accept as the final agreement. With a little  indulgence, I might then say that this would be the Rohrabacher- Feinstein Earthquake bill. That is the way it goes.   For 40 years the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program,  NEHRP, has supported efforts to assess and monitor earthquake hazards  and risks across our Nation.   Four Federal agencies coordinate their earthquake activities under  this program: the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Science  Foundation, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National  Institute of Standards and Technology. These agencies assess earthquake  hazards, deliver notifications of seismic events, develop measures to  reduce earthquake hazards, and conduct research to help reduce overall  American vulnerability to earthquakes.   The Congress last reviewed and reauthorized the program in 2004, and  that law expired in 2009. Although Congress continues to appropriate  funds for this important work, the legislation before us makes long  overdue changes to modernize the program and make it more effective.   The bill removes outdated language related to earthquake prediction  and instead emphasizes the continued development of an earthquake  early-warning system. The bill also reduces various administrative  burdens for Federal agencies, burdens that are disruptive to the  essential mission of the program. Our approach also improves data  sharing between these agencies.   Finally, the legislation provides a 5-year authorization for  appropriations at the current funding level.   In my home State of California, we understand the omnipresent threat  of another massive earthquake. According to the USGS, California has a  99 percent chance of being devastated by a magnitude 6.7 earthquake, or  an even larger one, in the next 30 years. That is the same power as the  1994 Northridge earthquake which killed 57 people, injured more than  8,700 others, and caused damages of up to $50 billion, making it one of  the costliest disasters in American history.   California is not alone. Close to 75 million people in 39 States face  significant risk from earthquakes. By being prepared for future  disasters we reduce our potential loss of life and property for those  who would suffer those consequences.   I want to thank Senators Dianne Feinstein and Lisa Murkowski who  introduced this bill in the Senate, as well as Representative Pramila  Jayapal who joined me in introducing the bill in this House. I want to  thank the leadership of the House Natural Resources Committee and the  House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for working with us  to bring this bill to the floor. Although the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee has primary jurisdiction and we were given superb  leadership by our current chairman, these committees and the Committee  on Science, Space, and Technology do share jurisdiction over the  agencies in this program.   Mr. Speaker, let me again express my deep appreciation for the  leadership on the other side of the aisle, but especially now that we  are going to be losing our chairman, for the great job that he has done  as chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,             and Technology,                                  Washington, DC, October 29, 2018.      Hon.

Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning S. 1768, the       ``National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program       Reauthorization Act of 2018,'' which was referred to the       Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, and additionally       to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, on       September 28, 2018.

Hon. Lamar Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: Thank you for your letter regarding S.       1768, the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program       Reauthorization Act of 2018. In order to expedite floor       consideration of S. 1768, the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure will forgo action on this bill.        The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure concurs       with the mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of       the bill does not prejudice the Committee with respect to the       appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional       claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or       similar legislation that fall within the Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction. I request you urge the Speaker to name Members       of the Committee to any conference committee named to       consider such provisions.        Please insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration on the House floor. I look       forward to working with the Committee on Science, Space, and       Technology as the bill moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                      Bill Shuster,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Smith), who is the chairman of the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   We Californians know what suffering happens when you are unprepared  for a wildfire. We have learned that lesson very tragically just  recently. There is no need for us to suffer by being unprepared for the  next earthquake. That is what this is all about.   I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and especially  thank the chairman for the fact that we have worked together in a way  that is really going to have a positive impact on so many people by  preventing them from having to suffer what we have seen recently in the  wildfires in California.   Mr. Speaker, although there is often disagreement in the people's  House, we should never overlook those many areas of concurrence.   There are those who believe that human activity, for example, is  causing a cataclysmic jump in the temperature of the planet. Others,  however, disagree with this analysis and, thus, oppose policies that  restrict human activities and drive up the cost of living a decent  life. This issue has been a tumultuous division.   However, there are so many other areas in which we can and will focus  on, not just in terms of what our committee does, but on which we have  a wide acceptance on where precautionary measures are justified and  needed. Research in understanding how buildings, bridges, and other  infrastructure react to earthquakes is an example of something that I  expect that we all agree on. We can see that even here in this debate.   I will not be here next year, but I wanted to mention just a few  other science-related areas where bipartisan action could be effective  and where the costs of prevention are minimal as compared to the  potential damage. These are things that we have worked on but have not  come to a conclusion. Both the chairman and I won't be here next year,  but I thought I would mention them.   For example, I hope there can be real progress made in the next few  years when it comes to the protection of our planet from astroids and  comets, which have caused massive damage--even extinction--over the  last 250 million years. Although we are searching in space near and far  for these objects now, we have not organized or put in place the means  to divert them or eliminate a threatening object when it is observed  heading in our direction.   Another common ground issue should be protecting our space assets  from orbital debris, which is basically a man-made minefield in space.  We rely on our space-based assets for defense, science, farming, a huge  portion of our commerce, and even for navigating your car to a local  market. There are many other plans for new satellite constellations and  new expectations for increased numbers of people visiting space.   Thus, we will be expanding, hopefully, observation and monitoring of  what is going on with the planet for the benefit of the people of the  planet. But none of these uses of space will ever be put to work for  bettering our lives unless we deal with the debris issue. If we are not  protecting our space-based assets, we are risking our future, our way  of life, our security, and our prosperity.   I am sorry we did not get this done. It was a bipartisan effort. We  just didn't get that, among all the things we were working on this  Congress. But I hope the next Congress will succeed and will focus on  those two issues where we can cooperate in a very bipartisan way.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the moving forward of S.  1768, the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization  Act of 2018.   May we always be prepared to deal with natural disasters, thus  protecting our people from needless tragedies. We will always live with  the potential of a severe earthquake, but we can minimize the loss and  suffering. That is what we are doing here with this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the bill being signed into law by the  President by the end of the year, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
