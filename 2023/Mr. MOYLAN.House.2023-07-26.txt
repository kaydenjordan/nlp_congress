 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Irene Perez Ploke  Sgambelluri. A proud mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, and a  World War II survivor are just some of the words used to describe Ms.  Irene Perez Ploke Sgambelluri, or as many call her, Aunty Irene.   Aunty Irene has been a fighter for World War II survivors, a champion  for Guam's Greatest Generation, and one who has worked tirelessly over  the decades to ensure that those who endured the atrocities of the  occupation are recognized by the Federal Government.   Aunty Irene advocated for the payments of World War II reparations  for decades, and the fruits of her labor were rewarded when former  President Donald Trump enacted legislation to ensure these reparations  were fulfilled.   During the month our community celebrates Guam's liberation, I honor  her for her years of advocacy.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Aunty Irene, and may God continue to bless her  and her family.                            ____________________
