 Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from  Montana for offering this amendment and to speak strongly in support of  the amendment.   In 2015, S. 1 authorized the Keystone Pipeline. So we have voted on  this before, and we have approved it. We need to do it again.   Look, whether you are for traditional sources of energy or renewable  sources of energy or both, we need the infrastructure to move it around  the country as safely as possible in an environmentally sound way on a  dependable basis. That means we need transmission lines, and we need  pipelines.   Let's come together. Let's continue to build our energy future, not  to mention the 11,000-plus jobs directly involved in working on this  pipeline. But  [[Page S1239]]  for energy independence and energy security for our country, for good- paying jobs, energy is foundational to everything we do in our economy.  Let's support this amendment.   I yield back to Senator Tester.                             Additional Cosponsor
