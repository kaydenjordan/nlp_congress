 Madam Chair, I rise to express my outrage at  the far-right minority in this Congress attempting to force their  extreme anti-abortion agenda onto what should be a bipartisan bill.   We all know the Dobbs decision last year decimated abortion access,  including for over half of active-duty female servicemembers. In  response, the Department of Defense announced important changes to  safeguard reproductive health care access.   Amendment No. 5 aims to revoke those protections and push  reproductive care further out of reach.   It is a shame that MAGA Republicans can trust women to defend our  nation on battlefields but refuse to trust them to make their own  healthcare decisions.   The military offers vast healthcare and educational benefits to  service members. Women  [[Page H3508]]  continue to be the fastest growing demographic in the military, but  restricting their rights tells them they're not welcome.   If my colleagues care about personal freedom, they will vote NO on  this amendment.
