 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support to H.R. 548  the Eastern Band of Cherokee Historic Lands Reacquisition Act.   H.R. 548 aims to take certain Federal lands in Tennessee into trust  for the benefit of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.   These lands are intended to be utilized for memorialization, the  interpretation of Cherokee history and culture, as well as a space for  meeting for events and performing traditions.   For historically significant locations like the Chota and Tanasi,  locations that once served as the Cherokee Nation's Capital, memorials  are to be built.   From as early as 1721 to 1730, Tanasi functioned as the Overhill  Cherokee's de facto capital.   The Cherokee historically were forced to abandon Tanasi, a historic  Overhill settlement in modern-day Monroe County, Tennessee, in the 19th  century in due to a rising town whose chief held more power.   Chota similarly an Overhill Cherokee towns site in Monroe Country,  Tennessee that developed after the loss of Tanasi.   The history of the Cherokee is one that is long and rich with  history, yet many persecutions from early the USA infringes on their  culture.   They are estimated to have numbered around 22,500 people in 1650 and  oversaw an area of the Appalachian Mountains that now is part of  Georgia, part of eastern Tennessee, and part of what is now North and  South Carolina.   The desire for fertile farmland during the Southeast's rapid  expansion of cotton cultivation, the finding of gold on Cherokee  territory, and the racial prejudice that many white southerners had  against American Indians were all factors in the removal of the  Cherokees.   The tribe gave up about 4 million acres of territory between 1783 and  1819 in the hopes that this would put a halt to ongoing displacement  efforts.   As authorized by the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which resulted in  the creation of the Trail of Tears, the Federal Government negotiated  treaties aimed at clearing Indian-occupied land for white settlers.   An estimated 4,000 of the roughly 16,000 Cherokee who were forcibly  removed between 1836 and 1839 passed away during this process.   The Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians was the name given to the  Cherokee by the U.S. Government in 1868 after many decades of struggle.   The relationship between the USA and the American Indian tribes is  far from perfect.   As such, offering the Cherokee this land to help rebuild the culture  that the United States actively displaced is a worthy cause.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 423, the  Pala Band of Mission Indians Land Transfer Act of 2023, which will take  certain land located in San Diego County, California into trust for the  benefit of the Pala Band of Mission Indians.   H.R. 423 directs the Department of the Interior to take 721.12 acres  of tribal land in San Diego County, California, into the trust in order  to preserve and protect the part of the Pala Band's reservation land.   The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act and any other federal statute are  both prohibited by H.R. 423 from being used to allow gambling on the  land.   The Pala Band, whose reservation it adjoins, currently owns the land  in fee simple.   The land is significant because it contains Chokla, a peak that is  extremely holy to the Pala Band and many other tribes in Southern  California.   Since at least 1903, the Pala Band, which consists of both Cupeo and  Luiseo ancestors, has used Chokla as a location for prayer and fasting.   In addition, the land has the remains of an ancestral village,  drawings on rocks, relics, and a variety of culturally significant  flora and animals.   In an attempt to prevent the construction of a landfill at the base  of Chokla in Gregory Canyon, the Pala Band bought the property in 2016.   The Pala Band aims to protect this holy area in its original state  after it is placed in trust, according to the U.S. Department of the  Interior.   A tribe's belief systems frequently have a physiological basis in  sacred sites.   These stories serve as a link between successive generations and  their predecessors, weaving them into the fabric of tribal identity and  culture.   The preservation and transmission of the unique identities,  traditions, and histories of Native peoples from one generation to the  next depends on the protection of Native sacred places and the defense  of the right to perform rites and ceremonies at these sites in secrecy  and without interference.   It goes beyond just being a matter of culture or religion for sacred  locations to be used and protected.   It is a recognized and safeguarded human right under international  law.   According to Article 25 of the United Nations Declaration on the  Rights of Indigenous People states that, ``Indigenous peoples have the  right to maintain and strengthen their distinctive spiritual  relationship with their traditionally owned or otherwise occupied and  used lands, territories, waters and coastal seas and other resources  and to uphold their obligations to future generations in this regard.''   It is important that we uphold the laws passed in the past to  preserve Indigenous peoples' traditions and cultures.   I strongly urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 423, which enables  the Pala Band tribes to secure their sacred place in order to preserve  their traditions and culture for future generations.   The bill will also restrict any gaming on Pala Band's land by putting  in the trust so tribes can peacefully perform and enjoy their rituals  at the scared land.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 302, ``To  Direct the Secretary of Energy to Establish a Program to Provide  Financial Assistance to Graduate Students and Postdoctoral Researchers  Pursuing Certain Courses of Study Relating to Cybersecurity and Energy  Infrastructure, and for Other Purposes.''   H.R. 302 is an important contribution to and necessary investment in  future generations of scientists and researchers, critical for our new  age of digitization and increased security threats nationally and  internationally.   This effort will support the fundamental development of a robust and  resilient cybersecurity workforce to help address the unique challenges  of recruiting and retaining cybersecurity professionals for careers  serving in local, state, federal or tribal governments.   As such, this bill is vital for the state of our future economies,  safety, and sovereignty as a nation.   Specifically, H.R. 302 will put forth the necessary funding through  the Secretary of Energy to strategically investment in our students  pursuing advanced studies in the fields of cybersecurity and energy  infrastructure.   For years, government officials and industry executives have run  elaborate simulations of a targeted cyberattack on the power grid or  gas pipelines in the United States, imagining how the country would  respond.   However, on May 6, 2021, we were attacked through a ransomware attack  by a criminal extortion ring that caused long lines of nervous  motorists at gas stations--stemming not from a government response but  from a unilateral decision by Colonial Pipeline, which controls nearly  half the gasoline, jet fuel and diesel flowing along the East Coast, to  turn off the spigot.   The lessons are clear and demonstrate how far the government and  private industry must go in preventing and dealing with cyberattacks  and in creating rapid backup systems for when critical infrastructure  goes down.   Furthermore, Russian hackers have been probing Texas' energy  infrastructure for weak points in digital systems that would allow them  to steal sensitive information or disrupt operations, according to  interviews with energy companies, state officials and cybersecurity  experts.   We must invest in our educational institutions and our student's  ability to hone the necessary skills to not only work in the digital  age but to become the cybersecurity leaders of the future.   Texas is already deemed to be the hub of science and technology  innovation and the center of cybersecurity development.   This bill will further support and uplift the potential of Texas and  other states to not only prepare students for cybersecurity careers but  also to raise awareness and protect against cyberthreats across our  nation.   Additionally, in supporting our economy this investment recognizes  the incredible value and revenue streams afforded through the  cybersecurity market.   This market is projected to reach $64.86 billion this year alone,  according to data provider Statista. And by 2027, that number is  expected to climb to $116.3 billion.   In line with that projected revenue growth, the U.S. Bureau of Labor  Statistics forecasts the number of information security analysts in the  U.S. will rise 35 percent between 2021 and 2031. And the bureau lists  the median pay for an information security analyst as $102,600 per  year.   We must continue to invest in the future of our cybersecurity  education and careers to support and uphold our future economies,  safety, and sovereignty as a nation.   Simply stated, this bill is smart policy moving us in that right  direction, and its passage will certainly help to keep our Nation  strong and competitive.   I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of H.R. 302.    Mr. Speaker, the Chinese spy balloon may not have  been the first, and it may not be the last.   It is interesting how the Chinese can characterize an outright spy  balloon of some sort, suggest it is only trying to find out the  weather, whether we have sunny days or not.   I rise to support H.R. 302 that provided for establishment of a  program to provide financial assistance to graduate students and  postdoctoral researchers pursuing certain courses of  [[Page H699]]  study related to cybersecurity and energy infrastructure, and other  purposes.   I am on the Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Innovation  Subcommittee, and I cannot tell you how important it is to develop a  modern, 21st century workforce and to develop the investment to give us  the future generations of scientists and researchers critical for our  new age of digitalization and increased security threats nationally and  internationally.   This is not going to be the end. It is simply the beginning. It is  important for us, as Americans, to have that workforce that is  entrenched in cybersecurity protecting Americans' national security.   It is important to recruit these young people, and I look forward to  participating with all universities in Houston on recruiting a new  cybersecurity workforce.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, let me thank the distinguished  gentleman from the great State of Maryland, Congressman Ivey, and the  distinguished gentlewoman from the great State of California (Ms.  Kamlager-Dove), for leading such an important Special Order. Let me  also thank Chairman Horsford for immediately capturing the pain and  sentiment of the American people.   When I say that, I am speaking of all the American people, Mr.  Speaker, because I believe more than any part of our constitutional  rights, the right to be free and safe in this Nation is one that  Americans crave. For no matter whether they are in the beauty of Utah,  in the richness of Mississippi, in the smart and urban life of New  York, or in the beauty of the West Coast, Republican or Democrat,  Independent and any other affiliation, we are concerned about safety.   The reason is because safety involves the coming and going of our  family members and our children. For any of us who have ever been  parents, we have always had a little trepidation when that little one  leaves home for the first time to go to pre-K or kindergarten that they  would be safe.   We are appalled at the unsafe conditions that we face in our schools  today: Uvalde, Sandy Hook, Santa Fe, and beyond. We know that violence  permeated those safe spaces.   At the same time I think, as I thank the Congressional Black Caucus  for its recognition, that as it speaks here on the floor today it is  embracing an American issue: public safety.   I will be looking for Republicans who are going to admit that even as  we want those who protect and serve to go home to their families, we  cannot deny American mothers and fathers the right to expect their  young people to come home.   We can walk, if I might say, and chew gum at the same time. We can  uplift the urgency of the importance of law enforcement at all levels:  first responders, EMTs, and firefighters, as I do, as a member of the  Fire Services Caucus, former chair of the Crime, Terrorism and Homeland  Security Subcommittee and now ranking member. We have worked in the  House Judiciary Committee and worked with the Congressional Black  Caucus on major legislation that deals with answering all of these  concerns.                                time  1930    Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss to think that there are not  Republicans who will not join us in this whole idea of crafting a 21st  century approach to police-community relations.   There is no one that could in any way accept the murder of a man on  the streets in video, as was my constituent's brother. Philonise Floyd  is here, and he will join me at the State of the Union. His brother,  George Floyd, big George, who grew up in Cuney Homes, was everybody's  friend. Their mother and their family was everybody's family. They  opened their doors to children who may not have a good hot meal, and  they gave it to them.   However, like every American who leaves their hometown and looks for  a greener space, as what he looked for in Minneapolis, Minnesota, he  found a deadly end. No one could accept that. The reason, Mr. Speaker,  that I know that is because the people who took to the streets  nonviolently and walked shoulder to shoulder with us were from all  walks of life.   Out of that was crafted a combination of Republican-supported ideas,  things that were embraced in the Trump executive order, now embraced in  the Biden executive order dealing with a reconstruct of police- community relationships, which would include the idea of making sure  that random stops that caught Tyre Nichols in the throngs of violence,  that lasted for an hour on videotape; or the tragedy of Breonna Taylor;  or the tragedy of Eric Garner; or the tragedy in the early stages under  color of law, Trayvon Martin, by someone who was supposed to be a civil  patrol, and a young boy lost his life; or the young boy in Cleveland,  Ohio, who lost his life at age 12 or 13 years old; or the cafeteria  worker who lost his life; or Pam Turner, who lost her life; or Sandra  Bland, who lost her life.   We can construct under the Constitution a reasonable response to  traffic stops included in the early premise of legislation. We can deal  with the right way to, in essence, address a human being, and  chokeholds when you are not in danger basically are without place. No  knocks that come to, in essence, a wrong person's home or someone  entering the wrong home. All of that is reasonable to deal with in a  new construct of which we hope the President of the United States will  join us in a bipartisan, bicameral effort.   That would include training and accountability as well. It would  include dealing with mental health concerns or violence intervention as  well as the necessity of wearing body cams, which were the element of  truth and have been.   I was very proud in the small cities that I represent, Mr. Speaker,  to be able to provide grant money for our cities to get body cams,  small cities that don't have it. Just think if we passed legislation  that allows all departments to seek body cams for truth for all that  are involved.   I rise today to capture the essence of the importance of this  Congressional Black Caucus Special Order because it is laying the  footprints for the day tomorrow, as the President speaks to the Nation  on many issues.   There is no doubt, as someone who went to the funeral of Tyre Nichols  as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, to be able to say that  we can do this together.   Public safety is an American issue. It is an American families'  issue. It is the issue of those who are entrusted to protect and serve.  It is the issue of local government, State government. It is the issue  of moms and dads. It is the issue of teenagers and young families and  senior citizens. It does not leave one person untouched.   I believe that the work that was done in the last years with  legislation that carried the name of George Floyd has the ability to  embrace a wide perspective of diversity and new changes and inspiration  and, of course, working as one would with all persons concerned and  even respecting the other body.   The Congressional Black Caucus has taken up the light, and I am  grateful for that leadership. I look forward that we continue to work  because we are not a nation of laws and values if we do not adhere as a  nation to the belief that every person deserves the dignity of their  humanity and does not deserve, under the Constitution, to be denied  their equal protection of the law, their due process in the workings  between law and community.   I thank my very important coleaders of this Special Order. I wish  them well. I know that they will be a dynamic team. I had the privilege  of doing this in the last session. I can tell you, you will have a  moment of joy every time you rise on this floor and are joined by the  esteemed members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Each and every one  of them have their own special story. We do make a difference. We can  change lives, and we can change laws.
