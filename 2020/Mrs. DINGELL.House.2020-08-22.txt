 Madam Speaker, through the Civil War, the Spanish flu,  the Great Depression, and two world wars, the United States Postal  Service has not stopped. No matter the conditions--snow, rain, heat, or  darkness--the dedicated men and women of the Postal Service have  carried out their mission with pride. The Postal Service is one of the  great pillars of our democracy. It is enshrined in the Constitution,  and it is an essential service for so many.   The actions by the Postmaster General in recent weeks is a sabotage  campaign aimed at manipulating the mail service, but whatever the  intent, it is hurting everyday Americans--seniors, veterans, and  working men and women.   In Michigan we have been told that just this month 10 mail sorting  machines have been removed and destroyed. This American institution is  being deliberately dismantled. It is not only an attack on the Postal  Service, it is an attack on our Constitution, our way of life, and,  yes, our democracy.   My message is simple: protect the Postal Service and our Republic.                            ____________________
