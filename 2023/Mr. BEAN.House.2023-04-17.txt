 Dr. Foxx, thank you so much. You are doing such a great job  as chairman of Education and the Workforce. Thank you for the  opportunity to serve on that committee.   Thank you for highlighting the decades-long campaign that has  manifested into bigger problems for America by the Chinese Communist  Party.   America's education system is being purchased and manipulated by  China. Since 2013, $12 billion has flooded in from foreign sources to  U.S. colleges and universities, including more than a billion from  communist China.   Rather than forcing colleges and universities to comply with  reporting requirements under section 117 of the Higher Education Act,  this administration is playing into the hands of the Chinese Communist  Party by refusing to pursue enforcement.   For the past 2 years, Mr. Speaker, this administration has been  trying to distract the American people of the very real threat China  poses with its far-left policies. That ends tonight.   Up next to help spread the word of exactly how bad an actor China is,  is my friend and colleague, the gentleman from California.   He is the chairman of the Workforce Protections Subcommittee. Mr.  Speaker, I yield 8 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Kiley).
