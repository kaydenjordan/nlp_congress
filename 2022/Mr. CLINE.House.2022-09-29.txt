 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Dr. Daniel Harrington,  the vice dean of Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine in Roanoke,  Virginia, who is set to retire at the end of this month after more than  14 years of service.   From humble beginnings, Dr. Harrington attended West Virginia  University for both his undergraduate and medical degrees. He then took  a residency at the University of Virginia, and it was there that he  learned about Carilion's nascent psychiatry residency program, which  would give him a chance to develop something that was all his own.   Dr. Harrington took that opportunity in 1990, and he and his family  moved to Roanoke.   In 2006, former Carilion CEO Ed Murphy approached Dr. Harrington with  the idea of partnering with Virginia Tech and starting a medical  school.   Dr. Harrington began traveling the country with then-Virginia Tech  President Charles Steger and operated a public-private academic  partnership to make the dream a reality.   Ever since, the school has been led on multiple fronts by the strong  leadership of Dr. Harrington.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Dr. Harrington and his wife, Gil, best wishes for  a well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
