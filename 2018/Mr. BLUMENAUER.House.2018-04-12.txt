 Mr. Speaker, it is so poignant that Paul Ryan  announces his retirement the same week that the Republicans bring to  the floor the so-called balanced budget amendment, which signals  surrender. Republicans can't budget responsibly.   After the largest transfer of wealth in American history with their  tax bill that was so flawed they could not even risk having a hearing  on it, it was literally being written while we were in work session in  the committee. They changed provisions by the hour in a mad scramble  for votes and special-interest support.   Ryan leaves as his legacy--a guy who on the Budget Committee railed  about deficits, deficit spending, who tried slashing social spending-- he leaves as his legacy trillion dollar deficits for as far as the eye  can see, and providing with this balanced budget amendment an excuse to  slash spending on programs that matter most to Americans: Medicare,  Social Security, Medicaid, even ultimately, it would threaten defense  itself.   The balanced budget amendment that the Republicans are going to bring  to the floor is a classic example of bait and switch. Republicans have  the White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. If they  wanted to actually produce a balanced budget, there is nothing stopping  them from doing it now. But instead, they came forward with the omnibus  bill that explodes spending and adds to the deficit even further.   So what do they do now? They are offering this proposal as a fig  leaf. The balanced budget amendment that they would freeze into the  Constitution would force somebody 4 years, 5 years, 8 years in the  future to do what Republicans either will not, cannot, or are afraid to  do today.   My senior Senator for years was Mark Hatfield, a principled  Republican, and even though I am a Democrat, I was proud to help him in  his last campaign when he was under some severe pressure.   Mark Hatfield was principled. He chaired the Appropriations Committee  in the Senate. When the Republicans brought forth the balanced budget  amendment in 1995, it failed by one vote in the Senate. That one vote,  and the only Republican vote against it, was Mark Hatfield because he  refused to handcuff the United States into the future and be part of a  charade, because he knew as chair of the Appropriations Committee, they  controlled the budget strings and they could reduce spending if they  wanted. He knew the irony that some of the very people who were touting  the balanced budget amendment would turn to him asking for increased  spending for their pet projects.   Today, Republicans pretend themselves to be outraged over the Obama- era deficits which were incurred when we were trying to protect the  economy from global collapse. All of the independent experts agree that  that money was important. It was spent on infrastructure. It was spent  on medical research. It was spent on providing a safety net for  struggling families.   What is the excuse today for a trillion dollar deficit? I mean, after  all of that hard work, the economy has stabilized. It is not growing  dramatically, but it is growing. The unemployment rate is low. What is  the excuse for a trillion dollar deficit and massive tax giveaways?  They are feeling the heat.   Now, they are going to try and deflect responsibility for their  trillion dollar deficits in a time of relative prosperity and low  unemployment as a result of the hard work that the Republicans opposed.   Republicans and Paul Ryan have made a shambles out of the Tax Code; a  mockery out of tax fairness. They are not cutting spending or raising  revenues. They just want to put that off for somebody in the future and  pretend all of a sudden they are fiscally responsible.   Mr. Speaker, I don't think it is going to work.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this is a very poignant moment. Speaker  Paul Ryan announces his retirement the same week that the Republicans  bring to the floor the so-called balanced budget amendment, which  signals a surrender, that Republicans admit they can't budget  responsibly.   After the largest transfer of wealth in our Nation's history with a  tax bill that was so flawed they couldn't even risk having a hearing on  it, they literally were writing the bill while we were in work session  in a desperate scramble for votes and special-interest support.   Ryan leaves as his legacy--a guy who, on the Budget Committee, railed  against deficits and deficit spending, slashing social spending--he  leaves as his legacy trillion dollar deficits for as far as the eye can  see, year after year.   They come forward with a balanced budget amendment. Wait a minute. If  my friends wanted to balance the budget, they could do it. They control  the White House, they control the Senate, they control the House. If  they wanted to, there is nothing stopping them. But, instead, they came  forward with an omnibus bill that explodes spending further and adds to  the deficit.   The balanced budget amendment would freeze into the Constitution a  requirement that somebody else, 8 years from now, balance the budget.  It is a classic bait-and-switch situation.   What a legacy for Paul Ryan and the Republicans. They have made a  shambles out of the Tax Code, they have made a mockery of tax fairness.  They are not willing to make hard spending decisions today. They want  to freeze something in the Constitution that would require somebody 7,  8, 10 years from now to do what they are afraid, unwilling, or unable  to do today. It is a sham, bait-and-switch in the classic sense.   I don't think the American public is going to stand for it and,  certainly, no responsible Member of this House should vote for it.
