 Mr. President, today I recognize Dezmond Ward, an  intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all the hard work he has done  on behalf of myself, my staff, and the State of South Dakota.   Dezmond is a graduate of Milbank High School in Milbank, SD. In  August, he will graduate from Concordia College in Moorhead, MN, where  he studies political science and history. Dezmond is a dedicated and  diligent worker who has been devoted to getting the most out of his  internship experience and who has been a true asset to the office.   I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Dezmond for all of the  fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the years to  come.                            ____________________
