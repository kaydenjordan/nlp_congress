 Madam Speaker, for too long, Americans, including  children, struggling with mental illness and substance abuse, have  suffered in silence, intimidated by stigma and unable to access  treatment.    The 2019 Rhode Island Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that 15  percent of Rhode Island high school students reported attempting  suicide one or more times in the previous 12 months. That is 4 students  in a class of 25.   There is a mental health crisis in Rhode Island and throughout our  country, and we have to address it now.   The Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act will save  lives by expanding access to mental health and substance abuse disorder  treatment through: Establishing the Behavioral Health Crisis  Coordination Office; reauthorizing critical public health programs to  prevent suicide and expand access to mental health and substance use  disorder treatment; and eliminating unnecessary limits on providers'  ability to prescribe treatments for opioid use disorder.   I urge my colleagues to join with me in support of this critical  legislation to save lives and to help us address addiction all across  our country.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special  Order.    Madam Speaker, my colleagues and I are here today for  this Special Order hour to celebrate Pride Month.   Pride is a time of celebration of our community and its diversity. It  is a time to uplift LGBTQ+ people all across the country and honor our  identities and how these individuals have shaped our lives.   Pride is also a time of action. Fifty-three years ago, LGBTQ+ patrons  fought back against discrimination and police harassment at New York's  Stonewall Inn. Now, we need to harness that same strength and  determination to fight back against State legislatures' attacks against  our community, especially trans and nonbinary kids.   For every person able to celebrate Pride Month, there are others who  are struggling. There are countless people unable to come out because  of discrimination, harassment, and threats of violence. In too many  States, this discrimination is being led by elected officials.   Here in Congress, the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus fights  every day so that all people, regardless of sexual identification or  gender identity, can live their lives openly and have every opportunity  to be successful and to lead happy lives.   I am proud to have introduced the Equality Act, along with every  single member of the Democratic Caucus as cosponsors, to ensure that  LGBTQ+ people are protected from discrimination in key areas of life. I  also introduced the Global Respect Act to deny  [[Page H5813]]  visas to those who commit gross human rights abuses against members of  the LGBTQ+ community around the world.   Both of these bills passed the House with bipartisan support, and I  urge the Senate to quickly do the same and advance LGBTQ+ equality both  at home and abroad.                                time  1915    As chair of the Equality Caucus, I will never stop fighting so that  all LGBTQ+ people, no matter where they live or how they identify, can  live their lives openly with the full protections of our Federal laws.   We have made important progress this Congress. In addition to passing  several LGBTQ+ bills through the House, two key caucus priority bills  have also become law: H.R. 49, to designate the Pulse nightclub as a  National Memorial, and S. 937, which included the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE  Act, which provides for grants to improve data collection of hate  crimes, including hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation or gender  identity, and grants for States to create hotlines to assist victims of  hate crimes.   I am so grateful we have a devoted ally to the LGBTQ+ community in  the White House who signed both of these bills into law. President  Biden has been a champion for our community. Just last week, he signed  an executive order advancing LGBTQI+ equality during Pride Month. This  executive order aligns with the goals of numerous bills introduced by  Equality Caucus members.   But we are not done fighting for LGBTQ+ equality. Later this week, we  will be voting on the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act to ensure Federal  surveys collect information on the LGBTQI+ community. We know better  data leads to better policies, and this bill will ensure we have the  data we need to draft the best solutions to address the needs of our  community.   It has been an especially difficult year for our community,  particularly for transgender and nonbinary youth who are under attack  across the country.   Please know that the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus and I will  never stop fighting for you. You deserve to live your lives openly,  free from discrimination or harassment, and to have every opportunity  to succeed as your non-LGBTQ+ peers.   This Pride Month, we all have to recommit to fighting for true  equality for all, every single person in our country, no matter where  they live, no matter their gender identity or sexual orientation.   I am so grateful to be joined today by several of my colleagues who  are helping to lead this fight for LGBTQ+ equality in the Halls of  Congress, and I look forward to hearing from them during this Special  Order hour.   I again extend a happy Pride to everyone.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  Moulton), a member of the Equality Caucus, a strong advocate for the  LGBTQ+ community, who took time out of a markup to be sure that he  could be a part of this Special Order. For that, we are incredibly  grateful.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his very  powerful words and for being here tonight.   As Congressman Moulton was speaking, I was thinking of Congressman  Pappas, because Congressman Pappas has been a great champion for  veterans. He serves as a distinguished member of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee and the Veterans' Affairs Committee and in  that role has been an extraordinary national leader on veterans'  issues.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr.  Pappas), a co-chairman of the Equality Caucus and a champion for the  LGBTQ+ community.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Pappas so much for  his powerful words and for his leadership and the example he has set.   Madam Speaker, I will now call on another co-chairman of the Equality  Caucus, an extraordinarily distinguished member of the Financial  Services Committee and Homeland Security Committee and someone who,  though he is very young, has, throughout his entire life, been a great  inspiration to young LGBTQ Americans and continues that great tradition  as a Member of Congress.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Torres).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his words and  for the example that he set.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms.  Stevens), my friend, a member of the Equality Caucus, and an incredibly  strong advocate for the LGBTQ+ community, a cosponsor of the Equality  Act, and a cosponsor of every single piece of legislation that has come  to the floor of consequence to our community.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her words  and her tremendous support of the LGBTQ+ community.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green), my  friend, a member of the Equality Caucus, a strong and consistent  advocate for the LGBTQ+ community, the lead sponsor of the House  LGBTQIA+ Pride Month resolution for many, many years, and a great  champion for our community.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Green, and I know Glen is  looking down very proud of your words tonight and the difference it is  going to make to those who are watching.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Manning), a very thoughtful member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, as  well as someone who serves on the Education and Labor Committee, a  member of the Equality Caucus, and a longtime champion of equality,  justice, women's reproductive healthcare, and so many issues important  to the LGBTQ+ community, and my friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  beautiful words and for her great support for the LGBTQ community.   Madam Speaker, before I conclude tonight's Special Order hour, I want  to make some final comments.   We celebrate pride as a community and very often people think of  pride celebrations as joyous public events with lots of people  gathering. We just had a pride celebration in Providence last weekend.  The estimates were that over 100,000 people attended.   Part of the importance of pride is that it is a moment of great  visibility for our community. For too long, members of the LGBTQ+  community were taught to be ashamed of who they are, to hide their true  identity, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Pride was not only a  time to celebrate the importance of our community but to be visible--to  stop being invisible people but to be visible in the communities where  we live and work.   Over the years, we have had extraordinary leaders from our community  in business, medicine, politics, the arts, education, and all areas of  life.   We have nine members of the LGBTQ community serving right here in the  House and two in the United States Senate, examples of political  leadership all across the country so that young people can see  themselves in people who are accomplishing things in all areas of  life--in the law, politics, medicine, and education.   It is a time of celebration, but we have to acknowledge this year  that we are facing great challenges as a community. Particularly young  trans kids and nonbinary kids are living in States where the adults are  putting forth legislation that will make them invisible, that will  subject them to horrific discrimination, that will not recognize the  humanity of those young people.   It is a time of celebration. It is a time to take stock of all that  we have done. But it is also a time for action to remind ourselves and  the rest of the  [[Page H5817]]  country that we demand to live in a country where we enjoy full legal  protections and we can live our lives free from discrimination of any  kind.   The good news is, overwhelmingly, a vast majority of the American  people support equality for LGBTQ people. They think discrimination is  wrong.   Equality is a founding value of this country. In every State in  America, a majority of voters believe that discrimination against LGBTQ  people is wrong because a cornerstone of who we are as Americas is that  we know discrimination is wrong.   It is only in the Republican Conference that we have to convince  people that discrimination against the LGBTQ community is wrong. It is  time for Congress and our Republican colleagues to catch up to the rest  of the country that understands that when you deprive a member of the  LGBTQ community of full equality, you not only hurt that individual but  you hurt the whole community because the community is deprived of all  that that person can accomplish and contribute.   That is the real harm of discrimination. It is not just to the  individual. It is to the whole community and to our whole country.   Madam Speaker, as we mark Pride Month, we not only celebrate, but we  also commit ourselves to make additional progress to continue in our  fight for full equality. The LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus here in the House  will continue to lead that fight in solidarity with all of our  colleagues.   I am proud to be part of a political party that fully supports LGBTQ  equality. When we introduced the Equality Act, it was cosponsored by  every single Democrat in the Caucus. Everyone wanted to be a partner in  this fight for full equality, and that is what the American people  expect.   Madam Speaker, I say to the young people out there who may be  struggling with their own sexual orientation, their own gender  identity, feeling alone, feeling like they don't belong, feeling like  they are not valued: I am standing on the floor of the House of  Representatives as the chair of the Equality Caucus to tell you that  you are valued. You are exactly how God created and expected you to be.  You are loved by your community and your family. You will continue to  be valued. You have people here in the Congress of the United States  who are fighting every single day to make sure you can live in a  country that will provide you with full protections and that you can  live a life free from discrimination of any kind.                                time  2000    I hope that will be some comfort to know that you have a President  who said right from that rostrum, Madam Speaker, to the trans kids: I  have your back.   That was the President of the United States who is the most powerful  person on the planet saying to young people from our community he has  your back.   So that has to give us a lot of hope of what future Pride  celebrations will mean and the kind of country we live in. I thank all  my colleagues who participated in tonight's Special Order hour.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
