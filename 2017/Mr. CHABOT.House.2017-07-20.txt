 Mr. Speaker, as dean of the Ohio delegation, I am greatly  saddened to inform the Members that our former colleague, Ralph Regula,  who was the dean of the Ohio delegation, has passed away.   Ralph was 92 years of age. He had the honor of serving his  constituents back home in Ohio for 36 years. He was a key player on the  Appropriations Committee for many years. He will be truly missed.   I wanted to inform the Members that Congressman Bob Gibbs--Ralph was  a  [[Page H6132]]  constituent of Congressman Gibbs--will be organizing a Special Order  next week. So Members who are interested, on either side of the aisle,  in participating in that should contact Representative Gibbs' office.                            ____________________
