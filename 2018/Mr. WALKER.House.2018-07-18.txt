 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of this amendment.   In December, Congress passed historic tax reform that frees people  from ObamaCare's erroneous individual mandate which punished lower and  middle income families for not buying health insurance they don't want  or cannot afford.   Well, how does D.C. respond? The City Council has now decreed that  all residents must buy health insurance, no matter the cost or need.  And listen, if you refuse, not only will you be financially penalized,  but the D.C. government can seize your personal property. What?   The idea that a local government can force you to buy a private  product just because of your zip code is unjust and un-American.   Congress, which has direct oversight of D.C., cannot allow the  District to ignore Federal law and use politics to punish their  residents.   I urge my colleagues to support the measure.
