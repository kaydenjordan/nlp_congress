 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1235) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in  recognition of the 60th Anniversary of the Naismith Memorial Basketball  Hall of Fame, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1235         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Naismith Memorial Basketball       Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) On December 21, 1891, a young physical education       instructor named James Naismith, introduced the game of       ``basket ball'' to his physical education class, in       Springfield, Massachusetts.        (2) In 1959, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame       was founded and dedicated to the game's creator Dr. James       Naismith, in Springfield, MA, ``The Birthplace of       Basketball'' and became the first and only museum to honor       the game at all levels around the world.        (3) The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame honors       players who have achieved greatness, exemplary coaches,       referees and other major contributors to the sport of       basketball. The Inaugural Hall of Fame Class of 1959 had       seventeen honorees who were inducted, including Dr. James       Naismith, George Mikan, Forrest C. Allen, Angelo Luisetti,       Original Celtics and First Team.        (4) The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame is       recognized throughout the world as the premier institution       entrusted with recording and disseminating the history of the       game of basketball and recognizing and honoring the       achievements of its greatest players, coaches, and       contributors.        (5) The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame provides       an entertaining, enriching experience and is known for its       educational outreach programs and celebrates and promotes       positive core values demonstrated by basketball's hallowed       heroes and its founder.        (6) Basketball is one of America's national treasures; with       its fast pace which reflects the freedom of expression and       the modern experience of life in the 21st century.        (7) Since its opening in 1959, the Naismith Memorial       Basketball Hall of Fame is home to the largest collection of       basketball memorabilia in the world, including more than       30,000 three-dimensional objects, 800,000 photographs, and       1.5 million documents.        (8) The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame welcomes       more than 6,000,000 visitors interested in discovering the       rich history of the game through its stories, its       personalities, and its most celebrated moments.        (9) The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame reaches       over seven million Americans through its educational       programs, events, exhibits, social media, and its interactive       website.        (10) The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame's       customized educational programs use basketball to teach young       students around the world the important lessons on a variety       of topics including: financial literacy, mathematics, civil       rights, leadership of character, women's and men's history,       and geography.        (11) The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame will       lead the celebration of the 60th Anniversary of Basketball       and will partner with a select group of constituents       including the National Basketball Association, the National       Collegiate Athletic Association, and USA Basketball in       commemorating the game throughout the 2019-2020 basketball       season.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gonzalez) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kentucky?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kentucky?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1235, the Naismith  Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act.   Basketball was invented in Springfield, Massachusetts, by Dr. James  Naismith in 1891.   I have the privilege of representing the Sixth Congressional District  of Kentucky, home of the University of Kentucky Wildcats. We  affectionately know the University of Kentucky Wildcats basketball team  as the greatest tradition in the history of college basketball; the  winningest program in college basketball; eight national championships;  and, of course, the greatest fans in the history of college basketball.  We call them the Big Blue Nation.   While it may be to the surprise of many that a Kansas Jayhawk and not  a Kentucky Wildcat invented the game, there is no doubt that this sport  has helped many Americans learn the value of teamwork, sacrifice, and  hard work.   Today, by some estimates, basketball is considered the fastest- growing sport in the world. With current megastars like LeBron James,  Steph Curry, Candace Parker, and Brittney Griner, we don't have to  wonder why we are in the Golden Age of basketball again.   And while the sport is wildly successful today with rising stars like  former Kentucky players John Wall, Anthony Davis, Devin Booker, and  Karl-Anthony Towns, the future is in good hands.   I could talk all day about the upcoming NCAA basketball season, but  instead I want to turn my attention to the Naismith Memorial Basketball  Hall of Fame.   Established in 1959, the Basketball Hall of Fame has honored players,  coaches, referees, and other basketball icons for their contributions  to this great American sport. From Larry Bird, Bob Cousy, Charles  Barkley, Bill Russell, Jerry West, Patrick Ewing, Oscar Robertson, Pete  Maravich, Bill Walton, Yao Ming, Shaq, TMac, A.I., the Millers,  Swoopes, Coach Summitt, Coach Calipari, Magic Johnson, Dr. J., Wilt  Chamberlain, Coach Adolph Rupp, Coach John Wooden, to Coach Dean Smith,  the Basketball Hall of Fame allows fans, young and old, to reminisce or  even discover the rich history of the game they love.   To the basketball lore of Chamberlain scoring 100 points in a single  game, to the athletic heroics of Michael Jordan, to Lisa Leslie's dunk,  to the UConn Ladies' streak of 111 wins, to Curry and company  revolutionizing the game with a constant barrage of 3-pointers, the  Basketball Hall of Fame is helping fans relive the greatest moments in  basketball history while teaching important life lessons to youngsters  through educational programs.   To honor 60 years of excellence in 2020 by the Naismith Memorial  Basketball Hall of Fame, it is with great pleasure that I am on the  House floor today encouraging my colleagues to support the Naismith  Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act. This  legislation requires the U.S. Mint to produce commemorative coins for  fans to collect and enjoy in celebration of this momentous occasion, in  denominations of $5 gold coins, $1 silver coins, and half-dollar clad  coins. Importantly, these coins would be produced at no cost to the  taxpayer, and surcharges on the sale of these coins would go to support  programs at the Hall of Fame after raising matching funds from the  private sector.   I especially want to thank Congressman Richard Neal from  Massachusetts, home to the Springfield location of the Hall of Fame;  and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy from California, for their hard work  on this legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to support this  legislation honoring this great American sport.   Go Cats, go Big Blue.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Texas and, as I  said before, the gentleman from Massachusetts for their advocacy of  this bipartisan piece of legislation, again, honoring a great American  tradition: the great sport of basketball.   Whether at the high school level, the collegiate level, or the  professional level, it is true--the gentleman from Texas is absolutely  right--this great sport unites our country. There is friendly  competition--sometimes vigorous competition--in the rivalries that we  see, whether it is Kentucky playing Louisville or North Carolina versus  Duke, or if it is the Lakers and the Celtics from the 1980s or the  Pistons and the Bulls in those great games in the 1990s.   There are a lot of people behind this legislation that deserve thanks  and appreciation. I want to thank, in particular, Jim Host, who is  credited for coining the phrase the ``Final Four,'' and Coach Calipari  of the University of Kentucky, who has been a tireless champion of this  effort. Without his leadership, I don't think this would have happened.   I want to also thank all of the members of the Hall of Fame who have  come to Washington to talk to us. Jay Bilas came down here in the Ways  and Means Committee and talked about the importance of this, and many  of the other former players. I have to thank the players because the  Hall of Fame recognizes their amazing skills and their talents, and if  it weren't for their advocacy, this wouldn't have happened as well.   Finally and probably most important of all, the Hall of Fame  Commemorative Coin Act that we are enacting here today is in honor of  the fans who make this great sport possible, the American people who  have fallen in love with this great American sport. We have to thank  the fans for creating such excitement. Whether it is the McDonald's All  American Basketball Game at the high school level, or if it is the  Final Four in the national title in the NCAA in both men's and women's  basketball, or if it is Game 7 of the NBA Finals, there is nothing more  electric than this sport at crunch time.   Again, I urge my colleagues to come together and support the Naismith  Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 1235, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2519) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint  commemorative coins in recognition of the 100th anniversary of The  American Legion, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2519         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as ``The American Legion 100th       Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds that--        (1) on March 15, 1919, The American Legion was founded in       Paris, France, by members of the American Expeditionary Force       occupying Europe after World War I and concerned about the       welfare of their comrades and communities upon their return       to the United States;        (2) on September 16, 1919, Congress chartered The American       Legion, which quickly grew to become the largest veterans       service organization in the United States;        (3) The American Legion conferences in Washington, DC, in       1923 and 1924 crafted the first United States Flag Code,       which was adopted in schools, States, cities and counties       prior to being enacted in 1942, establishing the proper use,       display, and respect for the colors of the United States;        (4) during World War II, The American Legion developed and       presented to Congress its case for vastly improved support       for medically discharged, disabled veterans, which ultimately       became the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 (58 Stat.       284; chapter 268), better known as the G.I. Bill of Rights,       and was drafted by former American Legion National Commander       Harry W. Colmery in Washington's Mayflower Hotel;        (5) through the leadership and advocacy of The American       Legion, the G.I. Bill was enacted in June 1944, which led to       monumental changes in United States society, including the       democratization of higher education, home ownership for       average people in the United States, better VA hospitals,       business  [[Page H7453]]       and farm loans for veterans, and the ability to appeal       conditions of military discharge;        (6) defying those who argued the G.I. Bill would break the       Treasury, according to various researchers, the G.I. Bill       provided a tremendous return on investment of $7 to the       United States economy for every $1 spent on the program,       triggering a half-century of prosperity in the United States;        (7) after Hurricane Hugo in 1989, The American Legion       established the National Emergency Fund to provide immediate       cash relief for veterans who have been affected by natural       disasters;        (8) American Legion National Emergency Fund grants after       Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, for instance, exceeded       $1,700,000;        (9) The American Legion fought to see the Veterans       Administration elevated to Cabinet-level status as the       Department of Veterans Affairs, ensuring support for veterans       would be set at the highest level of the Federal Government,       as a priority issue for the President;        (10) after a decades-long struggle to improve the       adjudication process for veterans disputing claims decisions,       The American Legion helped shape and introduce the Veterans       Reassurance Act to create a venue for judicial review of       veterans' appeals;        (11) building on these efforts, legislation was passed in       1988 to create the United States Court of Veterans Appeals,       today known as the United States Court of Appeals for       Veterans Claims;        (12) The American Legion created the American Legacy       Scholarship Fund for children of military members killed on       active duty on or after September 11, 2001;        (13) in 2016, The American Legion's National Executive       Committee amended the original scholarship criteria to       include children of veterans with 50 percent or greater VA       disability ratings;        (14) President George W. Bush signed into law the Post-9/11       Veterans Educational Assistance Act (title V of the       Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008; 122 Stat. 2357), a       next-generation G.I. Bill strongly supported by The American       Legion and the most comprehensive educational benefits       package since the original G.I. Bill of Rights was enacted in       1944;        (15) in August 2018, The American Legion will begin its       centennial recognition at the 100th National Convention in       Minneapolis, Minnesota, the site of the first American Legion       National Convention; and        (16) in March 2019, the organization will celebrate its       100th birthday in Paris, France, and September 16, 2019, will       mark the 100th anniversary of The American Legion's Federal       charter.       SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.         (a) Denominations.--In recognition and celebration of the       100th anniversary of The American Legion, the Secretary of       the Treasury (hereafter in this Act referred to as the       ``Secretary'') shall mint and issue the following coins:        (1) $5 gold coins.--Not more than 50,000 $5 coins, which       shall--        (A) weigh 8.359 grams;        (B) have a diameter of 0.850 inches; and        (C) contain not less than 90 percent gold.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gonzalez) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kentucky?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kentucky?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2519, The American  Legion 100th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act, which would require  the Department of the Treasury to mint and issue commemorative coins in  recognition and celebration of the 100th anniversary of The American  Legion.   For nearly 100 years, The American Legion, which was formed for  veterans and by veterans, through the support of Congress, has helped  to provide services to wartime veterans and the communities in which  they live across the United States and the globe.   On March 27, 1919, Theodore Roosevelt sent a telegram to Mr. William  Marshall Bullitt of Louisville, Kentucky, and many more respected  military wartime veteran leaders across the country which announced:  ``A conference will be held at St. Louis about May 1 for the purpose of  organizing an association composed of those who  [[Page H7454]]  have been in the land and naval forces of the United States in this  war. A convention held in France has already organized forces there in  an association called The American Legion and will have its  representatives at this convention.''   Shortly after this first national gathering of unified veterans held  in St. Louis, Missouri, the United States Congress officially chartered  The American Legion on September 16, 1919.   Since this charter, The American Legion has grown to be one of the  most influential, nonpartisan, nonprofit, and the largest veterans  service organization in the United States, with a standing membership  of over 2.4 million veterans in 14,000 posts worldwide.   The Legion annually raises millions of dollars in donations at the  local, State, and national levels to help veterans and their families  during times of need and to provide college scholarships and other  opportunities for deserving students.   Even in the Sixth Congressional District of Kentucky, which I proudly  represent, The American Legion continues to be a strong and aggressive  advocate for wartime veteran-centered issues. Just yesterday, I met  with many of The American Legion Nicholasville Post veterans right  there serving and honoring the Gold Star families at Camp Nelson in  Jessamine County, Kentucky.   The American Legion Department of Kentucky has established 139 posts,  3 areas, and 11 districts in our Commonwealth of 120 counties. The  American Legion continues to strive to achieve what has always been  held as a sacred duty to every good American since General George  Washington's vision to promote the importance of providing provisions  for the adequate care for war disabled veterans and their families.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Massachusetts and his  leadership. I do recognize the great game of basketball was, in fact,  invented in Massachusetts. That is okay, because Massachusetts gave us  Coach Calipari along the way. We really appreciate his leadership.   This would not have happened without the leadership of the gentleman  from Massachusetts. It is my honor to work with him on this bipartisan  piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on The American  Legion 100th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Kentucky has 14 minutes  remaining. The time of the gentleman from Texas has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, once again, in support of The American Legion 100th  Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act, I want to share a story from just  yesterday in Nicholasville, Kentucky, where The American Legion was  there, as they always are, supporting our veteran families.   We were at Camp Nelson--which was originally a Union Army cemetery,  but since the Civil War, has become a final resting place for many of  our heroes--yesterday to honor many of the Kentucky Gold Star families  who had lost loved ones, heroes, in the war on terror.   The first one was a U.S. Naval officer killed on September 11, 2001,  in the Pentagon. And most recently, Captain Matthew Roland, a captain  in the United States Air Force, was killed in action in August of 2015  in Afghanistan. And the families of these fallen heroes were there. We  were there to honor those fallen heroes and unveil a dedication, a  memorial to those Gold Star families who had sacrificed so much. Not  only did those heroes sacrifice everything for this country, but those  families have sacrificed because they have lost their loved ones, and  they are missing anniversaries, birthdays, and their children growing  up and walking down the aisle.   But who was there to honor those Gold Star families?   The American Legion. And The American Legion was there holding those  American flags high, and they were there to deliver the three-volley  salute in honor of those fallen heroes.   The American Legion is, first and foremost, a local organization.  They pride themselves in that, and that is what they were in Jessamine  County, Kentucky, honoring those Gold Star families. Yes, they  represent a country of heroes and servicemembers and veterans, but they  are local, and they showed that yesterday in the Sixth Congressional  District of Kentucky, and they show that all over this country.   I would just note also, Mr. Speaker, that when we think of how to  honor our veterans, we have to remember what General George  Washington--who, of course, was the Founder of our country, and who, of  course, was that famous general during the American Revolution who  arguably was the first veteran--said. And what General Washington-- President Washington famously said about our country and veterans was  that the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in  any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how  they perceive veterans of earlier wars and how they were treated and  appreciated by our Nation.   The American Legion embodies that. They are a group of patriots, of  veterans who know that it is critically important to instill in other  Americans the importance of patriotism, love of our country, love of  the American flag, so they help us and future generations respect our  veterans and their service and their sacrifice.   We appreciate the fact that we have a piece of legislation before  this body today that honors that great organization--The American  Legion--that provides that level of patriotism and support to our men  and women in uniform and veterans who have served this country so  heroically and patriotically.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Walz), the legislation's sponsor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 2519, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
