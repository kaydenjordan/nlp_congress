 Mr. President, I was at the State of the Union Address,  as was the Chair and most of the folks in this room.   In the State of the Union Address, the President made a very strong  statement. I was pleased to be able to hear him say--he made this  statement: We will buy American to make sure everything--everything-- from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on the highway  guardrails is made in America from beginning to end. All of it. All of  it.   Great. What he left out is what we have marked as little asterisks  here on the ``everything,'' ``all of it,'' ``all of it,'' it seems to  be, except oil and gas.   Oil and gas is one of those things that is essential for us. It is  not just transportation. It is not just electricity. The carpet I am  standing on has petroleum products in it. The finish on this desk has  petroleum products in it. The suit that people are wearing often will  have some petroleum products in it--maybe the buttons on the jacket,  paint on the walls. There are petroleum products all over this room,  and it is needed for all kinds of things.   Our economy is connected to petroleum. That doesn't mean we can't do  it cleaner. That doesn't mean we can't do it better. But it is  interesting to me to be able to note that when we talk about ``Buy  American'' and ``Doing American,'' now, when there is the conversation  and now decision finally from the Biden administration that we are  going to cut off Russian oil and gas coming into the United States-- good--that it immediately turns to let's get it from Venezuela or from  Iran or find some other source.   We are all saying: Time out. There is this country called the United  States. We also produce oil and gas, and we should be focused on what  does it take to be able to do it more here so that we are not dependent  on any country, especially a country that is run by an autocratic  dictator.   I wish this was the only statement that I would challenge him on, but  I was quite shocked that President Biden's envoy for climate, John  Kerry, as the Russians were invading Ukraine, made this statement:         I hope [that] President Putin will help us to stay on track       with respect to what we need to do for the climate.    And then he said that a Russian war could cause ``massive emission  consequences.''   Wow. The focus seemed to be on emissions consequences of a war,  rather than the people of Ukraine. And the focus seemed to be on, ``I  hope President Putin will stay on track with respect to climate  change,'' rather than stop.   Listen, when I just talk to normal folks on the street in Oklahoma,  they are frustrated by the price of gas. No matter how small their car  is or how big their truck is, they are ticked at the high price of  gasoline. They have been upset for a while. It is not just based on  Ukraine. The price of gasoline just in the past 13 months has gone up  over $1 a gallon. That wasn't because of Russia and Ukraine. That was  directly because of policies that are of the Biden administration.   And now, it is accelerating even more. We need to find a way to be  able to create greater energy security for the United States of  America, and that does involve actually producing more oil and gas.   I would say that the Biden administration and I disagree on this, but  the little-known fact is we don't disagree on this. I do agree with the  Biden administration because if you look at the Biden administration's  official numbers that they actually put out from the energy  information, when they put out their official numbers and they have to  estimate how much oil and gas we will use globally, the official  estimate from the Biden administration is, between now and 2050, we  will continue to need progressively more and more natural gas and  petroleum products--by the way, also more coal in their estimates as  well. Where we are different from the Biden administration is they do  acknowledge, privately, the facts and lay the data out and say we are  going to need more oil and gas and more coal, not less, to provide the  basic energy needs of the world.   Where I disagree with them is how they are trying to be able to push  the world into other energy solutions by raising the price of oil and  gas, which directly punishes consumers, and to be able to meet American  climate goals, saying, if we are going to meet our American climate  goals, we need to push production out to other countries and have them  produce the oil and gas and send it to us so that we can show a good  score for our climate while we still actually need to be able to  purchase that oil from someone else.   Let's admit the obvious. We need all kinds of energy, and in the next  30 years, according to even the Biden administration, we are going to  need more gas, natural gas, more petroleum, more oil, and more coal  worldwide.    We are also going to need all kinds of other forms of energy. Unlike  others, I am not opposed to every type of energy. Let's also make it as  clean as we possibly can. We need to have all forms of energy out  there, but we also need to admit the basic facts. We need oil and gas  production.   And that doesn't mean we go get it from Venezuela. Venezuela is a  ruthless human rights violator. The leadership of Venezuela tortures  his own people. We need to not go run to Venezuela to be able to get  additional oil.   We certainly don't need to go run to Iran. No, I don't know that this  administration is running to Iran, but there  [[Page S1081]]  are great rumors that are flying around currently about the final  negotiations of an Iran nuclear deal, and we are waiting to see what  the actual details are, whether that is going to include putting  Iranian oil on the world market. I hope it does not. I hope also that  they deal with, in an Iran nuclear deal--they actually deal with the  weapons that Iran is producing to actually deliver a nuclear warhead,  as they continue to be able to test more and more missiles, with more  and more range, with a larger and larger warhead size that is  specifically designed for a nuclear warhead.   We shouldn't pay attention to nuclear material and ignore the  delivery system that they are actually experimenting with.   I hope we pay attention to what is happening in Yemen. Iran is the  largest state sponsor of terrorism, and they are actually delivering  the products of war to Yemen that is actually trying to destabilize all  their neighbors around them.   I hope we don't lift sanctions on Hezbollah, on Hamas, on those  individuals who were part of actually murdering our marines in 1983 in  Beirut.   Those individuals who took away the property of Jewish citizens in  Iran in 1979, I hope all of those sanctions remain and that those  aren't up for bid and that we are also not talking about buying Iranian  oil. Solving our need for energy should not be running to dictators  around the world to go get it from them.   So what is happening now? The administration has done a release of 30  million barrels from the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve,  which, by the way, is a day-and-a-half of our oil usage. It does have  some effect, but it is a day-and-a-half of our oil usage.   It is not the long-term solution. Long term, that is not even a bump  in prices. Long term, we have to have stable supply to meet the demands  that we have in the country.   This administration is saying that there is more oil production now  in the United States than there was 2 years ago. That is factually  true. During the time of COVID, production of oil plummeted in the  United States, so there is definitely more oil being produced now than  there was during the peak of the time during COVID.   But they have also taken on multiple different items, from the very  beginning of the administration, to do what they could to be able to  attack the production of American oil and gas. From day 1, with cutting  off the Keystone Pipeline, which, by the way, I have folks who catch me  and say what difference would the Keystone Pipeline make? Well, let me  give you an example. The Keystone Pipeline would deliver more oil to  Houston, TX, a day than what Russia does a day to the United States.   We could literally replace Russian oil with what would have come  through the Keystone Pipeline, but they killed it because they had  environmental goals. And why should we worry about where we buy our oil  from? Why should we buy it from the Canadians when we can buy it from  the Russians--was the theory.   Well, I think we know why I would much rather be buying from the  Canadians today than buying from Putin's Russia. That was done right  off the bat.   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, just 2 weeks ago--not  ancient history, just 2 weeks ago--announced a new restriction on  natural gas pipelines and said they will make decisions on export  facilities of natural gas and natural gas pipelines on a case-by-case  basis based on their mitigation plans that they will present--no  definition of what that would mean.   It is basically, if you are going to sink billions of dollars into  doing a pipeline, we will make our decision when you are in process.  What does that do? That discourages any company from actually doing a  natural gas pipeline or certainly an export facility. When right now  Europe is screaming at us to export more natural gas, FERC, literally,  during the war, announced they are going to make it harder to do  natural gas exports.   The Obama-era rule on waters of the United States destabilized a lot  of investment because no one knew what was going to be the issue and  what was not going to be the issue. The Biden administration is now  saying they want to be able to reopen all of that and to create less  certainty on investment.    There was a pause on oil and gas lease sales. They said they were  going to do a temporary moratorium. They started that on January 20,  2021. It hasn't reopened yet, their temporary moratorium.   Every 5 years there is a plan that has to be presented for offshore  leases and how they are actually going to do offshore work. That plan  is due in June of this year. As far as we can tell, the administration  has taken up nothing on it, meaning offshore will have no ability to be  able to continue permitting because they are just apparently not going  to do the plan, which means you don't get access to those leases.   So whether it is offshore, whether it is onshore, they are cutting  off future supplies.   If that is not hard enough, the administration nominated Sarah Raskin  to be Vice Chair of Supervision for the Federal Reserve, who has made  public statements that she wants to be able to use the Federal Reserve  to be able to help cut off capital to anyone who handles fossil fuels.   So, basically, if you can't get loans and you can't transport from  here to there through a pipeline and you can't get additional leases  offshore or onshore on Federal lands, you have severely limited the  locations that you can actually get energy long term, while Biden's own  energy information group says we are going to continue to need more oil  and gas, more coal in the days ahead--the facts versus the reality of  what they are actually putting into place.   Now, again, electric vehicles don't offend me. For those folks who  can afford an expensive electric vehicle, that is great. It is 2  percent of the vehicles on the road, and they are fine. I don't have a  problem with them. But even when they talk about, let's do what we can  to double the number of electric vehicles that are on the road, great,  we will be at 4 percent of the vehicles on the road will be electric.   The other 96 percent of the people in the country want to go to  school, want to go to work, want to go to the grocery store, want to  travel on vacation, and right now to do that, they are paying the price  for it.   Let's have all forms of energy. Let's have some realism in our  conversation. Let's do what we can to be able to open up energy  production.   What am I doing? I have a specific piece of legislation that deals  with the permitting processes. It deals with some of the Executive  actions that President Biden has put into place to be able to slow down  the production of American energy. It opens up the process so we can  actually get back to producing more American energy.   I am also promoting some very key things that the administration can  do right now. For instance, when energy companies are looking to do  investment for additional drilling, they are asking the question how  long is the war going to happen? When is all this going to fall apart?  And no one knows that.   The administration today could announce we are doing a moratorium on  buying Russian oil for the next 12 months, lay out a firm date on it,  and then say 12 months from now we will review it. What difference does  that make? That tells energy companies, if you are going to invest and  you are planning to come online in the next year, we are not going to  cut your legs out from under you by the United States buying Russian  oil again in a few months; that we actually do American investments to  be able to actually replace the Russian oil that is coming in.   This administration could also today say we are not going to make any  changes to any of the rules that are out there that will affect any of  the process for developing American oil and gas for the next 12 months,  just a pause on making any changes on that.   And this administration could actually open up Federal leasing,  which, by the way, is not a radical idea. It is the law. The law says  that the administration has to do it every quarter, and so far four  quarters in a row the Biden administration has ignored the law of the  United States and just not done the leases, saying: They have plenty. I  don't want to do more.   Four quarters in a row they violated the law.   So what could the Biden administration do to be able to help American  [[Page S1082]]  production? Follow the law; put a pause on new restrictions; declare  how long they are going to actually hold off on Russian oil and how  long that will be to give certainty for people in their investment; and  pause all these new restrictions on capital.   If the Biden administration did that today, we would see an even  greater increase in oil. Listen, there is no incentive that needs to be  put in place. I have had folks say: What incentives do we need to put  in place to be able to increase American production? Can I just say oil  is at $120 a barrel.   There is no incentive that needs to be put in place. The problem is  not the incentive; the problems are the restrictions on the other side.  With that certainty in a constantly changing environment, very few  people want to be able to take the risk for it.   So if Secretary Granholm is serious when she is calling out oil  companies to ramp up production, do the work behind the scenes to open  the path for them so that they have that kind of certainty.   I yield the floor.
