 Mr. Chairman, my amendments address critical health  needs in Indian Country by providing the Bureau of Indian Affairs and  the Indian Health Service additional funding to complete projects.   My first amendment ensures communities, including the Hopi Tribe in  my district, have resources for funding to complete their arsenic  medication project.   My second amendment fulfills part of our trust relationship with  federally recognized Tribes by ensuring Indian Health Service clinics  and hospitals opening this year receive staffing and operations  funding.   In my district, the Gila River Health Care Red Tail Hawk Health  Center is scheduled to be opened, but has not received staffing or  operation funding. These healthcare facilities are badly needed to  increase access to healthcare in the community.
