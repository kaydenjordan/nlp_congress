 Madam Speaker, we are now in day 34 of the longest  shutdown in American history.   Over the course of this shutdown, I have heard from hundreds of  people in my community who are being hurt by this reckless shutdown.  Today, I would like to share the story of Graciela, who wrote to me  from my hometown of Redlands.   Graciela has worked for the IRS for over 40 years, and her Federal  job allows her to care for her daughter, who is suffering from thyroid  cancer. Graciela wrote to me and said: ``Each missed paycheck is  another 2 weeks that my daughter will go without medication and  treatment.''   It is outrageous that, in the face of this type of suffering, real  human suffering, our President can remain so callous.   We have voted 11 times to reopen this government, but instead of  working with us to end this shutdown, the President and Leader  McConnell continue to move the goalpost and insist on funding for their  ineffective and wasteful border wall and cuts to legal immigration.   Our country deserves better than leaders who are willing to hold  their people hostage.   Graciela concluded her message to me by saying this: ``The  President's misconceived notion that this country needs a wall more  than its own citizens need to go back to work or to be paid for the  work they are doing is mind-boggling.''   Madam Speaker, Americans are suffering and deserve better.
