 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  ``Encouraging Small Business Innovation Act,'' which I introduced  today.   During National Small Business Week, we are celebrating the  resiliency of our Nation's entrepreneurs who are leading our economic  recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.   To promote a strong recovery for the 32.5 million small businesses  across the country, Congress should bolster Federal programs that  support these entrepreneurs and innovators.   For more than 40 years, the Small Business Innovation Research and  Small Business Technology Transfer Programs have spurred innovation,  job creation, and economic growth.   These programs have generated breakthroughs in a wide range of  sectors, including agriculture, defense, energy, healthcare, and  transportation.  [[Page S2361]]    Today, the Small Business Administration and 11 participating Federal  Agencies leverage the SBIR and STTR Programs to help small innovative  firms explore their potential and increase the commercialization of  innovations arising out of Federal research and development.   While these critical programs have invested more than $40 billion in  small businesses, many firms, especially those that are minority- or  women-owned, still face considerable barriers to participation.   As we look to spur innovation and drive small business growth,  Congress should improve the diversity of these programs, enhance access  to capital, and expand the eligible uses of funds to better support the  needs of U.S. small businesses.   That is why I am proud to introduce this bill to increase the  effectiveness of the SBIR and STTR Programs by improving diversity,  enhancing access to capital, and expanding the eligible uses of funds.   This bill would direct participating Federal Agencies to use a  portion of their SBIR allocation to conduct outreach and provide  technical assistance to underserved populations and states.   It would also allow Small Business Investment Companies to  participate as investors in SBIR and STTR projects and permanently add  testing and evaluation activities permanently as an eligible expense,  which can be resource-intensive for small firms, across all relevant  agencies.   Additionally, this bill would require participating Federal Agencies  to conduct a joint annual meeting to share best practices for improving  data collection and streamlining processes across the programs.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill to improve  the effectiveness of the SBIR and STTR Programs.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  ``Encouraging Small Business Innovation Act,'' which I introduced  today.
