 Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about the INVEST in  America Act, an important moment in the fight to upgrade our national  infrastructure.   I am so glad to see the House take a critical step toward fulfilling  many of the key priorities laid out in the American Jobs Plan by  passing this bill.   I want to be really frank. There is no time to waste on this. We  urgently need to fix the roads, bridges, tunnels, and drainage systems  that we see crumbling around the country.   Not only does the INVEST Act address some of the key infrastructure  needs of our country, but it also creates good-paying, middle-class  jobs that will turbocharge economic growth.   The INVEST Act also includes $20 million in key infrastructure  investments for my district, Pennsylvania's Seventh, that will support  our economy and make roads safer for both motorists and pedestrians. I  am proud to have secured this funding for my community.   We have more work to do to get an infrastructure package finalized,  sent to the President's desk, and signed into law. Our country simply  cannot wait any longer, but I am proud to support the INVEST Act and to  get us one step closer to that goal.                            ____________________
