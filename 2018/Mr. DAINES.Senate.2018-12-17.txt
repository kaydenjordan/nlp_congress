 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing two outstanding Montanan men. Kyle Wilson of Richland  County and Anthony Byrns of Sanders County for their dedicated service  to this country.   Kyle Wilson was born and raised in Sidney, MT. A lifelong Montanan  who graduated from Sidney High School in 2011. Kyle, dedicated his life  to public service, by joining the U.S. Navy. Hard working and  disciplined are a few of the words used to describe those who join the,  Armed Forces, and Kyle is the epitome of a hard working seaman.   Anthony Byrns, Montana native, from Hot Springs truly grew up knowing  the meaning of small town. Following the footsteps of many in his  family, Anthony joined the U.S. Navy directly following his graduation  from Hot Springs High School in 2015. Anthony has been a dedicated  leader, taking initiative of the opportunities set before him. Proud of  his small town heritage, he is honored to represent Montanans.   Kyle Wilson and Anthony Byrns are a part of just 1 percent of the  Navy who were chosen to be in the Navy Ceremonial Guard. Upon selection  they both went through Ceremonial Guard School, an 8-week program where  they learn the protocol for important military ceremonies such as  funerals. With the passing the late President H.W. Bush, both Wilson  and Byrns were selected to carry his casket during the state ceremony,  an honor of a life time.   I commend both Kyle and Anthony for their diligent service to this  country and congratulate them for representing Montana with honor and  pride. I look forward to seeing their future success as they continue  to make all Montanans proud.                            ____________________
