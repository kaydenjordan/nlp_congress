 Madam Speaker, I was the first member who advocated for  reviewing and releasing Donald Trump's tax returns. I've been on this  quest for nearly 6 years.   I applaud Chairman Neal for fighting until the very end. This was not  about 1 man. The law was always on our side.  [[Page H10002]]    Our committee investigation makes crystal clear why Trump and his  cronies obstructed our work. Trump's handpicked Treasury Secretary and  IRS head were at best derelict. At worst they were corrupt and  criminal.   Trump paid a pittance in taxes for years. He overinflated losses to  shirk his duty as an American citizen.   Trump's government failed to conduct a mandatory review of his tax  records. They broke the law.   We provided the IRS with funds to prevent tax cheats from abusing our  tax code. Now, we must ensure the IRS cannot meddle with the audit  process and presidential returns are made public.   Americans must have faith that our tax system is fair. No one is  above the law. It is time to act.
