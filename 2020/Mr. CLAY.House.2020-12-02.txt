 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 945) to amend the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to require certain  issuers to disclose to the Securities and Exchange Commission  information regarding foreign jurisdictions that prevent the Public  Company Accounting Oversight Board from performing inspections under  that Act, and for other purposes, and for other purposes.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 945, the Holding Foreign  Companies Accountable Act, which would suspend the trading of  securities of foreign issuers that retain accounting firms not subject  to audit by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board after 3 years  of noncompliance, as well as require the issuer to disclose whether it  is owned or controlled by a foreign government.   I would like to thank Senator Kennedy and Representative Sherman, who  cosponsored the House version of S. 945, for working on this incredibly  important and long-overdue piece of legislation.   The Enron and WorldCom financial reporting scandals wiped out  billions of dollars from retirement accounts, eliminated tens of  thousands of jobs, and defrauded investors hundreds of billions of  dollars. To ensure U.S. investors, workers, retirees, and capital  markets were never again exposed to this type of egregious fraud,  Congress established the PCAOB through the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to  protect investors by overseeing the audits of public companies and  ensuring the preparation of informative, accurate, and independent  corporate disclosures and audit reports by inspection.   As former PCAOB board member Steven Harris noted: ``The PCAOB was  established because the accounting profession's framework of self- regulation had failed,'' and the creation of an independent auditor to  inspect and verify corporate disclosures and audit work was necessary.   However, citing various foreign secrecy, privacy, and national  security laws, many foreign issuers who enjoy the full benefits and  privileges of trading on U.S. exchanges and access to U.S. public  markets have openly flouted U.S. investor protections and prohibited  the PCAOB from inspecting their corporate disclosures as well as the  auditor's work.   According to a June 2020 PCAOB report, China alone had 202 public  companies listed on U.S. exchanges representing $1.8 trillion in market  capitalization that the PCAOB has been unable to fully and adequately  inspect.   Make no mistake, the ability of foreign issuers to circumvent PCAOB  inspection affirmatively allows foreign companies to exploit U.S.  workers and retirees and comes at the direct expense of U.S. investors  and the integrity of U.S. markets. To continue with business as usual  reverts us back to the Enron and WorldCom status quo.   By suspending the trading of securities issued by foreign issuers who  are not fully compliant with PCAOB audit inspections for 3 years, the  Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act will hold noncompliant  foreign issuers accountable and help safeguard U.S. investors and the  integrity of our markets.   We can no longer allow foreign issuers to exploit our system. I call  on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand with me in  protecting American workers, retirees, and investors by supporting the  bipartisan Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to yield such time  as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman), my  20-year friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me first thank my friend from Maryland, Senator  Chris Van Hollen, for his cosponsorship of this legislation.   The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act would require the SEC  to suspend the trading of securities at issue by foreign issuers who  are not fully compliant with PCAOB audit inspection for 3 years,  commencing upon the enactment of this bill, as well as require foreign  issuers to disclose whether they are owned or controlled by a foreign  government.   For too long, foreign issuers have circumvented important investor  protections crafted by Congress to protect U.S. investors, retirees,  workers, and U.S. capital markets. This commonsense bill does nothing  more than ensure a level playing field by requiring foreign issuers to  play by the same rules as everyone else.   Additionally, with passage of this bill, investors and markets can be  assured that the legally required disclosures they are receiving  pursuant to U.S. law from the company they are investing in have been  thoroughly vetted by an independent entity whose mission is to protect  investors and safeguard market integrity.   Maintaining the status quo would allow foreign issuers to continue to  exploit U.S. retirees, workers, and investors, all while allowing them  continued access to the greatest, most dynamic capital market system in  the world.   I call on all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in  supporting the bipartisan Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the  Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 1830) to require the Secretary of  the Treasury to mint coins in commemoration of the National Purple  Heart Hall of Honor.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:          Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material therein.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1830, the National  Purple Heart Hall of Honor Commemorative Coin Act.   The Purple Heart is one of the oldest and most recognized American  military medals awarded to servicemembers who were killed or wounded by  enemy action.   The mission of the National Purple Heart Hall of Honor, located in  New Windsor, New York, is to collect and preserve the stories of Purple  Heart recipients from all branches of the Armed Forces and across all  generations.   The Hall of Honor serves as a living memorial to these servicemembers  and ensures that all recipients are remembered. Currently, there are  over 200,000 names installed at the Hall of Honor.   This bill would provide tangible support to the Hall of Honor by  directing the West Point Mint to produce commemorative coins in  recognition of the work of the Hall of Honor. Proceeds from the sale of  this coin would fund improvements to the museum itself to help expand  the understanding and respect for those who have served and sacrificed.   This bill passed the House last September, but the version we are  considering today incorporates changes made by a Senate amendment that  updates the time period for issuance of the commemorative coins to  fiscal year 2022, and includes financial assurance language that  minting and issuing coins under this act will result in no net cost to  the Federal Government.   I thank Mr. Maloney, Mr. Takano, and Mr. Gallagher for their work on  this bill, and I urge Members to vote ``yes.''  [[Page H6036]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this bill ensures that the National Purple Heart Hall of  Honor can continue its important mission of collecting, preserving, and  sharing the stories of the brave men and women who were killed or  injured in service to their country.   The straightforward changes we are considering today will align the  time period for the issuance of the commemorative coins and ensures  that the coins issued under this act will result in no net cost to the  Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote ``yes'' on this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I send to the desk a concurrent resolution and  ask unanimous consent for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 7995) to amend title 31, United States Code, to save Federal  funds by authorizing changes to the composition of circulating coins,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7995         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Coin Metal Modification       Authorization and Cost Savings Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. SAVING FEDERAL FUNDS BY AUTHORIZING CHANGES TO THE                     COMPOSITION OF CIRCULATING COINS.         Section 5112 of title 31, United States Code, is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(x) Composition of Circulating Coins.--        ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of       law, and subject to the other provisions of this subsection,       the Director of the United States Mint (referred to in this       subsection as the `Director'), in consultation with the       Secretary, may modify the metallic composition of circulating       coins to a new metallic composition (including by prescribing       reasonable manufacturing tolerances with respect to those       coins) if a study and analysis conducted by the United States       Mint, including solicitation of input, including input on       acceptor tolerances and requirements, from industry       stakeholders who could be affected by changes in the       composition of circulating coins, indicates that the       modification will--        ``(A) reduce costs incurred by the taxpayers of the United       States;        ``(B) be seamless, which shall mean the same diameter and       weight as United States coinage being minted on the date of       enactment of this subsection and that the coins will work       interchangeably in most coin acceptors using electromagnetic       signature technology; and        ``(C) have as minimal an adverse impact as possible on the       public and stakeholders.        ``(2) Notification to congress.--On the date that is at       least 90 legislative days before the date on which the       Director begins making a modification described in paragraph       (1), the Director shall submit to Congress notice that--        ``(A) provides a justification for the modification,       including the support for that modification in the study and       analysis required under paragraph (1) with respect to the       modification;        ``(B) describes how the modification will reduce costs       incurred by the taxpayers of the United States;        ``(C) certifies that the modification will be seamless, as       described in paragraph (1)(B); and        ``(D) certifies that the modification will have as minimal       an adverse impact as possible on the public and stakeholders.        ``(3) Congressional authority.--The Director may begin       making a modification proposed under this subsection not       earlier than the date that is 90 legislative days after the       date on which the Director submits to Congress the notice       required under paragraph (2) with respect to that       modification, unless Congress, during the period of 90       legislative days beginning on the date on which the Director       submits that notice--        ``(A) finds that the modification is not justified in light       of the information contained in that notice; and        ``(B) enacts a joint resolution of disapproval of the       proposed modification.        ``(4) Procedures.--For purpose of paragraph (3)--        ``(A) a joint resolution of disapproval is a joint       resolution the matter after the resolving clause of which is       as follows: `That Congress disapproves the modification       submitted by the Director of the United States Mint.'; and        ``(B) the procedural rules in the House of Representatives       and the Senate for a joint resolution of disapproval       described under paragraph (3) shall be the same as provided       for a joint resolution of disapproval under chapter 8 of       title 5, United States Code.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7995, the Coin Metal  Modification Authorization and Cost Savings Act of 2020. I thank the  gentleman from Nevada (Representative Amodei) for his work on this  bill, which authorizes the Director of the Mint, in consultation with  the Secretary of the Treasury, to modify the metallic composition of  circulating coins to better meet public demand for coins while seeking  to reduce costs to taxpayers and preserve interoperability with  existing coin acceptor technology.   Despite the changes to our everyday lives brought on by the COVID-19  pandemic, coin production is at an all-time high. Just this year, the  U.S. Mint averaged a monthly production rate of approximately 1.27  billion coins per month for a total of 15.2 billion coins over the past  12 months. By comparison, the Mint produced 11.9 billion coins for all  of 2019.   Since 2006, metal prices have risen to where the unit costs of a  penny and nickel exceed their face value. The U.S. Mint estimates that  by adjusting the metal content of coins, the Federal Government could  save between $10 million to $17 million per year.   This bill would require any proposed change in the metallic  composition of coins to both reduce costs to taxpayers and be seamless.  This means that the diameter, weight, and electromagnetic signature of  the new coins would operate interchangeably in most coin acceptors that  use electromagnetic signature technology, such as vending machines,  laundromats, and the self-checkout lines at your local grocery stores.   This commonsense reform provides the Mint with the flexibility to  save taxpayer dollars and avoid future supply chain disruptions while  balancing the needs of stakeholders in ensuring that any new coins work  within the existing coin acceptance infrastructure.   This bill is supported by a wide range of industry stakeholders,  including the National Automatic Merchandising Association, the Coin  Laundry Association, and the Food Industry Association.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Amodei for his work on this bill, and I urge  Members to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would inquire through the Chair if my  colleague has any remaining speakers on his side.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill is a commonsense reform that  provides the Mint with the flexibility needed to meet consumer demand  for coins while saving taxpayer dollars.   This bill ensures that modifications will operate interchangeably and  without disruption to existing coin acceptor infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote ``yes'' on this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
