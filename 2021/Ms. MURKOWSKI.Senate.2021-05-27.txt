 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we are in a bit of a lull here, so  whenever there is a lull in Senate activity, it is one of those moments  and times when you think about those who have contributed to those of  us who serve here in the Senate--staff who have been with us over a  period of time, whether they be here in Washington, DC, or back in our  home States.   Tonight, I come to the floor to share some long overdue recognition  to a long-term member of my team, Michelle Blackwell.   We have had kind of a hectic beginning to this Congress. Yet we are  back, doing legislative business, and that is good, but it has, I  guess, delayed my tribute to, again, an extraordinary Alaskan, a woman  who has been a good team member but also a friend of mine.   Earlier this year, Michelle retired from my team after 17 years of  service--amazing years--to the U.S. Senate, as a member of my staff in  Alaska, and to many of my constituents back home. Since 2003, Michelle  served as my regional representative for the Southcentral region on the  Kenai Peninsula in Alaska. The Kenai Peninsula, for those who are not  familiar with it, is a pretty significant area. It is equivalent in  size to the States of Massachusetts and New Jersey combined, with a  population of about 55,000 people.   If there are roads that wind around and go up and down and into some  pretty extraordinary areas, Michelle has traveled them, and she has  represented this region with grace, efficiency, diplomacy--resolving  truly thousands of cases for constituents who have experienced problems  with Federal Agencies. You name it--whether it is the IRS, whether it  is Social Security, whether it is the VA--she has a story to tell  there. Helping constituents and serving as a liaison to the community  were really the keys to her success in my office. Her commitment to  public service and to helping Alaskans has made me a better Senator and  certainly a better representative for Alaskans.   I have to confess that, as much as we would like to claim her 100  percent for Alaska, Michelle did not get her start in public service in  the State of Alaska. Like many who now call Alaska home, Michelle's  path was kind of an adventurous one as she worked her way north.   She came to me from Wyoming via Washington, DC. She grew up in  Wyoming, and then, following college, she went to work for then- Congressman Dick Cheney. This was back in the early eighties. She  started out on the front desk, as a good staffer does, and as many  successful staffers like Michelle have done, she worked her way up from  there.   She spent 11 years working for Dick Cheney as one of his key aides,  and he was so appreciative of her work that he brought her with him  during his first tenure as Secretary of Defense under the 41st  President, George H. W. Bush   As many of us know, when you find good staffers, you do everything  that you can to hang on to them, but Michelle had a very adventurous  spirit and a curiosity for foreign policy. She served a year in  Switzerland with the State Department. She then returned to work for  Mr. Cheney when his time with the first Bush administration had ended  and he went to work for a public policy think tank, the American  Enterprise Institute. Following this was the time that she then  returned to Wyoming and opened the next chapter of her life.   In 1997, Michelle found herself in the famous Million Dollar Cowboy  Bar in Jackson Hole, WY. I have been there myself--but Michelle met the  man who would be her husband. The rest, as they say, is history.   Michelle and Jack were married a year later, and their adventurous  spirit continued. They moved north. They moved to Sitka, AK, where Jack  would serve as the park ranger for the State of Alaska's Department of  Natural Resources. They spent 4 years there in Sitka, and Michelle was  very active in the community, not surprisingly. She served as the  director of the local visitor and tourism bureau--a key industry to our  State and certainly to that region.   In 2002, Jack was transferred to Kenai, AK, to serve as the district  ranger for Alaska State Parks for the  [[Page S3858]]  region. That is when Michelle found her way to the Alaska congressional  delegation, where we found her. Again, I wish that I could take the  credit for finding Michelle, but she came to work for the entire Alaska  congressional delegation. This was at the time when the late Senator  Ted Stevens was our senior Senator, and this was just when I was  beginning my time in this office. Back then, the rules of this Chamber  allowed us to share district offices and staff, so Michelle served not  just me but also Senator Stevens and Congressman Young, who, as we  know, is now the dean of the House, so some pretty big political  powerhouses between   Don Young and Senator Stevens. They are  personalities that we have described as being larger than life at times  and some personalities that can be interesting to balance, but Michelle  did so with patience and poise.   All in all, Michelle has 25 years of Federal public service, and I am  proud to say that 17 of those years have been as a member of my staff.   Of all of her many professional accomplishments, you will not hear  her boast, but you will hear her colleagues speak with the highest  respect for her ethics and her duty to public service. She is so humble  but so, so respected by her staff both on the State side and among the  policy team here in DC.   I have had a lot of time to be in a car with Michelle as we have  driven around the Kenai Peninsula. I have seen her interact with  constituents who have serious, challenging, personal, deeply emotional  issues, and how she is able to communicate with Alaskans on their  level, on their issues, in a way that is respectful and understanding  and compassionate is a gift that is extraordinary.   Outside of the office, one source of pride--probably the biggest  source of pride for Michelle--is very clear: the devotion to her  family. When asked by others who worked with her, the first thing that  you would hear is of Michelle's dedication to her family, and she has a  great family.   Her husband, Jack, as I mentioned, is a great guy--a pilot. She was a  little worried when he decided that, instead of a family minivan, it  was going to be a family--I don't remember whether it was a Cherokee or  a Piper or a 175, but the family is flying around and doing a lot of  Alaska that we all enjoy.   They have two great kids, Jackson and Cameron. I have had the  pleasure and the privilege to watch both of these young people grow  into talented, kind, and smart young adults who are now pursuing  college and postgraduate degrees. Jackson, who was a page here in the  U.S. Senate and an intern for me, is a Truman Scholar. Cameron, his  younger sister, was also a page here. She is pursuing a premed-health  sciences program with the goal of being a doctor. Jackson is working on  Arctic issues and climate issues. You just couldn't be prouder of these  two young people. I know that Michelle is, and I certainly am. It has  been great to be able to watch and be a part of their family.   To the family--to Jack, to Jackson, and to Cameron--thank you for  sharing your mom with me, with all of my staff, and really with the  Senate and our country for so many years. We know that those years were  nights and weekends and holidays when we took a lot of her time, and we  appreciate that.   I recognize that, as we see good, strong, capable, really impactful  people move on from our teams, it is just the closing of one chapter  and the opening of yet another for Michelle and her family.   So, to Michelle, thank you for all of the years that you have given  to your public service and as a member of my staff. I wish you all the  best in your very well-deserved retirement.                   Tribute to Admiral Matthew T. Bell, Jr.    Mr. President, as I am still on the floor and we are still in a  pause, I want to provide some short remarks with regard to an  individual who has been not only a leader in the Alaska community for a  period of years but a real leader for our U.S. Coast Guard.   I rise to offer my commendation to ADM Matthew T. Bell, Jr., who  served the Coast Guard for 36 years, most recently as the commander of  District 17, D17.   He had his retirement ceremony just about 6 weeks or so ago, and I  had the opportunity to be out there at his retirement ceremony. It was  held in Juneau. We had the Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral  Schultz, who led the delegation, join Senator Sullivan, myself, and  Governor Dunleavy. It was pretty significant that you would have a  gathering there in Juneau for this retirement ceremony but not unusual  because Admiral Bell had led in a way and manner that deserved this  public recognition, certainly, at the highest level.   D17 is an enormous region that covers the entirety of Alaska, from  the Bering Strait to the Aleutian Chain and all of the surrounding  waters.   Admiral Bell, during his time there as head of D17, led with  distinction, but before this he had had some pretty significant and  impressive roles. He commanded the Personnel Service Center. He served  as chief of staff for the U.S. Coast Guard Pacific Area and as a  chemistry and nautical science instructor at the U.S. Coast Guard  Academy.   He served as commander of Task Group 55.6 in Bahrain in support of  Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he earned the highly esteemed  ``Cutterman'' designation after more than 12 years of sea service.   Three times--three times--he was the commanding officer and his  commands included the Coast Guard Cutter Point Divide, Coast Guard  Cutter Alex Haley, and Coast Guard Cutter Douglas Munro.   The Alex Haley and Munro were each stationed in Kodiak when Admiral  Bell served as their commander. In fact, we had the retirement ceremony  for Admiral Bell, and then the following day we flew out to Kodiak to  attend the decommissioning of the Munro after 40 years of service-- pretty admirable run.   But I can imagine that these tours helped sow the seeds of home for  Admiral Bell and his family.   So I mentioned I had the opportunity to be there when Admiral Bell  passed on the roles and responsibility of the D17 command. It was April  21.   He was honorably awarded and recognized for his outstanding service  and retirement. But, again, I think it is noteworthy. This was not your  average retirement ceremony. We had COVID-19 protocols that were still  in place. Senator Sullivan and I were in the front row. It was a pretty  limited gathering. I think they were limited to 30 people, joined by  the Governor of Alaska. Over 300 people watched by live feed, but  behind us--so in the speaker's view and behind us--was this  exceptionally distracting view, the beauty of Mendenhall Glacier that  was behind us. And every one of the speakers noted that it was quite  extraordinary to be in this setting.   But I was honored to be invited and humbled to represent the Alaskans  who have all deeply appreciated the Coast Guard's work in our State,  and especially while Admiral Bell was at the helm.   I want to take just note of the fact and thank Admiral Bell and all  of the really invaluable, heroic work that D17 does in the State.   In a given month in the State of Alaska, D17 rescues 22 souls,  assists 53 people, saves over $1.65 million in property across  3,853,500 square miles and over 47,300 miles of shoreline--a lot of  space, lot of territory to cover.   Alaska is tough. It is rugged. It is big. But these missions are  carried out in the toughest, most challenging environment. And as I  heard Admiral Bell mention during his retirement ceremony, he said:  ``If you can do the Coast Guard's mission in Alaska, you can do the job  anywhere [else].''   And he is right. It is the best that we will see.   Not only are Coast Guard men and women in Alaska mastering their  craft and saving lives and property, they are also integral members of  our communities. Those members and their families are our neighbors.  They are our classmates. They are our friends. And I deeply appreciate  the connection and fond relationship shared by the Coast Guard and  Alaska, and that is why it is so important, I think, to just take the  time to honor and to thank incredible leaders like Admiral Bell.   So on behalf of Alaska, I thank you for everything you have done to  continue the longstanding legacy of lifesaving, environmental  protection, and maritime safety in our great State.   But beyond that, thank you for representing and nurturing the  connections between the Coast Guard and our State as the D17 commander  and neighbor.  [[Page S3859]]    And I want to end my comments tonight with just a comment about Matt  Bell as the neighbor. Matt and his wife Nancy have raised three sons,  and like most Coast Guard families, they moved numerous times. They  have accepted the assignments and adventure with the kind of a matter- of-factness that comes with military service. But wherever they have  been stationed, they have become part of the community. They have made  that community just a little bit better.   And when Matt and Nancy came to Alaska, they knew they were home.  They said it. Absolutely, they knew they were home. In fact, it was  somewhat interesting. Nancy was not at the retirement ceremony there in  Juno because she had already moved all of their household goods to  Kodiak. I think it was her first week of work there. She was working at  the Coast Guard base there. So, you know, she is a true Coast Guard  family for life.   But for a small little side note and an anecdote, at the conclusion  of the decommissioning of the Munro, I had to fly back to Anchorage,  and as it turned out, the same airplane that was going to be taking me  back to Anchorage from Kodiak was the same airplane that was delivering  just recently retired Admiral Bell to Kodiak to come home to his wife  and help, basically, move in.   Long story short, weather comes in and there are no airplanes to  Kodiak. So he is not coming in and I am not going out.   As it was, I was supposed to be in Anchorage at a family dinner, and  I knew that they had a place set for me, and while I was at the airport  trying to rearrange reservations and trying to find accommodations for  the evening, Nancy Bell was at the airport waiting for her husband. And  she said: What can I do to make sure that you have a place to stay?   And I said: Well, it's not just about me. I have a whole volleyball  team from Palmer and a soccer team from the valley. What are we going  to do with 50-some-odd kids when there is no airplane until tomorrow?   And Nancy Bell sprung into action, as a good community member, to see  what it was that she could do to get not only me and a couple of staff  people but to get a couple teams of kids situated for the evening   And I said: You know, Nancy, you are taking care of me. Matt needs to  go to my family dinner in Anchorage and take my place.   And so he did. He had a great evening with my family, and I had a  great opportunity to spend a little bit more time with his wife in  Kodiak.   But it just speaks to the neighborliness that goes on. You have a  significant leader in our U.S. Coast Guard--a man who he and his family  have given so much, 36 years in service. And they are now going to give  that to their community--their Alaska community--that they have  adopted, and we have embraced them.   We honor them, and we wish the best for them and their family in  their retirement.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
