 Madam President, it has only been a month since  President Biden took the oath of office and Democrats assumed the  majority in the Senate, but we have already taken some major steps to  repair and rebuild our country.   I said this Chamber would begin its work by accomplishing three  immediate tasks: confirming President Biden's nominees, addressing the  COVID pandemic with bold legislation, and conducting a fair and honest  impeachment trial of Donald Trump. The Senate has made steady progress  on all three.   A little over a week ago, we concluded the second impeachment trial  of Donald Trump. The House managers presented a powerful, harrowing  reconstruction of the former President's role in inciting an attack  against our democracy--the greatest offense ever--ever--committed by a  President of the United States. Despite the final verdict of this  Chamber, Donald Trump deserves to be convicted, and I believe he will  be convicted in the court of public opinion. History will judge Mr.  Trump harshly, deservedly so, and everyone who condoned the dangerous  final acts of his Presidency will live with that in history as well and  live rather dishonorably.   Even during the impeachment trial, the Senate advanced the ball on  the two other priorities I mentioned. Our committees conducted several  confirmation hearings and worked closely with their House colleagues to  draft COVID relief legislation. That process is ongoing among Senate  Members, as well as over in the House. Now that the trial is complete,  we are going to move forward on both fronts.   Democrats remain hard at work preparing the desperately needed COVID  relief bill, which is on track to go to the President's desk before the  March 14 expiration of unemployment insurance benefits, and starting  this evening, the Senate will continue the process of confirming  President Biden's nominees with a vote on Linda Thomas-Greenfield to  serve as the next U.N. Ambassador.   Ms. Thomas-Greenfield has spent three decades in the U.S. Foreign  Service. She is exceptionally qualified, and that was reflected in the  bipartisan support she received from the Foreign Relations Committee.  If confirmed, she will assume the role of U.N. Ambassador at a time  when the nations of the world must deepen their cooperation on the  fight against COVID-19 and the fight against climate change, among  other critical priorities. She will have no time to waste in rebuilding  America's reputation and reasserting the first instrument of American  power--diplomacy. I look forward to voting in favor of her nomination.   After that, the Senate will immediately proceed to the nomination of  Tom Vilsack to serve as the Secretary of Agriculture. Mr. Vilsack is no  stranger to the Senate confirmation process or to the Department of  Agriculture in having served as its Secretary under President Obama.  The former Governor of Iowa has made a career out of caring for and  supporting our Nation's farmers. Mr. Vilsack was approved by the  Agriculture Committee by a unanimous vote. I expect he will receive the  same bipartisan reception by the full Senate.   For the rest of the week, we will continue to confirm Members of the  President's Cabinet: first, Jennifer Granholm to serve as the Secretary  of Energy; second, Dr. Miguel Cardona to serve as the Secretary of  Education. Both nominees have been advanced by the respective  committees with bipartisan votes--a pattern this week.   At a time when our Nation is gripped by a once-in-a-century crisis,  the President deserves to have his nominees approved quickly by this  Chamber so they can immediately get to work healing our great country    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 9.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I now ask unanimous consent that the  Senate resume consideration of the Thomas-Greenfield nomination as  provided under the previous order.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the  conclusion of morning business on Tuesday, February 23, the Senate  resume consideration of Executive Calendar No. 10, Linda Thomas- Greenfield; that at 11:30 a.m., all postcloture time on the Thomas- Greenfield nomination be considered expired and the Senate vote on the  confirmation of the nomination; further, that notwithstanding the  provisions of rule XXII, at 2:15 p.m., the Senate resume consideration  of Executive Calendar No. 7, Thomas Vilsack, with 20 minutes for  debate, as provided under the previous order; that upon the use or  yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the confirmation of the  Vilsack nomination; and that upon disposition of the Vilsack nomination  and if cloture has been invoked on Calendar No. 11, the Senate vote on  confirmation of the Thomas-Greenfield nomination; finally, that if any  of the nominations are confirmed, the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  actions.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10:30 a.m.,  Tuesday, February 23; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that  upon conclusion of morning business, the Senate proceed to executive  session as provided under the previous order. Finally, I ask unanimous  consent that the Senate recess following the cloture vote on the  Thomas-Greenfield nomination until 2:15 p.m.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:18 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, February 23, 2021, at 10:30 a.m.                            ____________________
