 Mr. Speaker, I rise with great sadness to mark the  passing of a leader of exceptional courage and firm principles, our  colleague and dear friend, Congresswoman Ellen Tauscher.   The presence of so many members from our California delegation is a  beautiful tribute to her beautiful life. Thank you all for being here.   Ellen's passing is a great official loss to the people of California  and to the Nation and a deep personal loss for all of us who are  blessed to call her friend.   Our hearts break for her daughter, Katherine. Personally, it was a  joy for many of us to see her expect Katherine. Katherine came.  Katherine is growing up. She took such delight in being Katherine's  mother.   Ellen was an extraordinary force for progress who made a difference.  Her smart, strategic leadership strengthened our democratic  institutions and kept America safe, and her relentless commitment to  nuclear nonproliferation beautifully honored the oath we take to  support and defend the Constitution and protect the American people.   Ellen was a pioneer who made history when she became the youngest  ever and one of the very earliest women members of the New York Stock  Exchange, where she was a powerful voice for technology, science, and  innovation.   Ellen's friendship was a gift, and her legacy was one of outstanding  leadership marked by deep patriotism and tireless commitment to  progress.   May it be a comfort to Ellen's beloved daughter, Katherine, and her  many, many loved ones that so many share their loss and pray for them  at this sad time.   Mr. Speaker, I now ask that Members and guests in the gallery rise to  observe a moment of silence.
