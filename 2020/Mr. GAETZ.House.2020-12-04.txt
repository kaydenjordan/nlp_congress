 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The MORE Act is flawed. It uses cannabis policy to do a great deal of  social engineering to create new taxes and new programs and  redistribution of assets.   But I am here as the only Republican cosponsor of the MORE Act, and I  am voting for it because the Federal Government has lied to the people  of this country about marijuana for a generation.   We have seen a generation, particularly of Black and Brown youth,  locked up for offenses that should not have resulted in any  incarceration whatsoever.   I am also deeply troubled by the current policy of the Federal  Government that inhibits research into cannabis, research that could  unlock cures and help people live better lives.   My Republican colleagues today will make a number of arguments  against this bill, but those arguments are overwhelmingly losing with  the American people. In every State where cannabis reform was on the  ballot in this country, it passed. It passed with overwhelming support.   As a matter of fact, the only thing that I know that is more popular  than getting out of the war on drugs is getting out of the war in  Afghanistan. But if we were measuring the success in the war on drugs,  it would be hard to conclude anything other than the fact that drugs  have won because the American people do not support the policies of  incarceration, limited research, limited choice, and particularly  constraining medical application.                                time  0930    We are here in a time when many people in our country are suffering.  They are in pain. It is documented that States with medical cannabis  programs see a reduction in the prescribing of opioids and in the  number of opioid abuses and deaths. We have held hearings in the House  Judiciary Committee where people in our government must confess that  this is, in fact, true, that the more we give people access to medical  cannabis programs, the more we see a blunting of this horrible scourge  of opioid addiction and opioid abuse.   We talk all the time on the right about the need to empower people  and empower States. Right now, the Federal policy on cannabis  constrains our people. It limits our States. I would only hope that in  the 117th Congress, after this bill invariably dies in the Senate, we  will actually come back and  [[Page H6832]]  pass the STATES Act because it acknowledges that we have screwed this  up in the Federal Government.   While we have screwed it up, States have taken action. They have  designed programs in the way that our great Federal system promises. If  we were to pass the STATES Act, then best practices would emerge,  States that developed applicable programs for their people would be  replicable, and we would see better policies.   I am going to vote for the MORE Act. It won't pass the Senate and it  won't become law, but then we should come back in the 117th Congress,  and we should truly do more for our people.
