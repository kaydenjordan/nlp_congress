 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the World  Bank Accountability Act, sponsored by my friend from Kentucky (Mr.  Barr).   Having had the opportunity last Congress to chair the subcommittee  that Mr. Barr now leads, I can tell my colleagues that the reforms in  this bill are real and they're urgent.   Let me highlight one case of management failure at the World Bank  that I focused on last Congress, alongside with my ranking member, the  distinguished gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore). I think the  scandal will illuminate not only the reasoning behind the reforms  demanded by H.R. 3326 but, also, the mechanism for achieving those  reforms, as the chairman was pointing out. It is the power of our purse  that will effect change.   In 2015, the World Bank canceled an IDA--International Development  Association, as has been referred to--road project in Uganda. This  initiative saw appalling lapses in basic management by the Bank which,  literally, enabled sexual exploitation of children to happen. When  local Ugandans complained to the Bank staff, they were ignored. Only  after the Bank's ombudsman became involved directly did the Bank really  investigate the abuses.   My colleagues on the Financial Services Committee and I were so  outraged by the scandal that I, along with Ms. Moore, my ranking  member, wrote a letter on July 14 of 2016 to the World Bank demanding  corrective action.   Here is the thing: To underscore the gravity of the Bank's management  failures, we originally proposed a letter at the highest levels of the  committee, including the chairman and the ranking member. In fact, the  letter as it went out--and I will include it in the Record--was on the  letterhead of Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Maxine Waters.  And, unfortunately, the ranking member then refused to sign the letter,  then just leaving it as a subcommittee letter that went out by myself  and Ranking Member Moore.                                    Committee on Financial Services,                                        House of Representatives,                                      Washington, DC, July 14, 2016.      Dr. Jim Yong Kim,      President, World Bank Group,      Washington, DC.        Dear Dr. Kim: We are writing to express our alarm over the       World Bank's cancelled Uganda Transport Sector Development       Project. As you know, the Bank is facing serious allegations       related to misconduct by a Chinese contractor, including       sexual exploitation of minors, repeated harassment of female       staff, and deficient safety measures that may have resulted       in five fatalities. The Bank has admitted that its       supervision of the project was inadequate, particularly with       respect to protecting Ugandan girls.        In addition to negligent supervision, the Bank's slow       response to local communities' accusations is troubling.       According to the Bank's own timeline, Ugandans had to wait       six months from the time they first voiced their complaints       until the Bank's Country Director wrote to public authorities       requesting follow-up by law enforcement. Ten months elapsed       before the Bank suspended the project, and delays in the       Management Response meant that the Bank's Inspection Panel       did not visit Uganda until one year following the initial       allegations. As the Panel continues to investigate this case,       we urge you and Bank management to cooperate fully while       respecting the Panel's independence. We also ask that any       findings of negligence and wrongdoing lead to appropriate       disciplinary action,        The failure of this project to protect, let alone benefit,       Ugandans should inform supervision in all sectors and regions       going forward. We believe that the Bank must strengthen its       role in supervising and monitoring its projects to ensure       that the poor are protected in the Bank's work. Any actions       by the Bank that would weaken its oversight could undermine       support for the institution.        Additionally, the Bank has long faced criticism, including       from its own staff, for a culture that too often places the       volume of lending above concerns for the effectiveness of       that lending. Last October, the Subcommittee on Monetary       Policy and Trade held a hearing on the multilateral       development banks that explored this very problem, and a       report by the Bank's Independent Evaluation Group notes how       the ``pressure to lend'' has characterized the Bank's culture       for decades, often at the expense of development outcomes. It       is clear that such a culture can distract from the proper       preparation and administration of projects, including       monitoring and supervision, thus putting development at risk.        In the case of Uganda, the Bank clearly should have made       supervision a higher priority. We hope that future       beneficiaries, be they in Africa or elsewhere, will encounter       more capable and responsive partners at the Bank.            Sincerely,      Bill Huizenga,        Chairman, Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade.      Gwen Moore,        Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade.     Mr. Chair, I think what America just heard from the  last two speakers on the other side of the aisle was that, literally,  the Democrats  [[Page H444]]  wanted the money to the World Bank but not the reforms. That is why  they voted for the $3 million-plus to go into that account, that IDA  account.   How cynical. I mean, funding of IDA is about as good as putting a  Band-Aid on a car accident victim; right? It is not doing anything,  ultimately, if there is such woeful inadequacy in trying to provide the  true issues that need to be addressed.   So, the sexual abuse of underage Ugandans, not really interested in  talking to you about that; harassment of female project staff, not  really interested in talking about that on the other side of the aisle;  deficient project safety that may have resulted in five fatalities, not  interested in talking about that. So, when they rise, talking about how  much they care about the poor and those who are underserved--forgive me  if I am cynical, Mr. Chairman--it rings a bit hollow.   For the Bank, it got even worse. After sending this letter with Ms.  Moore, we received a response that the Bank was undertaking cosmetic  steps to improve their projects and their actions, such as creating a  task force.   Again, forgive me for being a little cynical about the task force,  but not only was the country manager associated with the Ugandan  project not held accountable, he was promoted to country director for  the Congo.   It still gets worse. Last November, we learned that the Bank was  suspending yet another road project in the Congo due to allegations of  sexual violence against women. The investigation is still underway  today, Mr. Chairman. And the Bank has already admitted that it ignored  repeated requests to the beneficiaries in the Congo to look at the  other complaints, but we are beginning to see a theme: let's just keep  the money flowing anyway.   Here is the thing: it was the same projects, the same people in  place. I am just wondering why they--whether it is the ranking member  or others who voted for this in subcommittee--refused to keep the  Bank's feet to the fire.    Mr. Chairman, I am just confused as to why my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle refuse to hold the Bank's  feet to the fire because we have known about these issues for several  years. Task forces haven't been sufficient; rhetoric hasn't been  sufficient. We need real accountability in the Bank, and we need it  now. It needs to be initiated immediately, and then it needs to be  maintained and institutionalized.   So I thank my friend from Kentucky for taking this commonsense  approach and for demanding that the World Bank live up to its  commitments to the poor, whether they are in Africa or in other places  in the world.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3326.
