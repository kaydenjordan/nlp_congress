 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of Federal  privacy legislation.   With every new app that is downloaded or website that is used, people  run the risk of turning over their most sensitive personal data without  even knowing it.   Right now, consumers are left with virtually no rights or  protections. We have seen the damage done by the Facebook Cambridge  Analytica scandal, yet there has been zero action from Congress. This  is unacceptable.   I believe we can and must have a national data privacy law that gives  consumers control over their data and that sets fair rules of the road  for businesses to comply.   I introduced H.R. 2013, the Information Privacy and Personal Data  Protection Act, which would address both. I urge my colleagues to take  up this issue to make it a priority and work with me in moving this  legislation forward.                            ____________________
