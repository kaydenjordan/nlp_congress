 Mr. President, I had hoped that this week the Senate  would be busy providing more coronavirus aid and that the chairmen and  ranking members would be working overtime across the aisle to finalize  another major pandemic relief package for the American people. After  all, there are so many important ways in which American families need  help and which Democrats say they see as big priorities, just like  Republicans do--priorities like continuing a Federal add-on to  unemployment insurance, more tools for schools to safely reopen, more  access to testing and diagnostics, more resources to develop vaccines  and treatments, a new round of checks to put cash in families' hands  ASAP, and another round of the hugely successful Paycheck Protection  Program that small businesses have relied on, which was left out of the  Democrats' proposal.   All of these things and many more were in Senate Republicans'  trillion-dollar proposal for another coronavirus rescue package focused  on kids, jobs, healthcare, and legal protections to help our country  reopen.   So I had hoped the Senate would be spending this week turning a major  agreement into law, but sadly for the country, sadly for struggling  Americans, the Speaker of the House and the Senate Democratic leader  decided we would not deliver any of that--none of it.   For weeks, Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leader in the Senate  stalled and stalled in backroom negotiations with the administration's  team. For weeks--weeks--they held up important aid over non-COVID- related demands. They stayed true to their  [[Page S5360]]  comments from very early on in this pandemic.   This is the way they looked at it: They saw this pandemic as ``a  tremendous opportunity to structure things to fit our vision.'' That  was the House Democratic whip. Speaker Pelosi herself put it this way:  ``This is an opportunity. Every crisis is.'' Working families call this  pandemic a crisis. They call it a nightmare. But leading Democrats call  it ``an opportunity.''   Just listen to some of their demands. These are the Democrats'  demands that stood between all of this help and the Americans who need  it.   Here is one: Democrats say nobody gets another dime of relief unless  State and local governments get about $1 trillion in extra money. Let  me say that again. Democrats are saying nobody gets another dime of  relief unless State and local governments get $1 trillion in extra  money.   Let's put a few facts on the table.   No. 1, State and local governments have spent only about one-fourth  of the huge sums we sent them back in the springtime--$150 billion.   No. 2, the economists who have calculated the likely COVID-related  shortfalls for State and local governments have mostly produced  estimates that are entire multiples less--entire multiples less--than  what Democrats are demanding.   No. 3, in our HEALS Act, Republicans tried to give States and  localities extra flexibility around the unspent funds they already  had--extra flexibility around the unspent funds they already had. In my  State, for example, 94 percent of the money we sent them has not been  spent.   We wanted to send huge sums to help with schools, which are one of  the States' biggest expenses. Typically, in a State budget, the two  biggest items are education and Medicaid.   But forget all that. Democrats are demanding that we send State and  local governments a colossal amount of money, with no relationship to  actual need, while they have only spent a quarter--25 percent--of the  money they have already gotten.   Clearly, this isn't about COVID. Democrats think they smell an  opening they have wanted for years--to make Uncle Sam bail out decades  of mismanagement and broken policies in places like New York, New  Jersey, and California. So they have decided that no working family  anywhere in America can get another cent--not one cent--unless they get  to create a trillion-dollar slush fund for mismanaged States,  completely and totally out of proportion to pandemic needs.   Here is another one of those far-left demands: Nobody gets another  dime unless we indefinitely pay people more to stay home than to go  back to work.   Republicans agree we ought to continue additional Federal jobless  benefits during this extraordinary time. Senate Republicans tried  several times to stop them from expiring. The Democratic leader blocked  us.   Our view, which a majority of Americans share, is simply that it  disincentivizes rehiring and reopening to pay people more to stay home.  It is a statement of the obvious. It disincentivizes rehiring and  reopening to pay people more to stay home.   Plenty of Democrats said they saw the point and were happy to  negotiate on this. Speaker Pelosi's own No. 2, the House majority  leader, said: ``It is not $600 or bust.'' That was the No. 2 Democrat  in the House. The senior Senator from Maryland said: ``We certainly  understand. We don't want to have a higher benefit than what someone  can make working.'' Oh, no. But the Speaker and the Democratic leader  overruled them. No deal. No deal unless we pay people more to stay  home.   That is not about COVID. It is not about a real reopening. It is  about far-left ideology. They preferred for the jobless benefits to go  down to zero--zero--unless they could pay people more to stay home.   Does anyone in this country really believe that relief for Americans  should be totally contingent on bailing out States for mismanagement  that predated the pandemic by decades? Does anyone really think it was  better for jobless benefits to completely expire unless we pay people  more not to work? And does anyone really think that Congress should  walk away from countless subjects where a bipartisan agreement should  be possible over these fringe positions? Do Americans think Democrats  should walk away from school funding, testing, cash to households,  preventing a spike in seniors' Medicare premiums, legal reform, and  more, over this?   I think almost every family in America would answer these questions  the same way, but unfortunately Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic  leader have answered them the opposite way. They think they have  political leverage over the President of the United States, and so they  are willing to personally increase the pain for vulnerable families  unless they get their way on matters not related to COVID.   Republicans wanted to agree on the things we could agree to.  Democrats said: Our way or the highway.   Republicans wanted to send cash now--right now--for schools, testing,  and unemployment benefits and argue over State bailouts later.  Democrats said nobody gets a penny unless Texas and Florida bail out  New Jersey. That is their position. Nobody gets a penny unless Texas  and Florida bail out New Jersey.   So this is where we are. The previous UI benefits expired. The PPP  closed its doors.   Over the weekend, President Trump took steps to soften the blow of  the Democrats' hostage tactics on American families who need help most.  His decisions will help spare some Americans some of the pain from the  Democrats' hostage-taking.   From the beginning--from the very beginning--our side has tried  everything possible to find common ground and deliver more help, but  the Democrats have said no. At least the American people know the  score. At least they know the score.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a totally different matter, this  weekend brought more unsettling news in the ongoing struggle for Hong  Kong to preserve any shred of its civil liberties and self-governance.   One of the region's most prominent pro-democracy advocates, Jimmy  Lai, was arrested yesterday for alleged violations of the so-called  national security law imposed by Beijing.   Last year, after a historic election that saw millions flock to the  polls to overwhelmingly reject President Xi's preferred candidates, the  Chinese Communist Party moved quickly to choke Hongkongers' free  expression.   Mr. Lai has been at the vanguard of the vibrant Hong Kong-based media  and publishing world.   Jimmy Lai was arrested for an alleged violation of the so-called  national security law imposed by Beijing. He has devoted much of his  life to advancing precisely--precisely the sort of values that the CCP  finds most repulsive: freedom of thought and freedom of speech.   The Senate, the country, and freedom-loving nations across the world  stand with Mr. Lai and with all the peaceful demonstrators who have met  the business end of the CCP's repression.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 117, S. 1014.    I ask unanimous consent that the Duckworth amendment  at the desk be agreed to, that the bill, as amended, be considered read  a third time and passed, and that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  [[Page S5384]]  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 11 a.m., Tuesday,  August 11; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day; finally, that following leader remarks, the Senate be in a period  of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to  10 minutes each.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 4:44 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, August 11, 2020, at 11 a.m.
