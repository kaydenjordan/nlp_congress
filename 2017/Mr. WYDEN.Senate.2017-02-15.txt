 Mr. President, whenever the discussion in the Senate turns  to gun violence, we often hear Senators say: We shouldn't be talking  about guns; we ought to be talking about mental health. That is exactly  what we are trying to make sure is the focus of this debate because  this proposed rule is about mental health, and it is about background  checks; it is not about taking away anyone's constitutional rights.   Here is how the proposal works. If there is an individual with a  severe mental impairment--that means that another person, perhaps a  family member--is in charge of their Social Security benefits, then the  background check is to be informed by Social Security that the person  with a severe mental impairment is ineligible to buy a gun.   Having listened to the debate yesterday, I think everybody is going  to be a little confused about what happens then because the reality is  that anyone who thinks they have been unfairly affected can appeal, and  the likelihood is substantial that they are going to win. If the appeal  goes the other way and the individual believes the decision is wrong,  then that person can take the matter to court. It is not true to say  this rule deprives any American of due process. It is a rule aimed  directly at the two areas in this debate--mental health and background  checks--where there is enormous support from the American people.   The reality is you can talk to people in virtually any community--you  can go to a townhall meeting in any part of the United States--and you  will hear enormous support for background checks. One recent poll found  that 92 percent of gun owners supported expanded background checks.  Ninety-two percent of gun owners supported background checks. So not  only is the position I am articulating not extreme, opposing background  checks is the position that, in fact, has become increasingly out of  the mainstream.   As the courts continue to interpret the language of the Second  Amendment, one matter has been clear: Background checks are a  constitutional part of the exercise of those rights.   I have heard some saying that the rule can be improved, that it ought  to be tailored. I am very open to having a debate around those kinds of  questions. That is not going to be possible if this resolution passes.  This will preempt debate. The resolution doesn't just scrap the rule,  it blocks any further step on this issue for years. In my view, that  would be the wrong way to go, even if you have suggestions for  improving the rule.   So to wrap up the debate, I want colleagues to know that this rule,  this proposal that has been described on the floor--this resolution-- ought to be opposed because for those who want improved mental health,  for those who want background checks, for those who are just saying  what we need to do in this area as it relates to gun violence--it is  not about Democrats and it is not about Republicans; it is about common  sense. The commonsense position today for background checks, a focus on  mental health, and, most importantly, common sense is to oppose the  resolution.    I yield the floor.    I yield back.    Mr. President, I think Senator Murray has said it very  well, and I want to pick up on what I think is really at stake with  this nomination. In effect, if confirmed, Congressman Mulvaney would be  the numbers guy for the Trump team, the architect for the President's  fiscal plan for the Nation's future.   I want to start by way of saying that, when you look at the  President's promises that he made on the campaign trail to protect  Medicare and Social Security from draconian cuts, Congressman  Mulvaney's nomination and his record would be one of the biggest bait- and-switch schemes inflicted on America's seniors that I can imagine.   I am going to start by taking a minute to read some of what the  President said on the campaign trail. He said:         Every Republican wants to do a big number on Social       Security. They want to do it on Medicare . . . and we can't       do that. It's not fair to the people.    The President said: ``It's my absolute intention to leave Social  Security the way it is, not increase the age, but to leave it as-is.''   The President said:         You can't get rid of Medicare. Medicare's a program that       works . . . people love Medicare and it's unfair to them. I'm       going to fix it and make it better, but I'm not going to cut       it.   [[Page S1188]]     So those are just some of the promises that President Trump made with  respect to Social Security and Medicare. There are quotes like that  from rallies and campaign events and debates over a period of some  months. I think it would be fair to say that, for a lot of seniors,  when they heard that--when they heard these promises that these vital  programs would be protected--that was a political litmus test for many  American older people. So I describe this contrast between the promises  of President Trump and Candidate Trump and Congressman Mulvaney as a  bait and switch, but I think the Senate needs to know a little bit more  detail with respect to specifics.   In 2011 Congressman Mulvaney said: ``We have to end Medicare as we  know it.'' He added in another interview: ``Medicare as it exists today  is finished.'' He proposed raising the Social Security age to 70. He  called the program a Ponzi scheme. While he was a State lawmaker, he  even voted to declare Social Security unconstitutional.   My sense is it will be a while before seniors get over the whiplash  from the 180-degree turn the administration has pulled on Medicare and  Social Security cuts.   Now, with respect to the days ahead, for me, a lot of this debate  starts in my days when I was codirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers.  The seniors that I worked with knew what those programs meant. It was  their grandparents who faced old age without Social Security. Those  seniors with whom I worked during those Gray Panther days remember what  happened before we had the safety net. Before there was Social Security  and Medicare, you would have needy older people shunted off to poor  farms and almshouses. Even if you had meager savings, you were on your  own for income or you had to rely on family, and lots of family members  were not exactly well off. If you came down with a serious illness, it  really meant that you would be living in poverty and squalor. Social  Security and Medicare changed those unacceptable terms of the social  contract between this country and older people--and changed it for all  time. Those programs were about saying that in America--for the older  people who fought our wars, strengthened our communities day in and day  out, made America a better place because they were always pitching in  to help and be constructive--Medicare and Social Security meant that  older people and seniors would not face a life of destitution.   That is why I believe every Member of this body--and I heard Senator  Murray talk about this--ought to find what Congressman Mulvaney has  said against Medicare--his anti-Medicare and anti-Social Security  agenda--so troubling. I want to be very specific about the days ahead.  Medicare, at its core, has always been a promise. It has been a promise  of guaranteed benefits. It is not a voucher. It is not a slip of paper.  It is a promise of guaranteed benefits. We made the judgment--I just  went briefly through some of the history--because no one would ever  know how healthy they would be when they reached age 65. We talked  about it in the Budget Committee and in a number of meetings here in  the Senate. I am definitely for updating the Medicare promise, updating  the Medicare guarantee, and improving it, for example, to include  chronic care services, cancer services, diabetes, services dealing with  a whole host of chronic illnesses. That is going to consume much of the  Medicare budget. We can have more home care and we can use  telemedicine, and we can use nonphysician providers.   Senator Murray knows that in our part of the country we really have  found a way to get people good quality care in an affordable way, but  we are keeping the promise. We are keeping the promise of the Medicare  guarantee.    Congressman Mulvaney would break the promise of Medicare. If  confirmed, he would join his former House colleague who just became  Health and Human Services Secretary, Tom Price, who said in really very  blunt terms over the years that he wanted to privatize the program. He  wanted to privatize and cut the program. He basically indicated with  his legislation that he didn't really believe in Medicare, and he  didn't believe in the guarantee of services that Medicare provided. If  you look at Congressman Mulvaney's record, it certainly indicates he  shares the views of our former House colleague who just became Health  and Human Services Secretary, Tom Price.   With respect to Social Security, this year nearly 62 million  Americans and their families count on receiving retirement, survivors,  and disability benefits to stay afloat. This is a program that keeps  tens of millions of seniors out of poverty. It is unquestionably one of  the most popular programs in American history. It has changed the  fabric of the country for the better.   Again, I think about the days when I worked with older people. We had  millions of older people who month in and month out would just walk an  economic tightrope. They would try to balance their food costs against  their fuel costs and their fuel costs against their medical costs.  Social Security and Medicare came along to make sure those older people  wouldn't be pushed off that economic tightrope. So Social Security has  changed the fabric of the country for the better without doubt, and yet  Congressman Mulvaney proposes to raise the Social Security age to 70,  which would be a 20 percent cut to benefits.   Let's picture what this means, particularly for the millions of older  people who might not have had a job where they could work on their  laptop, and they had a physical job. They worked hours and hours on  their feet day in and day out. Ask the single mom who spent decades  working multiple jobs that way to put food on the table and send her  kids to school what it is going to mean to cut their benefits that  way--or the loggers or the dock workers, the miners, and all of those  people who have worked hard and have been on their feet with physically  grueling work. Ask them about raising the Social Security age this way.  I think you are going to get a pretty good sense of how strongly  Americans oppose this kind of Mulvaney approach.   So by way of summing up, I think it would be hard to find a more  significant task for the Congress at this time than protecting Social  Security and Medicare, advocating for the two as great achievements in  the history of American policymaking. They are right at the center of  our safety net.   Now you have to give Congressman Mulvaney credit for one thing. He  has been blunt, he has been explicit, and he is not shy about  essentially his vision of hollowing these programs out and dismantling  them. When asked about whether he was going to stick to his proposal to  cut the programs, he said:         I have to imagine that the President knew what he was       getting when he asked me to fill this role. I would like to       think it is why he hired me.    That is why I say--and Senator Murray touched on this--what kind of a  bait-and-switch game are we talking about here? You have the  President--Candidate Trump--saying: Nothing doing; nobody is going to  mess with Social Security and Medicare--off limits. I want older people  in America to know they are going to be safe if they elect me.   It was almost like a litmus test for America's older people. Then  Congressman Mulvaney comes along and he basically calls the bluff on  the whole thing. He describes the bait and switch in very blunt terms,  where he says: ``I have to imagine the President knew what he was  getting when he asked me to fill this role''--that the President knew  what the Mulvaney record was all about, which was about ending Medicare  as we know it.   So I will just close by way of saying that I see that a big part of  my job, and what Oregonians sent me here to do, is to defend Medicare  and Social Security for generations of Americans to come. That is why I  am a no on the Mulvaney nomination. I urge my colleagues to oppose the  nomination.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I, along with my colleagues  Congressmen Chaffetz from Utah and Conyers from Michigan, am  introducing the Geolocation Privacy and Surveillance Act, a bill that  protects Americans from seeing their phones and other devices turned  into location trackers without so much as a warrant or a warning. While  law enforcement agencies can and have obtained, and should obtain,  probable cause search warrants from a neutral judge authorizing them to  track the location of Americans, in many other cases, government  agencies obtain sensitive location information without a warrant. My  colleagues, Mr. Chaffetz and Conyers, and I intend to fix that.   This is a situation where government agencies' use of new technology  has gotten ahead of the laws in ways that would surprise many  Americans. Federal, State, and local agencies routinely track  Americans' locations through a variety of methods, most of the time  without people knowing they are being tracked. Some tracking demands go  directly from the government to phone companies. In the first 6 months  of 2016, law enforcement agencies submitted at least 86,000 demands to  telephone companies for subscriber location data. Some of these demands  were for the records of hundreds or even thousands of customers at a  time.   Law enforcement agencies also regularly track cell phones with the  use of a surveillance technology known as a cell site simulator or  Stingray. A recent bipartisan report by the Committee on Oversight and  Government Reform in the House of Representatives found that the  Departments of Justice and Homeland Security have spent more than $95  million to buy over 430 Stingrays. Although Federal agencies now obtain  warrants before using this technology, many State and local agencies do  not.   There is currently no uniform legal standard that regulates how  Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies are able to spy on  the location of Americans. Instead, there exists a confusing patchwork  of State laws, policies adopted by law enforcement agencies, and legal  precedents set by Federal and State courts. As a result, Americans in  one part of the country may enjoy less privacy, based on the policies  adopted by their local police department, privacy laws passed by their  State legislatures, or the willingness of their phone provider to push  back in court, than Americans who happen to live in a privacy-superior  jurisdiction. This patchwork quilt of rules and regulations has led to  confusion among law enforcement, prosecutors, and service providers,  who waste valuable time and resources litigating and appealing what  should be clear-cut rules--clear-cut rules that start from the premise  that privacy is an inviolable right, not a convenience granted by local  law enforcement.   Under President Obama, there was a policy in place that required  Federal law enforcement officers to get a probable cause warrant before  tracking an American's location. Under the current administration, we  do not yet know if this policy will remain, which makes this bill even  more critical.   This bill has three main components.   First, it requires the government to show probable cause and get a  warrant before acquiring the geolocational information of a U.S.  person, while setting out clear exceptions such as emergency or  national security situations or cases of theft or fraud. This probable  cause requirement would apply to all law enforcement acquisitions of  the geolocational information of individual Americans without their  knowledge. This requirement will include indirect location information  acquisition from commercial service providers and direct acquisitions  using Stingrays and similar devices, including tracking devices  covertly installed by the government. This bill would regulate both  real-time tracking of a person's movements, as well as the acquisition  of records of past movements.   Second, the bill creates criminal penalties for secretly using an  electronic device to track a person's movements that parallel those for  wiretapping. Currently, if a woman's ex-husband taps her phone, he is  breaking the law. This legislation would treat hacking her cell phone  to track her movements as a similar offense.   Finally, it prohibits commercial service providers from sharing  customers' geolocation information with outside entities without  customer consent.   Passage of this bill would provide much needed privacy protections to  Americans and ensure that location data is adequately protected from  warrantless surveillance by law enforcement agencies.   I thank my colleagues Chaffetz and Conyers for their efforts on this  bill, and I hope the Judiciary Committee will consider our proposal  quickly.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Cardin, and Mr. Van          Hollen):   S.J.
