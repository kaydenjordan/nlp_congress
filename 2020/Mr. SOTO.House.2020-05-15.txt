 Mr. Speaker, I don't need a magic minute to say the  obvious, that President Trump's response to the coronavirus has been a  colossal and utter failure that has left 36 million Americans without  jobs, 87,000 dead, and 1.5 million with this disease.   You can drone on and on about conspiracy theories all you want, but  we are going to clean up the mess. That is what the HEROES Act is  about. That is what we are doing here today: backing up first  responders, funding new tests, and making sure we put dollars into the  pockets of millions of struggling Americans.
