 Mr. Speaker, my experience as the first  registered nurse elected to Congress allows me to examine our Nation's  healthcare priorities with firsthand knowledge.   Currently, our mental health system is failing our communities. Our  Federal Government spends billions each year without addressing the  underlying causes of mental health illnesses.   Needless to say, reform is necessary. In Congress, we have defended  protections for preexisting conditions in the Affordable Care Act, a  law that has brought a sense of security for the 11.5 million Texans  and 133 million Americans living with preexisting conditions.   As we continue our work, we cannot lose sight of those living with  mental health illnesses as preexisting conditions.   There is much to be achieved, and I am eager to continue working for  the people to improve mental healthcare for every American.                            ____________________
