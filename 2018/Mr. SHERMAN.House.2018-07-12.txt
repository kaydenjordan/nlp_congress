 Mr. Speaker, Robert Mueller is conducting a criminal  investigation. Mr. Trump's attorney doesn't want him to testify.   Rudy Giuliani has taken three outrageous positions: He has claimed  that Mr. Trump doesn't have to testify if he doesn't think the  prosecutor has a good basis for the investigation; that Mr. Trump  doesn't have to testify if he doesn't think the prosecutor is being  objective; and that Mr. Trump doesn't have to testify if the prosecutor  doesn't already have sufficient evidence of a crime.   On this poster is a picture of Mr. Al Capone. He was forced to  testify before a grand jury. Mr. Capone didn't think that there was a  basis for that investigation, and Mr. Capone didn't think that the  prosecutor was objective. But he testified under oath, as did President  Bill Clinton, because no one is above the law. No one is immune from a  subpoena, not Mr. Al Capone, not Mr. Donald Trump.
