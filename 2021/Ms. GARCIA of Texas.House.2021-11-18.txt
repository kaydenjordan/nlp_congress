 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  billions of dollars coming to Texas to provide clean water and to  weatherize our power grid.   In just the past year and a half, my district has faced a devastating  winter storm and a massive pipe burst that put lives at risk. These two  events, pictured beside me, demonstrate a simple truth. We are long  past due for investments that modernize our electric grid and restore  our aging water systems.   That is why I am proud that the infrastructure bill will invest $3.5  billion to prepare power grids for weather emergencies and bring $2.9  billion directly to Texas for clean water. Thanks to this funding,  communities like mine will benefit from clean water, reliable power,  and peace of mind.                            ____________________
