 Mr. President, I come forward today to  recognize the grand opening of the Stewart Indian School Cultural  Center and Museum. Three miles south of Carson City, the Stewart Indian  School opened in 1890 with the official purpose of addressing  Indigenous education. In reality, students were made to forget their  Native languages and were allowed little to no contact with family  members for decades, thereby destroying important cultural and social  connections. Today, Stewart Indian School is listed on the National  Register of Historic Places and remains open as an important  educational and historic landmark in Nevada.   After its closing in 1982, the State of Nevada assumed the property  and began taking steps to reconcile its painful history with our  community. Most notably, it returned 130 acres of land to the Washoe  Tribe of Nevada and California. Since then, the Nevada Indian  Commission has worked hard to preserve the history and stories of its  alumni. In 2008, it helped establish a self-guided walking tour of the  campus, and in 2015, it worked with the Nevada State Legislature to  secure funding for a museum director and curator for the location. With  the help of volunteers and staff, members of this museum have worked  hard to record and display only some of the 30,000 Stewart Indian  School alumni stories, with many members being alumni or descendants  themselves.   On May 11 of this year, the U.S. Interior Department released the  Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative Investigative Report that  summarized the treatment of Indigenous children in over 400 boarding  schools across the country. The report unveils heartbreaking findings.  Many of these children were taken from their communities and were  forced to attend these schools. While there, they often faced rampant  emotional, sexual, and physical abuse. The report also makes it clear  that, from the beginning, these schools were designed to strip children  of their Indigenous identities. The resulting trauma impacted families  for generations, and some parents went as far as refusing to teach  their children their Native language or ways of life for fear that they  too would be severely punished in school for expressing themselves.  Stewart Indian School stands here today as one of these former 408  boarding schools.   I would like to commend the efforts of the Nevada Indian Commission,  of museum directors and staff, and of alumni and their descendants who  have made the official grand opening of the Stewart Indian School  Cultural Center and Museum possible. It is important that we recognize  the history of our community and acknowledge the testimonies of all  those who continue to endure the pain and loss that resulted from  decades of separation and cultural erasure. Finally, thank you to all  of those who bravely shared and publicized their stories so that we may  learn a bit more and work to never forget.                            ____________________
