other change that results in significant loss of access to       the fishery resource, which may include loss of fishing       vessels and gear for a substantial period of time and results       in significant revenue or subsistence loss due to an       allowable cause; and        ``(ii) does not include--         ``(I) reasonably predictable, foreseeable, and recurrent       fishery cyclical variations in species distribution or stock       abundance; or        ``(II) reductions in fishing opportunities resulting from       conservation and management measures taken pursuant to this

Secretary shall make a determination       about whether a fishery resource disaster has occurred, based       on the revenue loss thresholds under subparagraph (B), and,       if a fishery resource disaster has occurred, whether the       fishery resource disaster was due to--        ``(i) a natural cause;        ``(ii) an anthropogenic cause;        ``(iii) a combination of a natural cause and an       anthropogenic cause; or        ``(iv) an undetermined cause.        ``(B) Revenue loss thresholds.--        ``(i) In general.--Based on the information provided or       analyzed under paragraph (4)(B), the Secretary shall apply       the following 12-month revenue loss thresholds in determining       whether a fishery resource disaster has occurred:         ``(I) Losses greater than 80 percent may result in a       positive determination that a fishery resource disaster has       occurred, based on the information provided or analyzed under       paragraph (4)(B).        ``(II) Losses between 35 percent and 80 percent shall be       evaluated to determine whether economic impacts are severe       enough to declare that a fishery resource disaster has       occurred.        ``(III) Losses less than 35 percent shall not be eligible       for a determination that a fishery resource disaster has       occurred.         ``(ii) Charter fishing.--In making a determination of       whether a fishery resource disaster has occurred, the       Secretary shall consider the economic impacts to the charter       fishing industry to ensure financial coverage for charter       fishing businesses.        ``(iii) Subsistence loss.--In considering subsistence loss,       the Secretary shall evaluate the severity of loss to the       fishing community instead of applying the revenue loss       thresholds described in clause (i).        ``(C) Ineligible fisheries.--A fishery subject to       overfishing in any of the 3 years preceding the date of a       determination under this subsection is not eligible for a       determination of whether a fishery resource disaster has       occurred unless the Secretary determines that overfishing was       not a contributing factor to the fishery resource disaster.        ``(D) Exceptional circumstances.--In an exceptional       circumstance where substantial economic impacts to the       affected fishery and fishing community have been subject to a       disaster declaration under another statutory authority, such       as in the case of a natural disaster or from the direct       consequences of a Federal action taken to prevent, or in       response to, a natural disaster for purposes of protecting       life and safety, the Secretary may determine a fishery       resource disaster has occurred without a request.        ``(6) Disbursal of appropriated funds.--        ``(A) Authorization.--The Secretary shall allocate funds       available under paragraph (9) for fishery resource disasters.        ``(B) Allocation of appropriated fishery resource disaster       assistance.--        ``(i) Notification of funding availability.--When there are       appropriated funds for 1 or more fishery resource disasters,       the Secretary shall notify--         ``(I) the public; and        ``(II) representatives of affected fishing communities with       a positive disaster determination that is unfunded;       of the availability of funds, not more than 14 days after the       date of the appropriation or the determination of a fishery       resource disaster, whichever occurs later.        ``(ii) Extension of deadline.--The Secretary may extend the       deadline under clause (i) by 90 days to evaluate and make       determinations on eligible requests.        ``(C) Considerations.--In determining the allocation of       appropriations for a fishery resource disaster, the Secretary       shall consider commercial, charter, headboat, or seafood       processing revenue losses and may consider the following       factors:        ``(i) Direct economic impacts.        ``(ii) Uninsured losses.        ``(iii) Losses of subsistence and Tribal ceremonial fishing       opportunity.        ``(iv) Losses of recreational fishing opportunity.        ``(v) Aquaculture operations revenue loss.        ``(vi) Direct revenue losses to a fishing community.        ``(vii) Treaty obligations.        ``(viii) Other economic impacts.        ``(D) Spend plans.--To receive an allocation from funds       available under paragraph (9), a requester with an       affirmative fishery resource disaster determination shall       submit a spend plan to the Secretary, not more than 120 days       after receiving notification that funds are available, that       shall include the following information, if applicable:        ``(i) Objectives and outcomes, with an emphasis on       addressing the factors contributing to the fishery resource       disaster and minimizing future uninsured losses, if       applicable.        ``(ii) Statement of work.        ``(iii) Budget details.        ``(E) Regional contact.--If so requested, the Secretary       shall provide a regional contact within the National Oceanic       and Atmospheric Administration to facilitate review of spend       plans and disbursal of funds.        ``(F) Disbursal of funds.--        ``(i) Availability.--Funds shall be made available to       grantees not later than 90 days after the date the Secretary       receives a complete spend plan.        ``(ii) Method.--The Secretary may provide an allocation of       funds under this subsection in the form of a grant, direct       payment, cooperative agreement, loan, or contract.        ``(iii) Eligible uses.--         ``(I) In general.--Funds allocated for fishery resources       disasters under this subsection shall restore the fishery       affected by such a disaster, prevent a similar disaster in       the future, or assist the affected fishing community, and       shall prioritize the following uses, which are not in order       of priority:         ``(aa) Habitat conservation and restoration and other       activities, including scientific research, that reduce       adverse impacts to the fishery or improve understanding of       the affected species or its ecosystem.        ``(bb) The collection of fishery information and other       activities that improve management of the affected fishery.        ``(cc) In a commercial fishery, capacity reduction and       other activities that improve management of fishing effort,       including funds to offset budgetary costs to refinance a       Federal fishing capacity reduction loan or to repay the       principal of a Federal fishing capacity reduction loan.        ``(dd) Developing, repairing, or improving fishery-related       public infrastructure.        ``(ee) Direct assistance to a person, fishing community       (including assistance for lost fisheries resource levies), or       a business to alleviate economic loss incurred as a direct       result of a fishery resource disaster, particularly when       affected by a circumstance described in paragraph (5)(D).        ``(ff) Hatcheries and stock enhancement to help rebuild the       affected stock or offset fishing pressure on the affected       stock.         ``(II) Displaced fishery employees.--Where appropriate,       individuals carrying out the activities described in items       (aa) through (dd) of subclause (I) shall be individuals who       are, or were, employed in a commercial, charter, or Tribal

provided in clauses (ii) and       (iii), the Federal share of the cost of any activity carried       out under the authority of this subsection shall not exceed       75 percent of the cost of that activity.        ``(ii) Waiver.--The Secretary may waive the non-Federal       share requirements of this subsection, if the Secretary       determines that--         ``(I) no reasonable means are available through which the       recipient of the Federal share can meet the non-Federal share       requirement; and        ``(II) the probable benefit of 100 percent Federal       financing outweighs the public interest in imposition of the       non-Federal share requirement.         ``(iii) Exception.--The Federal share shall be equal to 100       percent in the case of--         ``(I) direct assistance as described in paragraph       (6)(F)(iii)(I)(ee); or  [[Page S6847]]         ``(II) assistance to subsistence or Tribal fisheries.         ``(B) Limitations on administrative

Secretary shall make a determination       about whether a fishery resource disaster has occurred, based       on the revenue loss thresholds under subparagraph (B), and,       if a fishery resource disaster has occurred, whether the       fishery resource disaster was due to--        ``(i) a natural cause;        ``(ii) an anthropogenic cause;        ``(iii) a combination of a natural cause and an       anthropogenic cause; or        ``(iv) an undetermined cause.        ``(B) Revenue loss thresholds.--        ``(i) In general.--Based on the information provided or       analyzed under paragraph (4)(B), the Secretary shall apply       the following 12-month revenue loss thresholds in determining       whether a fishery resource disaster has occurred:         ``(I) Losses greater than 80 percent may result in a       positive determination that a fishery resource disaster has       occurred, based on the information provided or analyzed under       paragraph (4)(B).        ``(II) Losses between 35 percent and 80 percent shall be       evaluated to determine whether economic impacts are severe       enough to declare that a fishery resource disaster has       occurred.        ``(III) Losses less than 35 percent shall not be eligible       for a determination that a fishery resource disaster has       occurred.         ``(ii) Charter fishing.--In making a determination of       whether a fishery resource disaster has occurred, the       Secretary shall consider the economic impacts to the charter       fishing industry to ensure financial coverage for charter       fishing businesses.        ``(iii) Subsistence loss.--In considering subsistence loss,       the Secretary shall evaluate the severity of loss to the       fishing community instead of applying the revenue loss       thresholds described in clause (i).        ``(C) Ineligible fisheries.--A fishery subject to       overfishing in any of the 3 years preceding the date of a       determination under this subsection is not eligible for a       determination of whether a fishery resource disaster has       occurred unless the Secretary determines that overfishing was       not a contributing factor to the fishery resource disaster.        ``(D) Exceptional circumstances.--In an exceptional       circumstance where substantial economic impacts to the       affected fishery and fishing community have been subject to a       disaster declaration under another statutory authority, such       as in the case of a natural disaster or from the direct       consequences of a Federal action taken to prevent, or in       response to, a natural disaster for purposes of protecting       life and safety, the Secretary may determine a fishery       resource disaster has occurred without a request.        ``(6) Disbursal of appropriated funds.--        ``(A) Authorization.--The Secretary shall allocate funds       available under paragraph (9) for fishery resource disasters.        ``(B) Allocation of appropriated fishery resource disaster       assistance.--        ``(i) Notification of funding availability.--When there are       appropriated funds for 1 or more fishery resource disasters,       the Secretary shall notify--         ``(I) the public; and        ``(II) representatives of affected fishing communities with       a positive disaster determination that is unfunded;       of the availability of funds, not more than 14 days after the       date of the appropriation or the determination of a fishery       resource disaster, whichever occurs later.        ``(ii) Extension of deadline.--The Secretary may extend the       deadline under clause (i) by 90 days to evaluate and make       determinations on eligible requests.        ``(C) Considerations.--In determining the allocation of       appropriations for a fishery resource disaster, the Secretary       shall consider commercial, charter, headboat, or seafood       processing revenue losses and may consider the following       factors:        ``(i) Direct economic impacts.        ``(ii) Uninsured losses.        ``(iii) Losses of subsistence and Tribal ceremonial fishing       opportunity.        ``(iv) Losses of recreational fishing opportunity.        ``(v) Aquaculture operations revenue loss.        ``(vi) Direct revenue losses to a fishing community.        ``(vii) Treaty obligations.

if applicable:        ``(i) Objectives and outcomes, with an emphasis on       addressing the factors contributing to the fishery resource       disaster and minimizing future uninsured losses, if       applicable.        ``(ii) Statement of work.        ``(iii) Budget details.        ``(E) Regional contact.--If so requested, the Secretary       shall provide a regional contact within the National Oceanic       and Atmospheric Administration to facilitate review of spend       plans and disbursal of funds.        ``(F) Disbursal of funds.--        ``(i) Availability.--Funds shall be made available to       grantees not later than 90 days after the date the Secretary       receives a complete spend plan.        ``(ii) Method.--The Secretary may provide an allocation of       funds

that reduce       adverse impacts to the fishery or improve understanding of       the affected species or its ecosystem.        ``(bb) The collection of fishery information and other       activities that improve management of the affected fishery.        ``(cc) In a commercial fishery, capacity reduction and       other activities that improve management of fishing effort,       including funds to offset budgetary costs to refinance a       Federal fishing capacity reduction loan or to repay the       principal of a Federal fishing capacity reduction loan.        ``(dd) Developing, repairing, or improving fishery-related       public infrastructure.        ``(ee) Direct assistance to a person, fishing community       (including assistance for lost fisheries resource levies), or       a business to alleviate economic loss incurred as a direct       result of a fishery resource disaster, particularly when       affected by a circumstance described in paragraph (5)(D).        ``(ff) Hatcheries and stock enhancement to help rebuild the       affected stock or offset fishing pressure on the affected       stock.         ``(II) Displaced fishery employees.--Where appropriate,
