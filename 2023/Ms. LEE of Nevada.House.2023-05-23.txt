 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of two  celebrations that are incredibly important to my community: Asian  American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Heritage Month and  Small Business Month.   As the Representative of one of the largest and fastest-growing  AANHPI communities in the country, I am beyond proud of the  contributions our small business owners have made to our thriving  southern Nevada economy, which include folks like: Alex Zen who curates  Chinatown's Zen D'core, a boutique jewelry shop offering minimalist  decor and jewelry; Amy Zhang Warthan, owner of No. 1 Boba Tea, which  has proudly served the Las Vegas community since 1998; and leaders like  Ken Cheng, manager of Chinatown Mall.   They have all worked tirelessly to create thriving commercial centers  for our small businesses.   All of this amazing development would not be possible without the  support of groups like the Nevada AAPI Chamber of Commerce, the Las  Vegas Asian Chamber of Commerce, the Las Vegas India Chamber of  Commerce, the Philippine Chamber of Commerce, the Vietnamese American  Chamber of Commerce, the Korean American Chamber of Commerce, the Sri  Lanka America Association of Las Vegas, and so many more. They all work  day in and day out to serve our AANHPI businesses across the Silver  State.   From Chinatown to the Las Vegas strip and across the valley, southern  Nevada draws its strength in our diversity, and the AANHPI Nevadans are  key to that success.   Thank you to all of the AANHPI Nevadans who put the American Dream on  full display by pursuing their passions and growing our small business  economy.                            ____________________
