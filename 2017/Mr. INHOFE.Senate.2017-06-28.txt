 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.     Congratulating the University of Oklahoma Women's Softball Team on    Winning the 2017 Women's College World Series National Championship     Mr. President, this is a little out of character.  Confession is good for the soul. One of my very favorite--maybe my most  favorite--of spectator sports is, of all things, girls' softball.   Now, a lot of people don't even know anything about the sport. It is  pretty incredible. I am pleased to tell you that Oklahoma City is the  home of a very famous ASA Hall of Fame stadium, which is the world's  No. 1 softball field. This is where the Big 12 Softball Championship  and the Women's College World Series are held.   This past May, the Sooners won the championship game at the Big 12  softball tournament between Oklahoma and Oklahoma State, which also has  a great team, at this impressive stadium. The Sooners won.   Then, on June 6, they became the 2017 Women's College World Series  national champions in Oklahoma City.   After facing diversity in the earlier game against North Dakota State  in the NCAA regionals, the Sooners proceeded to win 11 consecutive  games--think about that, 11 consecutive games--ultimately achieving a  5-to-4 victory over the University of Florida Gators.   In the first game of the championship series, Oklahoma outlasted  Florida in a recordbreaking--I was here; we were actually in session at  that time--17 innings. It went until 3 o'clock in the morning. Of  course, we won. It was the longest game in the history of women's  college series of all time.    This win is the women's softball team's second consecutive national  championship and the third in the last 5 years. This is a big deal.  These girls come from all over the country and end up playing softball  there. It is something where they are clearly national champions. It  makes me very proud to see that they are doing so well.   I would like to take a moment to congratulate all of the players.  Their hard work clearly paid off. It is important to thank the coaches  as well. Thank you for your skills, your tenacity, and your dedication,  which helped lead these ladies to victory.   Their remarkable head coach, Patty Gasso, has been with OU since  1995, and was inducted into the National Fast Pitch Coaches Association  Hall of Fame in 2012. I bet you didn't even know there was such a  thing, but there is. She and her staff have worked together over the  last few decades to build a legacy that has a strong community  following. These women will continue to make Oklahoma proud through  their various roles as students, athletes, and leaders.   Just last week, junior pitcher Paige Parker was warming up before she  threw the ceremonial first pitch of the game between the Kansas City  Royals and the Boston Red Sox. It was during this warmup that the  Royals players were able to see firsthand how impressive girls'  softball pitchers are. The catcher even missed some of them and almost  fell over.   I wish the best of luck to these players and the coaches for next  year's softball season. Enjoy your success, and bring home another  national championship next year.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the team roster of all  the players and coaches, who made this a great championship victory, be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         The players: Kelsey Arnold, Falepolima Aviu, Caleigh       Clifton, Alissa Dalton, Macey Hatfield, Shay Knighten, Mariah       Lopez, Paige Lowary, Kylie Lundberg, Nicole Mendes, Melanie       Olmos, Paige Parker, Nicole Pendley, Raegan Rogers, Sydney       Romero, Hannah Sparks, Vanessa Taukeiaho, and Lea Wodach.        The coaches: Patty Gasso, Melyssa Lombardi, JT Gasso,       Jackie Bishop, Lacey Waldrop, Brittany Williams, and Andrea       Gasso.     Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
