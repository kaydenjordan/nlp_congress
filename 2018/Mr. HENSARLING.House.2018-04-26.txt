 Mr. Speaker, I am humbled to honor former First Lady  Barbara Bush--Barbara Bush had unparalleled style and grace. Not only  was she our First Lady, but a fiercely loyal wife, mother, grandmother,  and great-grandmother.   As a fellow Texan, I am proud of her leadership for our country and  her unparalleled commitment to childhood literacy. Her leadership while  in the White House was impactful and her work for her foundation has  helped countless children. I had the pleasure of meeting Mrs. Bush on a  few occasions and am saddened to hear of her passing.   While she may no longer be here with us on earth, we can be certain  she is with our Heavenly Father--her memory will continue to live in  the hearts and minds of the American people.                            ____________________
