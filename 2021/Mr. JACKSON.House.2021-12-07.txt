 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of a critical piece of  legislation that comes before Congress each year, the National Defense  Authorization Act. First, I thank Ranking Member Rogers and his staff  for their outstanding leadership in this effort.   This bill modernizes our force, gives a well-deserved raise to our  servicemembers, and provides them with the equipment they need to  compete with China, Russia, and Iran.   For the 13th District of Texas, this bill will protect the nuclear  triad, it will modernize the Pantex Plant in Amarillo, and it will  support training done at Sheppard Air Force Base in Wichita Falls. It  also included provisions that I authored to put servicemembers first  and ensure the safety of all of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines,  and guardians.   This NDAA also pushes back on the unconstitutional vaccine mandate,  and it holds the Biden administration accountable for its failed  Afghanistan withdrawal.   Just as important, there are some notable provisions that are not  included. This bill does not contain harmful provisions that threaten  the Second Amendment and it does not require our daughters to register  for the draft.   Bottom line: This bill is a win for the military, it is a win for the  Texas 13th Congressional District, and it is a win for this country.
