 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the  confirmation vote on the nomination of R.D. James to be an Assistant  Secretary of the Army.   On vote No. 24, had I been present, I would have voted yea on  confirmation of the James nomination.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
