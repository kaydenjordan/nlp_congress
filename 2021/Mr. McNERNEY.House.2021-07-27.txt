 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for her hard work  on this excellent piece of legislation, the staff and Democratic  members of the committee, and all Members across the aisle for their  hard work on these very important issues.   I rise today in support of my two amendments to division B of H.R.  4502.   These two amendments draw much-needed attention to the energy-water  nexus. Energy and water development systems have become more vulnerable  as water scarcity and uncertainty have become more pronounced in the  West.   It is time for a more integrated approach to addressing challenges  and opportunities, and my amendments encourage our government agencies  to improve underlying data collection and analysis.   My first amendment encourages the Energy Information Administration  to conduct a more robust analysis and data collection of water  consumption in the commercial and residential surveys and to make the  information publicly available.   My second amendment encourages the Bureau of Reclamation to address  the energy consumption from their pumping stations to better understand  the opportunities for energy efficiencies and to reduce energy use  measures.   Better data and analysis are foundational to identifying efficiencies  in the face of climate change, especially in States where water  processing uses a large portion of the energy budget.   Madam Speaker, I urge the adoption of these amendments.
