 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Why at this time should we come together bipartisanly on this vote?  That is the question that I am going to attempt to answer.   Members of this body are going to have the opportunity as we move  forward here to either support Hamas or to not, to fight against them.  The choice will be made. People will decide which direction they want  to go.   My bill, H.R. 261, the Palestinian International Terrorism Support  Prevention Act of 2021, would make clear that the United States stands  with Israel and would sanction those who provide financial support to  Hamas. It is that simple.   Now, why do we need to do that? Why is it important to come together  on this? To put a fine point on it, this is not one pissed-off  Palestinian that picked up a shoulder-fired RPG, put it on their  shoulder, and fired it 100 yards over at Israel. That is not what we  are talking about here.   Hamas is sophisticated. They are well organized, and there is a  complex infrastructure involved in getting them their weapons. They  don't just go down to the Gaza Strip rocket depot in order to pick up  these things. They are smuggled across Iraq, Syria, Jordan, into one of  the most densely populated areas of the world without anybody noticing  or saying anything. That is why we need these sanctions.                                time  1530    Why should we come together bipartisanly on this to support our  friend and ally Israel to stand against Hamas?   Because the rockets that Hamas smuggles and fires at Israel are not  science-fair bottle rockets. Many of them are Fajr-5 missiles, 21-plus  feet long. That is longer than a Chevy Suburban. There are hundreds of  pounds of explosives on the end of that.   The explosives that detonated underneath my legs were about 5 pounds  to 10 pounds of explosives, to put that into perspective.   Why come together bipartisanly to support this?   Because Hamas is not firing these rockets in order to make a pretty  fireworks show. They use these missiles specifically to target large  towns and cities with the express hope of killing Israeli civilians,  like so many that we have heard about.   Ido Avigal was a 5-year-old boy who was murdered when shrapnel from a  rocket ripped through his window in a fortified room that he was hiding  in with his mother.   Daniel Tragerman was a 4-year-old Israeli boy who was killed by a  mortar shell fired by Hamas in 2014.   Soumya Santosh was killed when a rocket fired on Israel by Hamas on  May 11th detonated close to her. She worked as a caretaker to an  elderly woman who had been living in Israel for the last 7 years.   These individuals and so many others are not just collateral damage.  They and millions of other Israeli civilians are targeted. They are  targets of Hamas.   After I was blown up in Afghanistan, I volunteered to serve alongside  Israel Defense Forces. There, I served alongside soldiers that were  driven by their love for their fellow man, rather than by hatred for  their enemies.   I had the honor of getting to know some of the most creative and  caring people I have ever met, who adapted to some of the worst  situations that anybody could be placed into. Every family that I  encountered during my time in Israel shared a desire for their children  to grow, like we do, and to be educated safely without the looming  threat of war.   I learned at the Shabbat tables of my hosts there just how much each  family truly desires peace between every neighbor of Israel, regardless  of religion, regardless of history. They don't want to be attacked.  They want to live in peace. They want to see their children grow.   So why support bipartisanly this legislation?   Because Hamas, on the other hand, uses their own people as shields  and cannon fodder. They don't stand for their people. They don't defend  their people. They stand behind their people. They build their command  and control infrastructure inside hospitals and schools. They launch  their missiles from heavily populated areas.   And this recent round of fighting between Hamas and Israel is exactly  that, a round in an ongoing conflict that goes back decades. Hamas has  consistently launched thousands and thousands of rockets into Israel,  killing and maiming hundreds of civilians.   Why come together bipartisanly?   Because in the last week alone, they have fired more than 3,000  rockets into Israel. This didn't make the news, but in April, over 44  rockets fired into Israel. In January, three rockets fired into Israel.  That is just this year.   Why come together bipartisanly?   In 2020, more than 130 rocket attacks. In 2019, 650 rocket attacks.  In 2018, 350 rocket attacks.   That is more than one a day. Imagine if that was going on here in the  United States.   Why come together bipartisanly?   To make sure that we sanction the enablers of Hamas.   In 2016, Hamas bombed a bus in Jerusalem, killing 2 and wounding 21.   At another time, a Hamas suicide bomber killed one and injured nine.   Another bombing, Palestinian Islamic Jihad claims responsibility for  a suicide bombing in a neighborhood bakery.  [[Page H2476]]    Another bombing in a shawarma restaurant in Tel Aviv killed 11 and  wounded 70. Palestinian Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility, one of  the listed sanctioned groups in this bill.   In another bombing, at a vegetable market, seven people killed.  Palestinian Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility.   In another bombing, two commuter buses in Beersheba, 16 people killed  and over 100 wounded. Hamas claimed responsibility.   Why is this bill needed? Why do we need to come together?   Because Hamas does not finance terrorism with bake sales. They  receive significant support from individual groups and foreign  governments, like Iran.   The U.S. Government has estimated that Iran, by itself, has provided  as much as $100 million annually to Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic  Jihad, and other Palestinian terrorist organizations. These foreign  sponsors seek to bring death to the Jewish state. It is that simple.   Under my bill, the United States will sanction these groups that are  supporting terrorism. If we do not pass this bill, we will not stand  together to sanction these groups that are enabling this terrorism.   This is common sense, which is why it passed the House of  Representatives without any opposition last Congress. The bill even  includes humanitarian exemptions that Democrats in the Foreign Affairs  Committee wrote last Congress, before all voting in favor of this piece  of legislation.   Given the ongoing attacks on Israel, and the bipartisan support for  this bill last Congress, I have asked that this bill be expedited for  consideration again.   Unfortunately, some of our colleagues are now pushing the opposite  direction for the United States to withhold American weapons shipments  to Israel, but they will not support steps to cut off the flow of  weapons and funding from Iran to Hamas that is killing our  Israeli friends. There is a false equivalency that is going on, and  there is a rooting for a terrorist organization that is happening as  well.    So, Madam Speaker, this is my request. Many of you supported this  bill 2 years ago. Support it again now. Stand with our ally, Israel.  Stand against Hamas. Stand against their enablers. Pass this bill  unanimously.
