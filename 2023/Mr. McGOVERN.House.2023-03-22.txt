 Mr. Speaker, I rise to place in the Record the names of  three Nicaraguan political prisoners who were among those released and  sent to the United States on February 23, 2023.   Luis Carlos Valle Tinoco, Karla Vanessa Escobar Maldonado, and Yader  Antonio Polanco Cisneros joined the massive protests in Nicaragua in  April 2018. All were denied due process, imprisoned in deplorable  conditions, and refused access to medical care as their health declined  just because they disagreed with their government.   They were recognized as prisoners of conscience by the Defending  Freedoms Project of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, and I was  privileged to serve as their advocate.   Some Nicaraguan prisoners who arrived here are well-known leaders,  but many are not. They have been stripped of their nationality, lost  everything, and have a tough road ahead.   The Ortega government must be held accountable for its crimes.                            ____________________
