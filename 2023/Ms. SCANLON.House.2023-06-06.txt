 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes.   With all the very real issues facing our great Nation, it is really  disappointing that once again the House majority has decided to waste  valuable time and resources to promote a bunch of half-baked  legislative ideas and stir the culture wars pot with MAGA conspiracy  theories.   The bills that we started considering yesterday in the Rules  Committee and will debate and vote upon in the next couple days,  consuming an entire week of scarce legislative time, will do nothing to  address the most pressing issues our constituents are begging us to  address: gun violence, affordable health and childcare, the growing  impact of climate change, Social Security solvency, immigration, and  national security.   Worse, the antigovernment philosophy inspiring these bills will  ultimately harm Americans by creating dangerous bottlenecks in critical  government functions, misrepresenting the role and actions of the  Federal Government, and disrupting the government's ability to protect  Americans from harm.   Let's get some facts straight. While our colleagues across the aisle  have framed their argument as necessary to ensure that Congress  exercises its legislative function, they completely ignore the fact  that the Federal agencies and rulemaking processes they are attacking  have been established by Congress to undertake specific functions. That  includes rulemaking, which is delegated to the agencies by Congress and  ensures that they implement policies using the best and most recent  expertise available, for the benefit of the American people.   By enlisting the assistance of Federal agencies to administer the  laws that it passes, Congress fulfills its constitutional mandate, the  mandate for our entire government to establish justice, ensure domestic  tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general  welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to our colleagues.   In other words, working together with the other branches, our  government is charged with accomplishing certain basic goals for the  American people. The regulatory process that our colleagues seek to  frame as a battle against a vast bureaucratic conspiracy is actually an  essential part of ensuring that we all have clean air and water to  breathe and drink; healthy food to eat; safe planes, trains, and  automobiles to travel in.   In reality, regulations mean that when a senior goes to the pharmacy  to pick up their prescriptions, the lifesaving medication that they  will take is both safe and effective.   When you boil it down, rules and regulations are extremely tangible  ways that the Federal Government protects people's health and safety  and helps create a fairer economy where everyone has a chance to  succeed.   Subject matter experts at agencies craft these regulations, many  based on highly complex and technical data. Once a rule is proposed, it  undergoes an often years-long rigorous review in which comments are  solicited from the public, business interests, and other agencies.   Of course, these rules and regs are issued in response to  congressional directives. They are an important step towards  implementing laws that Members of this body have passed while  representing the people back home who elect them to come here.   We can see examples of successful rulemaking all the time across the  country. Before the Clean Water Act, the Delaware River, which runs  alongside my district, was so polluted that it stripped the paint off  passing ships. These days, you can safely kayak on the river thanks to  regulations developed by agencies to carry out that law.    While the regulatory process can always be improved upon, the  proposals we are considering today are not good-faith improvements or  efforts to provide checks on the regulatory process.   The first of these bills is H.R. 277, the REINS Act, which would turn  the administrative rulemaking process on its head, requiring every  major rule--of which there are dozens and sometimes hundreds every  year--to be passed again by both houses of Congress and signed by the  President.   Remember, these rules have been developed in the first instance as a  result of congressional action.   What the REINS Act is really doing is creating a process that will  cause  [[Page H2752]]  gridlock that then Republicans, or other political operatives, can take  advantage of to stop rules they don't like.   The burdensome requirements of H.R. 277 are simply not needed because  Congress already has multiple opportunities to shape or rescind major  rules if it disapproves of them.   We can hold hearings and offer public comment. We can disapprove  major regulations before they take effect, or we can rescind those  regulations under the Congressional Review Act.   On that last point in particular, I will note that this majority has  moved these types of measures through this Chamber already many times  this Congress.   In addition, we can also pass legislation to change laws or  regulations, if we so please. Of course, we are considering bills today  to do just that.                                time  1230    I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are aware of the  avenues through which Congress can review and reverse rules. I know it  because they use them, or try to use them, week in and week out.   For them to paint a bill like the REINS Act as a noble effort to  empower Congress is disingenuous, and, ultimately, it diverts attention  from the disastrous consequences this legislation would actually  create.   Effectively, the REINS Act nullifies all new rulemaking by any  administration, whether Republican or Democrat, and it would bring  government operations to a standstill. Any new regulation would have to  be passed by Congress in order to take effect.   So let's think about what that would really mean. A Congress, with a  House majority that would rather bring the country to the brink of  default instead of paying bills that Congress has already approved,  would have to vote on every new major regulation from every Federal  agency.   If that doesn't scare you, the Senate, hardly a model of expeditious  legislation, would need to do the same.   In addition, the bill might actually be unconstitutional because it  creates a mechanism in which one House of Congress can effectively veto  an agency's rule by simply not acting on it within a 70-day legislative  time frame.   This, in effect, is indistinguishable from the one-House legislative  veto that the Supreme Court held to be unconstitutional in Immigration  and Naturalization Service v. Chadha.   The unfortunate truth is, Congress struggles every day to meet the  most pressing needs of the American people. There aren't enough hours  in the day, year, or congressional term for us to weigh in on all the  regulations that we would need to implement the laws that we are  passing.   Under this policy, crucial regulations would be left to languish  unacted upon, and the health, safety, and welfare of the people we are  supposed to serve would be in jeopardy.   In addition to the REINS Act, there are three other bills that my  colleagues are pushing through today which would also undermine the  regulatory process and threaten public welfare and safety.   H.R. 288, the SOPRA Act, eliminates the decades-long standard for  judicial review of agency decisions. That is a precedent that rests, in  part, on the understanding that Congress delegates to agencies certain  authorities to carry out the laws that it passes.   It is clear that all the talk on the other side of the aisle about  this being to restore power to Congress is empty words because this  bill actually incentivizes unelected judges, not Congress, to make and  enact policy from the bench. Ultimately, it would slow the rulemaking  process and skew it toward more powerful, well-funded, and often  corporate litigants, which may be the point.   Finally, the two gas stove bills that our colleagues are pushing this  week actually demonstrate some of the flaws in the REINS Act; chief  among them, the ready availability of alternatives to the REINS Act  proposal and the dangers of politicizing the rulemaking process.   H.R. 1615 and 1640 are fearmongering attempts to prevent the  enactment of standards to make gas stoves more safe and efficient and  would hinder agencies' abilities to address potentially dangerous  consumer products.   The majority's trumped-up battle to defend gas stoves from the  Federal Government is nothing more than a conspiracy theory cooked up  to embroil Congress in culture wars that shed more heat than light on  the issues facing our Nation and are likely done so with a healthy  helping of fossil fuel lobbying dollars.   Contrary to the heated rhetoric from our colleagues across the aisle,  the Federal Government has not proposed to remove appliances from  Americans' homes. That persuasive falsehood has been repeated for  months by partisan hacks like Tucker Carlson to stoke grievances and  cause chaos.   H.R. 1640, the Save Our Gas Stoves Act, nullifies new,  congressionally mandated energy efficiency standards for gas stoves,  for new gas stoves only, that would save consumers up to $1.7 billion  in energy bills and cut down on emissions that are being shown to be  particularly dangerous to children's health.   Most of us are familiar with these energy efficiency standards, and  we rely upon them when we purchase new appliances like stoves and  freezers and furnaces. I know that I do because it is the responsible  thing to do as a consumer from both an environmental and an economic  perspective.   Contrary to my colleagues' assertions, half of the gas stoves on the  market today would meet the standard, and the remainder would have 3  years to make the necessary and already available adjustments to bring  their new stoves into compliance.   H.R. 1615, the Gas Stove Protection and Freedom Act, is even worse  because it threatens the government's ability to identify and regulate  unsafe gas stoves, including those with design defects that could cause  injury or death to American consumers.   Just last year, the Consumer Product Safety Commission recalled a gas  stove that had sent multiple people to the hospital and placed many  more at serious risk of injury or death from carbon monoxide poisoning.   This bill would have prevented the recall of that dangerous appliance  and would prevent the Consumer Product Safety Commission from  addressing other dangerous appliances in the future. It is simply  irresponsible to jeopardize the health and safety of Americans in order  to promote conspiracy theories for the far right.   Overall today, my Republican colleagues take a misguided approach to  the issues facing rulemaking and Federal regulations. It is clear they  don't want to make the government work better. They want to break it.   They would rather allow polluters and corporations to wreak havoc on  our environment, children's health, and working people's livelihoods.  They would prefer to decimate a regulatory process that improves the  lives of Americans every single day.    The Federal Government has long played an important role in promoting  the health, safety, and welfare of the American people, and we need to  ensure that it can continue playing that role.   Madam Speaker, I strongly oppose these bills, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the  Record a Politico article titled: ``What the right's gas stove freak- out was really about.'' That is dated January 14. The first line is:  ``No, President Joe Biden isn't coming for your gas stove.''    I also note that, in that article, it talks about the  multiple studies now that are investigating the impact of gas stoves on  asthma, including by the American Lung Association.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My esteemed colleague from Kentucky talked about the popularity of  the REINS Act, but I suggest that that popularity is overstated. The  REINS Act has been introduced by its extremist advocates for more than  a decade without ever being enacted into law, even when Republicans  held both Houses and the White House. I would suggest that it is  because saner heads have prevailed and understood that enactment of the  REINS Act is bad for America.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to provide for consideration of a resolution  which states that it is the House's responsibility to protect and  preserve Social Security and Medicaid for our future generations and  reject any cuts to these essential programs.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with any extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, Social Security and Medicare are vital to  many of our constituents' economic and health security, yet many of my  friends across the aisle have called for major cuts to these critical  programs.   In fact, just last week, Speaker McCarthy announced he was forming a  bipartisan commission tasked with looking at budget cuts and suggested  that Social Security and Medicare could be on the chopping block,  saying: ``We have to look at the entire budget. . . . The majority  driver of the budget is mandatory spending. It's Medicare, Social  Security, interest on the debt.''   It wasn't too long ago that I remember some of my Republican friends  calling the President a liar during the State of the Union when he  suggested that Republicans were willing to put Social Security benefits  on the chopping block.   Now, instead of debating gas stoves and the finer points of  administrative law, I am giving my friends on the other side of the  aisle a chance to reassure the American public and unequivocally state  these programs won't be cut, not just with rhetoric but also with their  votes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Ms.  Bush), to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Once again, my colleagues on the right are reverting to their  favorite tactic when confronted with real problems in the real world:  distraction to conceal that they are doing nothing.   They propose to grind the gears of government to a halt to impose an  extreme ideology that Americans as a whole do not support, just as they  threatened to tank our entire economy to impose other extreme cuts that  even their own party members couldn't support.   They want to ensure that we can do nothing with these bills, that we  can do nothing to protect kids from pollutants and dangerous products,  to keep businesses from scamming working families out of money, or to  ensure that the food people eat every day is safe.   Imagine an FDA that can't issue new food safety and drug regulations,  or an EPA that can't keep our drinking water clean, or a VA that can't  properly serve our veterans, or a Department of Transportation that  can't enforce safety standards for cars, trains, or airplanes. This is  what the majority is proposing, and it is a very dangerous vision for  America.   The people who elect us to Congress depend on us to make their and  their children's lives better, and doing nothing will not accomplish  that goal. If anything, we need to make our government more responsive  to the needs of the people. We need to do better, not nothing at all.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question and  the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
