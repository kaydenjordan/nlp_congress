 Mr. President, we heard famously that elections have  consequences, and over the next few days we will have an experiment in  what I call ``the physics of politics.''   For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. If the  Democrats use for the first time a partisan filibuster of a Supreme  Court nominee, we will have an equal and opposite reaction. An  unprecedented action is going to evoke an unprecedented reaction.   Neil Gorsuch deserves to be confirmed, and I want to share for the  next few minutes why. For more than 2 months since the nomination was  first announced, we have seen that Judge Neil Gorsuch possesses the  qualifications and the temperament to serve as our next Supreme Court  Justice.   While all nominations carry enormous responsibility, this is arguably  the most important position we are tasked with filling. We need someone  who is extraordinarily qualified, someone who will respect the  foundation of our country, someone who has the mental resilience to  stay above the political fray. Some of my friends on the left have  called Judge Gorsuch unqualified, too conservative, and someone who is  simply not in the judicial mainstream.   Judge Gorsuch started his legal career by earning degrees from not  one, but two Ivy League schools--Columbia University for his undergrad,  Harvard Law for his juris doctor, graduating cum laude. Even as a  Marshall Scholar, he earned a doctorate degree from Oxford. When one  takes into account these extraordinary educational achievements, it  would be simply incomprehensible that anyone would consider him  unqualified.   His record on the bench is just as impressive. We have heard these  numbers so many times that we sometimes just gloss or glaze over these  numbers, but these numbers are powerful indicators of how successful he  has been as a judge. Out of nearly 2,700 cases, Judge Gorsuch has been  overruled only twice--98 percent of his opinions were unanimous,  further proving that he falls exactly square in the judicial  mainstream. He has received ``well qualified,'' as my Senator from  Arkansas just stated a few minutes ago, from the American Bar  Association, the highest rating available for a Supreme Court Justice.   Judge Gorsuch is also not new to the nomination process. Just a few  years ago, in 2006, Judge Gorsuch was unanimously confirmed by the U.S.  Senate to the Tenth Circuit.   Let me say that one more time because so seldom do we see the Senate  acting in a unanimous fashion. This, perhaps, is a moment of reflection  that Judge Gorsuch, in just 2006, received a unanimous vote for the  Tenth Circuit. Every single Democrat who was serving in the Senate at  that time voted in support of Neil Gorsuch, including 12 Members who  are still serving in this Chamber today. His bipartisan support has not  stopped there.   Senator Bennet from Colorado says that Judge Gorsuch represents the  best qualities of Colorado and that we need to fulfill our  responsibility to this nominee.   Senator Donnelly, from Indiana, has said: ``I believe he is a  qualified jurist who will base his decisions on his understanding of  the law and is well respected among his peers.''   From West Virginia, Senator Manchin acknowledged that, while he may  not agree with future decisions that will be made by Judge Gorsuch, he  also said, without question, that he has ``not found any reason why  this jurist should not be a Supreme Court Justice.''   Senator Heitkamp, from North Dakota, said, during her meeting with  our Supreme Court nominee, that Judge Gorsuch reinforced the importance  of a judiciary that remains independent from the executive and the  legislative branches of government.   Neal Katyal, the former Acting Solicitor General under President  Obama, said of Gorsuch that he is a first-rate intellect and a fair and  decent man. The judge's work reflects his dedication to the rule of  law.   Last month, throughout his 3-day confirmation hearing, Judge Gorsuch  provided detailed and thoughtful responses that should have answered  every concern from committee members. As I watched, I was incredibly  impressed with his depth of knowledge, his genuine demeanor, and his  obvious respect for the rule of law. He understands that his job is not  to make the law. Let me repeat that because this seems to be an unusual  experience--at least it has been for me--to hear that a judge  understands and appreciates that his job is not to make the law, that  his job is not to alter the law but, as he expressed time and again,  that he is committed to interpreting the law as it is written.   One of his most memorable comments from his hearing has left a  lasting impression on me, and I hope it does on you as well.   He said:         A judge who likes every result he reaches is very likely a       bad judge, reaching for results he prefers rather than those       the law compels.    In one sentence, Judge Gorsuch eloquently summarized what we should  expect from our Supreme Court Justices, and it also gives insight into  how he intends to serve once confirmed.   After his extensive and exhaustive hearing, we clearly see, beyond a  shadow of a doubt, that this man is more than qualified for the  appointment. Any argument to the contrary is based purely on political  opposition.   Today, the Senate stands on the verge of breaking historical  precedence. We have let political disagreements get in the way of a  judicial seat--a nomination that should stand far above political  rancor.   A year ago, Judge Gorsuch was serving on the U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Tenth Circuit. He had no idea that he would find himself in the  midst of a partisan battle. There is no question that this man has led  an exemplary life and deserves a fair vote.   We are, simply, asking for a fair vote--a vote. Let us move past  these political games and confirm a man who has earned this position,  with a nearly flawless record, as one of the brightest judicial minds  our country has to offer.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, just in the very few spaces that are left  after we finish chatting about our great State and the great season our  school had, there are two things I want to note. No. 1, Coach Frank  Martin: coach of the year, a fantastic person, a great communicator, a  strong, disciplined coach. It is very hard to misunderstand what he is  saying.   Coach Staley: Absolutely, positively, unequivocally the best women's  basketball coach, in my opinion, ever, against UCONN--ever. Dawn  Staley, 20 years ago, came within a single point of winning a national  championship as a player. Can you just imagine being a single point  short? And this must feel like redemption for our coach.   We are so proud of the fact that both of our coaches are producing  student athletes, learning academically, striving on courts but  prepared for life, for living. So we are excited about that.   I want to note as well that there have only been 10 times in NCAA  history--10 times--that both the women's and the men's basketball teams  from the same school were in the Final Four at the same time.   It is a good time to be a South Carolinian.    I am aware of that. And that is relevant to you how?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    What State are you from, sir?    In what part of Florida were you born and raised?    Have you had any relationship with the coach before,  Senator?    Having been there when you were in South Florida, I would  say we made a big contribution to you too.    Mr. President, if my colleague will yield, I would note  that Senator Graham did have clarity in his purpose of identifying the  fact that the State has only 4.7 million people in a country of 330  million people, and we have been able to secure the No. 1 golfer, that  is true; the No. 1 baseball team, that is true; and the No. 1 football  team in all of the Nation, Clemson University, that is true; and now  the women's basketball champions, and that is true as well. However, I  would point out that we were able to show you a wonderful experience as  well in the State of South Carolina, and I hope that one day when you  retire from politics, you and your lovely wife will join us and become  a South Carolinian yourself. Perhaps then, and only then, will you be a  successful football coach. You have a promising career in politics, but  I know that you love and have passion for football, and perhaps when  you retire, you too will be a national champion football coach.    I am serious----    Before Senator Rubio walks off the floor, having had the  opportunity to listen to him over a number of years, he is eloquent. He  is inspiring. Sometimes he is just dead wrong. Coach Martin will be  staying at the University of South Carolina, without any question at  all.   Let me put the suspicions to rest. The reality of it is that good  teams are made up of good recruiting. The fact that we have great  recruiters in the State of South Carolina is indicative of the fact  that we have a lot of titles in our State.   So I will be praying for the Senator's State to succeed during the  hurricane season, without any question, and to be consistently behind  the State of South Carolina in every athletic event in which we have a  competition, wherever there is a competition.    Rule XIX.    In a decade. Thank you.
