 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to support  this bipartisan resolution, which has been offered by our chairman   Mike McCaul and our ranking member  Greg Meeks.   I was born with an appreciation for the people of Jewish faith. My  birthplace of Charleston, South Carolina, at the time of the American  Revolution had the largest Jewish population in the New World who had  come here to escape oppression and to achieve freedom, which they  achieved in America.    I am grateful today to be the chairman of the Subcommittee on Middle  East, North Africa, and Central Africa and co-chairman of the Israel  Caucus.   Just 7 weeks ago today, I met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  who is so courageous and is serving there in Jerusalem.   I pledged then my support of Israel to defend itself from a nuclear  Iran, which also includes, of course, support of Israel from the  barbaric invasion of Hamas, the puppets of Iran who have conducted  murder, killing hundreds of persons, 1,200 at least, and even possibly  more that, indeed, are puppets of Iran to kill people in Israel.   Sadly, we are in a conflict we did not choose with dictators with  rule of gun invading democracies with rule of law.   On October 7, which is the Israeli equivalent of 9/11 and Pearl  Harbor, I was grateful to be attending the NATO Parliamentary Assembly  in Copenhagen, Denmark, where with Finland and Sweden, Western  civilization has never been more united to defend Ukraine, Israel, and  Taiwan.   America's resolve for Israel I saw firsthand on May 14, 2018, leading  a House delegation to fulfill President Donald Trump's opening of the  U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem with the extraordinary Ambassador David  Friedman.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues of both parties to support the  resolution.                                time  1600     Mr. Chairman, the Energy and Water  Appropriations bill is critical for national security, energy security,  and creating jobs.   I congratulate Chairman Chuck Fleischmann for his extraordinary  success in developing this legislation, which is so crucial to achieve  peace through strength. I respect but disagree with Ranking Member  Marcy Kaptur.   On passing H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, earlier this year,  House Republicans have shown dedication to lead in a way that will  secure America's energy independence. I am grateful for the strong  actions taken to lower costs for families through deregulation. Biden's  disastrous war on fossil fuels has helped war criminal Putin to finance  his mass murder in Ukraine.   Increasing domestic energy production is the best way to combat the  dangerous dependency on Chinese-made or -supplied electric vehicle  batteries and solar panels that further enrich the Chinese Communist  Party.   The green energy spending has been diverted into unsustainable  boondoggles wasting taxpayers' money.   I appreciate that this legislation supports critical missions at the  Savannah River Site, which I am grateful to represent. As the only  Member of Congress who ever worked at the Savannah River Site, I know  firsthand of its importance and dedicated personnel.   In South Carolina, nuclear energy has provided over 60 percent of the  energy matrix, and I am grateful to Governor Henry McMaster, a champion  for small modular reactors.   Mr. Chair, I urge passage of the bill.
