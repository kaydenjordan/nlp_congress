 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership in  passing the most historic climate legislation in the history of this  Nation and in the history of the world.   It is appropriate that it would be named after Chairman Yarmuth after  his distinguished service in this Congress.   But I also thank all the young people out there and the environmental  activists who for so long had no hope that this body would do anything.  They marched, they protested, and they organized. They deserve credit  for the $369 billion that will build solar, wind, and that will build  electric vehicles.   I understand it is only a down payment on what we need for climate. I  understand there is more work to be done, so we eliminate fossil fuel  subsidies, so we have more of a commitment to environmental justice,  and so that we don't have mandates on oil leasing. But I am so proud of  the young folks for recognizing that getting something done is better  than getting nothing done. This is the first victory in many victories  to come, and they deserve credit for our passing this bill today.
