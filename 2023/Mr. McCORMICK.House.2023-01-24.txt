 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defense of the Second  Amendment, which is, once again, under attack by the unelected Federal  bureaucrats in Washington.   The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives is seeking  to reclassify firearms with pistol braces as short-barreled rifles, a  classification which threatens to make criminals of tens of millions of  law-abiding Americans who have already purchased these.   The extra red tape, fees, and registrations that the ATF wants to  require is an unnecessary punishment for shooting enthusiasts who  purchased perfectly legal accessories to their legal firearms.   This follows a long pattern we have seen for decades in Washington's  antigun, unconstitutional policies, which could never make it through  Congress as a law that is imposed upon the public through the rule- making process.   Americans are tired of unelected Federal agencies spending their tax  dollars attacking and curtailing the constitutional rights of law- abiding citizens.                            ____________________
