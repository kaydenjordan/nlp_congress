 Mr. President, this week, the U.S. Senate acted,  unanimously, to honor our Nation's dedicated law enforcement officers,  firefighters, and emergency responders by passing the Public Safety  Officer Support Act, known as PSOSA.   I was proud to author the bipartisan Public Safety Officer Support  Act and want to thank Senator Cornyn and Senate Judiciary Committee  Chairman Durbin for their steadfast leadership and hard work in helping  pass this vital legislation that seeks to modernize the Public Safety  Officers' Benefits Program by recognizing that, when a public safety  officer dies by suicide, there should be a rebuttable presumption that  the loss should be designated as a line of duty death.   I look forward to President Joe Biden signing the bipartisan Public  Safety Officer Support Act into law and remain confident in the U.S.  Department of Justice's readiness to effectively implement this  important new law. My confidence is rooted in the Department's  productive engagement and helpful technical assistance that was  provided throughout the development of the final version of PSOSA.   Of course, the Public Safety Officer Support Act would never have  passed without the steadfast support and dedication of a wide range of  organizations, such as the Fraternal Order of Police, National  Association of Police Organizations, Federal Law Enforcement Officers  Association, Sergeants Benevolent Association NYPD, National  Association of Attorneys General, National District Attorneys  Association, Major County Sheriffs Association, National Sheriffs  Association, National Border Patrol Council, United States Capitol  Police Labor Committee, BLUE H.E.L.P., The Wounded Blue, American  Psychological Association, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention,  International Union of Police Associations, International Association  of Chiefs of Police, National Prison Council, National Narcotics  Officers Associations' Coalition, American Federation of State, County  and Municipal Employees, National Association for Children's Behavioral  Health, International Society for Psychiatric Nurses, Meadows Mental  Health Policy Institute, Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, SMART  Recovery, Kennedy Forum, Inseparable, National Council for Mental  Wellbeing, National Association for Rural Mental Health, American  Mental Health Counselors Association, National Association of Social  Workers, Postpartum Support International, National Association of  State and Mental Health Program Directors, American Association for  Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work, and the Association for  Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies.   This impressive array of support for PSOSA reflects the importance  and urgency of fixing a specific flaw in the Public Safety Officers'  Benefits Program. Under current law, despite public safety officers  facing a heightened risk for developing posttraumatic stress and having  trauma-induced suicides, family member survivors of police officers and  firefighters that commit suicide are excluded from the program. This  means that surviving families are often left without any Federal  support, State and local survivor annuities, or continued access to  their loved ones' health insurance.   Comparatively, the U.S. Armed Forces recognizes that servicemember  suicides are line-of-duty deaths. More than 90 percent of the 1,107  Active-Duty Army suicides between 2005 and 2012 were determined to be  in the line of duty. Just like our servicemembers, our first responders  should be recognized and supported for the mental distress they endure  while protecting our communities and responding to emergencies. That  includes supporting their surviving families after they are gone.   Once signed into law and implemented, the bipartisan Public Safety  Officer Support Act will finally provide grieving families the benefits  their loved ones earned while serving their communities as public  safety officers and, equally important, help us eliminate the harmful  stigma and infliction of emotional distress and pain on survivors that  stems from misguided and outdated policies that refuse to designate  public safety officer suicides as line of duty deaths.   Now, I want to be clear. Ensuring that public safety officer suicides  are considered line of duty deaths for purposes of participating in the  Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program is about honoring a fallen  police officer's or firefighter's life of service. It is about honoring  these Americans and caring for their families, just as we do when a  public safety officer dies from heart disease or COVID in the line of  duty.   Simply put, our bipartisan law will ensure surviving families of  fallen public safety officers receive the support their loved ones  earned through a life of service.   We are seeking to ensure eligibility for the Public Safety Officers'  Benefits Program no longer allows the manner of death to negate a  career devoted to public service and serving one's community. And that  is why it is also important to emphasize that a presumption of a line  of duty death is not an absolute.   Just as committing suicide should not deny a public safety officer  and their family a line-of-duty death designation, in and of itself,  taking one's life would not entitle a disgraced public safety officer  who violated their oath of office to receive a Public Safety Officers'  Benefits Program benefit.   It is our intent that the U.S. Department of Justice will review and  take into account the potential contributing factors to the officer or  firefighters' death or injury and consult the agency investigating the  cause and manner of death and the agency of the police officer or  firefighter, just as the Department's Bureau of Justice Assistance  Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program Office is empowered to do in  all other claims submitted to the program.   Moving forward, I hope enactment of the Public Safety Officer Support  Act inspires the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund and  other State and local law enforcement memorials to update their  respective line-of-duty death criteria to match the Public Safety  Officers' Benefits Program. After all, our Nation's support of first  responder families is particularly critical following the tragic loss  of a police officer, a firefighter, or an emergency responder, and  these grieving families deserve to be included among the families of  the fallen.   In closing, I want to take a moment to recognize the incredible  courage, resilience, and strength of the late Officer Jeffrey Smith's  widow, Erin Smith,  [[Page S3912]]  and his parents, Richard and Wendy Smith. Their collective  determination and commitment to fixing an unjust system to prevent  future families of the fallen from having to experience the emotional  pain and financial harm resulting from the denial of a line-of-duty  death designation, played a pivotal role in the development and passage  of the Public Safety Officer Support Act.   I commend Erin, Richard and Wendy Smith for honoring the service of  their loved one and hope that Officer Smith's lasting legacy of  spurring a long-needed change in the law provides them with comfort and  confidence that his tragic loss was not in vain.                            ____________________
