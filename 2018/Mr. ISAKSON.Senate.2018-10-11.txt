 Madam President, I want to acknowledge what Senator  Blunt just said about the success of this Congress over the last 2  years. It has been remarkable. What they did on FAA is tremendous. I  enjoyed working with them on that. But I want to rise and talk about  our veterans and what we have done for our veterans and what we need to  do for our veterans.   Before I do, my State of Georgia had a tough day and a tough night  last night. The hurricane hit about 10 o'clock last night.  Unfortunately, we lost one 11-year-old with a tree crashing through the  roof. The Governor has declared a state of emergency for 108 of our 159  counties. We have 1,500 National Guard troops activated and ready to  deploy if needed to help law enforcement, emergency medical, and  hospitals to see to it that we meet the needs of the people in our  State. There is a lot of search and rescue going on. We are blessed  that a lot of things didn't happen, but we were certainly hurt by those  that did.   For families who have lost property and families who need help, our  sympathy is with them, and we are taking action. GEMA and FEMA are  working hard. Governor Deal is working extremely hard. We have  recovered a couple of times already in the last 5 years from  hurricanes, and we will do it again. But on behalf of myself, Senator  Perdue, and the United States Senate,  [[Page S6781]]  I send our best wishes to our people back in Georgia and also to our  people in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Florida. Florida was hit  worse last night. But now the storm has passed Atlanta and is going  over South Carolina, and then North Carolina, which just came back from  almost the worst storm in history, in which we had 48 inches of  rainfall in one county. I couldn't believe that much water fell in one  day, but it did. They are recovering and doing it nicely. They have  done a good job. But all of us know these acts of nature and acts of  God we have gone through affect our citizens, and we need to keep them  safe. I urge all of our citizens in Georgia and in every State in the  Union to play close attention to what their Federal emergency  management people say. If they tell them to evacuate, they should. If  they tell them to hunker down, they should. They should do whatever  they can to follow the rules the best they can. Everybody we have to  rescue takes a law enforcement officer and a medical person out of play  to help somebody else.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture  motion for the Stewart nomination be withdrawn and the Senate vote on  confirmation of the Stewart nomination and, if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.  [[Page S6793]]     Mr. President, it is an honor to rise on behalf  of Senator David Perdue and myself to offer our congratulations on a  job well done to Joel Wernick, a fine Georgian and the longtime  president and chief executive officer of Phoebe Putney Health System in  Albany, GA.   Under Joel's tireless leadership for the last 30 years, Phoebe Putney  Health System has become a major regional healthcare provider. The  Phoebe Putney Health System now includes Phoebe Sumter Medical Center,  Phoebe Worth Medical Center, more than 15 primary and urgent care  clinics, and nearly 30 specialty care clinics in counties throughout  southwest Georgia.   As the health system has grown under Joel's guidance, it has become a  major contributor to the entire region's economy. Today more than 4,500  people work under the Phoebe Putney umbrella, where they strive to  improve the lives of Georgians from middle Georgia all the way south to  the Georgia-Florida line.   Joel Wernick had the vision to grow Phoebe Putney's suite of services  and provide comprehensive healthcare including world-class oncology,  cardiovascular, and neonatal intensive care unit services in the  southwest Georgia region. This increase in quality specialty services  greatly benefits area residents who no longer have to travel extensive  distances to receive care.   I also thank the board of directors and staff who have shared and  supported this great leader's dedication to the people of Albany and  the surrounding communities.   During Joel's tenure, Phoebe Putney has received State and national  recognition, including the American Hospital Association's NOVA Award  for teen pregnancy prevention and the prestigious Foster G. McGaw Prize  for excellence in healthcare. Joel was a pioneer in making ``upstream  contributions'' in community health programs over the years to reduce  the cost and occurrence of disease and poor health before they reached  the hospital setting.   In starting the Phoebe Family Medicine Residency Program, Joel has  also appreciated the importance of healthcare for the family unit and  the importance of training medical professionals in southwest Georgia  and incentivizing them to remain there. Phoebe Putney's teaching  hospital has graduated more than 120 residents, and Joel's investment  in Flaggstone, the housing that supports those residents and pharmacy  students, has successfully kept doctors practicing in southwest Georgia  rather than departing for larger cities.   Joel has helped keep the ``golden rule'' culture and the charm of  south Georgia as guiding principles during his tenure at Phoebe Putney,  and for that, many have benefited and are grateful.   As Georgia's Senators, we are thankful for Joel's service and wish  him well as he enters the next chapter of his life. May God bless him  in his future pursuits.                            ____________________
