 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  2825, the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act.   America faces mounting threats to our national security from around  the globe. This includes the increased threats faced by Islamist  terrorism, foreign cyber attacks, and an unsecured southern border.   This bill will improve the Department of Homeland Security by making  it more efficient and improving its processes so that the DHS can face  security threats head on.   This bill promotes the domestic sharing of counterterrorism  information and calls for regular reports to Congress on cost-saving  and efficiency activities, including consolidation of facilities and  response to operational surges.   I believe this bill is vital to ensuring America's continued safety.
