 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, since we began this process several months ago, I have  met with experts, my colleagues, and, most importantly, the survivors  of sexual harassment and assault. Their insight has informed this  legislation today.   By passing this proposal, Congress will take a much-needed first step  in changing how we do business:   We eliminate counseling;   We eliminate the cooling off period;   We make mediation optional;   We change the system so that we protect the victim and not the  perpetrator;   We require more transparency with regular reporting that has  meaningful information;   We change the confidentiality rule so that the victim decides what to  talk about and when; and   We hold Members accountable for their behavior by referring every  case to the Ethics Committee.   This is long overdue.   There is one person who has been championing this work her entire  career, the gentlewoman from California, Representative Jackie Speier,  and I thank her. Without her, we would not be here. Representative  Speier's leadership and persistence are the main reasons we are so  close to getting this done, and the entire Congress should be grateful  for her work.   It is because of the leadership of the chairman that we are here on  the floor today. As he has his entire 10 years on the committee, he has  been focused on working together in a bipartisan way where we can  agree. Because of that commitment, he will certainly be remembered as  one of the most consequential chairmen of this committee. I thank him,  and I cherish his friendship.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier), and, again, the main reason  we are on the floor today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from  California an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), our Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin), a valued member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).   (Ms. NORTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend her  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is an important day for the House of  Representatives. Republicans and Democrats from all different parts of  the country have come together to make meaningful change in how  Congress operates.   As I conclude, I would like to thank the staff that worked so hard on  this, especially Kim Betz, Molly Fishman, and Miriam Goldstein; and  members of my staff, Teri Morgan and Jamie Fleet, my staff director.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Harper for his leadership, and I urge  my colleagues to support this legislation before us now.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution continues the work we started and the  legislation we just considered. It makes much-needed improvements to  how the House operates.   It requires every office to have an antiharassment and  antidiscrimination policy. It provides legal counsel for our House  employees who need assistance in fighting harassment in their offices.  It strengthens our Code of Conduct, the ethics rules we live by, to  make clear that this kind of behavior will not be tolerated, and it  bans the use of the MRA for paying settlements.   I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.   Again, I would like to thank my chairman for his cooperation. As  always, we work together. As you can see, when we work together, we get  things done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
