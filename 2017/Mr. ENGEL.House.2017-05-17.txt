 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. Let me start by  thanking the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), my good friend and  neighbor, the ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations.   I also want to thank Chairman Royce for his steadfast support in  bringing this bill to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, it is so shocking and so heartbreaking to me that, in  the year 2017, we wake up day after day to read about anti-Semitic  vandalism and violence, anti-Semitic slurs on Munich buses, Russian so- called law makers pedaling anti-Semite conspiracy theories, horrific  murders in a kosher market in Paris 2 years ago. Of course, Mr.  Speaker, here in our own country, bomb threats to Jewish community  centers, desecration of cemeteries. Actually, I can hardly believe it.   We know this ancient hatred has never been extinguished. It has  always found some dark corner in which to fester until some new group  on the fringe tries to pull it back into the mainstream. I fear we are  seeing that sort of resurgence right now.   When we hear these toxic ideas emanating from major political parties  and governing bodies in Europe, we know it is time for action. It needs  to be stopped, and this bill will help.   This legislation builds on the 1998 International Religious Freedom  Act, which established annual reporting on religious freedom worldwide,  as well as the 2004 Global Anti-Semitism Review Act, which required the  State Department to report every year on anti-Semitism around the  world.   This measure calls for continued and enhanced reporting on anti- Semitic incidents in Europe. We want to focus on what has been a hotbed  of anti-Semitism in recent years so that no active anti-Semitic hatred  goes unnoticed.   This bill also expresses our view in Congress that it is in our  country's interest to combat anti-Semitism here and abroad; that it is  critical to ensure the safety of European Jewish communities; that  multilateral organizations like the U.N. and OSCE have an important  role to play in combating anti-Semitism; that we should continue to  report anti-Semitic acts worldwide; and that our allies should follow  our lead and document anti-Semitic acts when they take place so we can  share our findings amongst ourselves.    We also call on the State Department to adopt the working definition  of anti-Semitism used by the International Holocaust Remembrance  Alliance, because words do matter when it comes to the way we talk  about this challenge.   It is absolutely amazing that 70-some-odd years after World War II  ended--and that decade culminated in  [[Page H4277]]  the murder of 6 million Jews in Europe in the Holocaust, men, women,  and children--it is absolutely unbelievable that 70 years later you  would see anti-Semitism in the same places in Europe rear its ugly head  by stupid people who don't know what they are saying or doing. It is  just amazing. You think there would be some kind of sensitivity about  the Holocaust and about all the innocent people who were murdered for  just the one reason that they were Jewish, and yet you see no-nothings,  as far as I am concerned, popping up again with their anti-Semitic  hatred. It is bad wherever it goes, but it is especially repugnant to  have it in Europe, the site of the murder of 6 million Jewish people.   I am very grateful to Representative Lowey for her hard work on this  bill. I am pleased to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New  York (Mrs. Lowey), my good friend, my fellow New Yorker, the author of  this bill, and the ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  close.  [[Page H4278]]    Let me first say, I agree with all the eloquent statements made by my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle pertaining to this bill.   I want to thank Mrs. Lowey, again, because it is a really important  bill. It is really important that we don't sweep this under the rug. It  is really important that we don't try to hide it or sugarcoat it.  Whether it happens here, whether it happens in Europe, no matter where  it happens, any form of anti-Semitism, any form of hatred of one group  toward another needs to be roundly condemned and stopped. That is what  we are trying to do here.   It hasn't even been a century since we heard this canary in the coal  mine: political parties scapegoating Jews; insidious campaigns that  question the humanity of Jewish populations or their legitimacy as  members of certain societies; governments, popularly elected  governments, saying that it was okay to hate.   We don't think it is okay to hate. That is why we are doing this.  What we hear today is unnerving in light of that history.   Mr. Speaker, we know what happened when too few good people stood up  and spoke out. We cannot allow that history to repeat. We must do  whatever it takes to ensure that it doesn't.   This bill will help us address a part of this growing concern. It  will shine a bright light on the resurgence of anti-Semitism in Europe.  It is just a piece of the puzzle, but it is a good start.   I am proud to stand with my colleagues today to support this measure.  I urge all Members to do the same.   I thank the others on this side of the aisle and the other side of  the aisle who have spoken on this, especially Chairman Royce.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure.   Let me start by thanking the chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee, Ed Royce, from California. I am also especially grateful to  another colleague from California, Norma Torres, a valuable member of  the Foreign Affairs Committee, for authoring this bipartisan  resolution, and also for her leadership as the founding co-chair of the  Central America Caucus.   Mr. Speaker, when a child from El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras  arrives at our southern border, he or she didn't get there because it  was an easy journey. It was because poverty, crime, or lack of  opportunity at home left that child no option but to face that long,  dangerous trek. No child anywhere should be forced to make that  heartbreaking choice.   The best way to ensure that this doesn't happen is not to build a  wall or isolate ourselves from our neighbors. It is to stop children  from having to make that journey in the first place. It is by making  long-term, strategic investments in a more secure and prosperous  Central America.   Over the last 2 years, Democrats and Republicans in Congress have  come together to do just that. We made a bold, new foreign assistance  commitment to Central America that helps address the root causes of  child migration from the region.   A big part of this effort is supporting those individuals who are  working day in and day out to root out corruption in Central America:  the attorneys general in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras; the  heads of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala;  and the Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in  Honduras.   These brave individuals put their lives on the line on a daily basis.  This resolution that we are voting on signals that the United States  agrees with them and has their backs.   To Guatemala's Attorney General Thelma Aldana, Honduran Attorney  General Oscar Chinchilla, Salvadoran Attorney General Douglas Melendez,  CICIG Commissioner Ivan Velasquez, and MACCIH Chief of Mission Juan  Jimenez: Today we come to the floor of the House of Representatives to  say thank you and to proclaim that we stand with you and your  institutions in the fight against corruption.   This measure sends a strong message that our Congress, which has the  ultimate say over funding for Central America, stands with those who  are committed to putting an end to corruption in El Salvador,  Guatemala, and Honduras.   We may have a new President in the White House and a new Secretary of  State at Foggy Bottom, but Congress continues to have the power of the  purse; and Democrats and Republicans, alike, believe that continued  international support for the attorneys general and CICIG and MACCIH is  key to the continued success of the Alliance for Prosperity in the  Northern Triangle.   In December, I led a letter to the attorneys general from El  Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, along with Representative Ros- Lehtinen and several other members of the Foreign Affairs Committee,  commending their efforts, pledging our ongoing support, and, most  importantly, noting how crucial it is that they be able to carry out  their work free from any interference from political leaders in their  countries. With passage of H. Res. 145, the entire House of  Representatives can and will send that same message.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 4 minutes to  the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres), the author of this  resolution, a leader on Central American issues, and a valued member of  the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me say that, as a father, I cannot imagine being faced with the  choice of letting my children risk violence or death from criminal  gangs or malnutrition, or taking a dangerous journey hundreds of miles  on their own. No parent or child should ever be forced to make this  choice. Unfortunately, far too many families in El Salvador, Guatemala,  and Honduras must do so on a daily basis.   The good news is that our Congress has decided to make a much-needed,  long-term investment in Central America. At the core of these efforts  is our commitment to support institutions and individuals that are  rooting out corruption.   H. Res. 145 makes it clear that our continued investment in Central  America will depend on support for anticorruption efforts from the  Salvadoran, Guatemalan, and Honduran Governments.   Let me finally note that I am heartened that the fight against  corruption in the hemisphere is not just limited to Central America.  From Brazil to Chile to the Caribbean, the citizens of the Americas  have finally had enough and have vowed to put an end to corruption once  and for all. The least that our Congress can do is support these  valiant efforts.   I again thank Chairman Royce for working so well with me, putting our  heads together over time, and passing good resolutions and legislation  like this.   I again thank Congresswoman Torres for introducing this crucial  resolution and for her hard work on it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support its passage, and I yield  back the balance of my time.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation,  and I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am very grateful that the House is considering my bill  today, the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act.   I want to thank my friend, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee, Ed Royce, for joining as the lead Republican cosponsor of  this measure. I am proud that we are bringing it up to the floor with  108 cosponsors, Members from both sides of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, every week, more and more bad news pours in about the  civil war in Syria. I am grateful to Chairman Royce for making the  comments he just made because my heart has been bleeding for Syria, or  crying out for Syria, for 4 or 5 years now, ever since, as Mr. Royce  said, there were peaceful demonstrations and they were mowed down by  the Assad regime.   The United States didn't do much. We sort of watched and retreated  and perhaps were afraid that we would be bogged down in another war.  But we should have, at that point, in my estimation, helped the free  Syria Army, which begged us for help, not people, not troops, but help,  and we didn't do it. We didn't give it to them.   We thought that Assad would fall on his own, ultimately, but he  didn't, and we are bearing the price today. We are paying the price  today. The people of Syria, unfortunately, are the ones paying the  price. Millions of people have died and have been misplaced and just  the horrors of war and the horrors of civilians. So my heart really  bleeds for the Syrian people.   This week, it was the revelation of a crematorium, a furnace where  the criminals who do Assad's bidding can pile the bodies and try to  burn away the evidence of their atrocities.   Also this week, Russia announced that they will work with Iran, Iraq,  and Assad to open a secure road from Baghdad to Damascus. What that  really means, Mr. Speaker, is a road from Beirut to Tehran in Iran, a  permanent Iranian foothold right in the Middle East, a permanent  Iranian foothold right on Israel's border, a permanent Iranian foothold  to do mischief and the usual nefarious things that the Iranian  Government does.   This crisis has been burning out of control for six long years. I was  an early vocal supporter, as I mentioned before, of arming the moderate  Syrian opposition. I thought we should have done much more to help push  Assad out of power and help the Syrian people chart the course for  their country's future. When we didn't, I spoke out.   Since then, Assad has plowed ahead with his campaign of carnage. The  few times he appeared to be taking on water, he was given a lifeline by  his devoted enablers, Russia and Iran, through its terrorist proxy,  Hezbollah. Every time Assad seemed to be losing, he was given a  lifeline and, as I just mentioned, by Hezbollah, also given a lifeline  by the Russians who came in.   So while it was suspected in the highest annals of Washington that  Assad wouldn't last more than a few months, no one would have imagined  that 4 and 5 years later there would be Assad winning the war, again,  with the help of Russia, Iran, and their terrorist proxy.   It is a disgrace, Mr. Speaker, and we need to act out. We need to  help.   Today, we find ourselves no closer to a solution, and 4 months into  the new administration, we have yet to hear a strategy for dealing with  Syria. The Tomahawk missile strike last month was an appropriate  response to the chemical weapons attack, although I believe the  administration's policy shift, with respect to Assad, emboldened Assad  to launch that attack, and a single missile strike is not a strategy.   We need a plan to stop the violence, push a political transition that  sees the end of Assad's rule and helps the Syrian people recover and  move forward. My bill, this bill, would be part of that strategy.                                time  1715    It is named, as Mr. Royce pointed out, for Caesar, a former Syrian  Government photographer. Fed up with documenting the brutality of the  Assad regime, he defected and escaped so he could show the world  exactly what was happening to the regime's victims.   I will never forget the images he showed us when he came to the  Foreign Affairs Committee. Those images are still seared in my brain  and I will never forget them; the depth of brutality and indifference  to human life.   We have named this bill after him because we want to send a message.  If you are supporting this murder, if you are enabling the butcher in  Damascus to continue waging that sort of violence against his own  people, you are going to face consequences.   This bill would sanction anyone who provides material support for the  Assad regime. We want to go after the actual hardware that keeps his  war machine running, the planes and bombs that terrorize the Syrian  people, and the spare parts and oil that keep everything running. If  you do business with Assad, the blood of the Syrian people is on your  hands and you are going to get caught up in these sanction. Yes, that  means Iran and Russia.   If conditions on the ground change and negotiations were in sight, it  might be useful to dial back these sanctions in order to help end the  violence. So we have built in some degree of flexibility. The measures  are tough, but we all want them to be a roadblock to peace.   This bill also seeks to provide some relief to the Syrian people who  are now suffering terribly. It would improve oversight of assistance  flowing into Syria and evaluate the feasibility of a no-fly zone.   We also need to think about what must happen after the violence has  ended, about who must be held accountable. So this bill requires  reporting on human rights violators, and would support efforts to  gather evidence of crimes against humanity. This bill isn't a silver  bullet. It isn't a strategy for resolving the crisis in Syria.   Congress can do a lot, though, when it comes to foreign policy. We  can give an administration tools and resources, but it is up to the  White House to lead on this issue. If the first step in a serious  strategy is stopping the violence--and I think it is--this legislation  can help dial up pressure on those driving the war.   So I continue to push ahead; Mr. Royce at my side, and I am grateful  to my colleagues for their support. I am grateful to the Foreign  Affairs Committee for moving this swiftly.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 4 minutes to  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished Democratic  whip, someone who I know, through our meetings, feels so strongly about  this and feels as we do.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Caesar Syria  Civilian Protection Act of 2017.   Since 2011, the Assad regime's forces have killed an estimated  500,000 people, mostly civilians, by unconscionably targeting and  attacking major population centers. According to Human Rights Watch,  last month, the Syrian regime used a nerve agent in northwest Syria  that killed at least 92 people, including 30 children.   Even more heartbreaking is the fact that this was not the first  chemical weapons attack by the Syrian Government against its own  people. To the contrary, reports suggest that the Assad regime's use of  chemical weapons has become ``widespread and systematic,'' and it has  dropped bombs with nerve agents on at least four other occasions since  December 12.   Just yesterday, our own State Department revealed that the Syrian  regime is actively using a large crematorium to dispose of the remains  of thousands of Syrian men, women, and children, whom they continue to  slaughter.   Not only has the Syrian Government become a source of such crimes  against humanity, but Syria has also indisputably become a hotbed for  terrorist activity, propped up by Iran, Russia, and Hezbollah. Both  ISIS and al-Qaida are operating near the Syria-Israel border, putting  the Jewish State of Israel and our regional security in grave danger.   As a mother and a Jew, I cannot turn my cheek to this unadulterated  evil. As a Member of the United States Congress, I have a duty to keep  the American people safe and hold the Assad regime accountable for its  war crimes and brutality. That is why I strongly support this critical  legislation, and I thank Ranking Member Engel for all of his hard work  in sponsoring it.   This bipartisan legislation would expand sanctions on those  individuals who commit such monstrous acts of violence and inflict such  extreme suffering upon innocent Syrians. It would ensure that the  United States has the tools it needs to reach its ultimate goal of  ending the Assad regime's campaign of carnage once and for all.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard both sides simply agree. This is as  bipartisan as you can get. It is as unanimous, hopefully, as you can  get.   Six years into the Syrian civil war, with hundreds of thousands dead  and millions more driven from their homes, we cannot waste time looking  backward or just simply placing blame. We need to face the reality of  this crisis today and do all we can to forge a new strategy to deal  with it.   Three, four, five years ago, no one would have imagined that Assad  would still be clinging to power over more and more deaths of his own  people. We need to find a way to push for an end to the violence and  bring about a political resolution that gets Assad out of power. By the  way, that is going to be harder to do because the Russians and  Ukrainians are really backing him.   Let's allow the Syrian people to start their long journey forward.  This legislation will help us meet that challenge. It will impose a new  cost on those who so far have aided the Assad regime with impunity. It  will apply new pressure to the regime, which relies on the patronage of  its enablers in Moscow. It will signal to the Syrian people that we  share a vision of a future in which they make the decisions and Assad  has no role.   The bill passed the House unanimously a year ago. I am hopeful we  will soon pass it in a little while again overwhelmingly. I urge the  other body to act on it without delay so we can get it to the  President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
