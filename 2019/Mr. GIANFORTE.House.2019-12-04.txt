 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oregon for his  leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill. Robocalls are not  only a nuisance, they are a threat to honest, hardworking Montanans.  Illegal robocalls seek to exploit them and steal their personal,  private information and their money.   Montanans hate robocalls. It is time to put an end to the stories I  hear too often from Montanans about illegal robocalls.   Today, we are taking a huge step forward, providing relief from  robocalls with the Pallone-Thune TRACED Act. It gives consumers tools  to block illegal robocalls at no cost. It also holds illegal  robocallers accountable for their scams, including higher fines and  more prison time. This bill includes language from my bipartisan bill  that helps identify and prosecute illegal robocall companies.   I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this bill and providing  the American people with needed relief from robocalls.
