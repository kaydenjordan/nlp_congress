 Mr. Speaker, for our friends and allies in Israel, the  Abraham Accords are the first agreement with a neighboring Arab country  since 1994. Peace agreements between Israel, Bahrain, and the United  Arab Emirates bring a significant shift in the balance of power in the  Middle East, and strengthens the American position against Iran, which  is a leading sponsor of terror in the world.   Thanks to President Trump's bold vision for American foreign policy,  we have rebuilt trust with our regional partners and show a united  front against the oppressive regime in Tehran.   After decades of division in the Middle East, the Abraham Accords  will lay the foundation for peace and prosperity in the region for  decades to come. Normalized relations across the region will accelerate  growth by expanding diplomatic, economic, and financial ties.   Mr. Speaker, there is much to be optimistic about, these recent  historic Abraham Accords will bring a new wave of peace and prosperity  in the Middle East.                            ____________________
