 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this Federal  takeover of elections.   I am disappointed that the underlying bill has been gutted, a bill  that was crafted in a bipartisan, practical way to address the surplus  resources at NASA to generate resources for the agency.   I would say this to my friends in the majority: I have served in the  minority and the majority several times back and forth. I ask you, why  are you trying so hard to make me a chairman again?   We pass a bill today to allow another body to pontificate. They will  not be able to pass anything. You will inflame your base because you  can't do anything. You will inflame my base because you are trying to  make dramatic changes. Why are you trying to make it so easy for me to  be a chairman again?   I guess I should thank you, and I would, except for things like this  missed opportunity to reauthorize this important piece of legislation  for NASA.   When we have committees like Science, Space, and Technology that work  together, that work in a productive way, that can persuade the majority  of this body to pass their legislation, we should allow the legislative  process to work.   Thank you, my friends. I look forward to the next session.
