 Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment. I understand it will be on a voice vote. This exemption,  just like the amendment that will follow, is so broad as to render the  underlying resolution impotent.   Let's be clear. The existing conflict the United States is supporting  is the primary cause of the humanitarian catastrophe that exists today.  Eighty-five thousand kids under the age of 5 have died of starvation  and disease. This is the world's worst cholera epidemic in the history  of the globe. If we were to adopt this amendment, it could potentially  allow for continued unlimited assistance for the Saudi coalition to  continue to exacerbate that nightmare.   I urge my colleagues, on a voice vote, to oppose this amendment.    Mr. President, once again, I urge rejection of this  amendment. If passed, it would, again, render the underlying resolution  a moot point.   I would make two additional arguments against it: First, the entire  rationale that the Saudis used for the military campaign in Yemen is to  prevent Houthi attacks against Saudi Arabia. So if this was an  exemption, then the United States could fully participate. Second,  existing law already allows the U.S. Commander in Chief to protect U.S.  troops against an attack or an imminent attack, and nothing in the  resolution would take away the Commander in Chief's power to protect  U.S. troops either here in the United States or abroad.   For those reasons, I would strongly oppose--that we object to this  amendment which, if passed, would essentially gut the underlying  resolution.
