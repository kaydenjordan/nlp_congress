 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this critical  appropriations bill to ensure that our military has the resources they  need to protect us abroad and that our law enforcement agencies have  the resources they need to protect us here at home.   This legislation makes sure that the U.S. Attorneys, DEA, ATF, U.S.  Marshals Service, and the FBI are getting the money they need to make  our communities safer by investigating and prosecuting more gun and  immigration criminals, human traffickers, dealers in opioids and other  dangerous drugs, international criminal organizations, and gangs. This  bill will make this Nation safer and help secure our borders.   This bill will also provide funds for over 100 additional immigration  judge teams to speed up their removal of people who are in the country  illegally.   The bill provides new resources for State and local law enforcement,  Mr. Speaker, including a $300 million increase in grants to help  address the terrible opioid epidemic in this country, and increases to  help protect women against violence, protect our schools and ensure the  safety of our children, relieve the backlog of sexual assault kits,  fight human trafficking, and help compensate States for housing illegal  aliens in their prisons and jails.   The American space program is the best on Earth, and this legislation  ensures it will continue to be the best on Earth, with funding for our  human and planetary space program. In fact, the journal, Science, today  reports that this legislation has given a major boost to science across  the board. We have made sure the National Science Foundation preserves  its competitive edge with a $300 million increase for research grants.  These funds will foster innovation and U.S. economic competitive,  including funding for research on advanced manufacturing, physics,  mathematics, cybersecurity, and neuroscience.   Mr. Speaker, this bill deserves the support of all Members, and I  urge a ``yes'' vote.
