 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize June as National Dairy Month.   As Republican leader of the House Agriculture Committee, I am proud  to be a descendant of a long line of dairy farmers. In fact,  Pennsylvania is one of the largest milk-producing States in the Nation.  We are home to more than 474,000 cows.   National Dairy Month began as National Milk Month in 1937. Now, it  has developed into an annual tradition that celebrates the  contributions the dairy industry has made to the world. From calcium to  potassium, dairy products like milk contain 13 essential nutrients,  which may help to better manage your weight, reduce your risk for high  blood pressure, osteoporosis, and certain cancers.   Yet, for too long, dairy products like milk have been unfairly  demonized. Not only does it hurt our dairy industry, but it has also  resulted in the loss of nearly an entire generation of milk drinkers.  Kids have been cheated out of the nutrition that they need.   Madam Speaker, whether it is protein to help build and repair the  muscle tissue of active bodies or vitamin A to help maintain healthy  skin, dairy products are a natural nutrient powerhouse. Those are just  a few reasons we should celebrate dairy, not just in June but every day  all year long.   Happy National Dairy Month.                            ____________________
