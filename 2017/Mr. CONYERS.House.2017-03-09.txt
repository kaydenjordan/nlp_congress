 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 8, line 25, insert after ``Civil Procedure.'' the       following (and amend the amendment to the table of contents       on page 9 after line 3 accordingly):       ``Sec. 1724. Applicability         ``Sections 1716 through 1723 shall not apply in the case of       any civil action alleging a violation of a civil right.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 180, the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, which  would exempt H.R. 985's unnecessary and burdensome class action  provisions all class actions asserting civil rights claims.   Class actions are an important litigation tool that consumers,  workers, and anyone else who has suffered injury can use to vindicate  their rights. They are also a critical mechanism for enforcing public  policy and are especially key in the enforcement of Federal civil  rights laws.   For instance, plaintiffs in employment discrimination cases who seek  backpay because of an adverse employment decision often pursue class  actions because such cases tend to be the kind that are well-suited for  class treatment. These cases typically concern multiple victims who  were subjected to the same discriminatory employment practice or  policy.   While damages awarded pursuant to a single plaintiff may not be large  enough to deter the employer's alleged wrongdoing, aggregate damages  awarded to plaintiffs as a result of class action would have a  deterrent effect.   Unfortunately, this bill, H.R. 985, requires class action plaintiffs  to prove at the certification stage that every potential class member  suffered the same type and same scope of injury, a requirement that is  obviously virtually impossible and cost prohibitive to meet.   This onerous requirement would effectively deter employment  discrimination and other civil rights plaintiffs from proceeding with  any class action.   As if this provision were not onerous enough, H.R. 985 would also  harm civil rights plaintiffs by making it virtually impossible to  pursue class actions pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4) of the Federal Rules of  Civil Procedure.   All Federal appeals courts interpret that provision as allowing  courts to certify a class limited to one issue in a case, such as  liability, without having to certify a putative class for the entire  cause of action.   Allowing courts to decide common questions within a case, while  permitting other issues to be determined on an individual basis, would  promote judicial efficiency, which is also one of the principal  benefits of class actions.   H.R. 985, however, would prohibit certification of such ``issue''  class actions unless the putative class for the entire cause of action  is certified, which would only further delay and possibly deny justice  for plaintiffs.   This provision would have a particularly devastating impact on civil  rights class actions that often can only be maintained as to particular  issues, such as liability.   Indeed, for these, and many other reasons, including the bill's  mandatory appeals provision, its automatic stay of discovery, and its  draconian and unworkable standards for setting attorneys' fees, 123  civil rights groups and organizations have written a letter to the  Judiciary Committee in strong opposition to H.R. 985, which I include  in the Record.  [[Page H1989]]                                                      March 7, 2017.      Re Strong Opposition to H.R. 985--Section 2.       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: We understand that the       House will soon consider H.R. 985, the ``Fairness in Class       Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency       Act of 2015.'' The 123 signatory civil rights organizations       and advocates write to strongly oppose Section 2 of H.R. 985.       The bill will undermine the enforcement of this nation's       civil rights laws and upend decades of settled class action       law. This sweeping and poorly drafted legislation will create       needless chaos in the courts without actually solving any       demonstrated problem. In this letter, we highlight the most       egregious of its many harms.        As advocates for the marginalized and often invisible       members of our society, we write to remind House members that       class actions are critical for the enforcement of laws       prohibiting discrimination in employment, housing, education,       and access to public areas and services. As the Supreme Court       has recognized, class actions provide ``vindication of the       rights of groups of people who individually would be without       effective strength to bring their opponents into court at       all.'' Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 617       (1997). Courts have interpreted Rule 23 of the Federal Rules       of Civil Procedure, the federal class action rule, over       decades and the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules has,       through its deliberative process, reviewed and amended the       rule to ensure its fair and efficient operation. No further       revisions are needed at this time.       H.R. 985 Adds Years of Additional Delay, Expense, and Disruption         One of the stated purposes of the bill is to ``assure . . .       prompt recoveries,'' yet it includes provisions that will       extend the duration of cases by years and add exponentially       to the expense on both sides.        The bill allows for an automatic appeal--in the middle of       every case--of the class certification order. Such appeals       are extraordinarily disruptive and typically add one to three       years to the life of the case. While the case sits in an       appellate court, expenses and fees rise, memories fade, and       injured victims remain without justice. Automatic appeals of       all class certification orders will clog our already-taxed       Courts of Appeals. Appeals of class certification rulings are       already permitted at the discretion of the Courts of Appeals.       An appeal of every class certification ruling is unnecessary.        The bill similarly builds in an automatic stay of discovery       in the district court whenever an alleged wrongdoer files any       one of a list of motions. This is an invitation for       gamesmanship and delay, and will deprive judges of the       ability to properly manage their cases.        The bill, by its terms, applies to all cases pending upon       the date of enactment. This means that hundreds of cases that       have been litigated and certified under existing law would       start from scratch with new standards, new class       certification motions, and new automatic interlocutory       appeals. The resulting waste of judicial resources would be       enormous.    Civil Rights Injuries Are Never Identical and Are Already Subject to                          Rigorous Judicial Review         H.R. 985 imposes a new and impossible hurdle for class       certification. It requires that the proponents of the class       demonstrate that ``each class member has suffered the same       type and scope of injury.'' At this early stage of a civil       rights class action, it is frequently impossible to identify       all of the victims or the precise nature of each of their       injuries.        But even if this information were knowable, class members'       injuries would not be ``the same.'' As a simple example,       those overcharged for rent will have different injuries. In       an employment discrimination class action, the extent of a       class member's injuries will depend on a range of factors,       including their job position, tenure, employment status,       salary, and length of exposure to the discriminatory       conditions. For this reason, nearly forty years ago, the       Supreme Court developed a two-stage process for such cases in       International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. U.S., 431 U.S. 324,       371-72 (1977). In the first stage, the court determines       whether the employer engaged in a pattern or practice of       discrimination. If the employer is found liable, the court       holds individual hearings to determine the relief (if any)       for each victim. The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed the       use of the Teamsters model for discrimination class actions       in part because of the individualized nature of injuries.       Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 366 (2011).       Thus, this bill would overturn the approach established four       decades ago to permit a class of victims of discrimination to       seek effective relief.        For the same reason, the bill's limitation on ``issue       classes'' will impede the enforcement of civil rights laws.       Under current practice, the district court will decide in       some cases that the best approach is to resolve the       illegality of a discriminatory practice in an initial       proceeding, and then allow class members to pursue individual       remedies on their own. In such cases, class certification for       the core question of liability (often a complex proceeding)       will be tried and resolved just once for the benefit of the       many affected individuals. These issue classes can promote       both efficiency and fairness. Section 1720, however, would       deprive courts of this ability that they currently have to       manage class actions to ensure justice.      Requiring the Early Identification of Class Members Is Unnecessary         Section 1718 seeks to impose a heightened standard for       identifying class members, an approach that has been rejected       by the majority of circuits to have considered the question.       This stringent standard would not further any interest that       is not already adequately protected by Rule 23, which       requires that the court consider whether the case is       manageable and the class action device is the ``superior''       method for fairly and efficiently resolving the case.        Moreover, Sec. 1718 would impose a nearly insurmountable       hurdle in situations where a class action is the only viable       way to pursue valid but low-value claims. In such cases,       records of who has been affected may have been destroyed by       the wrongdoer, may be incomplete, or may have never existed       at all. In those cases, individual notice to all class       members may be impossible. But, without class certification       in these situations, class members who have valid claims and       who can be identified would not be allowed to recover. The       bill also ignores the important objective of deterring and       punishing wrongdoing, and encourages defendants not to       maintain relevant records.   Arbitrary and Unworkable Standards for Attorneys' Fees Undermine Civil                             Rights Enforcement         Civil rights class actions are often about systemic reforms       that benefit the most vulnerable. In many cases, the sole       remedy is an injunction to change illegal laws or practices.       To ensure that non-profit legal organizations and other       advocates are able to undertake these important, complex, and       often risky cases, dozens of our civil rights laws       incorporate fee-shifting provisions. If a case is successful,       the judge awards a reasonable fee based upon the time that       the advocates have spent working on the case. This method of       determining attorneys' fees provides for consistent and       predictable outcomes, which is a benefit to all parties in a       lawsuit.        H.R. 985 would entirely displace this well-settled law with       a standard long ago rejected as arbitrary and unworkable.       Under the bill, attorneys' fees would be calculated as a       ``percentage of the value of the equitable relief.''       Sec. 1718(b)(3). But how is a judge to determine the cash       value of an integrated school, a well-operating foster care       system, the deinstitutionalization of individuals with       disabilities, or myriad other forms of equitable relief       secured by civil rights class actions? Asking judges to       assign a price tag in such cases is an impossible task and       would lead to uncertainty and inconsistency.        Non-profit organizations cannot bear the risk of these long       and expensive cases if, at the end, their fees are calculated       under this incoherent and capricious standard. Indeed, the       bill creates an incentive for defendants to prolong the       litigation so as to make it economically impossible for       plaintiffs' attorneys to continue to prosecute the       litigation.        These serious issues warrant, at a minimum, careful       consideration and public hearings. A rush to pass such far-      reaching and flawed legislation will deny access to justice       for many and undermine the rule of law.

Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan  will be postponed.                  Amendment No. 7 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7  printed in part B of House Report 115-29.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:   [[Page H1991]]              Beginning on page 13, strike line 19 and all that follows       through line 15 on page 14, and insert the following:        ``(8) A trust described in paragraph (2) shall file with       the bankruptcy court, not later than 60 days after the end of       every quarter, a report that shall be made available on the       court's public docket and with respect to each such reporting       period contains an aggregate list of demands received and an       aggregate list of payments made.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 180, the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I think the question is: Is there any  collegiality and respect for the Federal judicial system?   Let me read a letter in reference to the underlying bill:         We strongly urge Congress not to amend the class action       procedures found in rule 23 outside of the Rules Enabling Act       process.    It goes on to talk about an advisory committee, but I don't know any  sentence more clear than that. I know that as a parent raising a child,  ``do not'' and ``no'' are very clear, yet we maintain this debate on  the floor of the House.   Let me also mention a debate that is tomorrow, but I think it is  relevant to my amendment, LARA. This is a rule that was in in 1983. In  1993, it was thrown out because it had a deleterious effect on  meritorious civil rights cases, employment cases, and others. The  Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, that is tomorrow. The courts also don't  want you to do that, and most of the courts say it is a waste of  resources.   My amendment is going to help us solve the problem for this bill,  H.R. 985. It would improve the rules of the committee print by  replacing the substantive text of the bill with a requirement that the  bankruptcy asbestos trust report quarterly an aggregate list of demands  received and payments made. Specifically, the Jackson Lee amendment  protects the privacy of asbestos victims from overly broad and invasive  disclosure requirements by striking from the bill's text personal  information disclosure mandates.   Mr. Chairman, the only beneficiaries of the so-called FACT Act are  the very entities that knowingly produced a toxic substance that killed  or seriously injured thousands of unsuspecting American consumers and  workers--it is the defendants. And, no, it does not provide for a  safety for the trust.   Worse, this bill would allow victims of asbestos exposure to be  further victimized by requiring information about their illness to be  made publicly available to virtually anyone who has access to the  internet. Once irretrievably released into the public domain, this  information would be a virtual treasure trove for data collectors and  other entities for purposes that have absolutely nothing to do with the  compensation for asbestos exposure.   Why do these people have to be doubly, triply penalized? They are  already dying, many of them.   Insurance companies, prospective employers, lenders, predatory scam  artists all have access to these unsuspecting and devastated families  or victims. I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense Jackson Lee  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I wish to thank the Chair and Ranking Member of the Rules  Committee for making the Jackson Lee Amendment in order.   Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to explain the Jackson Lee  Amendment to Rules Committee Print 115-5 of H.R. 985, the ``Fairness in  Class Action Litigation And Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act  of 2017.''   My amendment would improve the Rules Committee Print 115-5 to H.R.  985 by replacing the substantive text of the bill with a requirement  that the bankruptcy asbestos trust report quarterly an aggregate list  of demands received and payments made.   Specifically, the Jackson Lee Amendment protects the privacy of  asbestos victim plaintiffs from overly broad and invasive disclosure  requirements, by striking from the bill's text personal information  disclosure mandates.   Mr. Chair, the only beneficiaries of the so-called ``FACT Act,'' are  the very entities that knowingly produced a toxic substance that killed  or seriously injured thousands of unsuspecting American consumers and  workers.   In fact, I am unaware of any asbestos victim who supports this  legislation.   Worse yet, this bill would allow victims of asbestos exposure to be  further victimized by requiring information about their illness to be  made publicly available to virtually anyone who has access to the  Internet.   For example, the bill requires all payment demands, as well as, the  names and exposure histories of each claimant together with the basis  for any payment the trust made to such claimants to be publicly  disclosed.   This sensitive information must be posted on the court's public  docket, which is easily accessible through the Internet with the  payment of a nominal file.   Once irretrievably released into the public domain, this information  would be a virtual treasure trove for data collectors and other  entities for purposes that have absolutely nothing to do with  compensation for asbestos exposure.   Insurance companies, prospective employers, lenders, and predatory  scam artists as well as the victim's neighbors would have access to  this information.   To address this serious failing of the bill, my amendment would  ensure that the quarterly reports required under the ``FACT Act,''  contain only aggregate payment information.   My amendment also deletes the bill's burdensome discovery  requirement.   As noted by the widow of our former colleague Representative Bruce  Vento who passed away from asbestos-induced mesothelioma, the bill's  public disclosure of victims' private information: ``could be used to  deny employment, credit, and health, life, and disability insurance.''   Mrs. Vento also warned that asbestos victims ``would be more  vulnerable to identity thieves, con men, and other types of  predators.''   I am sure that the supporters of this legislation will say that  Bankruptcy Code section 107 will prevent such results.   But this provision only permits--it does not require--the bankruptcy  court to issue a protective order.   In fact, such relief may only be granted ``for cause'' if the court  finds that ``disclosure of such information would create undue risk of  identity theft or other unlawful injury to the individual.''   What this means is that an asbestos victim would have to retain  counsel and go to court in order to prove ``cause'' to obtain relief.   And, even though Bankruptcy Rule 9037 does require certain types of  personal information to be redacted from a document filed in a  bankruptcy case, said Rule would be overridden by this legislation, as  written.
