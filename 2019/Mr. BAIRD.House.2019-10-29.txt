 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Congressional Gold Star Family Fellowship Program Act sponsored by my  colleague, Mr. Kelly.   Mr. Speaker, our men and women in uniform are part of a long line of  patriots whose unwavering commitment to our Nation has preserved the  rich legacy of freedom that we each enjoy every day.   Our military families are the forces behind our Armed Forces, and it  is our duty to also support and care for them, especially when their  loved one pays the ultimate sacrifice in service to our Nation.   I am proud to support this legislation, named after two fallen  American soldiers, Sergeant First Class Sean Cooley and Specialist  Christopher Horton. This resolution will provide fellowships in  congressional offices to Gold Star family members, giving them the  opportunity to drive policy change here in Washington and serve our  country in their own way.    Our fallen men and women in uniform stepped forward and answered the  call to serve. It is our turn to do our part to honor their legacy of  service and sacrifice by keeping the ones that we leave behind in the  forefront of our minds as we make decisions in this body.   With passage of this legislation, we will send a message to our Gold  Star families that they are not forgotten, and the American people  stand behind them and support them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
