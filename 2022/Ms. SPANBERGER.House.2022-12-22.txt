 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 5328) to amend the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act  of 2002 to extend terminal lakes assistance.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 5328         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. TERMINAL LAKES ASSISTANCE.         Section 2507(f) of the Farm Security and Rural Investment       Act of 2002 (16 U.S.C. 3839bb-6(f)) is amended by striking       ``2023'' and inserting ``2025''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 5328. This legislation will  enable the desert terminal lakes assistance program to fulfill its  intended purpose while bringing the program to an orderly closure. S.  5328 amends the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 by  changing the program's sunset date from October 1, 2023, to October 1,  2025.   The program has successfully improved the water supply to Walker  Lake, Pyramid, and Summit Lakes for the benefit of at-risk natural  desert terminal lakes and associated riparian and watershed resources.   To date, the program has secured over half of the water to reach the  restoration goal for Walker Lake while also protecting agricultural  interests in Nevada and California. The program has brought nearly  20,000 acres under sustainable management.   With an additional 2 years, the program can maximize conservation  outcomes while supporting agricultural producers and ensure that  maximum outcomes are achieved as the program  [[Page H10012]]  ends. The ability to complete the program in an orderly way and fully  spend the funds allocated back in 2014 will enable 70 to 80 percent  completion of Walker Lake's restoration goals.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  to close debate.   I appreciate the comments from the gentleman from Pennsylvania and  agree with him completely. The focus that he has placed on recognizing  how valuable this program has been in conserving water, how effective  it has been, and how this fix in this legislation will ensure that we  can in a fiscally responsible and without budgetary impact way ensure  this program's success by extending it for an additional 2 years is  exactly why I urge everyone to vote for this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
