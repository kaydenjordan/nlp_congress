 Mr. President, there are a number of issues I wish to  speak on today, but first I wish to extend my most sincere condolences  to the victims of violence in Las Vegas.   What we witnessed last night was a tragedy without precedent. Today,  our thoughts are with all those folks who have lost--the families,  loved ones, and  [[Page S6238]]  friends whose lives will never be the same as a result of this  shooting.   Our hearts are with all of you, and so are our prayers. We love you.  We stand by you today. We ask that God will stand by you always.
