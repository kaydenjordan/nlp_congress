 Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend a warm mahalo to  Hawaii's public safety dispatchers and radio technicians who provide an  essential service to our community.   These hardworking men and women process more than 1.4 million 911  calls each year in Hawaii and are literally the first line of response  in an emergency situation. Their ability to relay accurate and up-to- date information is essential to the success of our police officers,  firefighters, paramedics, and to the safety of those in desperate need  of help.   Last year, Hawaii's public safety telecommunicators helped our State  become one of the very first in the Nation to implement a text-to-911  program that is helping to close the gap in emergency response. This  program addresses a very real need for situations where you may have a  home invasion or domestic violence scenario where making a phone call  to 911 safely is simply not possible.   Mahalo to our telecommunicators for leading the way on this  initiative and for your work every single day on behalf of Hawaii's  people.                            ____________________
