 Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, Rotary International recognized  champions who have worked to eradicate polio around the world. Rotary  International has done a great job, and the Bill and Melinda Gates  Foundation has, too.   But as one of two congressional Members who were purple hearts of the  polio years, I wish to thank them, but also say how dreadful it is--and  awful--that the budget that is being proposed will reduce funding by  almost 20 percent to the National Institutes of Health and also to the  CDC.   The CDC and the National Institutes of Health protect us from health  scourges and look for cures and treatments that can protect people in  the future. The National Institutes of Health needs to have more  funding, not less, and so does the CDC.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I, indeed, also enjoyed the remarks that just  preceded me and that Mr. Conyers made and Mr. Clay made concerning this  issue.   I rise today in support of art, freedom of expression, freedom of  speech, but also Black Lives Matter and police officers who follow the  rules, which 98 percent or more do, who treat citizens appropriately  and risk their lives to keep us safe. And I mourn each officer that  loses their life or is injured in protecting us and having ordered  liberty.   But I rise in opposition to censorship, which is anathema to me, and  police officers who go beyond the law--that percentage that do--and  soil the badge they wear and use deadly force inappropriately, which  has occurred too many times sometimes because they just don't react  properly in the heat of battle, sometimes for other reasons, too often  upon Black people, which does tend to indicate a prejudice that exists  in certain people's minds. Black lives do matter, and people haven't  recognized that, and we need to.   The removal of David Pulphus' painting from the Cannon tunnel is  troubling on many levels. It raises serious questions about Congress'  commitment to the First Amendment, which guarantees the freedom of  expression. We take an oath to support the Constitution and should do  so in our actions as well as our words, as well as in our oath.   Benjamin Franklin warned us that freedom of speech is a principal  pillar of a free government. When this support is taken away, the  constitution of a free society is dissolved.   Secondly, it raises serious questions about censorship.  Unfortunately, in my hometown of Memphis, we have a history that is  sometimes not so good on particular cases of race and free expression.   That long history of artistic censorship oftentimes related to race  as well as sex, and for nearly 3 decades, in the early part of the 20th  century, Memphis had a censor, a public censor, appointed by the  government named Lloyd T. Binford. He served as the chairman of the  Memphis Board of Censors. They banned movies. They banned movies like  ``Curley'' in the 1940s because it showed White and Black children in  school together.   He prevented Memphians from seeing major celebrities like Lena Horne,  Duke Ellington, Nat King Cole, Cab Calloway in our local movie  theaters. He was a racist. ``Binfordizing'' became a word. Artistic  words that were wrong and Congress must be ever mindful of the slippery  slope of censorship.   Thirdly, and perhaps most important, this painting raises serious  questions about public policy. Congress should be debating questions of  public policy, not banning expressions of them.   The events that took place in Ferguson, Missouri, which are well  expressed by this painting, were a wake-up call to many in our Nation  about police use of deadly force, injustice in our inner cities, and  turmoil rising in our inner cities.   Sobering questions about the fairness of our criminal justice system  and about race were raised. And a painting such as this that reflects  those issues is most appropriate for display in the hallway where these  paintings and artworks are shown because it is representative of a  major slice of America in that year.   That, more than most other paintings and artworks there, show  something that is relevant to what is happening today and has occupied  the news in a major way.   For too long, justice has seemed too lacking, and we saw it in  Ferguson. Mr. Clay and I have worked together for display of this  artwork. I questioned some professors on another issue, lawyers that  specialize in First Amendment issues, speech issues in the Judiciary  Committee, and to a one they said it appeared to be censorship and was  wrong and was violative.   Of course there is some talk that, well, it is government speech and  maybe that is different. But you know some of the same people that have  opposed this painting are the same people that say the rules should  apply to Congress. Whatever laws we pass should apply to Congressmen  the same as they apply to other people, and we shouldn't have special  privileges. But those people decided on their own to exempt a painting  they found distasteful which wouldn't have been prohibited anyplace  else because of free speech. They violated their own precepts; the same  precepts they may be violating today in other rooms where they are  discussing a health bill that will exempt them from the health bill  sanctions or requirements and not require them, if they live in a  State, to not have the essential benefits of the Affordable Care Act.   So I rise today to commend Congressman Clay for his work, to thank  him for his work with me and Senator Duckworth on the Police Training  and Independent Review Act, which the need for is expressed here in  this artwork. That is why it is so important.   This communicates a story. Beauty is wonderful, and a lot of the  artwork is photographs and beauty. Nice. Fine. Places, fine. Content  and ideas are more important. It is always more important to have  artwork that challenges your mind and makes you think: What is this  about?   As I look at this painting and I think about it, sure, there are a  couple of police officers--two police officers in particular--in a  certain manner of being displayed. But there is a third police officer  on the right that is not shown this same way. And if you look at this  painting, you can see this painting says: not all police officers are  the same. Some are questionable, some aren't. It revolved around a  major incident in our city, St. Louis, Ferguson, but the arch is in  there and expresses that well.   This painting should not have been removed. Congressman Clay is right  to stand up for the First Amendment and for his constituent.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to help restore this painting to  its rightful place in the Cannon tunnel and to allow people to see it  and make their own decisions.    Mr. Speaker, I thank you and appreciate being a part of this.    And I am an art critic.    And I am an art critic.    And I am an art critic.    And I am an art critic.
