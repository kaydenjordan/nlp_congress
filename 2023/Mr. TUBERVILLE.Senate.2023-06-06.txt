 Mr. President, this month, I am proud to  recognize 96-year-old James Barnes of Abbeville, AL. Mr. Barnes was so  eager to serve his country that he didn't want to wait until he turned  18 to enlist in the military. So, at age 17, he convinced his dad to  sign a parental consent form allowing him to join the U.S. Navy, where  he became a radioman third class. He recalls the elder Mr. Barnes  saying that giving him permission was one of the hardest things he ever  did. Yet he recognized his son's noble desire to serve. Mr. Barnes  traveled the world aboard the U.S.S. LCI 963 and 965, with stops in the  Philippines and China to promote global stability after World War II.   After his military service, Mr. Barnes returned home to Henry County,  where he began farming peanuts, helping keep the Wiregrass region at  the forefront of our national peanut production. Additionally, Mr.  Barnes provided a critical service to people in the Wiregrass,  faithfully delivering mail for the U.S. Postal Service for more than 38  years, before his retirement in 1990. He is still involved with  American Legion Post 119 and Adoniram Baptist Church, where he has  served as secretary, treasurer, and a deacon, over the course of more  than 50 years.   Although Mr. Barnes is a humble man, members of his community will  [[Page S1976]]  tell you what a fixture he is in the local area. They describe him as  ``a true Henry County hero who represents all that is great about our  country.'' When asked what the secret to his long life is, Mr. Barnes  advised, ``No smoking, no drinking, and a lot of country cooking.''   Alabama is thankful for Mr. Barnes' many contributions to our State  and country, and I am proud to recognize him as the June Veteran of the  Month.                            ____________________
