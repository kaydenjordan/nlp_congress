 Mr. President, I thank my good friend, the senior  Senator from the great State of Vermont.   I, too, feel so badly about Senator Enzi's unfortunate passing. We  received the very sad news this morning that Mike Enzi had passed away  from injuries sustained on a bicycle accident.   He was only 7 months into his retirement, after four terms in the  Senate and decades--decades--of service to his home State of Wyoming.   We will remember him as we remembered him upon his departure from  this Chamber, as a kind and gentle man, as a practical legislator,  someone who sought common ground and was willing to leave strained  disagreements for another day. He was forceful, he was principled, but  he was also gentle, a rare and unusual combination and much needed in  this body.   He lived by a simple creed, given to him by his mother, that adorned  his office, and he shared it with his staff: Do what you think is  right; do your best; and treat others the way they wish to be treated.   Upon his retirement, those were the values he asked the Senate to  remember him by. At the news of his unexpected passing, those are the  values we will carry on in his memory. I offer my condolences to his  wife Diana and to former Senator Enzi's entire family    Mr. President, pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Committee on  Energy and Natural Resources being tied on the question of reporting, I  move to discharge the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources  from further consideration of the nomination of Tracy Stone-Manning, of  Montana, to be Director of the Bureau of Land Management.    As a reminder to all Members, the official photograph of  the 117th Congress will be at 2:15 p.m. Senators are asked to be on the  floor at that time. Following the photograph, the Senate will reconvene  and resume consideration of the motion to discharge the Stone-Manning  nomination. Senators should expect the vote on the motion to discharge  to occur around 5 p.m. today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess subject to the call of the Chair.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 232.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum call for the cloture motion filed today, July 27, be waived.    I yield the floor.
