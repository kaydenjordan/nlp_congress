 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today we stand with the people of Iran. We stand with  people who are engaged in legitimate protests against an oppressive,  corrupt regime.   There is a certain irony to this. This is a great people, the people  of Iran. It was the Persian king, Cyrus the Great, who drafted the  first declaration of human rights, the Cyrus Cylinder.   As you enter the United Nations, you see this quotation from him.  This was a document meant to protect other cultures and it secured a  special place in the history of civilization. His humanitarian values  that he laid out of freedom for all peoples, respect for culture, for  religious liberty, recognition of the fact that it is better to be  loved than to be feared, these are remarkable attributes, especially at  that point in time, and they were handed down as part of this deep  Persian culture.   We, who live in free societies, owe a great debt to the Iranian  people. They are the heirs to this culture. They are those who hold  those values and ideas for governance that originally inspired the  European Enlightenment, leaders of our own government here, our own  Founding Fathers. It was Thomas Jefferson who told his grandson: These  are the ideals you study first of Cyrus the Great in terms of  governance.   Now, it is amazing that Iranians at this moment enjoy far fewer  rights than their forefathers did. Cyrus was lauded for the protections  he offered religious and ethnic minorities. We look at the state of  affairs today and we see the repression of Iran's ethnic and religious  minority populations from the Azerbaijanis to the Balochs, from the  Kurds and the Arabs to the Baha'is and the Christians and the  Zoroastrians.   You know, the regime authorities routinely deny those citizens the  most basic human rights, and they do it through harassment and  intimidation and detention and violence. And if you want to know what  kind of violence, talk to the young Persians or talk to the young  minorities who suffered through the torture in those prisons.   Why do they suffer through it?   Because they are trying to bring attention to the oppressiveness of  that regime. Those young people yearn for human rights. They stand for  the celebrated culture of the Persian people and for human rights. As  this resolution makes clear, the United States House of Representatives  fully supports those who have taken to the streets in Iran to exercise  the fundamental freedom of expression and assembly.   We join them in the hope that their bravery will build the foundation  for the emergence of a freely elected, open democratic political system  in Iran. It is a moral imperative to support those who risk their lives  demanding the freedoms that people in free societies enjoy every day.    That is why this resolution calls on all democratic governments and  institutions worldwide to join us in clearly supporting the Iranian  people's right to live in a free society. We all face a clear choice.  We stand with the protesters and we stand with those who demand the  basic rights and opportunities enjoyed in free societies.   We are not going to stand with the oppressors, those who steal the  wealth of a great nation to enrich themselves and to fund violence  abroad. Supporting the people of Iran is a strategic imperative. These  brave men and women are standing up against the Revolutionary Guard's  violent intervention in Syria and Lebanon as well. We must join them in  demanding an end to the single greatest source of instability in the  Middle East, and this is this obsession that the regime has with this  ideology.   In standing with the Iranian people, we must explain that they are  not the target of our sanctions. U.S. sanctions target the oppressive  destabilizing regime, not the people of Iran. That is why, as this  resolution makes clear, Congress has provided authority to license  communications technology that improves the ability of the Iranian  people to speak freely.   Today we call on the agencies involved to expedite those licenses.  U.S. international broadcasting must also turn up the volume of its  efforts in Iran and convey a message of hope and support. This should  be conveyed by the young that know that this debate today in the  American people's House is about this issue. Iranians must know that  they are not alone in their struggle for freedom.   We also call on companies to reject requests by the regime to cut off  the Iranian people from social media.                                time  1500    These technologies are at their best when they are used to empower  people and undermine the efforts of oppressive regimes.   There is more we can do, and I welcome Chairman McCaul and  Congressman Deutch's introduction of bipartisan legislation that will  give the administration greater leverage to target those responsible  for ordering and carrying out human rights abuses in Iran. This  includes the regime's practice of holding Americans and other  foreigners hostage. Many of the regime's hostages are people of Iranian  descent who came to visit family members, came to visit loved ones.   I am also working to introduce legislation that has the same goal as  those who have bravely taken to the streets: to push the corrupt  revolutionary  [[Page H56]]  guard out of the Iranian economy. In doing so, it seeks to deny the  guards the funds they use to hold power over the Iranian people while  destabilizing Syria and destabilizing Lebanon.   Mr. Speaker, Congress and the administration have a great  opportunity. We must work together on an approach to Iran that empowers  the Iranian people and targets the corrupt regime which oppresses a  great people. We cannot be quiet with the passage of this resolution.  We state that America stands with the Iranian people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 535) to encourage visits between the United States  and Taiwan at all levels, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 535         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Taiwan Travel Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.),       enacted in 1979, has continued for 37 years to be a       cornerstone of relations between the United States and Taiwan       and has served as an anchor for peace and security in the       Western Pacific area.        (2) The Taiwan Relations Act declares that peace and       stability in the Western Pacific area are in the political,       security, and economic interests of the United States and are       matters of international concern.        (3) The United States considers any effort to determine the       future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by       boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of       the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United       States.        (4) Taiwan has succeeded in a momentous transition to       democracy beginning in the late 1980s and has been a beacon       of democracy in Asia, and Taiwan's democratic achievements       inspire many countries and people in the region.        (5) Visits to a country by United States cabinet members       and other high-ranking officials are an indicator of the       breadth and depth of ties between the United States and such       country.        (6) Since the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act,       relations between the United States and Taiwan have suffered       from insufficient high-level communication due to the self-      imposed restrictions that the United States maintains on       high-level visits with Taiwan.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the United States Government should encourage visits between       officials from the United States and Taiwan at all levels.        (b) Statement of Policy.--It should be the policy of the       United States to--        (1) allow officials at all levels of the United States       Government, including cabinet-level national security       officials, general officers, and other executive branch       officials, to travel to Taiwan to meet their Taiwanese       counterparts;        (2) allow high-level officials of Taiwan to enter the       United States, under conditions which demonstrate appropriate       respect for the dignity of such officials, and to meet with       officials of the United States, including officials from the       Department of State and the Department of Defense and other       cabinet agencies; and        (3) encourage the Taipei Economic and Cultural       Representative Office, and any other instrumentality       established by Taiwan, to conduct business in the United       States, including activities which involve participation by       Members of Congress, officials of Federal, State, or local       governments of the United States, or any high-level official       of Taiwan.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce).                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 535, the Taiwan Travel  Act, and I recognize Mr. Chabot for his longstanding dedication and  support to the people of Taiwan.   Mr. Speaker, Taiwan succeeded in a momentous transition, a transition  which took them to democracy. They did this decades ago, and since, it  has become a beacon of democracy across the Asia-Pacific.   Taiwan is a strong friend and critical partner to the United States.  Congress has been central to this longstanding bond, championing a  strong relationship with Taiwan through a number of landmark measures,  like the Taiwan Relations Act, impressing successive administrations to  fulfill their obligation to sell defensive arms to Taiwan. Today,  Congress continues this legacy with this Taiwan Travel Act, which has  gained strong, bipartisan support.   We should encourage our officials to visit Taipei, to meet with their  democratically elected counterparts on the many issues, the many  programs, that we work on together, such as global health, commercial  ties, global cooperation and training, the framework that we have in  place. We should also welcome Taiwanese officials here.   Mr. Speaker, there are, in fact, no laws that bar our executive  branch officials at any level from visiting Taiwan. The EPA  Administrator in 2014 was the last executive branch official to visit  Taiwan. A total of six Cabinet-level officials have visited Taiwan  since 1979.   As our 10th largest trading partner, Taiwan deserves more attention.  U.S. interests in the region deserve more respect. This bill encourages  officials, at all levels of the U.S. Government, including Cabinet- level officials, to travel to Taiwan to meet their counterparts and  vice versa.                                time  1515    Mr. Speaker, we must build stronger ties in our relationship with  Taiwan.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the chairman emeritus of  the Committee on Foreign Affairs.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank our esteemed chairman for his  years of service to our country.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support H.R. 535, the Taiwan Travel Act,  authored by my good friend and colleague, Chairman Steve Chabot. Over  the years, Steve and I have worked closely together on our Foreign  Affairs Committee, and his commitment and leadership on strengthening  U.S.-Taiwan relations has been second to none.   We have worked to shift U.S. policy on Taiwan to a more favorable  position for our friend and ally, Taiwan, rather than an acquiescent  policy that U.S. administration after U.S. administration continued to  implement out of fear from a Chinese economic retaliation or diplomatic  retaliation or military retaliation.   Frankly, Mr. Speaker, it is a shame that we continue to allow China  to dictate our foreign policy when it comes to Taiwan. The Taiwanese  have been great partners for the United States, whereas China seeks to  undermine everything we do, yet administration after administration  have gone so far as to self-impose restrictions and self-impose  limitations in our dealings with Taiwan, and that includes a self- imposed restriction on allowing the Taiwanese President and other high- ranking government officials from Taipei from coming to Washington,  D.C., to meet with Congress, to meet with administration officials, to  meet with other policymakers. This is unconscionable, and this farce  needs to end.   We should have direct dialogue with the democratically elected  leadership of our ally, Taiwan, and we should not allow China or the  fear of Chinese reprisal to dictate this.   Without this, we are putting ourselves at a disadvantage. We are  harming and insulting an ally. Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, we are  damaging our national security interests and giving China, in effect, a  veto over our foreign policy decisions.   That is why Mr. Chabot's bill is so important, Mr. Speaker. The  Taiwan Travel Act states that it should be U.S. policy to not only  allow visits from Taiwanese officials at all levels of the government,  but to encourage these visits, to facilitate these visits.   It also states that our own policymakers, including at the highest  levels of our government, should visit Taiwan for face-to-face meetings  with their counterparts.   Mr. Speaker, the United States is a global leader. We are a sovereign  nation. Who we choose to meet with and who we choose to recognize is  our sovereign right. We should not allow China or anyone else to impact  our decision. For far too long, America has allowed China to prevent us  from taking full advantage of our partnership with Taiwan.   The Taiwan Travel Act is an important step toward doing the right  thing for our friend and ally, and I hope that the administration will  reverse these damaging policies.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, the chairman of our esteemed  committee, for the time. I urge all of our colleagues to support Mr.  Chabot's bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who is the author of  this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am a decades-long supporter of Taiwan; and as chairman  of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I have made supporting stronger U.S.- Taiwan economic and security ties a priority for our committee. I have  traveled to Taiwan many times, as have members of the committee.   I really want to thank Chairman Chabot for introducing this important  measure, and I want to thank him for being a long-time champion for  Taiwan, especially when he was chairman of the Asia and the Pacific  Subcommittee.   The U.S. and Taiwan share a common commitment, and that commitment is  to democracy, the rule of law, and human rights. Taiwan's successes  serve as an example of what can be built on these important principles.  We should be supporting countries that have achieved democracy to serve  as an inspiration for those values across the world.   The Taiwan Travel Act is important because it will encourage more  interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan. This is long overdue. It is  needed, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 535.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 535.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3320) to direct the Secretary of State to develop a  strategy to regain observer status for Taiwan in the World Health  Organization, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3320         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE WORLD HEALTH                     ORGANIZATION.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized       agency of the United Nations, charged with coordinating       health efforts within the United Nations system. The World       Health Assembly (WHA) is the decision-making body of the WHO,       which convenes annually in May to set the policies and       priorities of the organization. Statehood is not a       requirement for attendance at the WHA, and numerous       observers, including non-members and non-governmental       organizations, attended the most recent WHA in May 2017.        (2) Taiwan began seeking to participate in the WHO as an       observer in 1997. In 2009, with strong support from       successive United States Administrations, Congress, and like-      minded WHO Member States, and during a period of improved       Cross-Strait relations, Taiwan received an invitation to       attend the WHA as an observer under the name ``Chinese       Taipei''. Taiwan received the same invitation each year until       2016, when following the election of President Tsai-Ing Wen       of the Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan's engagement in       the international community began facing increased resistance       from the People's Republic of China (PRC). Taiwan's       invitation to the 2016 WHA was received late and included new       language conditioning Taiwan's participation on the PRC's       ``one China principle''. In 2017, Taiwan did not receive an       invitation to the WHA.        (3) Taiwan remains a model contributor to world health,       having provided financial and technical assistance to respond       to numerous global health challenges. Taiwan has invested       over $6 billion in international medical and humanitarian aid       efforts impacting over 80 countries since 1996. In 2014,       Taiwan responded to the Ebola crisis by donating $1 million       and providing 100,000 sets of personal protective equipment.       Through the Global Cooperation and Training Framework, the       United States and Taiwan have jointly conducted training       programs for experts to combat MERS, Dengue Fever, and Zika.       These diseases know no borders, and Taiwan's needless       exclusion from global health cooperation increases the       dangers presented by global pandemics.        (4) Taiwan's international engagement has faced increased       resistance from the PRC. Taiwan was not invited to the 2016       Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization       (ICAO), despite participating as a guest at the       organization's prior summit in 2013. Taiwan's request to       participate in the 2016 General Assembly of the International       Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) was also rejected. In       May 2017, PRC delegates disrupted a meeting of the Kimberley       Process on conflict diamonds held in Perth, Australia, until       delegates from Taiwan were asked to leave. In June 2017, the       Republic of Panama granted diplomatic recognition to the PRC,       terminating a longstanding diplomatic relationship with       Taiwan.        (5) Congress has established a policy of support for       Taiwan's participation in international bodies that address       shared transnational challenges, particularly in the WHO.       Congress passed H.R. 1794 in the 106th Congress, H.R. 428 in       the 107th Congress, and S. 2092 in the 108th Congress to       direct the Secretary of State to establish a strategy for,       and to report annually to Congress on, efforts to obtain       observer status for Taiwan at the WHA. Congress also passed       H.R. 1151 in the 113th Congress, directing the Secretary to       report on a strategy to gain observer status for Taiwan at       the ICAO Assembly, and H.R. 1853 in the 114th Congress,       directing the Secretary to report on a strategy to gain       observer status for Taiwan at the INTERPOL Assembly. However,       in 2016 Taiwan did not receive invitations to attend any of       these events as an observer.        (b) Augmentation of Report Concerning the Participation of       Taiwan in the World Health Organization.--        (1) In general.--Subsection (c) of section 1 of Public Law       108-235 (118 Stat. 656) is amended by adding at the end the       following new paragraph:  [[Page H60]]         ``(3) An account of the changes and improvements the       Secretary of State has made to the United States plan to       endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan at the World       Health Assembly, following any annual meetings of the World       Health Assembly at which Taiwan did not obtain observer       status.''.        (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1)       shall take effect and apply beginning with the first report       required under subsection (c) of section 1 of Public Law 108-      235 that is submitted after the date of the enactment of this       Act.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce).                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), the author of this  important bill which counters the harmful and unacceptable efforts  being made to undermine Taiwan's inclusion at the World Health  Organization.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), our chairman of the  Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), our chairman of the  Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it was 20 years ago that we here in Congress spoke with  one voice. We passed a law to support Taiwan's inclusion in the World  Health Organization. It took a decade of advocacy; it took pressure  before Taiwan was finally invited to participate in that assembly for  the first time in 2009. So you can imagine it is with great  disappointment that we learned that Taiwan was excluded from the  meetings last year for the first time after 8 years of consecutive  participation in Geneva.   Mr. Speaker, Taiwan's participation at the World Health Organization  is a matter of public health, as our friend, Mr. Sherman, and as the  chairman of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee, Mr. Yoho, have both  reminded us. This is a matter of public health.   Taiwan has contributed greatly, so greatly to the international  efforts to prevent epidemics. It has provided critical humanitarian aid  and medical training around the world; financial assistance, investing  $6 billion in international medical and humanitarian aid efforts since  1996, all over this globe, 80 countries.   During the 2014 Ebola crisis, it was Taiwan that was there, providing  also 100,000 sets of protective gear for health workers. Through the  global cooperation and training framework, the U.S. and Taiwan have  jointly conducted training programs for experts to combat diseases from  Dengue fever to Zika.   Mr. Speaker, yes, as Mr. Yoho reminded us, and Mr. Sherman, we know  [[Page H61]]  from this experience that infectious diseases know no borders. They so  quickly spread, and the global health community does not benefit when  Taiwan is kept in the dark on these critical matters. We are all safer  when Taiwan has meaningful, unobstructed participation in international  health cooperation forums.   All of us recall that Taiwan had an awful experience during the SARS  epidemic that was 15 years ago when the World Health Organization  directed Taiwan officials not to approach them, but to approach Beijing  for information-sharing instead.   It is clear that Taiwan's exclusion from last year's World Health  Assembly will only hurt. The health and safety of the people of Taiwan  should not be needlessly held hostage by politics, and world health  should not be put at risk. Taiwanese doctors have so much to offer,  given their experience providing this humanitarian assistance around  this world.   Last fall, I met with the Director-General of the World Health  Organization.                                time  1545    I pressed him for Taiwan's participation. Unfortunately, this meeting  did not relieve my concerns about Taiwan's future outlook. And it is  for this reason, Mr. Speaker, that it is all the more important that  the U.S. use all of its diplomatic leverage to support Taiwan's efforts  to regain observer status to the WHO.   I applaud the administration for sending our Health Secretary to meet  with the delegation Taiwan sent to Geneva for bilateral meetings on the  sidelines of the assembly meeting last year, and I think, by doing so,  the U.S. demonstrated leadership by putting international cooperation  ahead of politics. Passage of this bill demonstrates our support for  Taiwan's inclusion.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), chairman emeritus of the  Foreign Affairs Committee.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank our esteemed chairman for this  time, and I want to thank my Florida colleague, Ted Yoho, the chairman  of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, for offering this  important bill as well as for his constant friendship and assistance to  our strong and indispensable ally, Taiwan.   His bill, H.R. 3320, directing the Secretary of State to develop a  strategy for increasing Taiwan's participation at the World Health  Organization, is an important first step, an important piece of our  foreign policy toward our ally, Taiwan.   Congress has, for years, been pushing for Taiwan to have greater  access, to have equal representation at so many institutions.  Unfortunately, as with so many other international organizations,  Taiwan's lack of observer status at the World Health Organization, or  WHO, is caused by an orchestrated and dangerous campaign by China to  constrain Taiwan's participation in global affairs.   In the case of the WHO, China is depriving the international  community from access to a wealth of Taiwan's high-level healthcare  information. Due to its superb talent, due to its data collection, due  to its quarantine and treatment facilities, Taiwan has excellent  infectious disease control capabilities. Fourteen years ago, Taiwan's  cooperation with the Centers for Disease Control was crucial in  stemming the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as  SARS.   Before the last World Health assembly in May, I wrote a letter to the  Department of Health and Human Services urging greater efforts to  ensure that Taiwan received an invitation to the summit. The Secretary  agreed with me, writing that Taiwan is an indispensable member of the  global health society and is a ``strong health partner that  demonstrated the value of its expertise and contributions to health  issues of global concern.''   Unsurprisingly, however, Mr. Speaker, China once again put its  dangerous and shortsighted policies first, using its influence with  World Health Organization member states to deny Taiwan an invitation to  the assembly.   We cannot continue allowing China to threaten global efforts to  mitigate infectious disease, and, more importantly, Mr. Speaker, we  cannot continue to allow China to bully Taiwan or to have a veto over  our own foreign policy decisions. It is time to develop new ideas and  new strategies so that we can put a stop to China's bullying and ensure  that Taiwan gains observer status at the WHO and everywhere else.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this important measure,  and, as always, I thank our esteemed chairman for the time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   In closing, I would like to share with the body that I led a  delegation to Taipei this last summer, and I was there when Taiwan  pledged to donate $800,000 in disaster relief to Houston. That was in  the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. It is generous actions like this  that I can think of, 80 occasions, that remind us again and again that  Taiwan is a positive actor in the international community, and that is  why we must continue to support Taiwan's international standing and  well-being.   So I would like to say in closing that I thank my colleagues for  being original cosponsors on this bill. In addition to Mr. Yoho and  myself, I want to thank Mr. Engel. And I want to thank Mr. Sherman. I  want to thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue, and Mr.  Connolly as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of two  critical pieces of legislation, H.R. 535 and H.R. 3320. These bills are  important to U.S. national security because the spread of pandemics do  not respect borders. These bills are also important because they will  enhance the position of Taiwan, a true and vibrant democracy, with  which we have had longstanding ties.   I commend my good friend and colleague, Mr. Steve Chabot, for  introducing the Taiwan Travel Act. Currently, the President of Taiwan,  Vice President, Premier, Defense Minister and Foreign Minister of  Taiwan are not allowed to come to Washington, D.C. for consultations.  These are U.S. self-imposed restrictions that are practiced due to fear  of potential Chinese diplomatic retaliation. Restricting high-level  visits by senior Taiwanese officials is both insulting and  counterproductive. This policy should be changed.   Mr. Speaker, China will never be happy with U.S.-Taiwan policy or the  Taiwan Relations Act. Communist China will never be placated by our  self-imposed restrictions on travel and consultations. We should not  try.   Mr. Speaker, I also stand today in support of H.R. 3320, introduced  by my good friend and chairman of the subcommittee on Asia and the  Pacific, Mr. Ted Yoho.   H.R. 3320 would designate that the Secretary of State devise a plan  to include Taiwan in the World Health Organization. Taiwan has been  excluded from participating in the WHO due to Chinese pressure, and  sadly, the international community has acquiesced.   We here in Congress have been advocating for many years that the U.S.  should take action to ensure Taiwan's meaningful participation in the  WHO. As a major transport and shipping hub in the Asia Pacific region,  with enormous volumes of people and goods passing through on a daily  basis, Taiwan's exclusion creates a dangerous gap in the global health  and safety information network.   Mr. Speaker, the full participation of Taiwan in the WHO and other  multilateral bodies cannot be overstated as a U.S. national security  interest.   China's efforts to exclude Taiwan from international bodies like WHO  creates needless blind spots in the international system where  terrorism and disease can spread undetected.   Mr. Speaker, Taiwan must join the WHO as a full member. Regaining  observer status is  [[Page H62]]  only a first step. Full WHO membership for Taiwan is not only in the  interest of Taiwan, it is in the interest of the rest of the world.   I urge my colleagues to pass these critical measures to strengthen  the bond between the U.S. and our democratic ally, Taiwan.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 3320.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
