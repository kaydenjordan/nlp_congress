 Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader. I thank my  friend, the chairman of the Banking Committee, and also Senator  Shaheen.   Hardly a week goes by that we don't learn more about the efforts of  the Russian Government to sow the seeds of dissent around the world.  Apart from oil and gas, this seems to be Russia's primary export. One  administration after another has tried to reason with President Putin,  but appeals to reason clearly don't work.   Vladimir Putin needs to know he will pay an increasing price for his  hostile actions. He needs to know we will stand up for our allies in  Ukraine and throughout Europe. He needs to know we will not tolerate  his interference in our democratic process, whether in the last  election or the next election.   Instead of providing a firm, clear message that we will not tolerate  Russia's bad behavior, this administration has been all over the  diplomatic map--and that is just in its public pronouncements. Frankly,  we don't know exactly what the Trump administration is doing privately  with the oligarchs, the oilmen, the Kremlin, or even with President  Putin himself.   This amendment sends a firm, clear message we need right now: The  United States of America will not accept continued Russian aggression.  We will put tough measures in place to punish past  [[Page S3473]]  actions and to deter future aggressions. We will stand by our allies.   I commend Senators Graham and Blumenthal for their amendments. I  thank Chairman Crapo for his leadership. I thank Senator Corker and  Senator Cardin and all the Senators who have put time and effort into  this issue.   On behalf of the Ukrainian community in my State, on behalf of fair  play, and on behalf of the integrity of the American election system, I  urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). The Senator from Idaho.    Mr. President, last week the Senate passed the Department  of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act,  but this legislation does nothing to address one of the most critical  problems at the VA. To improve the healthcare our returning heroes  receive, we need a VA that is fully staffed with the best healthcare  professionals we can find, and in many VA facilities throughout the  Nation, including in Ohio, that is far from the case.   Across the U.S., there are more than 49,000 VA vacancies that this  administration has yet to fill. In Ohio, as of  [[Page S3485]]  April of this year, there were more than 1,700 VA vacancies, and more  than 1,500 of those positions were considered critical to public health  and safety.   That is a massive problem that needs immediate attention by the  administration. These vacancies are not just numbers; they have serious  consequences for our veterans who need care.   When the VA is understaffed, it means longer wait times. It means  veterans unable to see the specialists they need. It means  overstretched doctors.   Overworked doctors means mistakes are more likely and veterans are  not getting the quality care they deserve.   Imagine a doctor tells an Ohio veteran she needs an MRI. Well, if  there is no MRI tech at that facility because they have not hired one,  she has to wait longer for the test and diagnosis. She might have to  find someone to drive her to another town.   The last thing we ought to be doing is making it harder for these men  and women who have sacrificed so much for our country to get the care  they need. We owe all of our veterans--and the families who support  them--our gratitude, our respect, and the best healthcare in the world.  That means recruiting talented doctors, nurses, and other staff members  has to be a priority for the VA.   The agency must improve outreach to prospective employees to show  that it is a desirable place to work. It needs to demonstrate that  employee's voices, including those of whistleblowers, will be heard and  protected when necessary. Future VA employees need to know that all  efforts by VA workers to improve the quality of services provided to  our veterans will be encouraged, appreciated, and acted on.   We absolutely need to ensure that we are holding the workers who care  for our veterans and servicemembers to the highest standards--but that  is not enough.   We can improve the quality of care by the VA by making sure it is  properly and fully staffed. That is currently not the case, and I will  continue to press the VA to provide answers as to why more than 1,700  positions in Ohio--positions that should be filled by Americans  dedicated to serving our veterans--are vacant.   When our servicemembers return home, they should be able to focus on  spending time with loved ones and rejoining their communities, not  worrying about whether they will be able to get the quality healthcare  they deserve.                            ____________________
