 Mr. Speaker, I rise again to thank Leader Hoyer for  his masterful control and work on the floor of the House and thank him  for his magic 1 minute.   I rise as well, as I hope to continue the debate, to encourage and  say that there is no option but to support the omnibus that will come  before us.   Mr. Speaker, 40 million children will have permanent healthcare  through the CHIP program. $24 billion will help to improve veterans'  healthcare. What is needed by Americans is that mental health will now  be a high priority in assisting the stabilization of our families.   I rise also to indicate my determination to reintroduce H.R. 7566,  which it was this year, the No Trafficking Zones Act.   This legislation would have established a sentencing enhancement of  up to 5 years for any person who commits an offense of child sex  trafficking or coercion and enticement of a minor within 1,000 feet of  a school zone.   Let me apprise this body, in 2020, 11,193 instances of potential  human trafficking were reported by the United States, national human  trafficking, and 25 percent of all that is in Texas, and these are  children.   Mr. Speaker, it is crucial that we fight for children, and we get  this bill--no sex trafficking in our school zones, no sex trafficking,  no human trafficking. We are going to get it passed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, there are no lameduck Americans. The lights are on, the  doors are open, and they expect for us to work.   I am excited about this omnibus. I am excited about the $800 billion  that Democrats were able to get for housing and safer communities.   I am excited about the STOP School Violence Act grants of $50 million  for community-based violence intervention; $95 million for the  background checks.   I am excited about 40 million children being able to have good  healthcare under Medicaid. I am excited about the enhancement of  Medicare and Medicaid for my constituents.   I am enormously excited about the $398 million--we have tried this  over and over again--to transition the TSA workforce to pay parity with  civil service employees performing similar work, as well as the dollars  for refugees' processing and shelter.   I am excited about the dollars for the United States Department of  Housing and Urban Development for the 18th Congressional District; for  Buffalo Bayou Park, $750,000, in the 18th Congressional District; for  riverside planning for restoration; for the hospital, $750,000; $4  million to deal with the Department of Housing and Urban Development  and Transportation.   I am excited because we are doing things for families.   Mr. Speaker, vote for this bill. It is no lameduck. Happy holidays.  It is for the American people, and the Democrats are standing tall.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on  the Budget, Judiciary, and Homeland Security, I proudly rise in support  of the omnibus appropriations legislation that provides funding to  continue the operations of the federal government through September 30,  2023, enhances supportive services to the American people, and avoids a  wasteful and irresponsible shutdown.   I am relieved that an agreement has been reached between the  bicameral, bipartisan leadership, and produced an omnibus spending  package that has the highest levels of non-defense spending in our  Nation's history.   This legislation provides vitally needed and long overdue funding  that will make our communities safer, improve health coverage for  children and families, increase funding for veterans' health care, help  victims of hurricanes and wildfires, prevent violence against women,  preserve our democracy, address the climate crisis, and deliver another  round of essential security, economic and humanitarian assistance to  Ukraine.   Democrats secured an astounding $800 billion in non-defense  spending--$68 billion more than last year, a 9.3% increase--to raise  living standards for Houston residents and millions of Americans.   Not only does this spending package include necessary increases in  funding for ongoing programs and services; it also approves spending  for the implementation of groundbreaking, historic legislation that was  enacted into law, led by Democrats, in 2022.   Passage of this legislation will improve safety for Houstonians and  all Americans. It addresses the epidemic of gun violence by funding  provisions of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the Gun Violence  Reduction Grants, and it bolsters police and criminal justice reform by  expanding gun violence prevention efforts.   The spending package allocates $1.75 billion, an increase of $215.9  million above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, to bolster efforts to  prevent and respond to gun violence.   It provides $135 million for STOP School Violence Act Grants.   It will deliver $50 million for community-based violence intervention  and prevention initiatives.   Additionally, it allocates $95 million to strengthen the National  Instant Criminal Background Check System.   The bill improves healthcare for my constituents and millions of  Americans by enhancing Medicaid and Medicare coverage, adding to child,  family, maternal, and minority health programs, and providing critical  funding for veterans' medical care. The omnibus:   makes permanent the option for states to provide women with  uninterrupted Medicaid coverage for 12 months postpartum, which will  help address the maternal mortality crisis that has been especially  devastating for communities of color;   gives 40 million children in America permanent health care through  Medicaid/Chips;   ensures permanent, mandatory, and continuous healthcare coverage for  over 40 million children enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP through the year  2029;   allocates $823 million for the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant,  including $55 million for State Maternal Health Innovation Grants, and  $7 million for the Maternal Mental Health Hotline;   increases funding to the Office of Minority Health and the Minority  HIV/ AIDS initiative; and   helps expand affordable, quality care to more Americans by allocating  record-level Medicaid funding to Puerto Rico and permanently enhanced  Medicaid funding for other territories;   provides, through the efforts of Democrats, a $21 billion increase  for veterans' healthcare, including supporting the VA as it implements  the landmark PACT Act.   Mr. Speaker, the package before us will lower the cost of living and  ensure the continuation of SNAP benefits for millions of hardworking  American families.   The omnibus will protect housing assistance for more than 4.8 million  individuals and families.   It provides a combined $45.2 billion for Section 8 Rental Assistance  to continue serving more than 3.5 million households nationwide,  including an expansion of housing assistance to more than 12,000 low- income families, survivors of domestic violence, and veterans.   The legislation invests $3.6 billion in efforts to reduce  homelessness through Homeless Assistance Grants.   The omnibus includes a $500 increase in the maximum Pell Grant for  the students who need them most.   It expands opportunity for underserved Americans through critical  investments in education, especially for high-poverty schools by  providing $18.4 billion for Title I Grants, and for students with  disabilities by providing $15.5 billion for Special Education programs.   It supports students at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs),  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving  Institutions, and Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities through  over $1 billion in funding.   The legislation tackles hunger and nutrition insecurity by expanding  access to fruits and vegetables to 6.2 million women, infants, and  children through WIC and ensures that 43.5 million people in SNAP- eligible families get the necessary benefits to which they are  entitled.   The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 will also fund efforts to  end violence against women.   I've championed the fight against domestic violence for many years,  and as chairwoman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism,  and Homeland Security, I sponsored H.R. 1620, the Violence Against  Women Act  [[Page H10524]]  Reauthorization of 2021. The reauthorization of VAWA was one of this  year's great successes, and I am so pleased to see that the  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 will accelerate its  implementation, as it:   provides $700 million for Violence Against Women Act prevention and  prosecution programs;   provides services and assistance to victims of domestic violence and  assault; and   supports victims with $225 million to reduce the backlog in access to  sexual assault kits and other DNA evidence tools.   This funding package also provides substantial funding to fight the  climate crisis and ensure a better life for future generations to come.   By following the science, it enables the development of common-sense  standards to curb pollution with $10.1 billion for the EPA, including  $4.1 billion for core science and environmental program work.   The bill includes more than $15.3 billion of transformative  investments in clean energy and science, which will help the  development and deployment of clean, affordable, and secure American  energy while creating tens of thousands of ``green jobs'' in  communities across the country.   The omnibus includes $6.35 billion for the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration, including strong investments in support of  climate research, weather forecasting, offshore wind energy, and STEM  education.   Without these visionary, expansive provisions that address climate  change, we risk exposing ourselves to harsher changes in climate and  the wrath they inflict. Today, we are already experiencing the  devastating effects of climate change. People in my Houston district,  and indeed around the country, are living through cataclysmic natural  disasters that are occurring with increasing frequency and severity.   This funding package addresses the needs of communities that have  been severely impacted by hurricanes and wildfires, and it provides  essential disaster response and recovery funding.   The omnibus provides $4.6 billion to help Americans who suffer from  wildfires, hurricanes, and other natural disasters during, and prior  to, calendar year 2023.   It allocates $20 billion for disaster response and recovery.   The omnibus also equips us to address challenges to our security and  our national values. In our ever-evolving global society, every day we  face new threats to democracy and to the wellbeing of those who seek to  live in a free and just world.   Russia's launch of a premeditated war against Ukraine is an attack on  democracy and a grave violation of international law, global peace, and  security.   The fighting sparked massive displacement, forcing over 7.6 million  Ukrainians to flee their homes to find refuge in neighboring states,  and putting women and girls at heightened risk of violence.   As leader of the free world, the USA has the duty and responsibility  to help Ukraine preserve its freedom and democracy. Therefore, I  proudly support the spending provisions in this bill that respond to  Ukraine's needs for humanitarian and security assistance.   The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 continues critical security  assistance to Ukraine with an additional $300 million for the Ukraine  Security Assistance Initiative for training, equipment, weapons,  supplies, and salaries.   It provides intelligence support to the Ukrainian military and  national security forces.   It provides $2.5 billion for humanitarian needs in Ukraine and in  countries impacted by the situation in Ukraine, and for additional  support for other vulnerable populations.   Just as threats against democracy are prevalent around the world,  they are also afflicting us here in the United States.   In response to the despicable, appalling assault on the Capitol that  attempted to disrupt our election proceedings on January 6, 2021, we  must do everything in our power to ensure that democracy always  prevails in the US.   Our democracy must never be jeopardized by threats from homegrown  extremists, nor deterred by delusional obsessions harbored by a would- be autocrat and his sycophants.   The bill's inclusion of the Electoral Count Reform Act will codify  the process by which Congress counts presidential electoral votes and  ratifies the outcome of the presidential election.   It will clarify to Americans that the Vice President's role in  ratifying states' electoral college votes is purely ministerial and  ceremonial, despite what the person who used to sit in the Oval Office  led millions to believe.   There are other ancillary but no less important features included in  the Consolidated Appropriations Act:   An increase in funding--to $7.8 billion--for NASA's Science Mission  Directorate will generate better scientific information about the Earth  and its changing climate, and will advance our understanding of both  our solar system and the universe.   The $220 million for the NATO Security Investment Program will  improve the infrastructure that is necessary for wartime, crisis, peace  support, and deterrence operations. The funds will support responses to  the challenges posed by Russian aggression, as well as the risks and  threats emanating from the Middle East and North Africa.   Two amendments passed by the Senate will protect women's reproductive  and childcare rights so their careers are not impaired by pregnancy and  motherhood. By the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act being added to the  omnibus, women will not face discrimination or adverse career impacts  due to being pregnant, and, by having access to a place at work to  breastfeed, women can balance work and family life when they have a new  baby, without adverse impacts to their careers.   The omnibus bolsters our ability to defend democracy and counter  China through funding to protect a free and open Indo-Pacific region.   The legislation enables us to repair roads and highways, expand  bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, improve Federal auto safety  programs, and upgrade public transit systems, implementing the historic  investments that were enacted in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs  Act.   The bill includes $900 million for global health security and $2  billion for the replenishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,  Tuberculosis, and
