 Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman and ranking member for  the hard work putting this NDAA together.   I rise today in support of the National Defense Authorization Act  because I am deeply, deeply concerned about the current direction of  our military.   We are at a critical juncture in our Nation's history. This  unclassified chart you see here shows the threat of the Chinese  Communist Party; they are in red; we are in blue.   It is a sad story. They are outpacing us at every aspect in the  military. With escalating tensions in the Indo-Pacific, China's blatant  threats against Taiwan, and our military recruitment falling here in  the U.S., we face significant challenges.   We came to Washington because we believe in America. We believe in a  brighter future for our children, and we believe that we are the  greatest country on Earth, but our military is being weakened from  within.   The woke ideologies are killing confidence, killing motivation,  killing recruitment, and the excellence of our military. These woke  policies of diversity, equity, inclusion, and critical race theory must  stop. The enemy does not care about the color of the skin of  our servicemembers and does not care what pronoun they use.    We must make changes, and the NDAA starts those changes. It starts  with leaders willing to take a stand.   Mr. Chair, again, I urge all of my colleagues to support the NDAA.
