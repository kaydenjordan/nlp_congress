 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 24) to provide for the compensation of Federal and other  government employees affected by lapses in appropriations.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 24         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Government Employee Fair       Treatment Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. COMPENSATION FOR FEDERAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENT                     EMPLOYEES AFFECTED BY A LAPSE IN                     APPROPRIATIONS.         Section 1341 of title 31, United States Code, is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(1), by striking ``An officer'' and       inserting ``Except as specified in this subchapter or any       other provision of law, an officer''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(c)(1) In this subsection--        ``(A) the term `covered lapse in appropriations' means any       lapse in appropriations that begins on or after December 22,       2018;        ``(B) the term `District of Columbia public employer'       means--        ``(i) the District of Columbia Courts;        ``(ii) the Public Defender Service for the District of       Columbia; or        ``(iii) the District of Columbia government;        ``(C) the term `employee' includes an officer; and        ``(D) the term `excepted employee' means an excepted       employee or an employee performing emergency work, as such       terms are defined by the Office of Personnel Management or       the appropriate District of Columbia public employer, as       applicable.        ``(2) Each employee of the United States Government or of a       District of Columbia public employer furloughed as a result       of a covered lapse in appropriations shall be paid for the       period of the lapse in appropriations, and each excepted       employee who is required to perform work during a covered       lapse in appropriations shall be paid for such work, at the       employee's standard rate of pay, at the earliest date       possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless       of scheduled pay dates.        ``(3) During a covered lapse in appropriations, each       excepted employee who is required to perform work shall be       entitled to use leave under chapter 63 of title 5, or any       other applicable law governing the use of leave by the       excepted employee, for which compensation shall be paid at       the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations       ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As we, Mr. Speaker, enter day 21 of the Trump shutdown, it is  incumbent upon the House to do everything we can to address the pain  and suffering being felt by dedicated Federal workers who are missing  their paychecks.   Most of them are living from paycheck to paycheck, and now they  approach this day, on Friday, having moved from paycheck to no check.   Today, 800,000 Federal employees will not receive their first  paycheck of this new year. Regardless of what Members think about the  causes of the shutdown, every single one of us should agree that  hardworking Federal employees who give their blood, their sweat, and  their tears to lifting us up as a Nation should not be held hostage to  politics as a result.   Mr. Speaker, 380,000 Federal employees have been furloughed and  locked out of their offices. Another 420,000 hardworking Federal  employees are working without pay.   We will see them at our airports. We will see them working today and  tomorrow, as they have been for the last many days, without pay. Some  even had to cancel already scheduled vacation days or sick leave to  report to work.   These 800,000 men and women include personnel at the Federal Aviation  Administration; the Bureau of Prisons; the Federal Bureau of  Investigation; the Department of Homeland Security; the Food and Drug  Administration; and the Departments of Agriculture, Treasury, and  Justice.   These are the men and women who keep our country safe, ensure the  safety of our airports and food, protect our national parks, and, yes,  keep our economy moving.   S. 24 would provide back pay to Federal employees furloughed during  this shutdown and potential future shutdowns.   The measure also would allow essential employees to use their annual  leave instead of having to cancel already scheduled and approved  vacation plans.   Many Federal employees are suffering. But not only are they  suffering, Mr. Speaker, their children are suffering. They are in pain;  they are worried; and they are scared. You see, they have mortgages and  car loans to pay, day care expenses to cover, and food to put on the  table.   And even while they struggle to pay these bills, furloughed employees  face the stress and anxiety of not knowing whether or not they will be  paid when the shutdown ends. The least we can do is to relieve that  uncertainty.   The President claims that Federal employees support this pointless  shutdown. He also had the nerve to say: Why don't they just adjust.   Adjust with what? And how?   I have not heard from a single Federal employee that they support  this shutdown. What they want to do is to get back to work serving the  American people, and what they are saying over and over again is:  Government, do not hurt us; help us. Do not hurt us; help us.   So, promising they will receive back pay once the shutdown ends is  the least that we can do.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, this bill passed the Senate with every single  Senator's consent, and President Trump has indicated that he will sign  it. I urge every Member of the House to do the same and support this  bill, and let's end this shutdown and get the government open and  working again.  [[Page H499]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), distinguished Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from the State of Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader of this great  House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, first of all, I thank the distinguished gentleman, Mr.  Hurd, for his cooperation in working with us, always approaching these  issues with a commonsense attitude and always striving for  bipartisanship. We look forward to working with him and others to  continue to support our Federal employees.   As this shutdown drags on, it is wreaking havoc, Madam Speaker, with  the lives of patriotic Federal workers who just want to get back to  work, and they need their paycheck.   Hundreds of dedicated public servants have called my office as this  shutdown goes on record as one of the longest in history. They are  worried and anxious about how they will pay their bills.   For example, the shutdown is having a dire effect on a 30-year  employee at the IRS whose finances and health are being imperiled. She  has multiple sclerosis and needs a monthly injection that has a $50  copay, which she simply cannot afford. She hasn't paid her mortgage,  and her lender won't give her a break.   This is not an isolated example. Thousands of Federal employees face  similar circumstances.   Madam Speaker, we must end this shutdown and send our Federal  employees back to work as soon as possible. I urge all Members of the  House to vote in favor of this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
