 Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small  business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit at the  heart of our country. It is my privilege to recognize a woman-owned  small business that provides critical medical supplies to hospitals and  laboratories nationwide. This week, it is my pleasure to honor Mercedes  Scientific of Lakewood Ranch, FL, as the Senate Small Business of the  Week.   In 1991, Noelle Haft and Hank Traynor founded Mercedes Scientific in  New Hyde Park, NY. The two were veterans of the medical supply  industry, combining their scientific expertise and knowledge of  laboratory distribution to start their own small business. At the time,  it was known as Mercedes Medical. Drawn by the weather and welcoming  business regulations, Mercedes Medical relocated to Florida in 1993.  When Hank retired, Noelle and her husband, Rob, continued running the  company along with their daughter, Alex Miller.   Over the next few decades, Mercedes Medical remained a family-owned  company as it grew into a notable medical supplier. The company moved  into their Lakewood Ranch facility in 2018 and expanded to provide  laboratory equipment and personal protective equipment, PPE. They  rebranded as Mercedes Scientific in 2019 due to their growing focus on  serving the research, laboratory, and scientific communities.   Mercedes Scientific is active in the community. They donate medical  supplies to local organizations and businesses, as well as educational  institutions nationwide. The company supports international nonprofit  missions, such as helping medical facilities recover from natural  disasters. Closer to home, Mercedes Scientific is a team build partner  with Habitat for Humanity in Sarasota, FL. They also work with the  Lakewood Ranch Business Alliance to promote local economic development.   Like many small businesses in Florida, Mercedes Scientific  experienced supply chain disruptions due to the coronavirus pandemic.  As a medical supply company, they play a critical role in securing  laboratory supplies, PPE, and COVID-19 test kits. Mercedes Scientific  works tirelessly with laboratories and hospitals in Florida and  throughout the Nation to ensure they receive the resources needed to  combat the pandemic.   When the U.S. Small Business Administration launched the Paycheck  Protection Program, PPP, Mercedes Scientific applied for funding. The  PPP provides forgivable loans to impacted small businesses and  nonprofits who maintain their payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Thanks to a PPP loan, Mercedes Scientific was able to keep their 67  employees paid and remain focused on its mission sourcing medical  supplies.   Mercedes Scientific is a notable example of the key role small  businesses play in America's medical supply chains. I commend their  continued work to provide essential hospital and laboratory supplies as  the United States confronts the coronavirus pandemic. Congratulations  to Noelle, Rob, Alex, and the whole team. I look forward to your  continued success, growth, and success in the Lakewood Ranch  area.                            ____________________
