 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of an  individual in my district who has been the true embodiment of Iowa nice  and midwestern tough his entire life.   Darrell Harris has lived his entire life in rural southeastern Iowa.   Darrell grew up very poor and dropped out of school in the eighth  grade to help take care of his family.   Throughout his life, Darrell spent time working on the railroad and  started a family farm that is still in operation today.   Darrell was lucky enough to marry the woman of his dreams and have  three beautiful children with her.   Sadly, his wife passed away at a young age, leaving Darrell as a  single father to raise three young children.   Nevertheless, Darrell kept his head down and he worked hard, never  asking for help and always willing to lend a hand when others needed  it.   Darrell's work ethic, kindness, and never-give-up attitude are an  inspiration to us all, and I am proud to represent him in Congress.                            ____________________
