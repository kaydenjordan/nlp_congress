 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 771) standing with Israel as it defends itself  against the barbaric war launched by Hamas and other terrorists.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 771         Whereas on October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists launched a       massive, unprovoked war on Israel by air, land, and sea,       including firing thousands of rockets;        Whereas this heinous assault took place just after the 50th       anniversary of the start of the multi-front 1973 Yom Kippur       War against Israel;        Whereas Hamas terrorists crossed the land border and began       slaughtering Israelis and abducting hostages in towns in       southern Israel, including children and the elderly;        Whereas since October 7, 2023, Hamas launched over 4,500       rockets into southern and central Israel;        Whereas since October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists have killed       over 900 Israelis and injured more than 2,600 others;        Whereas at least 11 United States citizens in Israel are       among those killed by Hamas since October 7, 2023;        Whereas since October 7, 2023, Hamas is directly       responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Palestinians;        Whereas the expansion of this war to other fronts by       Hezbollah, Iran, or others would create an even more       devastating regional catastrophe;        Whereas Hamas is a United States-designated Foreign       Terrorist Organization;        Whereas Iran has long provided support to Hamas and other       terrorist groups and proxies, and prior United States       Government unclassified assessments indicated that, ``Iran       has historically provided up to $100 million annually in       combined support to Palestinian terrorist groups, including       Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and the Popular Front       for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command'';        Whereas Hamas used rudimentary, civilian equipment, such as       bulldozers, paragliders, and rubber boats in its assault on       Israel, demonstrating the importance of fully enforcing tight       controls on what materials go into the Gaza Strip, including       through thorough vetting of assistance;        Whereas under the 2016 U.S.-Israel Memorandum of       Understanding, the United States pledged to provide Israel       $3.3 billion per year in Foreign Military Financing Program       assistance and $500 million per year in missile defense for       10 years, which Congress has appropriated annually;        Whereas section 1273 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry       National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021       authorized not less than $3.3 billion in Foreign Military       Financing Program assistance for Israel for each of the       fiscal years 2021 through 2028, in accordance with the 2016       U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding;        Whereas Congress has responded with additional       appropriations beyond the terms of the 2016 U.S.-Israel       Memorandum of Understanding as needed, including in March       2022 when Congress appropriated an additional $1 billion for       Iron Dome defense system after the May 2021 conflict in which       Hamas launched more than 4,400 rockets at Israel; and        Whereas Israel is a major non-NATO ally and Major Strategic       Partner of the United States: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) stands with Israel as it defends itself against the       barbaric war launched by Hamas and other terrorists;        (2) reaffirms Israel's right to self-defense;        (3) condemns Hamas' brutal war against Israel;  [[Page H5054]]         (4) calls on all countries to unequivocally condemn Hamas'       brutal war against Israel;        (5) calls on Hamas to immediately cease these violent       attacks and safely release all living hostages and return the       bodies of deceased hostages;        (6) mourns the over 900 Israelis and 11 Americans killed       and over 2,600 others wounded in Hamas' unprovoked attack on       Israel;        (7) reaffirms the United States' commitment to Israel's       security, including through security assistance in accordance       with the 2016 U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding;        (8) urges full enforcement of the Taylor Force Act (title X       of division S of Public Law 115-141; 132 Stat. 1143) and       other restrictions in United States law to prevent United       States foreign assistance from benefiting terrorists,       directly or indirectly;        (9) condemns Iran's support for terrorist groups and       proxies, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad;        (10) urges full enforcement of United States sanctions       against Iran to prevent Iran's funding of terrorist groups,       including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad; and        (11) stands ready to assist Israel with emergency resupply       and other security, diplomatic, and intelligence support.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to extend debate for  each side by 10 minutes, and I also ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, October 7, Israelis awoke to rockets  raining down on them from Gaza, and gunmen broke down their doors and  invaded their homes.   Hamas terrorists killed babies and toddlers. They killed elderly  grandmothers and grandfathers. They killed moms and dads. They killed  teenage kids in their homes. No one was spared from their brutality.   Following World War II, my father's war, I never believed the world  would bear witness to the slaughter of the Jewish people as we have  seen at the bloody hands of Hamas. October 7 was the deadliest day for  the Jewish people since the Holocaust.   Additionally, Hamas is holding 220 hostages, including Americans.  This is a flyer with a picture of a mother and son taken hostage by  Hamas, #bringthemhomenow.   They are using them as human shields and threatening to execute them.  They must all be released unconditionally now.   This is one of the darkest moments in the history of the State of  Israel.   I was in one of the kibbutzim right on the border of Gaza last year,  meeting with members of the community. I saw their daycare center. That  very same kibbutz was overrun by 70 Hamas terrorists. Many of the  residents I met were slaughtered.   Most viciously, the babies and the children I visited in the daycare  center were slaughtered, shot to death, beheaded, and burned alive.   When the press says it didn't happen, they are just wrong. It did  because I have seen the pictures of the burned babies and the  decapitated children and the blood that you see here in the babies'  cribs.   For God's sake, what is going on in this world today?   In one of the most horrific stories to emerge, a pregnant woman had  her baby cut out in front of her very eyes as they murdered her baby  before her and before they shot her in the head.   Simply put, Mr. Speaker, they are monsters.   At a music festival to celebrate peace, chaos, gunfire, and  explosions ripped through the air, piercing hundreds of bodies with  bullets and shrapnel. While the attendees attempted to flee the area,  gunmen surrounded them from every direction. In total, 260 attendees  assembled in peace to enjoy music were massacred.   Among others, atrocities we have heard reported include children with  their hands bound, shot in the back of the head execution style; women  who were raped and slaughtered, one of whom was dragged through the  streets of Gaza; families, including babies and young children, burned  alive in their homes in front of their parents; the beheading of  Israeli soldiers; and parents gunned down as they shielded their  children before the onslaught of gunfire.   This is sheer terror. It is evil. It cannot stand in this world.   We are witnessing in real time Hamas carrying out their covenant that  outlines their goal of eradicating Israel through jihad. In fact, their  covenant states: ``Israel will exist and will continue to exist until  Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.''   They specifically discuss jihad, noting: ``The day that enemies usurp  part of Muslim land, jihad becomes the individual duty of every Muslim.  In face of the Jews' usurpation . . . , it is compulsory that the  banner of jihad be raised.''   Mr. Speaker, it was indeed raised on October 7.   To be completely clear, despite repeated efforts by Israel to secure  peace, the ``Hamas Covenant'' states: Peace ``initiatives, and so- called peaceful solutions and international conferences, are in  contradiction to the principles of the Islamic Resistance  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on  Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the vice chair of the Committee on Foreign  Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Mrs. Kim), the chair of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on the Indo-Pacific.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Issa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Burchett), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Jackson), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Kentucky.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Kean), the chair of the Subcommittee on Europe.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Lawler), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Moran), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Rose).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Pfluger).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Idaho  (Mr. Fulcher).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mr. Meeks, as well.   Mr. Speaker, that is how the Foreign Affairs Committee operates. The  fact that this is the most bipartisan resolution in modern history with  425 cosponsors, over 97 percent of this body, speaks volumes. It sends  a strong message to the people of Israel that the United States  Congress and the American people stand firmly behind you.   The Hamas Covenant states, ``Ranks will close, fighters joining other  fighters, and masses everywhere in the Islamic world will come forward  in response to the call of duty, loudly proclaiming: `Hail to Jihad.'  This cry will reach the heavens and will go on being resounded until  liberation is achieved, the invaders vanquished, and Allah's victory  comes about.''   In response to this, we will strengthen our resolve to stand with our  ally Israel. This resolution sends a clear and unequivocal message that  the United States House of Representatives and the American people  condemn the barbarity of the genocide and war crimes perpetrated by  Hamas. We want to make it clear that Israel has the right to defend  herself to prevent an event like this from ever happening again.   We assure you that the United States will be shoulder to shoulder  with Israel supporting her right to self-defense.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
