 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong  and unwavering support for H.R. 5, the Dream and Promise Act.   I am proud to represent the 29th Congressional District of Texas. One  of the things I am most proud of is the strong and vibrant immigration  communities that reside in our district, where thousands of DACA, TPS,  and DED recipients live, work, and play beside us as neighbors and  colleagues. If Dreamers were forced to leave our district tomorrow, we  would lose over $400 million of GDP.   Our immigration policies put politics over people, which often hurt  our children who are in constant fear of being separated and uprooted  from the country they call their own. This is wrong for our economy.  This is wrong for our communities. This is wrong for our country.   It is time that we pass a permanent solution for these vital members  of our society, which is why I urge all my colleagues to support H.R.  5.                            ____________________
