 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in  the Record the following letters from Senator Hoeven and me to the  chairman and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions, and from Margaret Zientek to Senator  Murkowski and Congressman Young.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                        U.S. Senate,                                     Committee on Indian Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, November 28, 2017.      Senator Lamar Alexander,      Chairman.      Senator Patty Murray,      Ranking Member,      Committee Health, Education, Labor & Pensions, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.        Senators: As the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the       Committee of jurisdiction, we affirmatively state for the       record our agreement with the Tribal Working Group's analysis       dated November 27, 2017 that Head Start program administered       by the Department of Health and Human Services is not a       program that is eligible under Public Law 102-477 or H.R.       228/S. 91.            Sincerely,      John Hoeven,        Chairman.      Tom Udall,        Vice Chairman.                                   ____                                                 Public Law 102-477,                                                Tribal Workgroup,                                                  November 27, 2017.        Dear Senator Murkowski and Congressman Young: A question       has arisen whether Public Law 102-477, or either H.R. 228 or       S. 91, reaches the Headstart program administered by the       Department of Health and Human Services. It is our       understanding that neither the current law nor either bill       authorizes the inclusion of the Headstart program in a       ``477'' plan.        Thank you for your continued advocacy on these critical       bills.            Sincerely,                                                  Margaret Zientek,      Co-Chair P.L. 102-477 Tribal Work.                            ____________________
