 Mr. President, I didn't come to the floor to speak to  the nominee who is before us this afternoon, but following the very  impassioned comments by my colleagues, in fairness, on both sides of  the aisle and recognizing the vote that I just took about an hour ago  to advance Vanita Gupta to this position, I will take just a moment to  explain where I am coming from and why I will be supporting her final  confirmation in just an hour.   I have looked at her record. I have had an extensive sitdown with  her. I am impressed with not only her professional credentials but  really the level of experience, but more to the comments that we just  heard on the floor, the passion that she carries with her in the work  that she performs.   I think it is fair to say we will all agree her confirmation has been  very challenged. She has had significant back-and-forth in committee.  She has been elevated with very strong rhetorical words in favor and,  equally, words of condemnation.   I asked her point blank: Why do you want this? Is this worth it?  Because this has been, clearly, very hard on her as a nominee. She  paused and reflected a moment and just spoke to how she feels called to  serve in a very personal way that I thought was impactful.   We had a long discussion about some of the issues that I care deeply  about in my State as they relate to justice, access to justice, public  safety, and the real tragedy that we face when it comes to women,  primarily our Native women, who experience rates of domestic violence  and sexual assault that are shocking, disturbing, and wrong. Despite  all that we have as a State, the resources we have, the opportunities  we have, we have not been able to turn the corner as we have needed to  in confronting what I believe is a true scourge.   It is going to take more than resources. Jurisdictionally, it is very  complicated in Alaska. We don't have reservations. We don't have  similar law enforcement presence in many parts of the State that you  might have in the lower 48.   We have a great deal of work to do as a State. But as we discussed  these issues, I felt that I was speaking to a woman who had not only  committed a professional life to try to get to the base of these  injustices, to try to not just direct a little bit of money, put a  program in place, walk away, and call it a day, but to truly try to  make a difference.   So there are some statements that she has made in some other areas  that, in fairness, I find troubling and concerning, and part of my job  will be to ensure that she understands clearly how this translates into  issues in my State and with our particular issues. But I am going to  give the benefit of the doubt to a woman who I believe has demonstrated  through her professional career to be deeply, deeply committed to  matters of justice. So I will be casting my vote in support of her in  about an hour here.    Mr. President, I came to the floor today to talk about  something that has been top of my mind for a period of time, and I  wanted to bring it to Members' attention today because of some recent  articles of late as it relates to national security and global  competitiveness, particularly as they relate to domestic resource  development.   In recent months, since the beginning of this administration, I have  spoken out in concern at the direction that I have seen the new  administration take with regard to energy security and how that relates  to Alaska. I have spoken out at length about my opposition to several  of these Executive orders that were very early on relating to leasing  and permitting moratoria in my State. In fact, there were eight  specific orders that were directed to one State and to one State only.  That is a pretty hard hit for Alaska.   In other areas, I don't believe that additional Federal lands and  waters in Alaska should be placed off-limits. We  [[Page S2100]]  already as a State hold more public lands than any other State, and by  considerable degree. I don't believe our public land order removal  process should be paused.   This was an announcement that just came out of the Department of the  Interior last week. They say they are pausing it, but effectively, it  could be delayed or abandoned not just for these next 2 years going  forward but permanently. What this effectively does is it creates  almost de facto wilderness, if you will, because you have placed land  in a limbo, in a purgatory for decades. Nobody can do anything with it  as these PLOs, these public land orders remain in place.   I note--no great secret around here--like most Alaskans, I strongly  support our resource development industry and the men and the women who  work within it. They are my friends. They are my neighbors. I fish with  them. I recognize the importance and the value of what they do. I have  worked hard here in the Senate and for a long time to ensure that the  industry's continued centrality is allowed to prosper, not only because  of them, the people I know, but because of what it means for our  country, for our economy, our State's budget, our prosperity, and also  for our environment.   After years of lagging behind, the United States has come to a better  place on energy in recent years. We have seen domestic production  rising. We have seen our emissions falling. We have created jobs. We  have generated revenues. We have changed the world geopolitically even  as we have lessened our impact on the climate. But these kinds of gains  can't be taken for granted. They can't be actively ignored. They  certainly should not be discarded.   We have to acknowledge that this energy renewal has not been even  across the country. It has taken place largely on State and private  lands. We have very limited private land in Alaska. And instate  activity--we have been proudly producing for a while. But we also have,  again, much land that is federally held, and we have only seen help  arrive with any kind of activity and production on Federal land in the  past few years. I would suggest that we cannot afford that forward  progress to be reversed, but unfortunately that is the way it feels  right now. The threat is that this administration is going to take an  approach that is going to take us backwards.    So the question, I think, is a fair one for us to ask, to discuss  here. It is an important question. What happens if we just decide we  are going to turn our backs on this, our American energy? What happens  if we really do move in this direction of just keeping it in the  ground? What happens if we really do close our eyes to our domestic  energy sources, these assets, if we close our eyes to the contributions  that they provide?   I will suggest to you that there are a few warning signs that we have  up on the horizon. Oil prices are back up above $60 a barrel. This  actually helps my State; I will be honest there. We will accept that  for budgetary purposes. But we all talk about what happens typically  around Memorial Day. We have driving season coming on. We are still in  the midst of a pandemic. But if the United States artificially  restricts its supplies and demand rebounds rapidly, where does this put  us?   I mentioned that there have been some articles of late that just  really kind of struck me. It is interesting because I thought they were  pretty significant, but it seems they are relatively unnoticed here in  Washington.   According to Bloomberg, Russia has now supplanted Saudi Arabia to  become the third largest supplier of crude oil in the United States.  Canada is our No. 1. But there has been a series of circumstances. As  our domestic production is falling, the Saudis have also reduced  theirs, and it has been Venezuela. Venezuela is subject to sanctions.  Their production has pretty much gone offline to the United States.   Part of what we are seeing, though, is the refusal on the Federal  Government's side to approve cross-border pipeline infrastructure.  Canada, again, is our largest--we import more from Canada than anywhere  else, and they have greater capacity to help us out here so that we  don't have to take it from Russia. But, instead, we haven't been able  to take more from Canada to fill in that gap because of pipeline  capacity. So what happens is, we are sending more of our money to  Russia at a time when we are not on very good terms with Russia. Need  we say elections? Need we say SolarWinds? Need we say what we are  seeing from Putin?   This is what is happening: We are sending more of our dollars to  Russia, and they are sending us more of the resources that we could  produce here at home or perhaps at least import them from some  friendlier nations.   U.S. crude oil production fell from an average high of 12.2 million  barrels per day in 2019 to an average of 11.3 million in 2020.  According to the Energy Information Administration, this loss in  domestic production will return the United States to being a net  petroleum importer in 2021 and 2022. By all accounts, a sizable chunk  of this will come from Russia.   What is going to happen is, we are going to move from this position  where we have been in these past few years where we have had some real  energy security here because we have been producing, and we have been  producing to the point that we have been able to even supply to our  friends and allies. But now, with policies that are taking us in a  different direction and still knowing that we need the resource, we are  turning to Russia.   This is what really galls me so much: In 2020, the United States  imported 538,000 barrels of oil per day from Russia. In Alaska--we  recognize Alaska is a great producing State. Despite our immense  potential and desire to bring it to market, in 2020, we were producing  an average of 448,000 barrels per day.   It just begs the question: Is this what we really want? Is this what  we really want, for Russia to account for more of America's energy  supply than Alaska? We both have similar environments, both big, but  oil production goes on in areas that are tough to produce in. I will  hold Alaska's environmental record over that of Russia any day--in  fact, over most countries and even most States any day.   One article put it this way. They said: ``America's increasing  reliance on Russian oil is at odds with U.S. energy diplomacy.''   Let's kind of put it in context. The position that we have taken with  Nord Stream 2--basically what we have said is that we are asking those  in Europe who need Russia's gas--we are saying we need to be tough on  this. We need to break Russia's hold here. For all the years--it has  been 7 years since Russia annexed Crimea and demonstrated to the world  that they are not afraid to flex their muscles when it comes to energy  exports in order to achieve their geopolitical goals.   So we have been saying on Nord Stream 2: Europe, you guys, don't go  there. Yet we have to look at ourselves here because we are telling  Europe ``Limit your reliance on Russia for gas,'' but over here, we are  happy to step up our imports from Russia on oil.   The President has just recently imposed tougher sanctions on Russia,  as he absolutely should, but I think we need to be eyes wide open here,  folks, in terms of what it means when we need that resource.   I do recognize that much of this discussion on Russia and how Russia  has supplemented Venezuelan crude--I recognize that most of the oil  that is being imported is heavy and that this is a situation with our  gulf coast refineries that are specifically geared for that. I do  recognize that they have fewer options right now, but I do think this  is a conversation that we need to be talking about. We just can't sit  back and say: Well, this is just the way it is.    Congress and the administration need to be taking the steps necessary  to ensure that we in this country have a strong, stable supply of  domestic energy to meet our current demand, our future demand, and, to  the greatest extent possible, the demand from our allies.   Russia is positioning itself to capitalize on all of that. They  produce from wherever they want, and they are going to sell to wherever  they can.   The least that we can do here at home is to support our own  responsible production from States like Alaska, so that we have our  supply--our own supply--and can provide a diversified commercial  alternative.   Moving from oil and gas briefly here, Alaska is also ready to help in  another increasingly crucial area and that is  [[Page S2101]]  with mineral development. Our history of tectonic events has created a  geological environment that fosters deposits of a wide variety of  minerals that are critical to both our current and our future  economies.   Back in 2018, the Department of the Interior designated 35  ``critical'' minerals based on their importance to our economy and  security, as well as their susceptibility to supply and disruption.  These minerals are essential for everything. They help us with our  advanced missile systems, solar panels, batteries for electric  vehicles, your cell phones--everything. Our military is certainly aware  of this. They recognize the vulnerable position that we are in. Our  manufacturers recognize the vulnerability. These are products that we  use on a daily basis.   Right now, the United States is import-reliant on 31 of the 35  minerals designated as ``critical.'' We have relatively no domestic  production. We rely completely on imports to meet our demand for 14 of  these. And, of course, most of where we are importing these materials  are from China. That is not OK. That shouldn't be acceptable to us. I  think we all should agree on the need to rebuild our domestic mineral  supply chains. There has been good, positive conversation about what we  can do.   I feel this is one of those areas that is a growing vulnerability. It  used to be that we would talk about our vulnerability on the Middle  East for our oil, and then policies changed and we reduced our reliance  on that. That is why I am anxious. I am concerned about what I am  seeing translate going forward. But I think we need to be, again, with  eyes wide open when it comes to our mineral dependence and our reliance  on these important materials for what we need to be a strong nation.   I think this is a pressing and long-term security threat that we face  in this country. We have seen it play out in light of the COVID  pandemic. We have seen the vulnerability of international supply  chains. I thought it was great. It was so important that the  administration really focused in on this. The new administration is  focusing on this in a good way, and I appreciate that.   When President Biden released the first part of his infrastructure  proposal, focusing on international domestic supply chains, he has one  section there about electric vehicles. In the White House fact sheet,  it says the plan ``will enable automakers to spur domestic supply  chains from raw materials to parts, retool factories to compete  globally, and support American workers to make batteries and EVs.''   This is the type of policy that we should all want to get behind,  broadened out to every industry, not just to a select few. But the  question here, though, is whether the administration is willing to  accept what is going to be necessary in order to achieve this goal to  have these secure supply chains, especially when it comes to expanding  our domestic supply of raw materials. It is going to require approval  of mining projects, and that has been a challenge for us. That has been  a challenge for us.   This is where I go to another article that came up a few weeks back.  This is from Reuters. It appears to me that rather than looking within  our own borders, the administration is looking beyond. In this article  from Reuters, it states that the United States looks to Canada for  minerals to build electric vehicles. It provides:         The U.S. Government is working to help American miners and       battery makers expand into Canada, part of a strategy to       boost regional production of minerals used to make electric       vehicles and counter Chinese competitors.    It goes on further to talk about the different ways that the  Department of Commerce is discussing with many how we can boost  Canadian production of EV materials. It goes on further to say:         But Washington is increasingly viewing Canada as a kind of       ``51st State'' for mineral supply purposes.    I am a big fan of Canada. They are our neighbor, but if we are going  to be adding Canada as a 51st State to help us with our minerals and  access to minerals, let's not forget the 49th State, because Alaska has  good, strong resources. Where we seem to have problems is in gaining  access, whether it is in the permitting process or just the ability to  move forward with some of our mineral potential.   Again, I am not suggesting that we shouldn't be looking to our  friends to build these alliances, particularly with our neighbors  directly to the north and to the south. This is good. I am not  suggesting: Let's not be talking to Canada.   That is an important part of how we really work to build these secure  supply chains. All I am suggesting is that we here in America need to  also look to the strength of our resource assets.   There are some--again, the issue of mining in this country sometimes  can be a controversial one. I am going to suggest to folks that if we  really want to do more to build out not only our national security but  if we want to build out our clean, diverse energy infrastructure,  moving toward the President's vision of greater renewable  opportunities, which I want to do, let's acknowledge that we are going  to need these minerals. We don't really have a choice here.    The World Bank recently released a report looking at ``The Mineral  Intensity of the Clean Energy Transition.'' They found that ``large  relative increases in demand of up to nearly 500 percent are estimated  for certain minerals, especially those concentrated in energy storage  technologies, such as lithium, graphite, and cobalt.'' The report also  found that ``even with large increases in recycling--including  scenarios where 100 percent end of life recycling is achieved--there is  still likely to be strong demand for primary minerals.''   We know we are going to need it. People like Elon Musk last year  said: ``Please mine more nickel.'' He promised: ``Tesla will give you a  giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently  and in an environmentally sensitive way.''   I am with you on that.   Look at the analysis from Goldman Sachs, which found that increasing  demand for electric car batteries is causing automakers to brace for a  surge in prices in lithium, cobalt, and nickel.   In order for us to get there from here, in order to achieve a  transition to renewable and cleaner technologies, we have to  acknowledge that there is going to be a mineral footprint. It will be  impossible to establish a robust domestic supply chain for EVs and  batteries if we continue to import the raw materials from other  nations, including some that continue to dramatically outcompete us in  these areas every year.   I think we need a rational, clear-headed, eyes-wide-open approach to  energy and mineral development. We don't want to go backward on energy,  and we can't be caught flatfooted on minerals. We have the resources.  We have the highest labor standards in the world and the highest  environmental standards in the world. Our energy workers and our miners  will hold themselves to those standards. Instead of importing more from  places like Russia and China, we need to free ourselves from them to  the extent that we can establish ourselves as this global alternative.   I have kind of taken that--actually, it is not something new. In the  beginning of the 116th Congress, I prepared a white paper. We called it  ``The American and Global''--well, what we called it was a pretty cool  title. It is a great little publication that should have gotten more  notice, but like a good wine, it comes with time: ``'With Powers So  Disposed,' America and the Global Strategic Energy Competition.''   I outline in this a strategic energy initiative designed to sharpen  and direct our tools of energy related to economic statecraft and to  enhance the geopolitical position of the country.   From that or as a jump-off from that, I am introducing my Strategic  Energy and Minerals Initiative Act, which we call the SEMI Act. This  legislation will enable U.S. companies to better compete in global  markets, and it promotes the responsible domestic production of our  oil, gas, and minerals. I think these are initiatives that are good for  us to be looking critically at, again, as we move forward with this  administration's priorities on not only how we can build  infrastructure--build it better, build it cleaner, build it with a  renewable future--but we have to recognize that when we build things,  we need base elements.   Know that Alaska is ready, willing, and able to play a role on all of  these fronts. We have tremendous stores of  [[Page S2102]]  resources, but equal to those tremendous stores of resources is the  responsibility that I believe Alaskans feel to be good stewards as we  access those resources to allow for a level of sustainability, whether  it is with our fisheries or whether it is with the subsistence, the  livelihoods of those who rely on the food and animals on the land. We  believe that we can contribute to our national security and our global  competitiveness, while at the same time working to protect the  environment, but what we need is a chance to be able to do that.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, before I begin my comments, I ask  unanimous consent that Cristina Nelson, my Coast Guard fellow, be  granted floor privileges for the remainder of her fellowship.
