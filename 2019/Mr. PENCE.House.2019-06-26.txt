 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the New  Palestine High School softball team who capped their record-setting  season with a 10-0 victory in the State title game.   This is the Dragons' third State title in as many years. Over the  last 3 years, this dynasty has been unstoppable. Their record is a  staggering 90-6.   This season the Dragons won each game of the State tournament by at  least 10 runs, a feat which has never been accomplished in Indiana  State history. They are also the first softball team in Indiana history  to win back, to back, to back.   Through everything, they personified hard work and team spirit, and I  recognize Ed Marcum and the New Palestine Dragons for this historic  accomplishment.                            ____________________
