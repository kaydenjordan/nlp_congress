 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support for the  Respect for Marriage Act, an historic step forward in Democrats' fight  to defend the dignity and equality of every American.   Let us salute those who have legislated and advocated relentlessly to  make this bill the law of the land. I thank the chairman of the  Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler, Equality Caucus Chair   David  Cicilline, and all of the members of the Equality Caucus, and the  grassroots activists out there, without whose mobilization so many  pieces of legislation to expand freedom in our country would not be  possible.   I say that because when I came to this floor 35 years ago, my first  speech on the floor, after I was sworn in, was to talk about--say that  I came here to fight HIV and AIDS. What I learned after that is we had  to fight against discrimination against people with HIV and AIDS.   Two people who were so significant in that are Phyllis and Del, Del  Martin and Phyllis Lyon, champions in our country. Well, I will talk  about them in a moment.   First, I want to salute the Senate for its strong bipartisan  legislation, the leadership of Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and  Senator Tammy Baldwin, and the bipartisan, strong support that this  House gave the legislation to send it over to the Senate.   Marriage equality has been law across our country since 2015 and,  proudly, even longer in the State of California. Indeed, my thoughts  today are with Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, two dear friends and iconic  trailblazers. I have brought their picture to the floor time and time  again to talk about freedom and dignity and respect so many times.   Nearly two decades ago, their enduring love made history as they  joyfully, joyfully said their vows in San Francisco City Hall, the  first. In the years since, the same euphoria has blessed couples and  bonded families in every corner of America.   Yet, since the Supreme Court's monstrous decision overturning Roe v.  Wade, rightwing forces have set their sights on this basic personal  freedom.   In his concurrent opinion, Clarence Thomas explicitly called on the  Court to reconsider its ruling in Obergefell. While his legal reasoning  is twisted and unsound, we must take Justice Thomas at his word and the  hateful movement behind him at their word.   We must act now, on a bipartisan, bicameral basis, to combat bigoted  extremism and uphold the inviolability of same-sex and interracial  marriages.   Once signed into law, the Respect for Marriage Act will help prevent  rightwing extremists from: Upending the lives of loving couples,  traumatizing kids across the country, and turning back the clock on  hard-won progress.   This legislation takes several steps to uphold marriage equality  under Federal law.   First, it tears the bigoted, unconstitutional Defense of Marriage Act  off the books for good. When that bill was passed, our colleagues  understood that it was not constitutional. Why else would they have  tried to strip the judicial review of the Defense of Marriage Act if  they thought it could take the test of judicial review?   Today's vote will codify a legal reality already handed down by the  Supreme Court and ensure DOMA can never again be used to justify  hateful discrimination.   Second, the Respect for Marriage Act will enshrine married couples'  right to equal protection under Federal law, from tax filings to Social  Security, to bereavement and veterans' benefits.   Third, this legislation will require that every State recognize all  valid out-of-state marriages, regardless of any heinous restrictions  imposed by particular State law.   This legislation is the latest step in House Democrats' fight to win  full equality for LGBTQ Americans and forge a more perfect union that  our children and their children, all of our children deserve.    Fighting alongside tireless advocates, we transformed the fight  against HIV/AIDS, here at home and around the world; and I thank  President Bush for his leadership in that regard as well, all of our  Presidents--well, up until a certain point.   We tossed Don't Ask, Don't Tell into the dustbin of history. We  enacted fully inclusive Federal hate crimes legislation, protecting  Americans from the scourge of bigoted violence, with the Matthew  Shepard Act; our friend, Barney Frank, our former colleague, was so  instrumental in passing that legislation.   Today, we will include marriage equality into Federal law now and for  generations to come.   I am just going to speak personally for a moment because, as I  mentioned earlier, my first words on the floor of this House were about  fighting against HIV and AIDS and discrimination that goes with that.   My final bill as Speaker the first time, one of the final bills that  I signed was the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. Now, one of the final  bills that I will sign in the enrollment will be this beautiful  legislation, the Respect for Marriage Act that we are passing today.   Today, we stand up for the values the vast majority of Americans hold  dear, a belief in the dignity, beauty, and divinity, divinity, spark of  divinity in every person, an abiding respect for love so powerful that  it binds two people together.   San Francisco's--when we talk about freedom, I think of Harvey Milk.  He once told his supporters: ``I have tasted freedom. I will not give  up that which I have tasted.''   Thus, today, this Chamber proudly stands with the forces of freedom,  not going back, and justice.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a resounding bipartisan ``aye'' vote in favor of  the Respect for Marriage Act in loving memory of Del Martin and Phyllis  Lyon, my dear friends, and iconic pioneers, and I urge a strong  bipartisan vote.                   Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for his tremendous leadership to protect and defend the  American people and our Constitution. I thank the gentleman for his  kind words about my colleague from San Francisco, Jackie Speier, for  her leadership on behalf of the men and women in uniform.   Mr. Speaker, what an honor it is to speak on this important  legislation with you in the chair, a champion for the security of the  American people, whether on the Armed Services Committee, the  Intelligence Committee, other initiatives, whether it is cybersecurity  or the rest, you have been a leader. You have taught us a lot about  your areas of expertise and more, and because of you, we were able, on  one of the anniversaries of the ADA, to change the infrastructure of  the House so that you could preside.   Mr. Speaker, you were the first to preside, and now as we come to the  end of your service and your leadership in the Congress--not in the  world--that you should be in the chair is an honor for all of us. You  bring honor to this Congress, to that position, and I thank you for  your service and your leadership, Mr. Langevin of Rhode Island.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this year's strong bipartisan,  bicameral National Defense Authorization Act, the foundation of  America's national security priorities.   This legislation honors our fundamental charge under the United  States Constitution to provide for the common defense. That is why  Democrats have fought tirelessly to invest in our Nation's greatest  sources of strength, from our heroic servicemen and -women and their  families to promoting American leadership around the globe.   Thanks to the distinguished chair of the Armed Services Committee,  Adam Smith, as well as the ranking member,   Mike Rogers, and all the  members of the committee and staff for your tireless work assembling  this bipartisan, bicameral legislative package. That is what makes it  stronger, its bipartisanship.   I would like to talk about some of the things that are in the  legislation because as our country grows and our needs are greater, the  cost goes up, as well. But how those resources are prioritized is very  important to our colleagues who are making their vote known to the  public to whom we are accountable to understand our definition of  strength.   That starts with the deeply deserved 4.6 percent pay raise to help  ease the sting of inflation for our men and women in uniform. We are  also empowering the Pentagon to raise the basic housing allowance,  bringing down food prices by directing more funding to commissaries,  and expanding support for childcare services; meaning the personal  needs of our personnel are so very important, and this legislation does  just that.   Building on the sweeping progress in last year's NDAA to combat  sexual assault in the military, this year we require independently  trained investigators outside the immediate chain of command to  investigate claims of sexual harassment, as well. Our colleague Jackie  Speier was so important in all of that.   Importantly, we blocked an anti-choice demand to eliminate the right  to travel to access legal abortion for servicemembers stationed in a  State that criminalizes reproductive health. Because for Democrats,  health freedom is a value for every woman everywhere.   Additionally, this legislation delivers a record amount of funding  for research and development at America's HBCUs and steers additional  funding to  [[Page H8851]]  other minority-serving institutions. This is so important because  Democrats--and now Republicans--know that we must build a diverse,  inclusive national security workforce, one reflective of our Nation.   By investing in these essential engines of opportunity, we expand the  talent pipeline and make sure our Nation's brightest minds will help  solve our toughest national security challenges with inclusiveness,  with diversity, with our best.   At the same time, we are investing in America's global preeminence.  It is a national security imperative to honor our troops with cutting- edge technologies, equipping them to tackle complex 21st century  threats. You know this so well, Mr. Speaker, as does our chair and  ranking member. We are harnessing the power of clean energy to ensure  that our defense facilities and vehicle fleets are resilient to climate  change.    Meanwhile, we are nurturing a growing semiconductor industry which we  reinvigorated earlier this year with the CHIPS and Science Act.   Now, the NDAA will require government contracts to use chips that are  made in America: creating good-paying jobs here at home, securing our  supply chains, and bolstering our economic competitiveness.   This year's NDAA also makes robust progress to promote American  leadership in the global arena. The safety of families here at home  depends on international security and stability.   So with this legislation, we ensure that America and our allies  maintain a military and qualitative edge in strategic regions across  the world, investing more than $11 billion in the Pacific Deterrence  Initiative; securing more than $6 billion for the European Deterrence  Initiative; and further support for Ukraine's fight for freedom through  the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative.   Indeed, Democrats know that the security of our Nation is not only  measured in our military might, but also in the health, strength, and  our well-being, and the respect we have for our partners.   As I draw to a conclusion--I didn't say close--I just want to salute  the people of Ukraine and President Zelenskyy for their courage. In  fighting for their democracy, they are fighting for our democracy and  the democracies of their neighbors in Europe, as well, and really  throughout the world. So, we have a moral responsibility, as well as a  practical one, to support our Ukraine initiatives.   Importantly, there are two additional provisions the Democrats fought  to attach to this legislative package. The first is a version of the  Federal Firefighters Fairness Act, a long-sought Democratic priority to  make it easier for Federally employed firefighters who contract certain  diseases to qualify for Federal workers' compensation.   Our firefighters are our nobility. They risk their lives, putting  their lives on the line to protect our families, our homes, our  communities from devastation. With this provision, we take another step  to deliver the benefits they are entitled to that they have earned.   The second initiative, and very consequential, is the oceans package.  It is a very important and, I understand, bipartisan initiative closely  negotiated with military leaders. This bipartisan legislation is a  force for America's national security and economic competitiveness.   Mr. Speaker, 4 in 10 Americans live in coastal counties, and the  well-being of every family depends on strong, secure water sources. By  taking action to conserve our oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes, we are  protecting jobs and businesses, ensuring resilient access to clean  water, and preserving invaluable aquatic life and their natural  habitat.   Our military leaders repeatedly have told us that the climate crisis  is a top threat facing our Nation. The climate crisis is a security  issue. So we are also modernizing the NOAA Corps and securing more  hurricane hunter aircrafts to help protect communities from extreme  weather and climate disaster.   Mr. Speaker, today, we are confronting threats to democracy here and  around the world. Again, I would, in closing, once again salute  President Zelenskyy and the people of Ukraine. Their fight for  democracy is ours, as well. We have not only a moral but also a  strategic responsibility to continue to support their fearless fight as  we do in this legislation.   In order to uphold our sacred responsibility and ensure that  Americans are safe and America is secure, I urge a strong bipartisan  vote for the NDAA. Then, we will send it to the Senate and on to the  President to become the law of the land. My understanding is that there  is agreement between the House and the Senate in a bipartisan way as we  send this on.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Rogers for his great leadership in all of  this.   On a separate note, we are overjoyed that Brittney Griner is on her  way home after the President's tireless and focused work to secure her  release. Earlier today, we passed the Marriage Protection Act, and we  are so happy that she will be joining her wife when she comes home.   Again, Congress remains firmly committed to supporting the  administration as it continues to work to secure the release of Paul  Whelan and all those who Putin has unjustly detained. I just saw on the  news as I was coming over here that Paul Whelan said the President made  the right decision to get Brittney, trade for that, and then keep the  focus to get him free.   Again, I support Chair Smith and Ranking Member Rogers for their  great leadership in accomplishing a bipartisan, strong bill that again  keeps our country strong and measures our might in terms of our  hardware, of course, but also, in terms of the people who keep us  strong. We are deeply in their debt.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong bipartisan vote.
