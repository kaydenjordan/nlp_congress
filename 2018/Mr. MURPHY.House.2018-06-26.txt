 Paul, I thank the House and your leadership for moving so  many bills dealing with the opioid  [[Page H5664]]  problem that are both life changing and life saving.   It is rare that so much is done in this Chamber, that to think about  the 60-plus thousand, maybe 100,000 lives lost every year by this, it  is clearly something that is going to save massive numbers of people.
