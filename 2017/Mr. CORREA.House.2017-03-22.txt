 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1302, the Terrorist and Foreign Fighter  Travel Exercise Act of 2017.   Every day, communities across this country are confronted by evolving  threats. Since the beginning of the year, we have seen a number of bomb  threats against Jewish Community Centers. A year and a half ago, a 21- year-old White gunman hoping to start a race war opened fire at the  Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, killing nine of its  parishioners. The year 2015 went on record as the year with most  threats, reports of harassments, and vandalism against mosques in the  United States.   In light of the emboldened White nationalist, anti-Semitic, and  antigovernment movements, as well as ongoing threats from abroad, we  must ensure that our first responders are prepared to respond to the  evolving threats to our great country.   This bill will direct FEMA's national exercise program to design  scenarios that include emerging terrorist threats. To be clear, the  legislation does not require FEMA's national exercise program to focus  exclusively on terrorist threats, but, rather, seeks to ensure that  FEMA continues to develop exercises that are responsive to threats as  they may emerge.   The bill also requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to carry  out exercises related to terrorist threats domestically and abroad.   H.R. 1302 was passed unanimously and approved by the Committee on  Homeland Security earlier this month and the full House in the last  Congress, in July 2016.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1302 is commonsense legislation that will prepare  first responders, as well as State and local government partners, for  the challenges that lie ahead.   At this time, when first responder programs are slated for the  chopping block under the administration's budget blueprint, it is more  important than ever that Congress stand together to support them.  Exercises like the ones authorized under this legislation contribute to  our preparedness.   As such, I urge Members to support this bill once again.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.  Correa) on the Committee on Homeland Security for supporting this bill,  and I urge the rest of my colleagues to support H.R. 1302.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House  Committee on Homeland Security I rise in support of H.R. 1302,  Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel Exercise Act of 2017 to require an  exercise to terrorist and foreign fighter travel.   This bipartisan bill would expand the scope of the Federal Emergency  Management Agency's National Exercise Program by requiring additional  scenarios to address emerging terrorist threats.   Among the scenarios to be included are those involving U.S. citizens  enlisting with or providing support to terrorists organizations abroad,  as well as terrorist infiltration in the United States.   A nationwide exercise would be held within a year of enactment to  evaluate the threat of individuals traveling from the United States to  join a terrorist organization.   The exercise would also test scenarios involving terrorist  infiltration into the U.S. by United States citizens and foreign  nationals.   DHS would coordinate with other federal departments, foreign  governments, state and local governments, and the private sector to  conduct the exercise.   The growing complexity of the threat may be creating unseen gaps in  our defenses, yet it has been years since any large-scale ``stress  test'' has been conducted against terrorist travel.   Federal officials suspect that Todd Wolfe, an American citizen from  Texas, planned to fly his family to Europe where he would meet up with  an ISIS handler and take them all to Syria.   In March of 2014, Hanad Abdullahi Mohallim, an American from  Minnesota, entered Syria at Tel Abyad and recruited other fellow  Somali-Americans in Minnesota to leave the United States and join ISIS.   Also in 2014, Abdi Nur left the U.S. for Syria to join ISIS. He was  later reported to have attempted to recruit other men here in the U.S.  to join the terrorist organization.   We need to be gravely concerned about Americans leaving the country  to train overseas with terrorist organizations who then return to the  United States as foreign fighters.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1302.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 1302.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.   Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.   The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1238, the Securing our Agriculture and Food  Act.   Mr. Speaker, U.S. agriculture and agriculture-related business  represents about 6 percent of our gross domestic product as of 2014.  Protecting this industry, which contributes $985 billion to our  economy, from international and naturally occurring biological events  is critical not only to the stability of our national economy, but also  to the security of our national food supply and our human health.   This bill would clarify the responsibilities of the Department of  Homeland Security's Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs as they  relate to the DHS' responsibilities under the Homeland Security  Presidential Directive 9, entitled: ``The Defense of U.S. Agriculture  and Food.''   The bill includes language offered by Representative Donald Payne,  Jr., my colleague on the committee, directing the Assistant Secretary  for Health Affairs to coordinate with all departmental components with  responsibilities related to food and agriculture security and screening  procedures. Such coordination will include Customs and Border  Protection, which has historically struggled to maintain agriculture  inspection staffing levels at ports of entry.   Mr. Speaker, agriculture and agriculture-related businesses  constitute a major portion of California's economy. Agriculture plays  an integral role in industries ranging from transportation and  warehousing to finance and insurance, to accommodation and food  services.                                time  1245    The cascading effects of national and international outbreaks  compromise agriculture, food, and could have devastating effects on the  State's economy.   I encourage my colleagues to support this bill to ensure the  integrity of our agriculture industry and food supply.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Securing Our Agriculture and Food Act passed the House  in September of 2016, and the Senate companion bill was reported out of  committee last week.   Passage of this measure will send a strong message about our  commitment to protecting our Nation's food and agricultural sectors. As  such, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1238.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1365, the Department of Homeland Security  Acquisition Innovation Act.   When the Department of Homeland Security was established in 2002, it  was understood that the mission of safeguarding the American people  would be  [[Page H2308]]  a complex one. Today, 15 years later, the ever-changing nature of the  terrorist threat and its landscape has demanded that DHS be more  innovative. In the past 3 years, the Department has actively worked to  carry out its procurement process in new and innovative ways.   The Acquisition Innovations in Motion program, launched in 2015, is a  framework for coordinated industry engagement in which opportunities,  challenges, and strategies are discussed to identify acquisition  solutions and foster greater efficiency and effectiveness.   A key component of this program is a Procurement Innovation Lab  called PIL. PIL is a virtual testing environment that experiments with  innovative techniques to assess whether they can be effectively  integrated into DHS' procurement process. To date, PIL is credited with  reducing award times, the integration of existing flexibilities that  are in use in other portions of the Federal Government, and improved  acquisition training.   Results, case studies, and lessons learned from the PIL process are  regularly shared throughout DHS through webinars and the internal web  portal. These activities facilitate a continuous learning culture that  enhances the DHS mission of support.   I introduced this bill, H.R. 1365, to institutionalize DHS'  acquisition innovation efforts by authorizing such activity by the  Under Secretary of Management. Specifically, my legislation authorizes  robust testing, development, and distribution of best practices and  acquisitions throughout the Department, as well as performance metrics  to measure the effectiveness of such efforts.   Enactment of this bill will help ensure that this successful  acquisition management technique continues. This bill was unanimously  approved by the Committee on Homeland Security earlier this month.   Mr. Speaker, DHS' approach to acquisitions not only accommodates the  Department's unique mission, but it supports our responsibility to the  management of taxpayer dollars.   This bill codifies a pathway to developing and implementing  innovative approaches that serve the Department's acquisition  challenges through collaboration and efficiency. To that end, it is  vital that DHS continue to drive towards a more effective procurement  process in support of its vital mission.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 1365, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
