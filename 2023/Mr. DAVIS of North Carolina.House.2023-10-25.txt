 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of this resolution, which expresses unwavering support for  Israel.   This past August, I traveled to Israel. I find it absolutely heart- wrenching as I think of the very place that I visited just days later  was attacked by Hamas at the Kfar Aza kibbutz where 58 people in the  community were massacred and 17 kidnapped. It is just awful to think of  babies being killed, people being slaughtered and gunned down in cold  blood. At least 33 Americans have lost their lives. Others are missing.   Let's be clear: A nation must respond, and, yes, we must respond. Let  us continue to extend our unwavering support to Israel and ensure that  the people of Israel have everything necessary to defend themselves and  dismantle these egregious Hamas fighters.
