 Mr. President.    Mr. President, we come together today to talk about a  critical nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court at a time when the Court  will be considering a range of issues that are critically important to  the American people. Right now, one of the issues a lot of Americans  are most concerned about is the issue of healthcare. There are so many  aspects to that issue we can examine today.   I will get to larger overriding concerns I have with the nomination  in a moment. For now, what I will do is walk through some concerns I  have when it comes to healthcare itself and, in particular, Americans  with disabilities because I think, in this part of the debate and in  this part of Judge Kavanaugh's record and the potential impact his  decisions as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court will have on  healthcare itself and people with disabilities--this whole part of his  record and what might happen has not been examined enough in this  debate.   I will start with healthcare. If Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed today,  he could be the deciding vote in eliminating key healthcare protections  for people with preexisting conditions--an action that would have  serious repercussions on the healthcare of millions of Americans. This  administration and congressional Republicans have been trying for the  better part of the last 2 years to rip away healthcare coverage from  the people who need it the most across America.   Republicans in both branches of government--the executive branch and  the legislative branch--have attempted to decimate Medicaid. Although  they have been unable so far to fully repeal the Affordable Care Act in  Congress, the Republicans have turned to the courts to sabotage the  healthcare system and the Affordable Care Act.   By the way, while we are mentioning the Medicaid Program, let's  remind the American people what that program is. The Medicaid Program  is not a ``them'' program, it is an ``us'' program. It is about us--who  we are as Americans, whether we are going to take care of the family of  America.   I think my home State is representative of the impact Medicaid has on  people across the country. Forty percent of the children in  Pennsylvania get their healthcare through the Medicaid Program; 50  percent of the people with disabilities in Pennsylvania rely upon  Medicaid; and 60 percent of seniors trying to get into a nursing home  for long-term care in the twilight of their lives rely upon the  Medicaid Program. Forty percent of the kids, 50 percent of people with  disabilities, and 60 percent of seniors rely upon this program--some 70  million Americans.   The decisions by this Congress, or this body, and the entire  legislative branch are critically important on Medicaid and healthcare;  obviously, the decisions of the executive branch. Now we have to focus  as well on the judicial branch, especially with the nomination that  could tip the balance in 5-to-4 decisions.   Judge Kavanaugh has twice disagreed with rulings upholding the  Affordable Care Act. It is no coincidence he has been nominated by this  President, by this administration. President Trump apparently believes  he can count on Justice Kavanaugh, were he to be confirmed, to rule  against the Affordable Care Act when he is on the Supreme Court, if he  were to be confirmed today.   You don't have to take my word for this. A former law clerk of Judge  Kavanaugh's said it best when she spoke up about Kavanaugh's view of  the Affordable Care Act: ``No other contender on President Trump's list  is on record so vigorously opposing the law''--the law meaning the  Affordable Care Act that brought healthcare to 20 million Americans,  about more than half of them because we expanded Medicaid.   Right now, courts are considering whether people with preexisting  conditions should be protected from being charged more, from being  denied coverage, or being dropped from their insurance simply because  of their health status. Who would ever believe that after putting into  law, enacting into law, those protections for 130 million Americans, we  would still be debating it and that an entire political party would be  in a court of law arguing those protections are unconstitutional? It is  an insult to who we are as Americans.   In Texas v. United States, the administration last sided with 20  Republican State attorneys general and is refusing to defend the  Affordable Care Act's protections for people with preexisting  conditions. What is at stake in this legal battle that could obviously  end up, down the road, in the Supreme Court? It is 130 million  Americans with preexisting conditions. That means people with diabetes  or cancer or anything else that is a preexisting condition could have  their lives grossly adversely impacted. The Supreme Court might be the  last line of defense to maintaining those protections for people with  preexisting conditions. A Justice Kavanaugh could be the deciding vote  to rip away protections which are in law now, right now, and they could  be taken away.   If Republicans were to win this fight, coverage for millions of  Americans who have these protections would be adversely impacted. That  is probably an understatement. We also have to be concerned about the  fundamentals of our health insurance system--the fundamental stability  of our healthcare system, which could be undermined or worse.   Such a decision by the Supreme Court would have real-life  consequences. In Pennsylvania alone, 5.3 million people, including  643,000 children, have a preexisting condition. I will tell you the  story of one of those children.   Jackson Corbin is 13 years old and lives in Hanover, PA. He lives  with his mother Anna, his father Michael, and his brother Henry.  Jackson, Henry, and their mom all have Noonan syndrome--a congenital  disability that often involves heart attacks, bleeding problems,  possible developmental delays, short stature, and malformation of the  rib cage--all of that in the life of one child. Jackson's most  troubling concern is a form of hemophilia called Von Willebrand  disease. Because of this disease, he has to be very careful not to cut  himself or to do things that might cause internal bleeding. This means  Jackson cannot play sports. He cannot roller skate or even jump on a  trampoline. The cost of his healthcare--including medications and  treatments and specialists--is more than what his parents would make in  a year. Without health insurance coverage they are able to purchase  through the Affordable Care Act--including protections for preexisting  conditions--the Corbin family would either go bankrupt or Jackson, his  mother, and his brother would have to go without treatment, risking  their lives.   Last month Jackson testified in front of the Judiciary Committee and  spoke about what Judge Kavanaugh's nomination meant for him, Jackson  Corbin.         My Noonan Syndrome is part of who I am. It has been a part       of me since the day I was born, and will be a part of me for       the rest of my life. If you destroy protections for       preexisting conditions, you will leave me and all the kids       and adults like me without care or without the ability to       afford our care--all because of who we are.   [[Page S6691]]     Let me repeat those last few words of Jackson Corbin, 13 years old:  ``without care or without the ability to afford our care.''   That is what we are talking about here. Judge Kavanaugh could very  well be the deciding vote in determining the future of this child and  the future of members of his family.   All of us, everybody in this building today, are just one illness  away--each of us is just one injury away--from having our own  preexisting condition, if we don't have one already.   Maybe Senators and judges and Justices don't have to worry about  protections for preexisting conditions. Maybe they can all buy that  protection one way or another, but 130 million Americans have to worry  and have to worry about this consequential nomination on an issue of  such grave importance as healthcare itself and maybe, most especially,  protections for people with preexisting conditions.   How about disabilities? Judge Kavanaugh's record on the rights of  individuals with disabilities is troubling as well. I will give you one  example. Liz Weintraub, like Jackson, testified in front of the  Judiciary Committee in opposition to Judge Kavanaugh's nomination to  the Supreme Court. I know Liz Weintraub well. She is 51 years old. She  is from Rockville, MD. She has cerebral palsy and an intellectual  disability. She had two loving parents and three loving sisters, and  for 4 months this year, she was on my staff as a legislative fellow. So  I am not objective when it comes to Liz Weintraub, but here is what she  told us. The work she did, of course, on our staff was significant. She  helped to organize hearings and worked on disability issues to educate  our office and me, as well as other Senate offices about the importance  of hiring people with disabilities.   But Liz experienced low expectations in her life. She was told by  educators she could never attend college. She spent 9 years in a  private institution. She was told she had to work in a sheltered  workshop.   Despite these barriers, Liz persevered and achieved her dream of  being a disability policy advocate. Her knowledge, experience, and  wisdom made my office a better place on these issues and a better place  to work in. It strengthened our office's ability to work on disability  policy.   Let's get to the judge's record on these issues.   Judge Kavanaugh, on the DC Circuit, shows a pattern of siding against  individuals with disabilities. He has sided with employers over  employees who have a disability, making it more difficult for employees  to prove discrimination in court and have their rights protected under  the law.   In a case called Doe v. District of Columbia, he called into question  the very autonomy and right to self-determination of people with  disabilities. The case involved three women who had intellectual  disabilities and lived in facilities run by the District of Columbia.  The District allowed medical professionals to decide when elective  surgeries would be performed on these women without even consulting  with them and without even trying to determine the wishes of these  three women.   The trial court sided with the women in this case and said the  District of Columbia had to attempt to determine what these women  wanted before making medical decisions on their behalf. Judge Kavanaugh  overturned the lower court decision. He questioned the basic liberty of  individuals with disabilities. He allowed the government to continue  making medical decisions on behalf of these three women in the District  of Columbia without ever attempting to determine what they wanted.   This decision is offensive to the American people, but it is  offensive, I think, to people with disabilities even more so and to  people who have fought for decades to secure the rights of people with  disabilities. The decision robbed these women of their autonomy, and it  robbed them of their humanity.   Liz Weintraub said in her testimony:         I worry that if a Justice on the Supreme Court does not       believe that we, as people with intellectual disabilities,       CAN MAKE decisions for ourselves, then we will have the right       to make those decisions taken away from us. . . . That is why       I am opposing Judge Kavanaugh.    These are the words of Liz Weintraub, speaking for many Americans  with disabilities. I want to thank Liz for her testimony and for coming  forward to speak on behalf of those Americans.   These decisions about these rights for people with disabilities don't  just impact the individuals in the particular lawsuit. They also set a  precedent for future cases and send a message about the values of our  country about whose rights we consider worthy of protection.   If our courts don't protect the rights and dignity of people with  disabilities, then, what are our courts there for? We have to ask that  question.   I want to conclude with just a couple of more comments.   There has been a lot of debate and a lot of commentary and a lot of  vigorous disagreement about the back and forth that occurred just last  week, but I think I am like many Americans who say I believe Dr. Ford's  testimony. I thought she was both credible and persuasive, and I wrote  the following earlier this week in an op-ed in the Philadelphia  Inquirer dated October 2, in describing part of her testimony, the  ``details of a sexual assault she experienced as a 15-year-old''--that  made an impression on Americans, of course. Then, I went on to say:  ``the terror she felt in that moment, the horror of the physical  assault, and the psychological trauma of believing she might die.''   I believe that testimony, and that alone is troubling enough when it  comes to making a determination on this nomination.   I was further concerned when I listened to the testimony of Judge  Kavanaugh, concerned about his lack of judicial temperament--I think  that is an understatement in that moment--and also whether or not he  could be an impartial Justice based upon what he said in response to  the allegations, and especially what he was saying about Democrats in  the Senate.   So I will vote no for several reasons, many of them outlined with  regard to healthcare and disability policy. I will vote no on this  nomination, and I urge my colleagues to vote no as well.   I yield the floor.
