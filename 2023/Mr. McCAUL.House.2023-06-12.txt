 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 377) calling for the immediate release of Evan  Gershkovich, a United States citizen and journalist, who was wrongfully  detained by the Government of the Russian Federation in March 2023, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 377         Whereas United States citizen Evan Gershkovich is a       reporter for the Wall Street Journal;        Whereas Evan Gershkovich is an accredited reporter, with a       history of working in Russia for the Moscow Times, Agence       France-Presse, and the Wall Street Journal;        Whereas Evan Gershkovich is known to his family, friends,       and colleagues as someone who is adventurous, curious, and       who has an abiding love for Russia and its people;        Whereas Evan Gershkovich, a trailblazing and intrepid       journalist, actively reported on stories across Russia,       including the vast wildfires across Siberia, the COVID-19       pandemic, the Russian economy, and the Government of the       Russian Federation's unlawful invasion of Ukraine;        Whereas, on March 29, 2023, Evan Gershkovich was arrested       in Yekaterinburg while reporting on behalf of the Wall Street       Journal;        Whereas, on April 7, 2023, the Government of the Russian       Federation charged Evan Gershkovich with espionage;        Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has failed       to publicly provide evidence of Evan Gershkovich's criminal       action to credibly render a charge of espionage;        Whereas the last time an American journalist was detained       on allegations of espionage in Russia was in 1986 during the       era of the Soviet Union;        Whereas, on April 10, 2023, Secretary of State Antony       Blinken designated Evan Gershkovich wrongfully detained by       the Government of the Russian Federation; and        Whereas, on April 17, 2023, the United States was joined by       46 United Nations Member States in a joint statement       expressing deep concern over the detention of Evan       Gershkovich by the Government of the Russian Federation: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to       immediately release Evan Gershkovich, who has been wrongfully       detained since March 2023;        (2) urges all United States executive branch officials,       including President Joseph  [[Page H2796]]       R. Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Special       Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger D. Carstens, to       raise the case of Evan Gershkovich and to press for his       immediate release in all interactions with the Government of       the Russian Federation;        (3) urges the Government of the Russian Federation to       provide full, unfettered, and consistent consular access, in       accordance with its international obligations, to Evan       Gershkovich while he remains in detention;        (4) urges the Government of the Russian Federation to       respect the human rights of Evan Gershkovich;        (5) urges the Government of the Russian Federation to       respect the rights of accredited journalists to freely and       independently report the news without fear of arbitrary       detention or reprisal;        (6) urges the Government of the Russian Federation to       desist from detaining, imprisoning, and otherwise seeking to       intimidate journalists in order to curtail or censor an       independent press;        (7) condemns the Government of Russia Federation's       continued use of detentions and prosecutions of United States       citizens and lawful permanent residents for political       purposes;        (8) calls for the immediate release of Paul Whelan, who has       been wrongfully detained in Russia since December 2018;        (9) expresses continued support for all American citizens       and lawful permanent residents detained in Russia and abroad,       including Marc Fogel, who faces a politicized, excessive       sentence for his alleged offense, Vladimir Kara-Murza, who       has endured multiple attempts on his life and years of       persecution by the Putin regime, and others; and        (10) expresses sympathy for and solidarity with the       families of Evan Gershkovich, Paul Whelan, and all other       American citizens and lawful permanent residents wrongfully       detained abroad for the personal hardship experienced as a       result of the arbitrary and baseless arrest and detention of       their loved ones.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Evan Gershkovich is an American citizen and a respected Wall Street  Journal reporter. He is the son of two Soviet-born Jewish exiles who  fled Russia to avoid persecution. He is a loving little brother.   What he is not, Mr. Speaker, is a criminal. Yet, on March 29, he was  arrested by the corrupt Putin regime and charged with espionage. No  evidence has been presented to back up this accusation because there is  no evidence.   Evan is innocent. He was simply doing his job, reporting on the news  in Russia, but we know that the war criminal Putin doesn't like that.  He doesn't want his own people to know about the atrocities that he is  committing in Ukraine. He doesn't want them to know about the  corruption within his own government or how he has turned their country  into an international pariah.   Vladimir Putin knows that a free press is a pillar of democracy, that  a strong fourth estate will hold officials accountable, so he arrested  Evan with the intention of not only silencing him but of scaring other  journalists to remain silent, too.   I assure Evan's friends, his coworkers, and especially his family,  who I have met with, that we will continue our fight every day until we  bring him home to you.   As the father of five children, I cannot begin to imagine the pain  and suffering Evan's family is feeling right now. I had the opportunity  to meet Evan's mother, Ella, recently. Like any mother, she was very  worried about her son and this situation, but she was also very  determined to do anything she could to bring him home.   She thanked me for the efforts of our committee, the Foreign Affairs  Committee, and others on Capitol Hill who are doing everything we can  to help their son.   Just as unfortunate, our next resolution, on Paul Whelan, makes clear  that Evan's family is not the only one suffering through this  nightmare. We are also awaiting information from the State Department  about the arrest of yet another American citizen in Russia over this  last weekend.   The Putin regime is increasingly brazen in using political detentions  to seek leverage over the Biden administration, and it must be made  clear that the use of American citizens as political pawns will not go  unpunished. These Americans deserve to be home with their families  instead of in Russian prisons.   Today's bipartisan resolution condemns the Putin regime for their  illegal imprisonment. It calls on the Biden administration to  prioritize bringing home all American citizens who are wrongfully  detained overseas.   Today, we send a strong message to Vladimir Putin that America,  Republicans and Democrats alike, will not tolerate his corrupt regime  holding U.S. citizens hostage under false pretenses.   America, Mr. Speaker, stands with Evan and with every American who is  wrongfully detained overseas, and we will not rest until all of them  are brought home.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I reserve the  right to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me also thank the ranking member, Mr. Meeks, because  what makes this committee so special, in my opinion, is that we know  how important it is to speak with one voice, as one country, not as a  divided nation. When it comes to Mr. Putin and what he is doing to our  Americans over there, we are united with one voice.   Mr. Speaker, Evan's case marks the first time since the Cold War that  a journalist has been wrongfully charged with espionage on Russian  soil. It is clear that Putin and the corrupt Kremlin will do anything  to silence those who seek to expose the truth.   A man of integrity, Evan put the truth ahead of his own safety. He  was dedicated to shining a light on the vast corruption and the war  crimes of Russia.   Make no mistake, Evan's work posed a threat to Mr. Putin and his  cronies, so they did what they always do when threatened: They silence  their critics.   It is absolutely unacceptable for Putin to hold Americans hostage as  diplomatic pawns. Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, it is happening way too  often now.   As I said before, America stands with Evan, and we will not rest  until he is home.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 272) calling on the Government of the Russian  Federation to immediately release United States citizen Paul Whelan.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 272         Whereas United States citizen Paul Whelan is a resident of       Novi, Michigan, and a veteran of the Marine Corps;        Whereas, on December 22, 2018, Paul Whelan traveled to       Moscow, Russia, for the wedding of a personal friend;        Whereas, on December 28, 2018, the Federal Security Service       of the Russian Federation arrested Paul Whelan at the       Metropol Hotel in Moscow and charged him with espionage;        Whereas the Federal Security Service has never provided any       evidence of supposed wrongdoing with respect to Paul Whelan;        Whereas Paul Whelan was imprisoned in Lefortovo Prison and       was held in pretrial detention at the prison for more than 19       months after his arrest;        Whereas a Moscow court extended Paul Whelan's pretrial       detention multiple times without publicly presenting       justification or evidence of wrongdoing;        Whereas even Vladimir Zherebenkov, the lawyer appointed by       the Federal Security Service to represent Paul Whelan, said       on May 24, 2019, ``[The Federal Security Service] always       roll[s] out what they have, but in this case, we've seen       nothing concrete against Whelan in five months. That means       there is nothing.'';        Whereas then-United States Ambassador to the Russian       Federation, Jon Huntsman, responded on April 12, 2019, to a       question about the detention of Paul Whelan, ``If the       Russians have evidence, they should bring it forward. We have       seen nothing. If there was a case, I think the evidence would       have been brought forward by now.'';        Whereas then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with       Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on May 14, 2019, and       urged him to ensure United States citizens are not unjustly       held abroad;        Whereas the Kremlin has refused to provide Paul Whelan with       full access to his lawyer, and the so-called evidence against       Paul Whelan and any evidence he has seen is in Russian, a       language Whelan does not read or speak;        Whereas the Lefortovo pretrial detention facility and the       Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to provide medical       treatment for Paul Whelan's medical condition, despite being       aware of its worsening state, resulting in emergency surgery       on May 29, 2020;        Whereas Paul Whelan was wrongfully convicted on June 15,       2020, and sentenced to 16 years in a Russian labor camp by a       three-judge panel, in a trial witnessed by United States       Ambassador John Sullivan, who referred to the trial as ``a       mockery of justice'' due to the denial of a fair trial and       the exclusion of defense witnesses;        Whereas, in August 2020, on an unknown day, Paul Whelan was       secretly transferred to camp IK-17, a penal labor camp in       Mordovia, Russia, where he is forced to work 6 days a week in       a garment factory;        Whereas Ambassador John Sullivan, while visiting Paul       Whelan at the labor camp in Mordovia, stated that ``Russian       authorities . . . have never shown the world evidence of his       guilt'', and reiterated his call for the Russian authorities       to correct this injustice and release Paul Whelan;        Whereas Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with       Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on February 4, 2021,       and urged him to release United States citizens detained in       the Russian Federation, including Paul Whelan and Trevor       Reed, so that they are able to return home to their families       in the United States;        Whereas, in August 2021, Whelan was released from a month-      long stay in a solitary confinement at the IK-17 penal colony       in the region of Mordovia;        Whereas, on April 27, 2022, the House of Representatives       unanimously passed a bipartisan resolution calling for the       release of Whelan;        Whereas Secretary Blinken ``pressed'' the Kremlin to accept       an offer by the United States that would bring Paul Whelan       and Brittney Griner home in July 2022;        Whereas, in November 2022, Paul Whelan was unable to       contact his family for more than a week, during which time       Russian authorities claimed Whelan had been sent to the       hospital;        Whereas Russian authorities refused to release Paul Whelan       as part of the prisoner exchange in December 2022;        Whereas Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated, ``His       detention remains unacceptable, and we continue to press for       his immediate release at every opportunity''; and        Whereas President Biden stated that his administration had       ``not forgotten about Paul Whelan,'' and promised to ``keep       negotiating in good faith for his release'': Now, therefore,       be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) implores the Government of the Russian Federation to       immediately release Paul Whelan from imprisonment;        (2) implores the Government of the Russian Federation to       comply with international treaty obligations and provide       unrestricted consular access to Paul Whelan while he remains       imprisoned in the Russian Federation;        (3) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to       provide Paul Whelan and all other political prisoners their       constitutionally afforded due process rights and universally       recognized human rights;        (4) expresses the sincere thanks of the United States to       the Governments of Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom       for their support in attempting to release Paul Whelan; and  [[Page H2798]]         (5) expresses sympathy to the family of Paul Whelan for       this travesty to justice and personal hardship and expresses       hope that their ordeal can soon be brought to a just end.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, on December 28, 2018, U.S. citizen and Marine Corps  veteran Paul Whelan was wrongfully arrested in Moscow and charged with  espionage.   This is just one of the many examples where an American is used as a  political pawn by the Kremlin--where they disguise hostility and human  rights abuses as justice. Paul was held in pretrial detention for 19  months, and on June 15, 2020, he was sentenced to 16 years in a Russian  labor camp.   Paul was never provided with any real evidence of guilt. Defense  witnesses were excluded. He was denied a fair trial, including the  opportunity to defend himself properly or even communicate with his  family.   Last month, on May 16, Paul reached day 1,600 of illegally being held  hostage in the Russian Federation for a crime he did not commit.   Mr. Speaker, Paul is innocent, yet he remains behind bars to this  day. Since his illegal incarceration, Paul has not received adequate  medical care and has been denied regular access to his attorney. He has  been designated as ``wrongfully detained'' by the U.S. Department of  State. U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan accurately described Paul's  wrongful conviction as ``a mockery of justice.''   Make no mistake, there is no such thing as justice in a country that  is controlled by a despot. This resolution shows that we have not  forgotten, and we will never forget Paul, and that we will keep  advocating for his immediate release.   The U.S. Congress will not sit by as Americans are held hostage by  the war criminal in the Kremlin. We will not rest until Paul and every  wrongfully detained American is home safely with their families.   During consideration of the prior measure, we discussed Russia's  wrongful detention of the Wall Street reporter, Evan Gershkovich.   Another politically motivated imprisonment I must mention is Vladimir  Kara-Murza, a legal U.S. permanent resident twice poisoned by the  Kremlin. He is a relentless advocate for democracy and human rights and  was recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for his criticism of  Russia's war in Ukraine.   Sadly, this is what happens when you contradict the state-run media  in a totalitarian state. His reward for pursuing the truth and standing  up, exposing Putin's brutality and corruption, was imprisonment.   The vengeance of the Kremlin knows no bounds.   Putin must stop using Cold War tactics to target innocent Americans  as diplomatic pawns. I call for the immediate release of all Americans  wrongfully detained abroad.   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution so Paul and  his family know that the United States Congress stands with them with  one voice, Republican and Democrat, chairman and ranking member, and  will do everything in our power to make sure that Paul is returned  safely to his home and to his family.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), the vice chair of the Financial  Services Committee, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the  Intelligence Committee, and a cosponsor of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   Mr. Speaker, I first thank Ranking Member Meeks for his support. We  do speak with one voice, as one Nation, against this hostage taking by  foreign nation adversaries.   I thank Representative Stevens for her passion on this issue and for  introducing this resolution and being a co-chair of that important  caucus. I also thank my dear friend, Mrs. Dingell, who represents the  family and, obviously, the passion of the family. I can only imagine  what it must feel like to have your son, family member, detained in one  of the worst prisons in the world.   This happens too often. We are seeing this trend way too often now.  It is not just Russia; it is China and Iran and Venezuela. It is a  disturbing trend, Mr. Speaker, to take Americans hostage and hold them  as political pawns for either a change of policy or an exchange of a  prisoner that has no relation to the offense of the American. You can't  tell me that what happened to Brittney Griner, whose offense was so  meager, the idea she had some sort of small amount of--whatever it was,  a vape pipe, and then in exchange, a major Russian arms dealer. But  that is what they do and that is what they want.   We need to stop this, and we need to provide the deterrence to stop  this. The world continues to watch in horror as Vladimir Putin's crimes  and atrocities in Ukraine continue. That is a lot of what this is all  about. Paul Whelan is a marine. Evan is a Wall Street Journal reporter.   Just reporting the truth gets you thrown in prison in Russia. What  were they reporting about? The indiscriminate bombing and killing of  civilians, to the mass graves I saw in Bucha, to torture chambers, to  mobile crematoriums. Think about that, Mr. Speaker. We haven't heard  about something like that in quite some time, probably since my  father's generation and my father's war.   What we are witnessing today is a genocide. If you rise up in protest  or report the truth, you will be put in prison. I condemn this  aggression in the strongest possible terms. I, along with the other  Members on both sides of the aisle, will continue to fight to hold  these perpetrators accountable.   We must also condemn the Russian dictator's practice of exploiting  them as political pawns. As I have said, it has happened way too often.  It is time to get Paul out of this Russian gulag, which is what it is,  and back to his family in Michigan.   Today, all of us stand in this body with one voice, united as  Americans, in condemning Russia's illegal detention of Paul Whelan.  Congress will not rest.   As Congresswoman Stevens said to Mr. Putin, if he is watching this,  and to Paul Whelan, if he has the opportunity to watch this, we want  them to know that we here in Congress will not rest until all Americans  wrongfully detained in Russia are returned to their families.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3099) to establish in the Department of State the position  of Special Envoy for the Abraham Accords, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3099         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Special Envoy for the       Abraham Accords Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that the policy of the United States, as       enacted in section 104 of the Israel Relations Normalization       Act of 2022 (division Z of Public Law 117-103), with respect       to the Abraham Accords remains unchanged.       SEC. 3. SPECIAL ENVOY FOR THE ABRAHAM ACCORDS.         Title I of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of       1956 (22 U.S.C. 2651a et seq.) is amended by adding at the       end the following new section:       ``SEC. 64. SPECIAL ENVOY FOR THE ABRAHAM ACCORDS.         ``(a) Special Envoy for the Abraham Accords.--There is       established within the Department of State a Special Envoy       for the Abraham Accords (in this section referred to as the       `Special Envoy'), who shall serve as the primary advisor to,       and coordinate efforts across, the United States Government       relating to expanding and strengthening the Abraham Accords.       The Special Envoy shall report directly to the Secretary of       State and shall hold the office at the pleasure of the       President.        ``(b) Nomination.--Pursuant to subsection (j)(1) of section       1, the Special Envoy shall be appointed by the President, by       and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and may be       appointed from among the officers and employees of the       Department except that such officer or employee may not       retain the position (or the responsibilities associated with       the position) held by such officer or employee prior to such       appointment simultaneously with the position or       responsibilities of the Special Envoy.        ``(c) Rank and Status of Ambassador.--The Special Envoy       shall have the rank and status of ambassador.        ``(d) Duties.--The Special Envoy shall be responsible for--        ``(1) encouraging countries without diplomatic relations       with Israel to establish formal diplomatic, economic,       security, and people-to-people ties;        ``(2) seeking to expand and strengthen existing       relationships between Israel and Muslim-majority countries,       including those outside the geographic scope of the Near       Eastern Affairs Bureau of the Department of State, to ensure       that all parties reap tangible security and economic benefits       for their citizens;        ``(3) building on existing efforts, including the Negev       Forum, to help foster enhanced cooperation between Israel and       Muslim-majority countries on shared priorities including as       relates to trade, agriculture, and water security;        ``(4) providing diplomatic support for Israel's integration       into cooperative efforts related to regional security; and        ``(5) coordinating lines of effort across the United States       Government, including the regional and functional bureaus       within the Department of State, and conducting appropriate       diplomatic engagement with foreign governments,       nongovernmental organizations, and other stakeholders       determined appropriate by the Special Envoy in order to  [[Page H2801]]       expand and strengthen the Abraham Accords.        ``(e) Report.--        ``(1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       the confirmation of the first Special Envoy appointed       pursuant to this section, and annually thereafter, the       Special Envoy shall submit to the Committee on Foreign       Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations and       the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate a report       describing all United States efforts to expand the Abraham       Accords, including specific diplomatic engagements and status       of efforts with respect to specific countries.        ``(2) Form of report.--The report required by paragraph (1)       shall be submitted in unclassified form but may contain a       separate, classified annex.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, for 75 years, the United States and Israel have been  close friends and partners, working hand in hand on our shared  priorities to keep our nations safe, secure, and prosperous.   Along with our partnership with Israel, we also have many shared  interests with our Arab partners in the region.   The United States has consistently worked to help secure peace in the  Middle East, and we remain committed to enduring peace throughout the  region.   Not only do we want to ensure regional security but economic  prosperity as well, which drives cutting-edge innovation.   We are all concerned about Iran's malign activities. A nuclear Iran  is a threat to the entire region and the world and is not acceptable.  Yet, for so many years, our friends would not speak directly to one  another. Even after Egypt, in 1979, and Jordan, in 1994, established  peace and diplomatic relations with Israel, other Arab countries  refused.   Then, in August 2020, everything changed. The UAE and Israel  announced that they were normalizing diplomatic relations in a deal  brokered by the Trump administration, which we now know as the Abraham  Accords. In short order, Bahrain and Morocco joined UAE in opening  diplomatic relations with Israel.   I was proud to be at the White House for the signing of these famous  documents, the accords, a game-changing development that benefits the  United States, Israel, and our partners in the region.   The Abraham Accords have served as a foundation for increased  cooperation between Israel and Middle Eastern nations. We have already  seen incredible leaps forward as these countries engage in defense  cooperation, economic cooperation, and frequent diplomatic engagement.  What we have not seen, but we all wish to see, is more countries  joining the Abraham Accords.   Secretary of State Blinken was in Saudi Arabia last week, and I  remain hopeful that one day Saudi Arabia will engage with their  neighbors and join these historic accords. Saudi Arabia and Israel  would both benefit from working together on their shared interests.                                time  1645    It has never been more important that we continue to prioritize the  expansion of these agreements. Part of doing this entails making it  clear who in the United States Government is responsible for expanding  these Abraham Accords.   This bipartisan bill, introduced by my colleague and friend Mike  Lawler from New York, who is also a member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee, would create that position, a special envoy for the Abraham  Accords at the State Department. The special envoy will coordinate all  efforts to expand the accords and strengthen relationships between  Israel and participating countries.   We need to put our diplomatic might into trying to achieve the kinds  of big breakthroughs that created the accords almost 3 years ago. This  legislation, Mr. Lawler's bill, does exactly that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Lawler), a member of the Committee on  Foreign Affairs and the author of this important bill.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I thank all the gentlemen from New York--Congressman  Lawler, Ranking Member Meeks, and Congressman Torres--for putting this  legislation forward.   We have all talked about peace in the Middle East our entire  lifetime, but we really have a chance to make a difference. The Abraham  Accords jump-started that process, built upon the agreements with Egypt  and then Jordan, and now this.   We are really, I think, privileged to be a part of the new era of  ushering in cooperation between Israel and the Muslim-majority  countries.   When I would talk to Ambassadors from UAE and other countries, they  would say: We are just tired. We are just tired of Palestinians saying  no. We just can't do it. We just can't do it.   They just said: We want to move forward. We want progress. We want  peace in the region.   They want economic prosperity, which this does.  [[Page H2803]]    These accords mark a generational shift in Middle Eastern relations.  This bill will further that effort and that mission, and we must  continue the work. This special envoy will be dedicated to this  purpose.   I have to say that Ritchie Torres came up with this idea. He worked  with our side of the aisle, and he and Congressman Lawler worked  together on this legislation. That is what Congress should look like,  working together on a goal that can promote peace, prosperity, and  cooperation--in this case, in the Middle East.   I may not see it in my lifetime, but I hope I do. However, I do know  that this bill will move it one step forward toward that great goal  that we all share here today.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
