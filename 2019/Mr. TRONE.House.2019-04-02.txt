 Madam Speaker, it was a true honor to hear the wisdom of  Dr. Lora Hargrove this afternoon. Her call for unity, shared humanity,  and peace is perhaps more important today than ever before.   Dr. Hargrove is a native of Baltimore, Maryland, just like our  distinguished Speaker. She holds a doctorate in ministry from Wesley  Theological Seminary, and she is working towards her second Ph.D. in  African Diaspora from Howard University.   Dr. Hargrove comes from a long line of servant leaders. Her father,  the late Judge John R. Hargrove, Sr., was the first Black Federal  prosecutor in Baltimore and the first Black deputy U.S. attorney. Her  mother, Shirley H. Hargrove, was a teacher and guidance counselor.   Dr. Hargrove now serves as interim minister at Rockville's Mount  Calvary Baptist Church, where my wife, June, and I have seen her  practice many times what she preaches. From hosting HBCU college fairs  to finding shelter for women and children, Dr. Hargrove lifts up our  community every day.   Thank you, Dr. Hargrove.                            ____________________
