 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Texas Independence  Day.   One hundred eighty-one years ago, 59 delegates met in Independence  Hall at Washington-on-the-Brazos to risk everything to make freedom a  reality for generations of Texans to come.  [[Page S1561]]    Today, I continue on a tradition started by the late Senator John  Tower and carried on by Members of the Texas delegation to read the  words of a 26-year-old Lieutenant Colonel, William Barret Travis, who  at the time was under siege by the forces of Antonio Lopez de Santa  Anna.   On February 24, 1836, Travis penned the following immortal letter:         To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World--Fellow       Citizens & compatriots--        I am besieged, by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under       Santa Anna--I have sustained a continual Bombardment &       cannonade for 24 hours & have not lost a man--The enemy has       demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison       are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken--I have       answered the demand with a cannon shot, & our flag still       waves proudly from the walls--I shall never surrender or       retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of       patriotism & of everything dear to the American character, to       come to our aid, with all dispatch--The enemy is receiving       reinforcements daily & will no doubt increase to three or       four thousand in four or five days. If this call is       neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as       possible & die like a soldier who never forgets what is due       to his own honor & that of his country--Victory or Death.        Signed:        William Barret Travis.    That same love of ``life, liberty, and property of the people'' that  spurred the Texans at the Alamo and throughout the revolution still  lives in each Texan today.   I think it is particularly appropriate that right now this body will  be confirming former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to be the Secretary of  Energy. That is fitting to the spirit of freedom and independence of  Texans.   Texans fought for it, they died for it, and we owe it to their  sacrifice to carry the torch of freedom for future generations, and we  will.   To all Texans: Happy Independence Day.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is reminded that it is a violation  of rule XIX of the Standing Rules of the Senate to impute to another  Senator or Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming of a  Senator.   The Senator from Florida.                             Remembering Doug Coe     Mr. President, yesterday marked the 75th anniversary of the  sinking of the USS Houston (CA-30), the ``flagship'' of the U.S.  Asiatic Fleet, which fought bravely against the Imperial Japanese Navy  Battle Fleet. During an engagement on March 1, 1942, the USS Houston  and the Australian cruiser HMAS Perth were sunk at the Battle of Sunda  Strait, suffering a combined loss of nearly 1,000 servicemen; the  surviving sailors and marines became prisoners of war. After the war,  it was revealed that they had been sent to Japan and then transferred  to the mainland and used as slave labor for construction of the Thai- Burma Railway. Only 266 men from the Houston's complement of 1,008 and  214 of the Perth's complement of 681 returned home after the war.   The news of this horrific loss hit the Lone Star state hard, but with  typical Texan gusto and determination, it prompted a mass recruiting  drive for volunteers to replace the lost crew. On Memorial Day 1942, a  crowd of nearly 200,000 witnessed 1,000 ``Houston Volunteers'' inducted  into the Navy. An accompanying bond drive raised over $85 million,  enough to pay for a new cruiser and an aircraft carrier, the USS San  Jacinto. This historic event speaks to the American spirit and grit as  well as our enduring alliance with Australia.   In honor of this occasion, we remember the brave men of Texas, and  all of those from the Greatest Generation, who gave so much to preserve  freedom  [[Page S1575]]  in the Pacific and fight for America. They fought for country and  liberty in the face of impossible odds. These sailors, soldiers, and  marines represent America's unbeatable determination.                            ____________________
