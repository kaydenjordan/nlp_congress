 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to  Mr. Robert ``Bob'' Von Drasek, as he is better known. Bob was the most  dedicated, committed, and loyal Saul-Alinsky-trained organizer who I  have ever known.   Bob came to the south Austin community during a time of great  turbulence.                                time  1030    The community was in the throes of a great transition from being 80  percent White to becoming 80 percent Black within a 10-year period of  time. Blockbusting, panic peddling, redlining, disinvestment, and all  manner of malfeasance were taking place. Police brutality and other  forms of law enforcement misconduct were rampant.   I met Bob during this period. It was also during this time that the  Organization for a Better Austin, under the leadership of Gail  Cincotta, was organized; the South Austin Coalition Community Council,  SACCC, was formed with Bob as a lead organizer; and I decided to run  for the city council.   Over the years, I have followed Bob's work without exception. South  Austin is practically an all African American community, except for a  few merchants who never left the area, a few White citizens, school  teachers, and policemen. Of course, Bob is White or Caucasian, and yet  he won the hearts of the  [[Page H7163]]  community and the trust of the people. He has developed intimate  relationships with many of the residents and, to many, he is like a  member of their family.   Through Bob's leadership, SACCC became known as the top grassroots  community organization in the Chicagoland area. Bob was always a great  strategist, but the members, like Mr. Ed Bailey, Mrs. Irene Norwood,  Mrs. Lillian Drummond, and Mr. George Lawson, were the voices.   Many people don't know it, but it was SACCC who led community  reinvestment. It was SACCC who organized senior citizens. It was SACCC  who led the fight for LIHEAP. It was SACCC who kept the Austin Bank on  its toes. It was SACCC who united block clubs. It was SACCC who got  people to join local school councils. And it was SACCC who got churches  to open their doors for community meetings.   I have been in buildings with Bob where there was no heat. I have  been in homes where there was no food. I have been on streets where  there were no lights. I have been with Bob in allies where there was no  hope. I have been with Bob and families after their relatives were  shot.   Bob has worked to bring help to the helpless and hope to the  hopeless. Bob VonDrasek, you are a good man, and I thank you and your  family, your wife and children, for what you have meant to our  community and to our world.   True soldiers are always reluctant to come off the battlefield, but  there comes a time when we must put away our swords and shields to  practice war no more. When that time comes, Bob, just know that you  have made a difference. When you came to south Austin, newspapers were  writing that it would be the next big slum. They did not know you and  they did not know the people of south Austin. South Austin is not a  slum. It is a vibrant, forward-thinking, and forward-moving community.   Bob, you have done the Master's work. You have fed the hungry,  clothed the naked, brought hope to the hopeless, and help to the  helpless. You have lifted spirits and you have taught people how to  love, how to live, and how to work together.   I close, Bob, by leaving these words with, and for, you.         If when you give the best of your service, telling the       world that the Savior is come, be not dismayed when men don't       believe you, He understands, and will say, ``Well done.''        Oh, when I come to the end of my journey, weary of life and       the battle is won, carrying the staff and the cross of       redemption, He'll understand, and say, ``Well done.''        If when this life of labor is ended, and the reward of the       race you have run, oh, the sweet rest prepared for faithful,       will be His blest and final, ``Well done.''        But if you try and fail in your trying, hands sore and       scarred from the work you've begun, take up your cross, run       quickly to meet Him, He'll understand, He'll say, ``Well       done.''                            ____________________     DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague who  demonstrates with regularity the intensification of real care for the  people.   Today, we take up another bill that does nothing to make up for the  long-term Republican sabotage of the Affordable Care Act. Tens of  millions of working families also see their healthcare costs skyrocket  due to the repeated Republican efforts to undermine the healthcare  system.   Tens of millions of Americans with preexisting conditions will still  fear the loss of guaranteed health protections with the horrible choice  of loss of health insurance or untenable premiums.   The Republicans' sabotage will cost a typical family of four in my  congressional district $2,250 more in insurance premiums in 2019. The  Republicans' sabotage will cost a typical 55-year-old couple in my  congressional district $3,570 more in 2019.   The 2019 premium hikes follow an average 37 percent increase in 2018.  These premium hikes are especially disturbing when contrasted with the  billions in tax cuts the Republicans gave to insurance companies in  their tax law.   H.R. 6199 makes a small change to health savings accounts used  exclusively by the wealthy. Many of my constituents have trouble paying  for basic living costs like heat, food, and housing. They ask me  regularly for a few hundred dollars to help their kids stay in college.   The vast majority of my constituents can't set aside tens of  thousands of dollars to pay for their medical care out of pocket in a  health savings account. This legislation does nothing to increase  coverage, improve affordability, or change the skyrocketing costs of  healthcare.   I urge my colleagues to reject this bill, and I urge my Republican  colleagues to bring up meaningful legislation to improve coverage and  lower costs to help the tens of millions of Americans in need.
