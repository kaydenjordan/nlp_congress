 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Kentucky  Chapter of the National Waste and Recycling Association, NWRA.   For 60 years, NWRA has been the Nation's leading voice for the  private sector waste and recycling industries, which are essential to  maintaining the quality of American life. The daily delivery of waste  and recycling services impacts all residential, commercial, and  industrial properties.   The NWRA's mission has been to promote the waste and recycling  industry  [[Page S4911]]  through the strategic application of a results-driven advocacy and  vision. The NWRA has created a favorable business climate where members  prosper and provide safe, economically sustainable services and jobs  that benefit communities throughout America.   With nearly 700 members, no chapter has showcased this shining  standard more than Kentucky's NWRA chapter. For example, solid waste in  Louisville has a diversion rate that is twice as efficient as  comparable sized cities.   Solid waste and recycling collection in Louisville is no easy task.  Metro Louisville consists of 83 incorporated cities, numerous  homeowners' associations, and the Urban Services District collected by  Metro Public Works. Despite these challenges, Kentucky's NWRA chapter  continues to meet and exceed all expectations.   I am proud to salute the Kentucky NWRA chapter for their continued  service and accomplishments, and I have no doubt they will continue to  play an integral role in bettering the Commonwealth.                            ____________________
