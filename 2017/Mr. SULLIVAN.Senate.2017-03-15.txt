 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, every week for the past few months, I  have been coming down to the Senate floor to recognize a special  Alaskan, someone who makes my State--what we believe is the most  beautiful and unique State in our country--a better place for all of  us. I call this person our Alaskan of the Week.   Last week, I had the opportunity to recognize Glen Hanson, who  volunteers his time by flying in what we refer to as the Iditarod Air  Force--members of the Alaska volunteer community pilots who fly  supplies in for the Last Great Race.   I know the pages are really interested in the Last Great Race. So,  just as a quick update, we had a winner. It is still going on, but one  musher, Mitch Seavey, crossed the finish line in Nome, AK, in record  time. I congratulate Mitch and all of the members of the Iditarod Air  Force who are still out there, flying, when it is 30, 40, below zero.  It is a tough race, a real tough race. Iowans, I am sure, could do well  in it but not a lot of other Americans.   Today, I want to take my colleagues and viewers to a very different  place in Alaska--about 1,300 miles southeast of Nome, where all the  Iditarod action is going on, really almost a world away--to a beautiful  city called Ketchikan, AK.   Ketchikan is the first port city that people will visit when they  take the Alaska Marine Highway's Inside Passage up to Alaska. It is a  trip that I encourage everybody to take. It is beautiful. Flanked by  the towering Tongass National Forest, it is a place full of life and  spirit, mountains, forests, lots of rain, lots of salmon, and lots of  jaw-dropping scenery.   Yet, like most places across our country, it has its challenges, and  it has a challenge with homelessness, like many communities in America  and Alaska. Luckily, for all of us, Ketchikan is also home to a very  caring community that has set its sights on helping its fellow  Alaskans. One of these people is Pastor Evelyn Erbele, our Alaskan of  the Week, who has dedicated her life to helping others.    Evelyn is the copastor with her husband Terry of the First United  Methodist Church of Ketchikan. There is a day shelter in the church's  social hall, which provides a hot meal, shower, clean clothes, and a  place for the community's homeless to go every day of the week.   Oftentimes when we think of homelessness, we think of people not  having a place to sleep, but it is also important to remember that  being homeless means having no place to go during the day. First City  Homeless Services--Day Shelter gives people a place to go during the  day. Pastor Evelyn oversees that day shelter. According to the manager  of the shelter, Chris Alvarado, who himself has been homeless, she does  so with commitment and with kindness and with compassion.   ``She has a heart of gold and gives 100 percent,'' said one resident  of Ketchikan about Evelyn.   Evelyn met her husband Terry in Seward, AK, where she was a nurse in  1976. From Seward, they set out on a journey to help people around the  world--Nigeria, Lithuania, Russia.   In 2009, Evelyn--now with a Ph.D. in theology and ordained by the  Methodist Church--went up the Alaskan  [[Page S1821]]  Highway from Bellingham to Ketchikan with her husband. She didn't know  when she accepted the job at the Methodist Church in Ketchikan as  copastor that she would be overseeing the day shelter. At first,  according to her, the work was a bit unsettling. ``I never  intentionally walked side by side with people who are homeless,'' she  said. She continued: ``Initially, I may have been biased. I was using  the word `them' when I would describe the people I was working with.  One day, the Lord said to me, Evelyn, you are them. You are my child no  less or no more than they are.'' She said that after hearing that  voice, she realized she wasn't working with ``them'' anymore. ``I was  working with men and women who were in a place that I easily could have  been.''   In her years working to help the homeless in her community in  Ketchikan, she realized that not everybody who is homeless fits neatly  into ``one basket.'' There are lots of reasons for homelessness, she  said, and the homeless may have many, many faces: men, women, children,  families, the old, and the young.   As the Presiding Officer knows, homelessness is a big challenge  across our Nation. On any given day, tens of thousands of Americans-- hundreds of thousands--don't have a permanent place to call home. Of  course, the best way to address this is to have a strong economy and  job opportunities, and that is what we need to be focusing on here in  the Senate. But we also need people like Pastor Evelyn not only in  Alaska but across the country, who are tireless advocates for helping  the homeless. I thank all of them. I especially thank her, and I thank  her for being our Alaskan of the Week.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
