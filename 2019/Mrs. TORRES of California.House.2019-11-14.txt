 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   My amendment would add language directing the U.S. Export Finance  Agency to emphasize outreach to Tribal businesses, including Alaskan  Native corporations, that export goods and services.   There is a long history of successful Federal economic development  programs leaving--leaving--Indian Country behind.   Ensuring that Tribal businesses are aware of the services and  resources that the agency provides is absolutely critical. Companies  that increase their exports are able to raise wages, take on additional  employees, and further invest in their communities.   Increased economic development in Indian Country means increased  economic opportunity, which, in turn, means more self-determination for  Tribes and a greater ability to take care of their people as sovereign  nations.   The U.S. Export Finance Agency has proven to be an important tool in  expanding U.S. exports and creating American jobs, but we need to  ensure that it is a tool that benefits all Americans, including Native  Americans. And that is exactly what this amendment does.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member  for his support. There has been a lot of talk around China and zero  talk around Indian Country.   All this amendment does is require the agency to conduct outreach-- outreach--to Indian Country to ensure that Tribal export businesses  benefit from the same services and resources we offer every other  American business.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   As the new Export Finance Agency works to help American businesses  export their products and services, it is critical that we ensure that  we are not enriching or empowering the bad actors, especially those  involved in drug trafficking, corruption, or human rights violations.   We don't want to help those whose actions are contrary to our  American values, and we certainly don't want to help those who act  against our best interests.   That is why H.R. 4863 prohibits the Export Finance Agency from doing  business with individuals who are subject to U.S. sanctions.   I have offered an amendment to further clarify that this prohibition  also extends to individuals who are subject to sanctions related to  human rights and violations of free speech. This is especially  important given the growing challenges to free speech across the world,  including in Hong Kong and in Xinjiang.   Government officials or other entities who are involved in the  suppression of free speech should not benefit from the agency's  investment, and all of us should agree to that.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    I take issue with the ranking member  questioning my hard work. I have spent every year since I came to  Congress in 2015 working to address the issues of public corruption in  Central America and throughout Latin America. So for this to come up  now is, frankly, very disappointing.   My amendment, yes, does build on important provisions that are  already in the bill, which prohibit extending credit to individuals who  are subject to U.S. sanctions.   These provisions will protect the new agency, uphold American values,  and protect our national security.   I urge my colleagues to find a way to see through this fog and  understand that this is the right way to go about it. I hope they will  support the bill and support my amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1545
