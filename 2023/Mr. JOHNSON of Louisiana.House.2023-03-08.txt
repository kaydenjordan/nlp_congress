 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I am going to pause here for 5  seconds, and I will tell you why.   I did that to note something. I did that because I want to note that  our Federal Government just spent $1 million in 5 seconds--$1 million.  By the time I finish this speech, the government will have spent over  $50 million. By the time my colleagues finish their speeches, that  figure will be in the hundreds of millions.   As it stands right now, our government is spending $197,000 per  second, which as a recent publication by the America First Policy  Institute points out, is faster than the speed of light.   Let's look at this graphic here real quick.   My staff just ran this up on the copy machine because I wanted to  blow it up. This is a post by the AFPI. They point out the fastest  things on the Earth, and they note that we are actually spending right  now faster than the speed of light. The speed of light is 186,282 miles  per second. We are spending $197,000 per second.   Our national debt is well over $31 trillion right now--$31 trillion.   Now, if those figures alarm you, Mr. Speaker, you are not alone.  Everybody on our side of the aisle is deeply concerned about this. We  understand what a risk it is to our national security and to the  stability of our constitutional Republic.                                time  1845    However, you won't find anyone--hardly anyone, I think--on the other  side of the aisle who understands this or agrees with it. I mean, based  upon their voting records, based upon their proposals to continue to  raise taxes and raise spending, based upon some of the speeches they  gave here on the floor tonight, they don't get it, and neither does the  mainstream media. That ought to be of even greater concern to you.   Earlier this month, the Congressional Budget Office released a  frightening report. All Members of Congress in a bipartisan fashion met  in the congressional auditorium this afternoon to hear the CBO Director  relay some of this really frightening information.   It is about our economic outlook. If you haven't heard about it yet,  it is because really the media is not covering this. The 24-hour news  cycle buries it for the next big thing, but there is hardly anything  bigger than this.   Let me give you a couple of the highlights that came out of that  briefing this afternoon:   Number one: Net interest on our national debt will reach $10.5  trillion over the next decade.   Now, I know these numbers are big and it is sort of hard to grasp  them, but you think about $10.5 trillion over the next 10 years. For  reference, listen to this: since 1940 the total net interest payments  on our national debt has been $12.9 trillion, adjusted for inflation.  Since 1940.   In the next 10 years, we are going to spend $10.5 trillion just on  interest alone. It is staggering. Our national debt is going to reach  $154 trillion by 2053--$150-plus trillion. That equals $540,000 per  household when you adjust for inflation. That is more than four times  the current median household income.   Deficits are going to average--average--$2 trillion annually, or 6.1  percent of our gross domestic product over the next 10 years. The  government had a lower deficit than this every single year from 1945 to  2009. The cost of the annual interest will balloon from $350 billion to  $1.4 trillion in just a decade. That is 20 cents of every tax dollar  that is collected by this Federal Government is going to go to paying  interest on America's debt.   Mr. Speaker, we are in uncharted economic waters. We have never seen  anything like this. Our country has only faced an economic threat like  this during times of war and pandemic. If you only listen to the media  and Democrat politicians, all of our colleagues over here, you would  think there is really no issue at all.   I mean, the Biden administration continues to portray this rosy  outlook. They were saying it today: the state of the economy isn't so  bad. We are doing well. We are trending in the right direction, they  say. That is absolutely not true.   The CBO, by the way, is a nonpartisan entity. They don't choose a  side. They just came in and presented the objective facts to  Republicans and Democrats because we want to make everybody face this  harsh reality.   President Biden has touted that his administration ``cut $1.7  trillion of the deficit.'' He says that is evidence that he is really  serious about the national debt, but that is obviously fiction as well.  That reduction naturally occurred with the statutory end of the  increased spending that Congress approved to combat COVID-19. That  wasn't because of any shrewd economic policy from the White House. It  is exactly the opposite.   Speaking of economic madness, you know, tomorrow the President is  expected to release his 2023 budget proposal. It is more than a month  late. Every news report, all the early ones, suggest that his budget is  replete with trillions of dollars in new taxes, raising taxes in the  middle of an inflation crisis that he created; more spending on  frivolous, liberal pet policies and projects and no plan at all to  reduce the deficit.   For the first time in his Presidency, he won't have a Democrat rubber  stamp over here. He won't have the Democrats in charge of this House to  go along with that destructive agenda.   Mr. Speaker, the American people made their voices heard when they  gave Republicans control of this House, and we are going to do our job.  They have entrusted our new majority to provide a much-needed check on  the Biden administration, and that starts with the power of the purse.   Over the next few months, the discourse around here is going to  intensify. There is going to be some heated debate. It is likely to get  off track with squabbles about everything from defense spending to  earmarks, but House Republicans will not lose sight through this of the  bigger picture. We are going to rein in spending and inflation because  we must. We are going to promote responsible budgeting because we must.  We are going to chart our country on a course back to fiscal sanity. It  is the duty of every Member of this body to do so.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield to a number of my colleagues  tonight who will participate in this Special Order hour, talking about  lots of important things on the hearts and minds of the American  people. I just want to suggest that the debt is one of those.   Mr. Speaker, I yield first to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs.  Miller), my dear friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  highlighting that really important issue. The WOTUS rule has gotten  completely out of control.   Mr. Speaker, I yield next to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  D'Esposito), one of our new Members to Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his  service as a police officer, law enforcement, and also now in Congress.  We are delighted to have you.   Mr. Speaker, I yield next to the gentleman from California (Mr.  LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that  wise counsel. It is about responsibility, and the gentleman said it so  well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  remarks; that was so well said. The gentleman is a great orator, and I  love how he laid out the case methodically. That is what a former U.S.  attorney from the Western District of Tennessee would do.   Facts are stubborn things, as John Adams said.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cline),  another brilliant lawyer and also my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  remarks. The regulatory environment is just out of control, and that  recent Supreme Court opinion of West Virginia v. EPA came out on our  side, and I think that some of these agencies will  [[Page H1203]]  begin to have their wings clipped a bit, and hopefully this WOTUS rule  will be handled appropriately. I thank the gentleman for highlighting  that important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Brecheen),  one of the new stars of the Republican Party in the Congress, a former  State senator there who now represents the Second District representing  his people very well.    Mr. Speaker, it is a harsh truth, and we  have to address it. My colleague is right. As he implied there, the  inevitable result of living beyond our means today is that we and our  children inevitably are going to have to live below our means tomorrow.   We are going to have higher debt, higher taxes, less security, less  opportunity. It is not going to be the same America that we have always  known and valued. It is a harsh truth.    Mr. Speaker, I yield next to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Grothman), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I  point out, as he said, that our resolution blocking those crazy changes  to D.C.'s criminal code was so strong that even Joe Biden couldn't  agree to veto it. We are doing the right thing. We must continue, and  we will.   I am grateful to my Republican colleagues for joining me for this  Special Order hour.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 26 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, March 9, 2023, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
