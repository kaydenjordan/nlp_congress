 Madam Speaker, today, I rise in support of the  resolution to remove the arbitrary deadline for ratification of the  equal rights amendment, which is designed to end the legal distinctions  between men and women.   Madam Speaker, signed in 1776, the Declaration of Independence  states: ``All men are created equal.'' Really? Following the birth of  our Nation, it took women 144 years to secure the right to vote and  even longer for women of color. It took 187 years to be promised equal  pay, 197 years to get reproductive rights, and 198 years to get a  credit card or buy a home.   Yet, Madam Speaker, the women in this country are still fighting for  equality. Madam Speaker, we are tired of waiting.                            ____________________
