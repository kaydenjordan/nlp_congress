 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  the small business development centers located throughout my district  and throughout the country. These development centers are Statewide,  nationally accredited programs that provide one-on-one consulting,  training, and information resources to empower new and existing small  businesses.   They are a public-private partnership between the Small Business  Administration, the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce and Economic  Development, and universities and colleges across the Commonwealth.   Clarion University and Penn State both have fantastic small business  development centers whose mission is to provide entrepreneurs with the  knowledge needed to make smart decisions and to see their businesses  grow and prosper.   Over the past few months, I have received many letters in support of  small business development centers from constituents who have utilized  these services to start or maintain a small business of their own.   Lisa from Smethport wrote that, after growing up working in her  family's restaurant, it had always been a dream to operate her own  restaurant. Through the help of the Clarion University Small Business  Development Center, her dream became a reality.   Joseph from Punxsutawney worked with the center to help manage his  business's financial records and receive a line of credit. He wrote  that the information and advice they provided helped him make critical  business decisions with confidence.   And Emily from Franklin recently opened up a charming bed and  breakfast after working with the development center staff to write up a  business plan and organize the financial aspects of her business. She  hopes to continue working with the development center and said she  truly feels as though they want her to succeed.   Mr. Speaker, these are just some of the stories I have received, and  I thank all of my constituents that took the time to share their  stories with me. The success stories of small business owners that work  with development centers are endless. They have greatly helped economic  progress in my district.   The Clarion University center helped start up 55 new businesses in  2017 and supported more than 500 constituents.   Nationally, small businesses make up 99.7 percent of U.S. employer  firms. In 2018, there were more than 30 million small businesses that  employed 58 million people.   The development center program, operated through the Small Business  Administration, was allocated $130 million for fiscal year 2018.  Through the continued funding of small business development centers,  paired with the passage of probusiness legislation like the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act, entrepreneurship can continue to thrive in Pennsylvania  and all across this country.   Mr. Speaker, that is something every American can applaud and that we  should be proud of.

He leaves behind his daughters,  Cathy and Mary, and many grand- and great-grandchildren.   He was a World War II Navy veteran who served on the hospital ship  the USS Tranquility. During the war, he and his crewmates were  dispatched to receive survivors of the sinking USS Indianapolis, which  led to the largest loss of life at sea from a single ship in the  history of the Navy.   After the war, Dick married his loving wife of 67 years, Rosalyn Jean  Kline, and, together, they owned and operated Kline Funeral Home.   Dick stayed active in the community over the years. He was a member  of the VFW and the American Legion. He belonged to the Rimersburg  United Methodist Church, and he gave 55 years of service as the  secretary of Rimersburg borough. In 1999, they named him Citizen of the  Year.   Madam Speaker, Dick Kline left a lasting impression in his service to  his country, his community, and all those who knew him. He will be  missed.                            ____________________
