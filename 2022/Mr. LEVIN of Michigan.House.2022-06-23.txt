 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with  transgender and nonbinary young people and condemn the relentless  discriminatory, anti-LGBTQ+ bills and hateful rhetoric we are  witnessing across the Nation.   In recent months, Republican State legislatures and elected officials  have targeted the LGBTQ+ community for cheap political gain and  referred falsely to anyone who opposes attempts to infringe on the  rights of others as ``groomers''.   There are at least 206 active bills across State legislatures this  year alone that target the LGBTQ+ community.   Here are some samples of this hateful legislation:   Excluding trans youth from participating in school sports.   Restricting trans youth from accessing the bathroom.   Banning curriculum to deny the existence of LGBTQ+ people in the  classroom.   Criminalizing medical providers who provide gender-affirming  healthcare.    Targeting parents of LGBTQ+ children who simply want to support their  kids as best they can.   That is right: LGBTQ+ rights are being attacked from all angles.   In Texas, providing gender-affirming healthcare is now considered  ``child abuse,'' and parents of transgender youth face a real risk of  being separated from their children.   This month, in Idaho, a group of extremists were arrested after  plotting to riot and cause violence during a Pride event. In recent  days, as people around the United States have sought out the joyous  parades and events that come with Pride Month, including in my own  district, GOP politicians and preachers have put out calls for killing  LGBTQ+ people.  [[Page H5830]]    There is no doubt: Bigotry toward the LGBTQ+ community has grave and  potentially life-threatening consequences. According to the Trevor  Project, in the past year, 45 percent of LGBTQ+ young people seriously  considered attempting suicide, including more than half of transgender  and nonbinary youth. Similarly, 93 percent of transgender and nonbinary  youth reported worrying about being denied access to medical care due  to State and local laws.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today as the dad of a gay son and a  longtime ally of the LGBTQ+ community to say that these radical  policies have no place in America and that this Congress must take  concrete action.   In February of this year, I was proud to vote to pass the Equality  Act, which protects LGBTQ+ people from discrimination in jobs, housing,  and public accommodations. While it would not undo every single one of  these horrible State policies I have mentioned, it would go a long way  to enhance the civil rights of the LGBTQ+ community and send the  message that we stand against bigotry and hate.   Unfortunately, the filibuster is holding this bill up in the Senate.  One thing is for certain: The filibuster must be abolished to create  any viable pathway to send the Equality Act to President Biden's desk.  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the Capitol to hear the cries  of the LGBTQ+ community members, and particularly trans and nonbinary  young people, who need these protections desperately and are counting  on your support.   Here in the House, our work is far from done. I am glad we are  considering the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act, which improves data  collection on sexual orientation and gender identity to provide better  resources for the LGBTQ+ community so that we have the data we need to  make good law. We must also pass legislation to provide mental health  care for LGBTQ+ people, offer hate crimes protections, and uplift and  support the dignity of all LGBTQ+ individuals across this Nation.   All of us, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, must  stand collectively against this hate and foster inclusion for all.  Let's get to work.                            ____________________
