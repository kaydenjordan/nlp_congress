 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and the  establishment of a national commission to study the events of January  6, 2021. The January 6 insurrection was a violent and bloody attack on  our democracy. Domestic terrorists stormed this building. They did so  in order to stop the peaceful transition of power and to keep Donald  Trump in office, even after he lost the 2020 election fair and square.   We have never seen this type of attack before in this country. I pray  we never will again. That is why we need to establish a national  commission to understand how this happened, to gather all the facts  surrounding these events, and, most importantly, to ensure it never  happens again.   I want to thank Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member Katko for  working across the aisle to establish this bipartisan commission. The  people who took part in this insurrection caused great damage to this  building, dozens of people were injured, and five people lost their  lives. But despite the horror of that day, our democracy endured.   This commission will allow us to understand how this happened and how  we prevent it and gather all the facts. The search for truth matters.  Protecting our democracy matters. This should be a bipartisan vote to  strongly support the work of this commission.
