 Mr. Speaker, here we are again, facing the  possibility of a government shutdown. It is one of the most foolish  acts possible. What we have seen in the past when this occurs where  there are some people who decide they want to force the government to  shut down.   It only hurts our employees, and it hurts the public, having a denial  of service in many instances. The employees are sent home. They are off  the payroll temporarily. But what has always happened is that we always  end up paying them because it is not their fault, and, as a result, the  taxpayer loses twice. They lose the services, and they end up having to  pay, essentially, public employees to take a forced vacation.   Now, the current controversy is largely about the fate of almost  700,000 undocumented young people who were brought here as children.  This shouldn't be a matter of major debate. We can take care of the  immigration issues if we allow the process to work.   Remember a couple years ago the Senate passed a bipartisan  immigration reform bill--not perfect, maybe a C-plus on the scale, but  it would have fixed the problem in the short and intermediate term.  Unfortunately, the House leadership never allowed us to vote on it,  probably because they knew it would pass.   Now we are facing anxiety again. We have had people arguing about  what vulgarity the President used or who is acting in good faith, but  the fact is that we have a proposal from Senator Durbin and Senator  Graham, a bipartisan proposal, that met the broad outlines that the  President earlier talked about that looks as though it will pass the  Senate, and we have a strong possibility of passing here in the House.   Now, there is some controversy. People are suggesting Democrats want  to shut the government down. Absolutely not. My Republican friends are  in complete control of the House and the Senate and the White House,  and they can, as they did recently with the short-term extension, pass  it themselves. But if they want to work with us, they ought to include  us in this effort.   I would suggest that we stop governing behind closed doors and having  the majority party cater to a small handful of people who are making  demands that would not be acceptable to the broad House and probably  aren't even acceptable to most Republicans. Let's bring the best  approaches forward.   It is pretty simple. Allow the House to vote on the Graham-Durbin  proposal. I understand there is one from our friend Mr. Goodlatte,  Congressman McCaul. Bring them forward.   There are legislative processes--queen of the Hill, king of the  Hill--where you can have multiple votes on issues that are related, and  at the end there is one that is left standing that represents the  majority.   I would suggest that there is no reason to play games with the  integrity of government services, play games with our employees, and  play games with providing key services to the public; and, most  importantly, stop using almost 700,000 young people and millions of  their family members, their employers, and their fellow workers as  pawns.   Let's bring the proposals forward, allow an up-or-down vote, and  resolve this rather than threaten the possibility of wasting money,  wasting services, and further frustrating the American public. They  deserve better. This is a simple resolution that was in our capacity  this week.                            ____________________
