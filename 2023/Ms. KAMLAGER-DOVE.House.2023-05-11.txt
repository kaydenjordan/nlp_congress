 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against  attacks on parents across our Nation.   Parents and adult guardians play a critical role in children's lives  as nurturers, providers, and confidants.   However, how can they protect or provide for their children when  their elected officials choose time and time again to disregard the  will of the people, ignore legislation that could save lives, slash  funding to critical programs for our children and families, and then  defame them for being who they are.   Let me tell you who they are. In the United States, there are over  200,000 foster parents. Forty percent of married couples with children  are stepcouples. Sixteen percent of children live in blended families.  There are over 100,000 adoptions each year, and 4 million Americans are  adopted. All of these statistics represent parents, and it is not up to  any of us to define what a parent is.   As a mother, I am appalled by the state of our country. MAGA  Republican legislation confuses guidelines around abortion care,  threatening the lives of mothers across the country.    Our children aren't safe to go to the grocery store, school, houses  of worship, or the mall. They can't turn around in a driveway or  retrieve a basketball. Our children go hungry when the government  decides to cruelly slash programs like SNAP and WIC that put food on  our families' tables.   This Sunday is Mother's Day, and I will be celebrating with my  family, but the voice in the back of my head will ask me, what kind of  world are they growing up in? This is not what our country is meant to  look like.   Every bio-parent, stepparent, adoptive parent, foster parent, or  guardian who loves their child is a parent, and we are all scared about  the world our children are set to inherit.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly oppose H.R.  2, House Republicans' child deportation act.   Yes, our immigration system is broken, but instead of productive,  bipartisan legislation that would work to fix it, Republicans want to  double down on immoral, cruel, and inhumane Trump-era policies that  hurt children and families and stoke fear and greater division.   With title 42 set to expire today, we should take this opportunity as  a chance to address the humanitarian crisis at our border by focusing  on solutions that alleviate pressures at our border and fundamentally  change the dysfunction and chaos that is happening.   Instead, this bill would make our immigration crisis that much worse.  H.R. 2 would require expedited deportations and expanded detention for  unaccompanied children; impose new restrictions on asylum while  threatening to end the asylum system as we know it; detain even more  migrant families in facilities with poor and unacceptable conditions;  resume President Trump's failed policy of building a border wall; and  so much more.   Mr. Speaker, I hope the American people heard some of the statements  made by my Republican colleagues when this bill was heard in committee.   Republicans dog whistle, fearmonger, lie, and resort to conspiracy  theories about our border to hide the fact that they have no real  solutions to this growing crisis. Harmful policies meant to exacerbate  confusion, waste more money, and hurt people fleeing dangerous  situations are not the answer. Many are fleeing war zones; areas of  conflict; countries that employ torture, violence, rape, and ethnic  cleansing as tactics of control.   What are we proposing to do with H.R. 2? Be a cruel neighbor and  throw them back into harm's way while telling Mexico to shoulder much  of this burden.   America is supposed to be a nation of immigrants. We are supposed to  have compassion for those seeking asylum. Republican policies like H.R.  2 run counter to those very fundamental values.   Unlike some of my GOP colleagues, I do not for a second believe that  immigrants from Mexico are a threat to us. If anything, the threats we  face are homegrown. They take the form of xenophobic, transphobic, and  hateful individuals who twist the meaning of the Constitution to fit  their own political agendas.    Mr. Speaker, as for the drug myth, over 80 percent  of drugs smuggled into our country are done by Americans, not  immigrants.   Let's get serious and talk about meaningful steps toward immigration  reform that include what it means to be a global partner in this space,  not this wildly inappropriate and ineffective bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to condemn Republicans' attack  on our workers. The GOP's surprise billing our workers act would allow  States to send surprise bills to workers for unemployment benefits  overcompensation paid to them during the pandemic for as long as 10  years after the overpayment was issued.   Is it the job of the American people to keep the receipts of 10 years  past of UI payments so that they don't go to jail?   People who applied for these benefits and were overpaid did not know  they had been overpaid. These were the result of a government mistake.   To add salt to the wound, Republicans want to cut fraud prevention  programs by $400 million over the next 5 years. Unbelievable.   This legislation hurts our State employee unions by allowing States  to contract out jobs, which is what led to this mess in the first  place.   Let's be clear: This is an old trope from the Republican playbook.  Blame and demonize poor and Black women, insinuating they are gaming  the system, when Republicans have their own welfare queen to deal with.   How can you possibly lecture Americans about paying their bills when  you fail time and time again to come together and meet your financial  obligations as a country?                                time  1530
