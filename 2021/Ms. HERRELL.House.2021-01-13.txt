 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to these Articles of  Impeachment.   Political violence has no place in our constitutional Republic, and  those who assaulted police officers and forced their way into the  Capitol are responsible for their criminal actions.   Leaders in both parties have a responsibility to condemn such  violence, whether in the Halls of Congress or on the streets of  America.   I don't believe, Madam Speaker, that the American people have an  appetite for this. They are expecting us to do the will of those who  sent us from each State around the Nation.   Right now, Madam Speaker, we are seeing this body that has impeached  once before trying to do it a second time. Two wrongs do not make a  right.   We have got to stand for the American people, because we will not get  a second chance to get this right the first time.
