 Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to Judy       Reardon and recognize a long life devoted to serving the Granite State.        Everyone involved in public service in New Hampshire knows the name       Judy Reardon. When Presidential candidates or journalists on the       national level wanted an expert perspective in the Granite State, they       reached out to Judy. When prospective candidates for statewide office       needed advice from someone who ran--and won--several campaigns, they       turned to Judy. When candidates were locked in a tough election fight       and needed counsel to get them through Election Day, they called Judy.       When government officials needed guidance on how best to use the tools       of government to serve their constituents, they sought Judy. When local       advocates needed advice on how best to champion their issues, they       looked to Judy. And Judy always answered with suggestions and       encouragement that were forward-thinking, incredibly astute, uncommonly       direct, unfailingly honest, and oftentimes very funny.        I am one of the many people who counted on Judy's sage advice, and we       enjoyed a fiercely loyal friendship. Few people have had an impact on       my life--personally and professionally--as much as Judy Reardon. From       the New Hampshire State Senate to the Governor's office and the U.S.       Senate, Judy filled numerous roles on my team: counsel, legislative       director, and senior adviser. But her different staff titles over the       years can never truly capture her importance to me or the significance       of her work. She was my confidante and always the smartest person in       the room. Judy was by my side when we expanded kindergarten for New       Hampshire children. She helped me protect women's reproductive rights       in New Hampshire. She was with me when we fervently defended the       Affordable Care Act for years in the U.S. Senate. She was with me       through every tough reelection. Judy devoted her life to public       service--specifically, to bettering the lives of Granite Staters.        Sadly, Judy passed away last week after a long period of illness.       Over the past few days, her many friends and former colleagues have       released statements expressing the magnitude of her loss. It has been a       tough week as we grieve a giant in public service. Yet our tears       quickly turn to laughter and smiles as we recall fun memories with Judy       and remember her fire, her unique sense of humor, her relentless       spirit, and her commitment to her craft. I've heard so many stories       about her mentorship of members of my staff and young activists who       wanted to learn from her, work beside her and match--as best they       could--her passion for making a difference. To these people, Judy       developed a reputation for being--in their words--``scary'' and       ``intimidating.'' When they presented their work or an idea to Judy,       they knew it would be scrutinized by a brilliant mind who would share       her thoughts in a candid way. Still everyone knew that her words were       meant to challenge them to reach their full potential, to strengthen       their arguments, and to refine their points-of-view. Everyone felt       better about a path forward after talking with Judy.        I have known Judy since 1986, and it is difficult to imagine a future       without her. I will miss her counsel before big decisions and       consequential votes. I will miss her voice in meetings. I will miss her       loyalty to me and the shared causes to which we devoted so much time       and attention. She accomplished so much in public service, yet her       story will continue to be written by the countless young staffers and       activists she inspired over the years to follow her example. On behalf       of the people of the Granite State, I ask my colleagues and all       Americans to join me in recognizing Judy Reardon and keeping her       family--her beloved sister Patricia            [[Page S9772]]            Cornell, her brother-in-law Rik Cornell, and her devoted cat Huey--in       our thoughts and prayers.                                      ____________________
