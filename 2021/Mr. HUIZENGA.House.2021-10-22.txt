 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of  Corporal Duane E. Dewey for his service, sacrifice, and dedication to  our country.   Corporal Dewey's instinctive action and bravery saved the lives of a  number of his fellow soldiers and earned him the highest military  decoration for valor, the Medal of Honor.   He began his service in the Marine Corps in 1951 when he enlisted for  the duration of the Korean war.   On April 16, 1952, Corporal Dewey and his fellow marines were engaged  in a firefight where they were outnumbered more than 20-1. During this  fight, Corporal Dewey was wounded in the legs by an enemy grenade.  While being treated for this injury, another grenade was thrown within  reach.   At a moment's notice, Corporal Dewey grabbed the grenade and  literally sat on it while pulling the medic who was treating him onto  his body, using his body as a shield to save those around him.   Amazingly, although he sustained severe injuries from both grenades  and a separate additional bullet wound to the abdomen, Corporal Dewey  survived the fight.   These actions of this great, brave, and courageous man earned  Corporal Dewey the Medal of Honor, which I hold here today, his  challenge coin. It was actually presented by President Dwight D.  Eisenhower himself, the first one that he did personally, who notably  remarked--accurately, I would say--that Corporal Dewey must have a  ``body of steel.''   Madam Speaker, Corporal Dewey is the epitome of an American hero. May  we honor his legacy and never forget his selfless actions.                            ____________________
