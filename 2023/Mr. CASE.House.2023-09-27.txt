 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this measure, and I must  say to my friend and the chair of the subcommittee and to my majority  colleagues that it is deeply frustrating and deeply regretful to have  to stand in opposition to a bill that, in so many ways, is a very good  bill.   My colleague Mr. Garcia reflected in his comments just now on many  provisions of the bill with which I can agree. This bill does great  things for the Indo-Pacific. It is eyes wide open to the threat of  China. It funds the Pacific Deterrence Initiative. It provides for  strengthening our relationships with allies and partners. It helps our  servicemembers.   There is so much good in this bill, so what is so frustrating is to  see it infected with the same kind of partisan provisions and divisive  issues that, for a long time, have not been a part of the Subcommittee  on Defense. This has been a refuge of sorts from the culture wars, from  the division that we have seen elsewhere. It now no longer is, and this  is the consequence.   The consequence is division in the Department of Defense and in our  relations with and review of the Department of Defense, which should  not be infected by these areas for a Department that is, again, very  realistic about the threats we face.   My colleagues have talked about a lot of these issues already that  create fatal flaws in this bill, but I am going to focus on one, and  that is climate change. Oh, no. Let's not say those words, ``climate  change.'' Somehow, we are all supposed to react to this as if it is  some kind of thing that we can put up on the shelf.    The Department of Defense does not ignore climate change. The  Department of Defense has had its eyes wide open for decades now on the  risks of climate change.   We can go back, for example, to January 2019, which is one of its  most recent reports. This is a report from the DOD, ``Report on Effects  of a Changing Climate to the Department of Defense.'' Is that a better  way to say it?   I quote from the executive summary: ``The effects of a changing  climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to the  Department of Defense missions, operational plans, and installations.  Our 2018 National Defense Strategy prioritizes long-term strategic  competition with great power competitors. . . . To achieve these goals,  DOD must be able to adapt current and future operations to address the  impacts of a variety of threats and conditions, including those from  weather and natural events. To that end, DOD factors in the effects of  the environment into its mission planning and execution to build  resilience.''   That is pretty realistic on the part of the DOD. This is followed up  by very definite reports, including the ``Department of Defense Climate  Adaptation Plan'' from September 1, 2021; the ``Climate Adaptation Plan  2022 Progress Report''; and the ``Climate Risk Analysis,'' October  2021.   DOD is not ignoring this issue however you want to label it, nor can  it. Shall we ignore the rise in sea level at Pearl Harbor, where we are  investing billions and billions of dollars? Shall we ignore the  consequences to Guam from hurricanes? Of course, we need to do this.   Let's get away from this approach of defunding climate risk analysis  in the DOD.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I am reading the text of this amendment, and  it says here none of the funds appropriated may be used for the  purposes of teleworking or remote working for any employee or any  contractor of the Department of Defense on a regular and recurring  basis.   That seems pretty excessive to me.   Now, I would agree with my colleague from Wyoming that certainly  telework presents opportunities in some cases for abuse just as regular  work does, but we are living in a new world. We are living in a post- COVID world.   There is a place in our workforce for regular work, which is not so  regular anymore, and there is a place in our world for telework.   I can certainly envision legitimate purposes for an employee or a  contractor of the Department of Defense to engage in telework; for  example, particularly, a valuable contractor who does, in fact, choose  to work at home and that contractor's services are desired by the  Department of Defense.   Why should we limit the Department of Defense in its ability to  utilize telework if and as appropriate? By the way, it may be not only  about the efficiency of the work, but it may be more cost effective. It  may be more cost effective for that work to be engaged in from the  telework perspective. We have the technology to do that.   There are a lot of ways that we can provide for work. We are  obviously in a significant recruiting and retention challenge for the  Department of Defense, and if the Department of Defense wants to engage  in telework or offer that as an alternative to satisfy its own needs, I  see no reason to provide an excessive amendment that essentially rules  out an entire option that is available really to the rest of our  society.   Madam Chair, for those reasons, I must oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, to my friend and colleague, Mr. Calvert, Main  Street small business is engaging in telework today. It is finding the  opportunities to utilize telework where appropriate. Main Street  government is engaging in telework where appropriate.   I completely agree with the concerns for telework in a national  security environment. Presumably, if one was exercising flexibility  from a responsible perspective, one would not engage in telework,  especially in the national security area.   Obviously, we have a great part of our Federal Government that does  not engage in national security directly. Why shouldn't the Department  of Defense have this particular flexibility?   Again, the excessiveness of the amendment and the no exceptions at  all nature of the amendment, I think, advise against it.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, to my colleague, I am simply reading the  language of the amendment, ``on a regular and recurring basis.'' There  may well be suitable reasons why telework would be advisable on a  regular and recurring basis which is not health related and not very  specifically narrow as she has pointed out.   We have belabored this point long enough. I am prepared to close, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, suitable oversight of telework by the DOD is  appropriate. It is something that we should engage in. To foreclose it  under all circumstances, I believe, is unwise.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I just heard my friend and chair of the  subcommittee say something that I completely agree with, which is we  need real solutions to immigration and the border crisis, and that is  true. This takes a piecemeal approach that is unnecessarily broad and  unnecessary in general.   To our knowledge, there is no current or planned use of active  military bases to support DHS' need for temporary or long-term  detention of migrants crossing the southern border. Certainly, if the  claims by my colleague from New York are correct, that is worthy of  debate.   However, the amendment goes much further than that particular point.  It says that the military cannot provide any assistance to the  Department of Homeland Security to house persons on a military  installation. Therefore, we have to ask the question: Is that too broad  in an amendment?   Let's take a look at a couple of examples or at least one example in  particular. It would apply in that case to governmentwide efforts like  Operation Allies Welcome, which was the evacuation of Afghan refugees  after the collapse of the government in Afghanistan in 2021. The DHS at  the time worked with the Departments of Defense and  [[Page H4615]]  State to use military installations to temporarily house Afghan  refugees fleeing imminent danger and persecution. This was a critical  tool to save lives.   There are, I am sure, other situations that we can envision in which  we would want to access our military installations for very tailored  purposes, with congressional oversight, that are under the control of  the Department of Homeland Security.   If we want to have a debate over immigration, let's have it. If we  want to recognize that we have a real problem, I am the first to  recognize that, as well. The amendment certainly takes a very broad  approach to a problem that I think we can all agree is definitely a  problem and rules out many other situations that, in all honesty, we  would want the discretion for the DOD. It is much better for Congress  to retain that discretion to the DOD where necessary for national  security purposes with congressional oversight and with very tailored  congressional restrictions.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, first of all, I think we are trying to confirm  whether or not Floyd Bennett Field is, in fact, a military installation  within the definition of the gentleman's amendment.   That point aside, again, I would say that if we are trying to solve  the particular issue that my colleague and friend from New York is  trying to solve, let's try to solve that one. Let's not do so with a  blunt instrument that takes away discretion across the board for  legitimate uses of military installations under congressional  oversight, such as the Afghan refugee situation.   We can talk about this on the floor. Yes, it is completely necessary  to discuss and debate this, but let's not overplay this so that the DOD  never has the flexibility to have any military installation used for  legitimate purposes that we would all agree with.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, we have confirmed, to the prior amendment, that  Floyd Bennett Field in New York is not a military installation.   Do we not value diversity in our military? That is the question in  this amendment.   Does it matter that we have a diverse military? Does it matter or  not?   Do we not value equity in our military? Does it matter?   Do we not value inclusion? Do we want a military that represents our  society or just a slice of it? That is the question.   If you say that you value a diverse, equal, and inclusive military,  if you say that that is of value to you, it doesn't happen  automatically. It takes effort.   That is why our military leaders over a long period of time now have  valued the investment in diversity, equity, and inclusion. They  understand that a military that reflects the society that we live in  values our military and accelerates, enhances, and improves the overall  service that it provides. They understand that that military in that  situation will be supported by the American people.   They understand that it will be respected around the world where many  other militaries of our partners and allies around the world do value  diversity, equity, and inclusion. They don't have these debates in  their parliaments and congresses. They don't face these attacks on the  attempt to value these attributes within our military.                                time  1300    We need to back those up, and yes, that does take an investment.  Where you think that those efforts are wrong, where you think they have  gone too far, where you think that they are somehow affecting military  service, then go ahead and oversee those efforts.   Your solution is to cut the funding from all of them because you  don't  [[Page H4616]]  value these attributes in our military. You think that valuing these  attributes leads to a weak military. I heard you say that. I don't  agree with that. That is fundamentally not a position that we agree  with.   From our perspective, again, to take a blunt instrument and wipe out  an entire department that values efforts that will improve military  service, and, by the way, improve military recruitment, I hope the  author of the amendment agrees that military recruitment is a major  challenge for our military.   Yet, let's just say to whole parts of our society, sorry, we don't  value you at all because we are not going to take care of trying to  provide for diversity, equality, and inclusion. That is the wrong  approach.   Fundamentally, this is a difference in policy. It is a difference in  goal. Apparently, it is a difference in assessment of what makes our  military strong and will continue to make it strong.   For those reasons, I have to strongly oppose this amendment. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, obviously we have a difference of opinion here.   I would also submit that the leadership of our military have a  difference of opinion with the perspectives expressed by the author of  this amendment.   Again, they understand the values of pursuing a diverse, equitable,  equal, and inclusive military. They understand the challenges of a  military that is not representative of the American people. They  understand the need to provide for that investment.   Again, we can oversee this particular effort. We can question  particular representations of that policy. To take a blunt instrument  to this entire effort and defund it and say that it has no value at  all, that is what is objectionable in this amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, again, we have an amendment that would want us,  apparently, to occupy some other state of reality as opposed to the  world as we have it today.   In that world, we do have transgender individuals who need help,  children whose parents are looking for the right courses of conduct for  them.   This measure would say that those parents do not have the right to  make those decisions in consultation with their doctors and with their  children.   Further, what this amendment says is that those parents need not  apply to join our military because they will not be welcomed there with  the decisions that they need to make for their families.   This amendment that cuts gender-affirming care options for  servicemembers' children will drive individuals out of the military,  prevent recruitment to start with, and is, frankly, needlessly cruel.  These decisions should be reserved for parents and their children.   I hear all the time from the other side of the aisle talk about  parents' rights--all the time. Parents should have the right to make  these decisions.   Is there an exception for military families? Parents get to make  these decisions, but by the way, if you are a member of our military,  you don't get to make these decisions.   This is a very personal decision for parents to make with their  families, with their children, and with their doctors.   It is probably, in all honesty, unconstitutional as courts believe  healthcare bans like this violate the equal protection clause of the  Constitution, but let's just leave that aside and talk about the  policy.   Is the policy wise to say to servicemembers and their families that  they cannot access care that is provided to them in a non-servicemember  world?   I think that is the wrong policy, so I oppose this amendment and  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, first of all, we can certainly debate the  efficient use of our funds for expenses and the cost, but I strongly  suspect that my colleague's objections in this amendment do not relate  to cost but to a judgment about what should and shouldn't be provided  to our military families.   Now, we can have this debate about transgender care for our military  servicemembers, and the debate will look something like this one, but  this particular amendment would ban any care for minor children.   What this amendment would do is to say to our military  servicemembers, you cannot have the full range of recognized medical  options for your children that are available in a nonmilitary setting.   That is what this amendment would do. This is about children. It is  about parents making decisions for their children.   This is a situation where that decision should be left to the  servicemember parents who have a choice as to whether they serve in the  military or not, have a choice as to whether to join the military or  not, or stay in the military.   We should provide them the same basic rights and options as are  available in the private sector. Otherwise, aside from not being fair  to them, in my estimation, we also will not have a strong military  because they will choose not to join or to stay in.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
