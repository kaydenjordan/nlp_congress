 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to  the CHOICE Arrangement Act because we have to do way more to cut  healthcare costs for our families.   I have offered an amendment to cap the cost of insulin for all  children and young people at $35 a month. Last Congress capped insulin  for seniors, and I believe that this Congress should do it for our  children.   We can make life just a little bit easier for hundreds of thousands  of our families dealing with diabetes. If we want to actually cut  healthcare costs, this is the way we do it. This will save everyone  money, including taxpayers.   This is a bipartisan issue, and so I urge my colleagues to support  this amendment and cut costs for children and families. This Congress  needs this bipartisan win and hundreds of thousands of families need  the relief.                            ____________________
