 Madam Speaker, I rise today to condemn intimidation  tactics of pro-abortion activists.   Since the very day the Dobbs v. Jackson decision was illegally  leaked, acts of violence against pregnancy centers, places of worship,  and other pro-life institutions have skyrocketed.   Cases of vandalism, harassment, firebombings, and physical assaults  have been reported all across the country, in communities big and  small. In addition to the actual acts, these violent acts amount to  intimidation of those individuals that need the services provided by  these pro-life, faith-based organizations.   Not only has President Biden and his administration failed to condemn  these attacks, but his Department of Justice has also refused to take  any action to identify and prosecute those that have committed these  crimes. This is curious considering the way that this administration  has been weaponized against so many American citizens that haven't  committed any crimes at all.   Over 100 attacks have taken place in the last 8 months alone. Every  Member of Congress, Republican and Democrat, should join in condemning  the violence of these extremists. The rule of law matters, the sanctity  of life matters, and equal justice matters.                            ____________________
