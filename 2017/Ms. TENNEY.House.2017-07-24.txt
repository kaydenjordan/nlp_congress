 Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank Chairman Roe and  Ranking Member Walz for prioritizing bipartisanship and putting our  veterans ahead of politics. This committee's work is a testament to  what we can achieve here in Congress when we put aside politics and  focus on results.   Mr. Speaker, the Department of Veterans Affairs Bonus Transparency  Act requires the VA to submit a report to Congress at the end of each  fiscal year listing the bonuses that were awarded to senior-level  executives within the department.   In 2015, VA employees received more than $177 million in bonuses,  which was 24 percent more than they had received in 2014. The average  bonus for a senior executive was $10,000.   I have no doubt that the men and women of the VA serve our veterans  admirably each day. In fact, I know that they do. In my own district, I  have spoken with veterans who are grateful for the compassionate care  they receive from the VA hospital in Syracuse as well as local VA  clinics in Binghamton and Rome.   VA employees should be fairly compensated for their work and awarded  for their achievements in service to our Nation's veterans.   It is also clear to me that there is more work to be done. Just  recently, an audit of several VA facilities in  [[Page H6173]]  North Carolina and Virginia revealed that wait times continue to be  misrepresented and that nearly 14,000 veterans were denied access to  timely care. The audit also found that veterans were waiting an average  of 26 days to see mental health specialists, while the VA falsely  reported average wait times of 6 days.   In light of such news, the American people are right to wonder who at  the VA may be receiving a bonus this year. They are also right to be  concerned about the nature and conditions of such bonuses.   H.R. 1690 would add a simple reporting requirement to existing law  that will streamline the oversight of bonuses at the VA. It requires  the agency to proactively provide information to Congress that details  the amount of each bonus awarded to senior executives as well as the  job titles of the individuals and the location of their employment.   Because of the patterns of mismanagement at the VA, veterans must  know how bonuses are being awarded at the agency, and Congress deserves  to receive this information in as timely a manner as possible without  having to request it each year. This bill increases transparency over  the bonus process without placing an undue burden on the agency.   It is an honor to represent a district that is home to more than  55,000 veterans. I owe it to each of them every day to make sure that  the VA is accountable and transparent. Our Nation's veterans deserve  the very best healthcare for their service and sacrifice to our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz for their  support, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1690.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize F.X. Matt Brewing  Company, located in Utica, New York. Founded in 1888, Matt's Brewery is  the fourth oldest family-owned brewery in the United States.   An award-winning brewery, F.X. Matt Brewing Company is famous for  their pale ale lager, Utica Club, the first beer licensed for sale  after Prohibition, in addition to international taste test winner  Saranac beer and soda lines.   F.X. Matt Brewing Company is currently among the 15 largest beer  producers in the Nation, and the Matt family continues to develop new  recipes each year.   Matt's Brewery has played an important role in our local community by  hosting Saranac Thursdays, a weekly summer concert series, where a  portion of the proceeds are donated to the United Way of Utica. Matt's  Brewery also hosts the post-race celebration for the world famous Utica  Boilermaker 15K road race.   I am grateful to Fred Matt, Nick Matt, and everyone at the brewery  for their hard work, ingenuity, and dedication to our community as they  continue this historic family business. I encourage my colleagues to  stop by my office to try some of their great products.   On a personal note, as a lifelong friend of the Matt family, I will  always be grateful to Lillian ``Duffy'' Matt, affectionately known as  Duff, who taught me how to ride a bicycle.                            ____________________
