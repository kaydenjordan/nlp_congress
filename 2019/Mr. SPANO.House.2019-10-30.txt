 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to Down  Syndrome Awareness Month.   Down Syndrome occurs when abnormal cell division results in a  duplicate of chromosome 21. However, those suffering from this disease  are anything but abnormal, and it is time that they be viewed as valued  members of our communities.   Although there is no cure or prevention for Downs, there are still  nations working to eradicate the disease using the only means available  to them, through the willful abortion of babies identified as having  Down Syndrome during prenatal screenings.   Iceland is an example of a country where almost all women who receive  a positive test result for Down Syndrome terminate their pregnancies at  the recommendation of their medical practitioners.   Those with Down Syndrome can and should be given the opportunity to  live full lives. They can be educated and employed. They exude joy and  grace, with the most lovable personalities. Just ask their family and  friends.   It is time for the world to stop being complicit in the genocide of  those with Down Syndrome and to support our friends born with an extra  chromosome. All life has value.                            ____________________
