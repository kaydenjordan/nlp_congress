 Mr. Speaker, I thank Speaker Ryan for yielding. He  admonished us to be brief. So, Joyce, I will be brief.   Often I rise on this floor when we have extraordinary staffers retire  on either side of the aisle, Republican or Democrat, and observe what  an extraordinary difference they make to the comity that does, in fact,  exist but is rarely seen by the public.   Joyce Meyer has been an extraordinary member of our family. Speaker  Ryan says family is important to her. Family is important to all of us,  and this is a family. It is sometimes a contentious family, but it is a  family.   Frankly, the peacemakers in the family are largely the members of the  staff, particularly the highest ranking staffers, and particularly  those staffers who have been with each of us and many of us for a  significant period of time. They understand the tensions that can be  created, but they also understand that there is a responsibility to the  American people. Every time I went across the aisle and talked to Joyce  Meyer, I knew that she understood that and that she wanted to be a  positive force in making this institution work better.   Let me say that Joyce Meyer now has an even bigger responsibility  because she is going to the White House. May we all wish her the best  in making that institution work better.   Joyce, God bless you and Godspeed.                            ____________________
