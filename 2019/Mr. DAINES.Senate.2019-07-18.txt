 Mr. President, this week I have the distinct honor  of recognizing Miriam Haley of Silver Bow County for her contribution  to the Butte veteran community.   Mrs. Haley, a quilter for over two decades, recently chaired a  patriotic quilt show during Butte's Miners' Union Day celebration. The  goal of this show was to create quilts for veterans moving into the  newly built Southwest Montana Regional Veterans Home. Mrs. Haley  ensured these quilts were designed to serve the Butte veterans in their  day-to-day needs, whether they be resting or sitting with visitors.  Originally, Mrs. Haley had hoped to collect 65 quilts for the veterans,  but the show collected double that number. The 130 quilts spread out in  proud display for the show acted as a tangible expression of Montana's  ability to go above and beyond for its veteran community.   I wish to congratulate Mrs. Haley on her quilt show's success. Her  actions reflect the deep devotion to patriotism ingrained in all  Montanans.                            ____________________
