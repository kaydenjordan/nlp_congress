 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last Friday, as the Jewish New Year began,  Rosh Hashanah, our Nation lost a titan of justice and an unmatched  force for good--Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   According to Jewish tradition, a person who dies on Rosh Hashanah is  a tzaddik--a person of great righteousness. Justice Ginsburg, who was  only the seventh Jewish Supreme Court Justice and the first female  Jewish Justice, was, indeed, righteous.   I and Jill, my wife, were proud to call Ruth a friend, and like all  Santa Feans, we are proud that Ruth graced our city at the Santa Fe  Opera every summer. She loved New Mexico, and New Mexico loved her. Our  hearts are with Justice Ginsburg's family.   You shared a great national treasure with all of us, and we are  eternally grateful.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg was 1 of only 12 women who graduated from  Columbia Law School in 1959. With a young child in tow, she tied for  first in her class. Talk about a trailblazer. Indeed, RBG, as she is so  affectionately called, blazed so many trails--too many to list. She was  the first woman to serve on two major law reviews and one of the first  female law professors in the Nation. She cofounded the first law  journal on women's rights, and coauthored the first casebook on gender  discrimination.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg had to push open those doors because no one  opened them for her. She was no stranger to gender discrimination. She  was demoted at work when she became pregnant with her first child. She  was refused a U.S. Supreme Court clerkship because she was a woman. She  was also paid less than her male counterparts as a law professor.   Always driven toward justice, RBG became the leading legal mind  behind incrementally dismantling gender discrimination laws in the  United States. She spearheaded the strategy to apply the 14th  Amendment--requiring equal protection under the law--to women, and she  won in the Supreme Court five times. Her victories helped to take down  the mass of legal structures relegating women to second-class status.  She accomplished what was nearly impossible and expanded who is  included in ``We the People,'' and her quest for justice never ended.   As a jurist, she authored groundbreaking opinions--striking down  strict requirements on abortion clinics that were designed to put them  out of business, establishing the right of persons with mental illness  to be treated in the community instead of in institutions, and opening  up the Virginia Military Institute to female cadets, which, I think,  Senator Kaine talked about a little bit earlier.   She was also as well known for her forceful dissents. ``I dissent''  has become a rallying cry against an activist conservative Court.   In 2013, when the Court struck down the preclearance provisions of  the Voting Rights Act, Justice Ginsburg declared: ``'Hubris' is a fit  word for today's demolition of the VRA.'' She observed that striking  down voting protections because they worked too well was like  ``throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not  getting wet.''   Justice Ginsburg was brilliant, determined, and courageous.   Now, as her long and well-lived life has come to an end and as the  Nation mourns, it is only fitting that she continue making firsts--as  the first woman to lie in state in the Capitol. All of us--women and  men alike--owe a debt of gratitude to Justice Ginsburg and to her  righteous and unwavering commitment to justice and equality under the  law.   As you have now heard many times, Justice Ginsburg's last words to  the American public were ``My most fervent wish is that I will not be  replaced until a new president is installed.''   Yet, mere hours after the Supreme Court announced Justice Ginsburg's  passing, while the Nation was in mourning, Leader McConnell announced  he would replace her before the current Presidency ends.   Let me say this: While my heart is broken, my soul is on fire.   Not only are Senate Republicans disregarding Justice Ginsburg's last  request, they are turning their back on the principle that they claimed  was pure just 4 years ago.   In February 2016, Justice Scalia passed away a full 9 months before a  Presidential election. At that time, the majority leader refused to  hold hearings on President Obama's highly qualified nominee,  proclaiming:         The American people should have a voice in the selection of       their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy       should not be filled until we have a new president.    Those words meant nothing. They were deceitful tricks in pursuit of  raw power, and they have brought shame upon this body.   Election day is only 40 days away, but it is more accurate to say  that the election ends in 40 days, because the election is actually  underway today. Voters are already voting in 29 States. More than half  of the States are voting. Tens of millions of Americans will cast their  votes before election day. The leader's vow to vote to replace Justice  Ginsburg is a slap in the face to these voters and runs roughshod over  the Constitution.   Senator McConnell is moving at lightning speed to steal the second  Supreme Court seat because he knows this President faces an uncertain  electoral future. He is scared to let the American people, as he put  it, ``have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court  Justice.''   This hypocrisy is only outmatched by the utter disdain for American  voters--disdain for their intelligence, disdain for their will.   But the real scandal will be what this means to the American people.  On November 10, 7 days after election day, the Supreme Court will hear  argument on the legality of the Affordable Care Act, or what many call  the ACA. After failing to repeal the ACA in Congress, now the  Republicans are trying to destroy it in the courts, and they are  rushing to fill this vacancy with a judge who will do that work for  them.   The Trump administration is standing with 20 Republican Governors and  attorneys general who are asking the Supreme Court to strike down the  ACA. Republicans are trying to take away Americans' healthcare in the  middle of the worst pandemic in a century. It is unforgivable.   By overwhelming numbers, the American people support the ACA. Before  the ACA, insurance companies could deny healthcare insurance to people  with preexisting conditions. Up to 129 million Americans under age 65  have preexisting conditions. The millions of people who have been  infected by COVID-19 now have a preexisting condition for the rest of  their lives. In my home State of New Mexico, more than 840,000 people  live with a preexisting condition. Because of the ACA, 23 million more  Americans have healthcare insurance, and millions more have Medicaid  expansion. This includes hundreds of thousands of New Mexicans.  [[Page S5858]]    When the ACA was challenged years ago, the Supreme Court upheld it by  a 5-to-4 vote. We are one vote away from the decimation of our  healthcare rights at a time when nearly 7 million Americans have  contracted COVID-19.   The threat is not only to the ACA but also to women's reproductive  healthcare, our environmental protections, and what is left of our  campaign finance limits. So we know why they are moving at a record  pace to fill this seat.   But while the President and the majority leader want to rush through  a lifetime Justice in just a few weeks, COVID relief has languished on  Senator McConnell's desk for months. Millions of Americans are out of  work. Small businesses are closing their doors. Schools can't reopen  safely. Parents are burning the candle at both ends, working and caring  for kids at home. State, local, and Tribal governments can't meet  budgets for essential services.   The American people desperately need another relief package, but the  Senate Republicans and the President don't think there is any urgency.  Leader McConnell said that himself.   According to the President, COVID-19 ``affects virtually nobody.''  The President said that--``affects virtually nobody.''   This virus that ``affects virtually nobody'' is the third leading  cause of death in the United States, has taken more lives in 8 short  months than the Vietnam and Middle East wars combined, and has sent our  economy into a nosedive not seen since the Great Depression.   We talk a lot about priorities here in the Senate. Right now you are  seeing Senate Republican priorities in stark relief. They will rush a  lifetime Supreme Court pick in weeks--violating every principle they  established themselves--to please their far-right donors. But they will  neglect relief for you--for struggling families, for people out of  work, for people sick and dying--for months.   Finally, we cannot ignore the fact that the President has explicitly  said he wants to fill this vacancy to help decide the 2020 election in  his favor. He has repeatedly lied that absentee ballots, votes from  Democratic areas, or votes that are tabulated after election day are  somehow fraudulent.   And like an authoritarian, he does not even try to correct himself  when his lies are debunked. Instead, he openly admits he wants the  Supreme Court to decide the election by disqualifying votes he does not  like and even refuses to commit to a peaceful transfer of power.   The Senate should not become an accomplice to this corrupt scheme  that threatens the future of our democracy, and every Senate Republican  should condemn the President's refusal to commit to give up power  peacefully.   I would note that several of my Republican friends have stood up and  have said that there should be a peaceful transition of power, and I  applaud them for that.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
