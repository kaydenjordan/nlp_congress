 Madam President, I have the distinct honor of  recognizing Steve Fournier of Butte, a tireless advocate for the most  vulnerable Montanans. Steve is known by his peers for his dedication,  compassion, and integrity working to help the homeless.   For nearly 16 years, Steve has helped Montanans find housing  stability through his work as a case manager and service advocate for  locally administered housing programs. When the rescue mission served  as the emergency housing alternative for the Butte area after it closed  earlier this year, Steve helped 22 households find a safe and warm  place to stay. His efforts have helped many of his neighbors in  southwest Montana overcome crisis situations and transition to a more  hopeful path.   Steve's demonstrated commitment to assisting others is a genuine  reflection of uncommon moral stamina. The Treasure State is humbled and  blessed to have people like Mr. Fournier call Montana home. Thank you,  Steve, for repeatedly finding a refuge in times of trouble.                            ____________________
