 Mr. Speaker, last week, I got behind this microphone,  and we were actually trying to show something that was a bit  optimistic. But like everyone else on our side, the frustration we are  going through on so many of the Democrat policies that I don't think  were meant to be mean-spirited or so dystopian in the damage they  cause, particularly to the working poor, which is one of my fixations-- sometimes, the economics is the economics, sometimes virtue signaling  over the unintended consequences.   I want to go over something and try to explain why I think this is  such a big deal for both those on the left and those of us on the  right. There is actually a window of optimism, but it is going to take  a policy pivot.   Last week, I got up here and talked about--remember, I gave a couple  of presentations last December, a major success in curing type 1  diabetes. Now, it was really only one use case where they were able to  take T cells and convert them into insulin-producing cells. In that  particular one, the individual would need some immunosuppressants  because of the body's reaction to it.   Now, we have an organization that is doing some of the same  technology with T cells, turning them into insulin-producing cells but  with CRISPR as a partner. They are doing a tiny tweak. The model says  the body won't recognize it as a foreign cell, and you won't need  immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of your life.   Conceptually, why is this such a big, big, big deal to have a cure  for type 1? If you dig through the literature, it says that, at least  for people with type 2, we might have a way to get their body-- actually, we do have a way--dear Lord, let the technology be true and  actually coming forward--to help individuals in type 2, their bodies to  produce insulin again.   Then, we have some other big policy things we would have to do here.  We would have to have an honest conversation of how we do nutrition  support. We would have to have an honest conversation of what we do in  the farm bill, what we encourage Americans to grow, instead of just  sort of the commodity crops.   North America used to grow 3,500 different types of grains. Maybe you  design a farm system that allows both regional and uniqueness for  different arid climates and others, sort of a cacophony, or whatever  the proper word there would be, for optionality because there is a food  security issue when you only grow certain crops.   God forbid you have like what is happening in parts of Europe, where  olive trees have a type of fungus. Olive trees that are hundreds and  hundreds of years old are dying. We make ourselves much more fragile in  food security.   I sort of say that because I actually see an elegant solution coming  here if we could change the way we view public policy. It is often this  right-left paradigm of the left's version of wanting to be  compassionate. They are going to build more clinics for those in urban  areas and Tribal communities and even certain world populations that  have just stunning percentages of type 2 diabetes and the misery that  comes with that. Put up more clinics. My argument is: Screw that. Let's  cure it.   If we are seeing technology that may lead us to a cure, put the  resources forward that create the disruption because curing a misery is  so much more wonderful than helping people being able to maintain and  live within their misery.   Oh, by the way, for those of us who are absolutely fixated that the  debt is going to destroy this Republic, it makes a hell of a lot of  difference. Let's walk through some of the math of why I wish we were  having this level of optimism that the technology disruptions we have  now of knowing how to cure so many diseases actually may be the path  that we start to take on the crushing debt that is coming.   This is important. This is year-old data from CBO. It is a year out  of date. The numbers today are much worse. In 29 years, $112 trillion  of publicly borrowed debt in today's dollars; the vast majority of it  is Medicare, Social Security. The rest of the budget is in balance.   Why this is so important is the political class, particularly here in  Washington, we have lied for decades to our constituents.   The left will say: Oh, rich people don't pay enough. We spend too  much money on defense.   Republicans say: Oh, we have to get rid of foreign aid, waste, and  fraud.   Maybe those are true, but they are not the driver of the debt. The  debt is demographics. We are getting old as a society. You are going to  see some slides later on that really will kick you in the head on these  numbers. That $112 trillion of publicly borrowed debt as projected by  CBO last year--and this is a number that says there are no more  pandemics and no more recessions.   How many of you want to have a secure retirement? How many of you  give a darn about your kids? Well, think about one little factoid here.  You just saw that Medicare was the primary driver of U.S. sovereign  debt. What was it? $77 to $78 trillion of borrowing over the next 29  years? Thirty-one percent of Medicare is just diabetes. Now, you are  seeing the tie.   If I come to you and say: I hope it works, but considering the  numbers and the benefit of if it does work, why aren't we, at least the  left and the right, saying let's end people's misery? Oh, by the way,  by doing that, one of the greatest effects we can have on society is  actually curing these diseases that make us poorer, sicker, and  actually are the primary drivers of our debt.  [[Page H1068]]                                     time  1930    Mr. Speaker, 31 percent of Medicare spending is just related to  diabetes--33 percent of all healthcare costs. So, remember, Mr.  Speaker, the problem with this place is ObamaCare, the ACA, and the  Republican alternatives were finance bills. They weren't about what we  spend, they were who got subsidized. That is the math. The Democrats'  bill had three tiers, the Republican had four tiers, but it was who was  cross-subsidizing whom and then how much was coming out of the general  fund to subsidize those groups. They were spending subsidization bills.  They had nothing to do with what we spend.   My argument is if we would embrace the technology, push it forward-- and we have changed a bunch of laws to legalize the very technology  that will disrupt healthcare costs--then we save Medicare. But we also  end a hell of a lot of misery in our society.   And is that Republican or Democrat?   I am sure at some point someone will contribute to one side or the  other and we will turn it into partisan, right?   But at least between now and then it is technology.   And, once again, I fixate on this also: 5 percent of our brothers and  sisters who have multiple chronic conditions are the majority of our  healthcare spending.   If you say you care about healthcare, Mr. Speaker, is it  nationalizing health care?   Well, once again, nationalizing health care, the Medicare for All,  doesn't remove any costs. It just collectivizes how you can ration.   If you want to reduce costs, cure people, and end the misery, once  again, 5 percent of our brothers and sisters are the majority of our  healthcare spending.   You already see what is going on right now, Mr. Speaker, with some of  the messenger RNA, some of the new stem cell therapies, the number of  diseases we are curing. We now have a cure for hemophilia. We are about  to have trials for sickle cell. You already see in so many diseases we  are taking on, so many of the blood cancers today, we can cure. But the  10,000-pound gorilla is diabetes.   Maybe it is a little bit utopianism, but we have seen a perfect  example of this.   Do you remember this body just a decade or so ago, Mr. Speaker?   We were having a real stressor. We were having to have conversations  with State Medicaid systems on how we were going to pay for all these  liver transplants for those people who may have had too good a time in  the seventies. Remember, we had hundreds of thousands of individuals in  the United States that we thought were having failing livers from  hepatitis C. Liver transplant clinics were being funded and organized  all over the country, and then, suddenly--I think the first drug out  was Sovaldi--we figured out how to cure it. And the drug was  outrageously expensive, it was something like $88,000, but it was a  fraction of the cost of a liver transplant and then someone spending  the rest of their life on anti-rejection drugs.   And then another drug came to market with a slightly different  technology. The price crashed and saved a fortune and ended lots of  future misery.   We lived in the last decade an example of what I am talking about.   But I beg of my friends on the Democrat side: Think about your  legislation like H.R. 3. We know H.R. 3 functionally makes Big Pharma  bigger because it incentivizes them to take their current portfolio of  pharmaceuticals, make little tweaks, and keep them. But the capital  staff for the small biotechs that are disruptive is crushed. There are  good articles out there, and there are good economic papers that make  it very clear.   If the Democrats get their way, it is great politics. It is  absolutely brilliant politics. Talk about drug prices, how outraged we  are. We are outraged.   But, Mr. Speaker, are we outraged to the point that you are going to  kill the next generation because they don't get the next pharmaceutical  that is curative?   We need to think maybe more with a calculator like economists, maybe  economists with a soul and a heart rather than: Hey, this is brilliant  for the next election cycle.   Back again, think about the body, the place we work in. We go home,  we campaign, and we say all the wonderful things we are going to do.  But the fact of the matter is, this last fiscal year, 77 percent of all  the spending here was on autopilot. It is what we call mandatory.   Ten percent was defense. Thirteen percent was everything else. We act  as if we are here doing something when if you put defense and say we  are just going to keep the baseline where it is at and the 77 percent  is mandatory--Social Security and Medicare, you fall under a certain  income, you are part of a certain ethnic or tribal group or you hit a  certain age--it is automatic. It is formulaic.   This is all we get to focus on. This is what all the theater here is  about. And one of the reasons I think the theater has gotten so  hyperbolic is we know this is what wipes us out, and not one person  here has actually voted on this. It has been, except for the last  handful of votes the Democrats moved forward, we were adding, like we  just did today, in a piece of legislation that actually added to  mandatory spending because it is easy. It makes you look like a hero.  Hey, all we protected is there.   But we don't have the resources to pay for it.   To give you an idea, Mr. Speaker, of how crappy the last fiscal year  was and how much we borrowed, these slides are all out of date now. The  numbers are much worse. One of the reasons I grabbed this one is, take  a look here. This was 2030. We are going to hit $30 trillion of  borrowing. Well, we hit that last week.   Think about what we have done. And there was a time here a couple of  decades ago the discussion was: Well, are you willing to do entitlement  reform?   Take that off the table. I know it is great political rhetoric, but  it is too late. The vast majority of baby boomers are already in their  retirement age. We missed the window. The window was a quarter century  ago if we were going to do entitlement reform.    Other than the things we have come here and talked about, the massive  subsidies that we give actually to really, really, really rich people,  when it is their third home on Martha's Vineyard and we give them  subsidized flood insurance, or the Democrats' Build Back Better bill  which if you would be making $400,000 or $800,000 a year and you were  going to get--what is it, $125,000 in tax credits if you bought the  right electric vehicle, the right solar panel. At some point we need to  have an honest conversation. We calculated over the next 10 years there  are $1.4 trillion of subsidies for really rich people.   So instead of the constant rhetoric of let's tax rich people more and  make them pay their fair share, maybe we should just stop subsidizing  them because the subsidies create distortions.   So back to the thing we don't do here called math, the 2050 number,  we were saying we were going to be at 195 percent of GDP. That number,  the best calculation as of today is 15 points higher than that. We will  be well over 200. And that is a baseline, not another pandemic, not  another war, and not another major recession.   Then we start to deal with our newest reality, and I should have  grabbed the slide, but you see part of it here. There is a model put  out by CBO that says that if interest rates over the time of that 29- year period, if the baseline borrowing costs of the United States was 2  points higher in that 25 year, then every dime--every dime--of tax  receipts will go just to pay interest. We have made ourselves that  fragile, that if the cost of borrowing money goes up by 2 points on  U.S. sovereign debts over the baseline, then every dime in the future  just goes solely to cover the interest costs.   We have lost our minds. And yet, think of the crazy stuff we debate  here. It is as if we are desperate to debate the shiny objects, the  stupid, little indignation of the day, and at the same time we are  borrowing $47,000 every second--$47,000 every second.   That is why I keep coming behind these mikes saying that it doesn't  have to be this sort of dystopian, crushing future. I need the majority  to think differently, and I need my minority over here to think  differently. Because here are some of the drivers, and this is really  uncomfortable. I have been booed in front of audiences when I have  given this presentation, but the math is the math, and the math always  wins.  [[Page H1069]]  We can virtue signal, we can tell anecdotal stories, and we can talk  about how compassionate we are. But at some point, the math will win.   This is important because I am going to show you the sister slide to  this in a couple of moments, and you need to get your heads around  this. The money you put in taxes, into Social Security, and the money  you are going to get out of Social Security are pretty close to each  other. You actually get a little bit more out. It is a fairly even  deal. But that chart you were seeing, Mr. Speaker, is substantially  driven by this. So the average couple--and this is someone who is  retiring right about now--has put in about $161,000 into Medicare, and  they are getting $522,000 out. And those are adjusted dollars. So,  ceteris paribus, whatever the fancy term is, that gap there is the  primary driver of U.S. sovereign debt.   So, Mr. Speaker, what happens when you talk to millennials?   We all have in our offices over here kids born in 1985, and they just  think they are never going to see any of this. These are actual surveys  where they already see themselves in enough financial pain, and they  are worried. Then they have people like me get behind the microphone  and show them the slides and basically say: If we don't do something  about this, your retirement--and this is a technical economic term--you  are screwed. We need to start using language like that around here  because somehow the fancy language doesn't seem to sink into the thick  skulls here.   Do you care about this generation?   These 25-year-olds we have in our offices who are freaky smart, they  are working their hearts out, and they look at the numbers saying, Oh,  my God, when they start getting near their retirement age, the United  States will have a couple hundred percent of debt to GDP, and if  interest rates are up, if interest rates are up--I didn't bring the  slide--there is one model that says that 2 percent higher baseline  borrowing costs, we go from that 210 percent debt to GDP in 29 years to  about 300, 320 percent because of the multiplying effect because we  never pay anything off.   The model as it is as of today says that millennial, that person born  in 1985, they are going to put $236,000 into Medicare. And if we don't  do something to disrupt the cost of healthcare, then they are going to  take out over $1.2 million, and this makes the curve steepen. When you  see the CBO curve, you wonder why it starts to steepen. It is this  delta there.   There is a hope. There is a path, but it needs to be everything. I  have my healthcare disruptions, but I have also come here and talked  about how you can change the immigration system to maximize economic  growth and not crush the working poor. When we open up the borders--we  have brought the papers here--we crush the working poor because we  flood the country with people with similar skill sets.   Mr. Speaker, in the last year and a half, we are what, 1.7 million  behind in legal immigration. The kid who just got the Ph.D. from  Arizona State University and we are sending him home. You have seen the  healthcare. If you care about the environment, the concept of radically  changing the way we look at regulation using crowdsourcing and data  instead of the 1938 model of stick paper in file cabinets, a Tax Code  that maximizes economic growth.   Are we willing to have really disruptive conversations, or should we  go to a border adjustability model, so you don't have a tax arbitrage  for around the world to move products to the United States instead of  making them here?                                time  1945    There are ways, and the trick is, the model says you have got to do  all of it almost at the same time. And this place can barely agree on  what time of day it is. Then we have seen policies around here that  when so many of our brothers and sisters who are older, are basically  saying it is the rational decision: I am leaving the labor force.   One of the other parts of that growth model is everyone is needed.  Every American is needed. We need your talents. We need your labor,  particularly if you are older. Would this place be willing to provide  certain incentives? So you are 65, you don't need to retire. But we are  going to fix parts of the way we tax your benefits to incentivize you  to stay in the labor force.   There are ideas that work that basically make the future something  optimistic. My wife and I joke about this, and I have said it behind  this microphone a bunch of times. We are both 59 years old and I have a  6-year-old daughter. You know you are pathologically optimistic when  you are 59 years old and you have a 6-year-old daughter. But darn it,  doesn't she have the right, doesn't the kid that is growing up in a  neighborhood of poverty have the right, doesn't the person who is older  have the right to have a decent retirement?   Don't we have the right to be in a nation of optimism where we told  the truth about the math and our demographics, and then we provided an  optimistic vision that gets us there instead of the crazy stuff that  has been posed this last 12 months that we keep showing economists  after economists--and these are not conservative economists. Many of  them are from liberal groups saying: You do realize that Build Back  Better by the end of the decade make people poorer?   But it was great politics. Stop the crazy. Buy a calculator, and then  if we do it by math, I think you could actually see this body work  together because an optimistic vision can be ours if we just fixate on  the disruptions that make the future great.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
