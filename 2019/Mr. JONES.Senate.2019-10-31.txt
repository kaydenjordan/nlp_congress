 Madam President, under the previous order, I call up  amendment No. 1141, as modified.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading  of the amendment be dispensed with.    Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment  offered by myself and my friend from Arizona, Senator McSally.   This amendment would permanently block an impending $1.2 billion in  cuts to the Federal public transportation investment. These cuts will  affect every one of our States--every one--including 7 million in my  home State of Alabama.   Without this legislation to block what is known as the ``Rostenkowski  Test,'' every public transit agency will suffer a 12-percent across- the-board cut to transit formula grants this year. For many transit  agencies, particularly these smaller transit agencies that serve rural  States such as mine, these cuts could be devastating. These cuts would  reduce services that are so important to the community, for instance,  services for low-income people and services to those who have  disabilities.   These cuts would reduce funds for important bus and rail efforts to  modernize our transportation.    I yield the floor.
