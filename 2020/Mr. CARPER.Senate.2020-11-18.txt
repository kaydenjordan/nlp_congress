 Mr. President, I today I am introducing legislation that  aims to reduce traffic-related pedestrian fatalities in Native American  communities while also improving public health and quality of life.   First, let's be clear. Everyone in this country deserves reliable  options to travel safely from one place to another. Everyone deserves  roads that connect us to each other and expand our horizons. But the  sad truth is that not everyone in this country has safe, reliable roads  that foster connections and expand horizons. That is especially true in  Native American communities.   The adverse statistics surrounding the safety and health of  Indigenous peoples are staggering. Vehicle-related unintentional injury  is the No. 1 cause of death among American Indians and Alaska Natives  aged 1 through 44. It is also the third overall cause of death for all  American Indians and Alaska Natives, of any age or gender.   While unsafe roadways put lives at risk, inadequate or unreliable  transportation options create obstacles for everyday life, making it  more difficult to simply access healthy groceries, schools, quality  health care, emergency services and economic opportunities. Immobility  for individuals within Indian Country reinforces barriers to education,  quality healthcare, and economic opportunity.   Meanwhile, Native American communities face disproportionately higher  prevalence of diabetes and other heart disease. In fact, American  Indian and Alaska Natives are more than twice more likely than non- Hispanic White Americans to die from diabetes. Cardiovascular disease  is the primary cause of mortalities for Native Americans under the age  of 65. While exercise can help to lower the risks associated with  chronic heart disease, throughout Indian Country, there are few safe  options for walking, running and bicycling.   The sad truth is that decades of Federal underinvestment in  transportation infrastructure has contributed to disproportionately  higher rates of road traffic fatalities and poor public health outcomes  in Indian Country. Unsafe, unreliable and inadequate transportation  infrastructure is exacerbating a public safety crisis, worsening public  health, and degrading quality of life.   Investments in infrastructure that improve safety and expand  opportunity for nonmotorized forms of transportation--such as  sidewalks, bicycle infrastructure, and pedestrian and bicycle signals-- can help to prevent more road traffic fatalities and also combat the  prevalence of chronic health disparities that exist throughout Native  American communities. To that end, the Promoting Access to Tribal  Health, Wellbeing and Youth Safety Act would create a new grant program  at the U.S. Department of Transportation to dedicate new resources for  pedestrian-related infrastructure and improve pedestrian infrastructure  throughout Indian Country. The legislation will also authorize $25  million annually for these critical projects.   By improving pedestrian infrastructure across Tribal communities, we  can save lives while improving health outcomes and quality of life in  Tribal communities.   I would like to thank my colleagues, Senator Feinstein, Senator  Tester, Senator Heinrich, and Senator Warren, for joining me to  introduce this legislation. As we celebrate National Native American  Heritage Month, I look forward to working with my colleagues on this  issue. Together we can improve the safety and health of Indigenous  peoples across the Nation.                                  ______                                         By Ms. HIRONO:   S. 4915. A bill to establish the Servicemembers and Veterans  Initiative within the Civil Rights Division of the Department of  Justice, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
