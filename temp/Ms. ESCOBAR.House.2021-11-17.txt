 Madam Speaker, like Representative Ocasio-Cortez, I,  too, have served in this House for 3 years, and I have found the  dignity and respect that we deserve and owe one another in this Chamber  has been severely lacking.   While my Democratic colleagues and I continue to work on critical  legislation that improves the lives of Americans, Mr. Gosar, a Member  of the Republican Conference, has decided to focus on promoting  xenophobia and fetishizing violence, fanning the flames of hate.   Words have power. My community knows that only too well. And the  example we set as Members of Congress is followed by millions of  Americans. Mr. Gosar's actions continue to lower the bar, obliterate  standards for respect and civility, and make this workplace unsafe by  targeting a colleague--a woman of color. I would like to note that  women of color are frequent targets of hateful rhetoric and attacks  like these.   In any other environment, someone like Mr. Gosar would have  immediately faced termination, would have to live with the consequences  of his dangerous actions and words, but not in the Republican  Conference.   Mr. Gosar's video, which glorifies the gruesome killing of our  colleague and a violent attack against our President should have  sparked immediate condemnation and action by the minority leader and  his entire conference. But instead, we are told to relax, and we are  threatened, told that if we dare take action, we will face retaliation.    Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman.   Madam Speaker, I say to my colleagues, when you give hate, racism,  and violence cover, you give it life. With this vote, we are saying  ``not on our watch.''   Madam Speaker, I invite my Republican colleagues to do what is right  and support this resolution.
