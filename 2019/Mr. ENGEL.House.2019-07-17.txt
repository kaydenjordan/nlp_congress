 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution  491, I call up the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 36) providing for  congressional disapproval of the proposed transfer to the Kingdom of  Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,  the Kingdom of Spain, and the Italian Republic of certain defense  articles and services, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include in the Record extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the three measures the House will now consider are  extraordinary, extraordinary but necessary, because they respond to  what I view as an extraordinary abuse of power by the Trump  administration, using a phony emergency to override the authority of  Congress and push through $8 billion in arms sales.   Each of these resolutions would prohibit a specific license for the  export of precision-guided munitions, or smart bombs, and related  components. We are focusing on these three licenses because the weapons  would be the first ones shipped.   Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that Congress has serious concerns about  the Saudi-led coalition's war in Yemen. The Saudis and their partners  and, for that matter, the United States do have legitimate security  concerns about the  [[Page H5936]]  efforts of Iran and its proxies to destabilize the Gulf region.   But as this war has dragged on, it has become clear that the  coalition has carried out its campaign with little regard for innocent  life: schoolbuses full of children destroyed in a fiery flash, weddings  and funerals incinerated with no warning, civilian buildings and  communities targeted.   Reckless doesn't begin to describe it. It is gruesome. It has  contributed to the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.                                time  1315    To make matters worse, many of the weapons used in this carnage were  built in America, sold by American companies to the Saudis and their  partners.   Starting in the last Congress, when the administration told us they  were planning to go ahead with another massive sale of offensive  weapons to the Saudis and Emiratis, Senator Menendez and I used the  tools at our disposal to place informal holds on these transfers. We  hoped that the administration would work with us and dial up pressure  on these nations to start acting responsibly.   Now, the administration has complained that we stopped these sales  from going through for months and months. But, as I said, this was an  informal mechanism. The law--and I emphasize it is the law--says that,  at any point, if an administration wants to go ahead with a weapons  sale, it has to send a formal notification to Congress. That starts a  30-day clock. During that time, Congress can vote to stop a weapons  sale.   Did the administration stop us to try to find a way forward? No.   Did they send a formal notification, starting the process laid out in  the law under which Congress can legislatively block the sale? No.   What did they do? They dug up an obscure provision of the arms export  law and declared an emergency to justify moving ahead with these sales.   What does that mean? It means, they went around Congress. It means,  they went around the law.   Now, the emergency provision exists in law for a good reason. And if  there were a real emergency--if the United States or our citizens or  our allies were in immediate danger--we wouldn't be standing here  today. There would be no objection.   But here is the thing, Mr. Speaker. There is no emergency.   Do you know how I know? I know because nearly 2 months down the line,  not a single weapon has been shipped. Most of the weapons haven't even  been built. In fact, one of the phony emergency declarations lets the  Saudis build new facilities to manufacture weapons in their country,  which I only presume would mean the Americans currently building these  weapons in the United States would be out of a job.   That is right. Donald Trump declared an emergency to move jobs out of  the United States--good manufacturing jobs, the kind Americans fight  for. He abused the law to send them abroad.   What kind of emergency requires weapons that will be built months and  months down the road? Or requires building a new factory on foreign  soil? Especially when the law only gives Congress a 30-day review  period.   The answer is clear, Mr. Speaker: a phony emergency. An emergency  designed to make yet another end run around Congress, to undermine the  separation of powers, to trample on this body's constitutional duties.   I am sick and tired of it, Mr. Speaker.   The State Department sent an assistant secretary up to the Hill to  testify about this fiasco. He told us in the Foreign Affairs Committee  that the administration took this brazen action out of respect for  Congress' oversight role. Mr. Speaker, that is really, really hard to  believe.   The other body passed 22 bipartisan resolutions stopping all these  sales from going forward. The three measures we are considering today  deal with weapons that are already manufactured, sitting in a  warehouse, and, if we don't act, will be loaded onto a ship and sent to  Saudi Arabia and the UAE within the next 2 months.   This resolution would prohibit the use of an emergency declaration to  move ahead with the transfer of 64,000 Paveway precision-guided  munitions, or, as we call them, smart bombs. Sixty-four thousand, Mr.  Speaker, which would be added to the stockpile of 58,000 the Saudis  previously purchased starting in 2015.   What will all these weapons be used for? No one knows.   If the administration wants to sell these weapons, they should follow  the law, not misuse it, and they should come to Congress for its  approval.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Spanberger).     Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close debate on this measure.   I will wrap up quickly, as we have two more of these measures to  consider.   It is important that we pass this measure now, along with the two we  will soon consider, because these deal with weapons that could soon be  on their way across the ocean.   I think the Iranian regime is dangerous. I think the Houthis are  dangerous. No one is denying the Saudis the right to go after them.  What we are saying is, don't go after them and kill thousands of  civilians in the process with American weapons.   And also, separation of powers, the President cannot try to get  around Congress with phony emergencies. I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution  491, I call up the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 37) providing for  congressional disapproval of the proposed export to the United Arab  Emirates, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and  the Republic of France of certain defense articles and services, and  ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include in  the Record extraneous materials on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the second resolution we are debating is very similar to  the first. But in this case, it would nullify the administration's  phony emergency being used to transfer 60,000 precision-guided bombs to  the United Arab Emirates. That is on top of the 40,000 we estimate the  Emiratis already have on hand.   I won't rehash the same argument, but I would like to make a point  why, when we see what is going on in Yemen, it is so important for the  United States to take a stand.   Mr. Speaker, one of the things the Foreign Affairs Committee has  focused on this year is trying to put American values back at the  center of our foreign policy: Democracy, human rights, the rule of law.   Frankly, this administration has acted like it cannot be burdened  with these fundamental things that make America America. It just  boggles the mind that any great country can throw weight around, but we  are not China. We are not Russia. Our foreign policy should show the  world the character of our country, our compassion, our belief that  people everywhere should be able to live prosperously, productively,  and have healthy lives.   These ideas go hand in hand with promoting our security. We want more  stable, secure countries and communities. Democratic countries are  stronger partners for the United States on the world's stage. And if we  are serious about those values, it means speaking out when we see them  trampled, whether they are trampled by an adversary or by a friend.   When we turn our back on these ideals; when we strip the word  ``democracy'' out of the State Department's mission statement; when we  look the other way when friendly regimes carry out horrific human  rights abuses; when we slash investments in the diplomacy and  development efforts that help us build bridges of friendship and  understanding; when we walk away from all of that, what signal does it  send to the world?   What does it say about the sort of behavior that we are willing to  tolerate? I have supported our partners and our partnerships in the  Gulf region. I think they are an important counterbalance to the threat  Iran poses, and I recognize that our partners face real threats from  Iranian-backed Houthis who are themselves guilty of serious human  rights abuses.   But that doesn't mean we should just look the other way in the face  of violence and slaughter of civilians perpetrated by our partners. It  doesn't mean we look the other way and let the President ride roughshod  over Congress so there is no separation of powers and whatever the  President wants, he gets, and Congress just rubberstamps it. It can't  be that way.   So even if this administration will not stand up for values, the  Congress should, and the Congress will. These measures, along with much  of the Foreign Affairs Committee's work this year, sends a strong  message that our values must guide our foreign policy.   So, again, it is important for us to help Saudi Arabia. It is  important to realize Iran is making trouble. It is important to note  the Houthis are not good people. But it doesn't mean that we give Saudi  Arabia or any other country a blank check to do whatever they want,  dropping bombs indiscriminately on school children, on buses. We can't  just sit idly by and let that happen and continue to send weapons that  are perpetrating these crimes.   So, this is a strong message, I think, that our values must guide our  foreign policy, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Again, Mr. Speaker, let me say that I certainly respect my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle for the points they have raised. We have  similar concerns, but I think the way we handle it or the way we have  proposed to handle it is a little bit different.   That is why I am saying if we don't pass this measure, then these  bombs will be on their way to the Emirates very soon.   If we do pass this resolution, then it will go to the President's  desk and it will put him on the spot to answer whether he agrees that  our values need to be central to America's work around the world.   Again, I am very concerned and aware of the malign role that the  Iranians play in the region. I am very concerned about the Houthis who  also play a bad role in the region. But that  [[Page H5940]]  doesn't mean that we should just give blank checks or give them arms. I  think it would just be a mistake to let them think that they don't have  to have any conduct in trying to conduct this war into diminishing  civilian casualties.   The other point I want to raise, again, is the fact that, Mr.  Speaker, do you remember when you were a kid in school and you learned  how a bill became a law?   Well, there is something called separation of powers, checks and  balances. It is not right for the President to declare an emergency  when there really is no emergency in order to get around Congress'  disapproval of something. So I feel it is important to fight for the  institution as well.   So, again, if we do pass this resolution, it will go to the  President's desk, and it will let him answer whether he agrees that our  values need to be central to our work around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution  491, I call up the bill (S.J. Res. 38) providing for congressional  disapproval of the proposed export to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and  the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of certain  defense articles and services, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include in the Record extraneous materials on the measure under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this final measure we will consider would stop the  transfer of fuses for precision-guided munitions--critical components  that allow these weapons to be armed and detonated. Like the bombs,  these components have already been manufactured, and we need to act  quickly to stop their shipment.   As we wrap up this debate, Mr. Speaker, I want to make an appeal to  my friends on the other side of the aisle: You can be for or against  these weapons sales and still understand that these resolutions are the  right thing to do, if for nothing else than the integrity of this body.   I spoke earlier about the rule of law. This phony emergency  declaration is a message to the Congress and to the American people  that when the law gets in the way, this administration is just going to  find a way around it. They will twist the law into pretzels or just  throw it out the window entirely if it allows them to sidestep  Congress. We cannot stand for that.   This administration should have played by the rules, and we could  have done that and probably still gotten these sales through. They  could have sent up a notification and allowed Congress to have a  debate. But instead, they want to shut us out of this process.   With these resolutions, we are taking some of that power back. We are  saying that we won't allow the laws written in this body to be ignored.  If nothing else, this is an opportunity to stand up and say: We took an  oath to uphold the Constitution, and that means Congress remains a  coequal branch of government.   Let me say that again: that means Congress is a coequal branch of  government. We will not be a rubberstamp for any administration, not  only this administration, but any administration. Congress has its  duties. We will not be a rubberstamp.   I have felt for a long time that administrations of both parties,  quite frankly, have ignored Congress when it comes to foreign policy  and national security. We shouldn't stand for it any longer. No more do  we give a blank check to any President of any party who wants to cut  Congress out of the decisionmaking and subvert the Constitution.   So, Mr. Speaker, we shouldn't agree to it, we shouldn't stand for it,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time for the  purpose of closing.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close debate on this measure.   I am glad we had a spirited debate on the issues. As always, I am  grateful to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), my friend, the  ranking member, for his collegiality. We are generally bipartisan on  the Foreign Affairs Committee, and when we do disagree, we do so on the  issues and not on the politics and the personalities.   I have enormous respect for Mr. Mast, which he knows about, but I  would say that this, today, is not a referendum on Iran. I agree with  everything that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said  about Iran: its bad intention, its bad behavior. I agree.   But, again, I say, as I said before, it doesn't mean we give another  country, being an ally or not, a blank check to do whatever it pleases.  And in this particular case, the conduct of the war in Yemen is  something that we cannot just turn our heads away and say: ``Oh, well,  this is the war and the Iranians are bad, so, therefore, we are going  to look the other way.'' I think if we are talking about American  weapons, we can demand better.   So I think that these measures are a chance for the Congress to take  back some of the power granted by the Constitution, to say that we  won't stand by when any administration--this administration,  administrations to come in both parties--we won't stand by when any  administration ignores Congress, plays fast and loose with the law, and  fails to demand accountability for human rights abuses around the  world.   I encourage all my colleagues to support this measure and the two  others that we have just considered.   I thank Mr. Mast and my friends on other side of the aisle for a  spirited debate, and I yield back the balance of my time.
