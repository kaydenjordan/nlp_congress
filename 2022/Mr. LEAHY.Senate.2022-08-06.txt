 Madam President, on August 7, Colombia's newly elected  President Gustavo Petro and Vice President Francia Marquez will begin  their 4-year term. Their election represents a sharp break from the  past.   The new government is inheriting every imaginable problem.  Regrettably, the country has made minimal progress since the signing of  the 2016 Peace Accord that ended five decades of armed conflict with  the FARC, and in some parts of the country, narcotics-related violence  is worse. The previous government failed to make a dent in the number  of assassinations of social leaders or to hold members of the armed  forces and police accountable for past atrocities. Compounded by the  public health and economic shocks caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and a  flood of Venezuelan refugees, Colombia remains a highly polarized  society, divided between urban elites and the impoverished countryside.  It will take many years to reverse decades of deeply rooted neglect,  discrimination, poverty, and lawlessness.   Since 2020, the United States has invested more than $11 billion in a  [[Page S4205]]  counter-drug strategy in Colombia that was never sustainable and has  largely failed, as it has failed in Mexico and Central America. As long  as the demand for illegal drugs in this country remains high, the only  solution in source countries like Colombia is a strategy based on  sustainable social and economic development, a professional,  accountable police force, and a judiciary that is independent,  accessible, and that the people trust.   Colombia has the advantage of being a democracy with exceptionally  talented people and extraordinary geographic and biological diversity.  But if the underlying causes of conflict and poverty are not addressed,  the country's future stability is far from assured. I urge the White  House, the State Department, and the Defense Department against  pursuing the same old failed strategies. With a new government in  Bogota, there is the chance to avoid repeating past mistakes and to  measure progress not in the short term by the amount of money spent or  the number of hectares of coca destroyed, but by long-term investments  in institutions and local communities. The people of rural Colombia  need our support, but not in the form of myopic approaches that have  consistently failed to get at the root of the injustice, impunity, and  inequality they have been struggling with for generations.   The U.S. Congress will do its part to support a strategy designed by  the Colombians that is not just more of the same, that is consistent  with the peace accord, that has the support of civil society, and, most  importantly, that has the support of rural Colombians who have paid the  highest price of past policies that have failed them.                            ____________________     Madam President, I have spoken twice this year about the  despair and insecurity that are a daily reality for the people of South  Sudan, despite independence 11 years ago that held so much promise and  hope for that country.   On January 6 and 31, I noted that the country's independence was a  result of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement--CPA--which took years of  negotiations facilitated in part by the United States, Norway, and the  United Kingdom. It provided a roadmap for political stability, economic  development, respect for human rights, and justice. I further noted  that since then, two former warlords, President Kiir and First Vice  President Machar--who were never elected--have dominated the political  landscape. It is they, throughout these formative years, who have had  the executive power and the responsibility to turn the aspirations of  independence into meaningful improvements in the lives of their people.   Eleven years later, the country is in a state of political paralysis,  and its people are coping with a widening humanitarian crisis, brought  on by violence instigated by government security forces, severe  flooding, skyrocketing fuel costs, and acute food shortages compounded  by the war in Ukraine which was a major source of grain imports for  South Sudan. Millions of people have been displaced from their homes by  the fighting, flooding, and hunger.   I will not take time today to recount the litany of failures of the  Kiir-Machar government which I enumerated in January and which have  only worsened since then. Rather, I want to call the Senate's attention  to a Vatican mission of peace, unity, and reconciliation to South Sudan  in early July. The visit by Cardinal Pietro Parolin came at a time when  the country's leaders are apparently, though not surprisingly, seeking  to evade elections and extend their stay in office illegitimately, even  though the peace agreement mandated that elections be held this  December.   Kiir and Machar have now proposed extending their unpopular  authoritarian rule for 3 years without the consent of the people of  South Sudan. The parliamentary faction of President Kiir has passed a  political parties bill in which they have changed political parties'  registration requirements in order to limit those who could pose a  serious challenge to their continued hold on power. The text of the  bill that was negotiated and agreed to by the parties was changed by  Kiir's parliamentary caucus and rammed through the Parliament despite  boycott and serious objections from the other parties. All these  actions provide sufficient evidence to suggest that President Kiir and  Machar are determined to cling to power by any means necessary.   It is no secret that President Kiir and his Deputy Machar have made  the conditions for holding free and fair elections impossible, for all  the reasons noted earlier. The country's leaders have done nothing to  prepare for elections, preferring instead to retain power by default.  By fomenting civil unrest and violence and threatening and arresting  their critics, they have transformed the peace agreement into a  meaningless document. Rather than peace and prosperity, it has brought  dictatorship, corruption, violence, and misery.   As I said on January 31:         The sad reality is that while the South Sudanese people won       their independence from Sudan, they remain captives of the       same ruthless and corrupt warlords who created so much ethnic       conflict, bloodshed, and misery during the civil war and who       have not been held accountable.        They simply reinvented themselves as political leaders,       with a stamp of legitimacy from the international community,       while continuing to act like the warlords they are and always       were.        They have shown no interest in implementing the R-ARCSS or       any other peace agreement.        They have shown no interest in the welfare of their people.        They have shown no interest in anything except holding onto       power, avoiding justice, and enriching themselves.    Real peace requires justice, and it requires respect for fundamental  rights regardless of ethnicity, race, or religion. It requires free and  fair elections and equitable economic development. Cardinal Pietro  Parolin conveyed a clear message to President Kiir and Vice President  Machar. Their churches played an indispensable role in the  international effort that culminated in the 2005 comprehensive peace  agreement, and they, too, have a stake in its success. Above all,  President Kiir and Vice President Machar should know that the world is  watching.   The ethnic and political violence, displacements, and destruction of  villages and food stocks perpetrated against South Sudanese civilians  in different parts of the country, including by forces loyal to them,  must stop.   The arbitrary arrests, sexual assaults and rape, forced  disappearance, and killings of religious, civil society, and political  leaders must stop and justice done for the victims.   Those currently detained arbitrarily must be released, including Kuel  Aguer Kuel, the former governor of Northern Bahr El-Ghazal, and Pastor  Abraham Chol Maketh.   The daily corruption in South Sudan, including illegal loans and  growing debt burden that has impoverished the current and future  generations, must end, and South Sudan must begin to feed and care for  its own people from its existing resources, which are sufficient if  used prudently.   President Kiir and Riek Machar are responsible for the chronic  hunger, insecurity, economic, and political crises in the country, and  they have the power to bring peace and stability to South Sudan, which  is a matter of urgent priority.   But the country is certain to disintegrate further if Kiir and Machar  continue to hold it hostage to their individual interests at the  expense of the lives and livelihoods of the South Sudanese people. They  must prepare to step down and allow the country to recover and rebuild  from the ruins of their policies.   I commend South Sudanese civil society and pro-democracy movements,  such as the People's Coalition for Civic Action--PCCA--for their  efforts in creating awareness about the plight of the people of South  Sudan and for their nonviolent campaign for freedom and democracy. They  have our support.   Finally, I want to again urge the Biden administration to listen to  the people of South Sudan. I commend recent steps by the State  Department to recognize the fallacy of continuing to support a failed  peace agreement that South Sudan's own leaders do not support, and I  urge the European Union and Intergovernmental Authority for  Development--IGAD--countries to take similar action. There is no point  in admonishing two failed leaders to  [[Page S4206]]  implement a peace agreement they have no intention of implementing.  That is not a policy. It is a dead end.   Instead, the administration should join with other key governments  and stakeholders in exploring the possibility of recreating a new  political forum for South Sudan to address the challenge of the looming  end of the transitional government and the reality of the  impracticality of conducting democratic elections in the current  environment. Given the failure of the leaders of the current  transitional government, it is unacceptable to extend its mandate. It  should be brought to an end. I also urge the IGAD governments,  particularly President Museveni of Uganda and President Uhuru Kenya of  Kenya, and the other regional leaders, to face the fact that the  Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of Conflict in South Sudan--R- ARCSS--they helped mediate has been sabotaged by South Sudan's leaders.  The time has come to do what is needed to help the South Sudanese  people get back on a path to achieve their democratic aspirations and  freedoms.   South Sudan needs a new broad-based political dialogue that is  inclusive of all political forces and civil society. This political  dialogue, which many political parties and organizations have endorsed,  should focus on peace and stability in South Sudan beyond the confines  of power sharing, taking into account key provisions of the R-ARCSS,  combined with the outcomes of the South Sudan national dialogue. Such a  broad-based political dialogue should aim at reaffirming a shared  vision for South Sudan and building consensus on political and  constitutional matters, ending violence, saving lives, uniting the  nation, and preparing for elections.   The dialogue process should culminate in the establishment of an  interim administration led by persons of consensus, technocrats, and  individuals not politically aligned with the warring parties and not  entangled in corruption and political violence. Such an administration  should have a limited mandate to further political dialogue, rebuild  public trust in government, strengthen the unified forces, deliver the  constitution, return the IDPs and refugees, conduct a census, and  culminate in free and fair elections.   The Biden administration should articulate a new policy that  reinvigorates U.S. engagement and supports peace, stability, and  democracy in South Sudan. No one should be under any illusion that this  can achieved quickly or easily. But without a competent or credible  government to engage with, we must shift our focus to providing strong  support to pro-democracy, nonviolent organizations to create the  grassroots pressure necessary for a genuine political dialogue to take  place and build the foundation for a better future.                            ____________________     Madam President, a remarkable American marked his 100th  birthday last month. Marcelle and I were delighted to be able to wish  Norman Lear our best on this milestone.   His achievements throughout his impactful life have broken important  new ground at just about every turn. We all know Norman's credits in  television, such as ``All in the Family,'' ``The Jeffersons,'' and  ``Maude.'' They helped shape 20th century American culture.   Norman's influence on America did not start in television. He was an  U.S. Army Air Force pilot in World War II, flying more than 50 combat  missions over Italy and Germany, and his heroism garnered the Air Medal  with four oak leaf clusters.   Norman's patriotism and public service continued throughout his  television career. He addressed pressing social issues in ways others  were not willing to do, touching hearts, and changing lives. The core  of his message was always to bring people together on common ground, an  idea which is so desperately needed today in all facets of our culture  and media.   He founded People For The American Way, to champion American ideals  that often were under fire or diminished by apathy.   Norman Lear has always understood that more things unite us than  divide us as Americans, and to quote him, ``we are all in this life  together.''   I was moved by his reflections, published in the New York Times on  July 27, 2022, his 100th birthday, and ask unanimous consent to have  them printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, July 27, 2022]    On My 100th Birthday, Reflections on Archie Bunker and Donald Trump                              (By Norman Lear)         Well, I made it. I am 100 years old today. I wake up every       morning grateful to be alive.        Reaching my own personal centennial is cause for a bit of       reflection on my first century--and on what the next century       will bring for the people and country I love. To be honest,       I'm a bit worried that I may be in better shape than our       democracy is.        I was deeply troubled by the attack on Congress on Jan. 6,       2021--by supporters of former President Donald Trump       attempting to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. Those       concerns have only grown with every revelation about just how       far Mr. Trump was willing to go to stay in office after being       rejected by voters--and about his ongoing efforts to install       loyalists in positions with the power to sway future       elections.        I don't take the threat of authoritarianism lightly. As a       young man, I dropped out of college when the Japanese       attacked Pearl Harbor and joined the U.S. Army Air Forces. I       flew more than 50 missions in a B-17 bomber to defeat fascism       consuming Europe. I am a flag-waving believer in truth,       justice and the American way, and I don't understand how so       many people who call themselves patriots can support efforts       to undermine our democracy and our Constitution. It is       alarming.        At the same time, I have been moved by the courage of the       handful of conservative Republican lawmakers, lawyers and       former White House staffers who resisted Mr. Trump's       bullying. They give me hope that Americans can find       unexpected common ground with friends and family whose       politics differ but who are not willing to sacrifice core       democratic principles.        Encouraging that kind of conversation was a goal of mine       when we began broadcasting ``All in the Family'' in 1971. The       kinds of topics Archie Bunker and his family argued about--      issues that were dividing Americans from one another, such as       racism, feminism, homosexuality, the Vietnam War and       Watergate--were certainly being talked about in homes and       families. They just weren't being acknowledged on television.        For all his faults, Archie loved his country and he loved       his family, even when they called him out on his ignorance       and bigotries. If Archie had been around 50 years later, he       probably would have watched Fox News. He probably would have       been a Trump voter. But I think that the sight of the       American flag being used to attack Capitol Police would have       sickened him. I hope that the resolve shown by       Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, and their       commitment to exposing the truth, would have won his respect.        It is remarkable to consider that television--the medium       for which I am most well-known--did not even exist when I was       born, in 1922. The internet came along decades later, and       then social media. We have seen that each of these       technologies can be put to destructive use--spreading lies,       sowing hatred and creating the conditions for       authoritarianism to take root. But that is not the whole       story. Innovative technologies create new ways for us to       express ourselves, and, I hope, will allow humanity to learn       more about itself and better understand one another's ideas,       failures and achievements. These technologies have also been       used to create connection, community and platforms for the       kind of ideological sparring that might have drawn Archie to       a keyboard. I can only imagine the creative and constructive       possibilities that technological innovation might offer us in       solving some of our most intractable problems.        I often feel disheartened by the direction that our       politics, courts and culture are taking. But I do not lose       faith in our country or its future. I remind myself how far       we have come. I think of the brilliantly creative people I       have had the pleasure to work with in entertainment and       politics, and at People for the American Way, a progressive       group I co-founded to defend our freedoms and build a country       in which all people benefit from the blessings of liberty.       Those encounters renew my belief that Americans will find       ways to build solidarity on behalf of our values, our country       and our fragile planet.        Those closest to me know that I try to stay forward-      focused. Two of my favorite words are ``over'' and ``next.''       It's an attitude that has served me well through a long life       of ups and downs, along with a deeply felt appreciation for       the absurdity of the human condition.        Reaching this birthday with my health and wits mostly       intact is a privilege. Approaching it with loving family,       friends and creative collaborators to share my days has       filled me with a gratitude I can hardly express.        This is our century, dear reader, yours and mine. Let us       encourage one another with visions of a shared future. And       let us bring all the grit and openheartedness and creative       spirit we can muster to gather together and build that       future.
