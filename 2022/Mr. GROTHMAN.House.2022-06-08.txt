 Mr. Speaker, there are a variety of topics that I think  have not been discussed enough lately but I think should be addressed  on the floor.   We have been gone for 2 weeks prior to reconvening this week, and in  that time I took one more trip to the southern border. I took the trip  to the border because other than arguably the threat of an absolute  catastrophe over the Ukraine, it is easily the biggest cause for  concern in this country at this time.                                time  2045    I went down to McAllen, Texas, with 11 other Congressmen. Rather than  having a trip of twelve which, as I understand, is the biggest group  that has been at the border since COVID, we should have had 80 or 90  people there to see what is going on.   Prior to talking about things that I saw on the trip, I will talk  about the size of the problem, because the numbers tell the story. In  the most recent April, we let 183,000 people in the country.   Frequently, the press, for whatever reason, and some politicians,  talk about the number of people who have contact with the Border  Patrol. 183,000 is the number who actually came in the country. A year  ago in April, that number was 66,000. And 2 years ago it was 6,000. So  we have gone from 6,000 let in the country in April of 2020, April of  2021, 66,000 and, most recently, 183,000.   These numbers are staggering. The press should be reporting every  monthly number with banner headlines. Perhaps, because the story seems  old, they get tired of reporting it. But it is a more significant story  every month.   Of those 183,000, about 60,000 are what we refer to as gotaways; that  is, not people who checked in at the Border Patrol and got a cursory  review. They are people who did not touch the Border Patrol at all. We  don't know whether they were sneaking in this country with drugs. We  don't know whether they had diseases. We don't know whether they have  criminal background problems. We don't know.   So from 6,000 to 66,000 to 183,000. Who knows what it is going to be  by this time next year. Obviously, it is changing America dramatically.   We do have ways to come in this country legally. We like to make sure  that the future America is people who have proved themselves, law- abiding, hardworking. Here we have no idea who we are getting.   I point out that one of the reasons more people are sneaking across  the border is that, as we have approximately 120,000 people who check  in with the Border Patrol, the Border Patrol has to spend more of their  time doing paperwork and not doing what they want to do, which is guard  the border. That is why we are having a much more significant number of  people come here without any contact whatsoever.   The Biden administration says they inherited a mess. They inherited  6,000 a month; and now we are at 183,000 a month.   As far as other observations along the Rio Grande, the heartlessness  of the Mexican drug cartels continues to be shown. When they want to  get drugs here, because they know the Border Patrol is understaffed,  what they do is they send a group of people across the river, and they  know the Border Patrol will be obligated to deal with that group of  people. And then they send another group of people, say, a mile or 2  miles further on down or further up river, where they know they can get  across with their drugs.   They also know the cartels are so brutal and heartless that they will  throw a young child overboard in the Rio Grande because they know our  ethical Border Patrol will save that child, rather than deal with the  people who are sneaking across, perhaps sneaking across with drugs.   For the first time since I have been at the border--I have been down  there several times, in part, due to my subcommittee assignment, the  fact that I am a ranking member. The people who showed me the Rio  Grande pointed out at the bend of a river, here is where we have a lot  of Chinese come across.   Again, I think people are under the impression these are largely  Mexican, Central American folks. I was surprised to hear from my guide  that they pointed out this is the bend where we see a lot of Chinese  coming across; which is, by the way, typical of what I have seen in  other regions. This is people from all around the world.   They also pointed out that one of the reasons so many people are  coming here, they come here because the drug cartels are making money  off them and advertising on social media all around the world, be it  Central America, be it Brazil, be it Peru, be it India, or Pakistan, or  Bangladesh, the drug cartels are making money on these folks.   The further you come, the more they make per person. Maybe they are  getting six or $7,000 for Mexican, maybe 9 or 10,000 for Central  American, maybe 15 or $20,000 from Asia.   One more time--and I repeat things up here I find almost hard to  believe. But one more time, I was told by the Border Patrol that right  now the Mexican drug cartels make more money smuggling people across  the border than drugs, and that is really saying something.   So, in addition to the other problems, we are strengthening the  financial hold the drug cartels have on Mexico and, to a lesser degree,  on the United States.   It is not rocket science how to stop this. You stop it by going back  to the migrant protection protocol in which people coming here were  held in Mexico pending a hearing.   When I talk about the non getaways, about 120,000 a month, these  folks are let in the United States and told to show up for a hearing at  some time. They rarely show up.   When people are paying 10 or $15,000 to get this far, they would not  come here in the first place if they were on the Mexican side of the  border. People are not going to pay $15,000 to sit in Mexico and hope a  hearing goes their way.   So we should go back to the common sense provisions we had just a  year and a half ago, and we would quickly get back down to the six or  10 or 15,000 a month, rather than the massive amount that is coming  across the border.   Another benefit of not having so many people cross the border, is we  would decrease the number, the horrifically high number of drug  overdoses we have in America. These numbers have been repeated, but it  is another story that I think the press is dropping the ball on because  they think because it is an old story it is not an important story.    When I was elected to this job 7 years ago, about 47,000 Americans  were dying every year of drug overdoses. That is now over 110,000. By  comparison, 57,000 American troops died in Vietnam. Over  [[Page H5406]]  twice as many Americans die every year from drug overdoses in this  country as died in 12 years in Vietnam.   The apathy of the Biden administration on these numbers and, quite  frankly, the apathy from the people in this Chamber is stunning.  110,000 people are dying. Not only does that, by itself, mean we have  to do a lot more at the border, we should greatly increase the  penalties for people who smuggle fentanyl or sell fentanyl in this  country.   Think about that. 110,000 people. Think about their parents. Think  about their children. Think about their siblings as, for the rest of  their life, they are going to carry that death with them.   And what do we get from this administration? Nothing. The border is  not a priority. We don't care how much fentanyl comes here.   So again, my request to this body and the request from the Biden  administration, show a little bit of sympathy for the families, where  the people who use these drugs die, and care a little bit about the  future of America.   In some years, over 800,000 people are sworn in as new citizens.  Nobody complains. They have been in the country 5 or 6 years. They have  proven they are not going to go on welfare. They have proven they are  not going to commit crimes. I have attended their ceremonies. They make  one feel very good about being an American. I don't know why we  wouldn't want to have everybody come here under those circumstances,  rather than this massive increase of people coming across the border.   The next topic which should be discussed, and every Congressman who  didn't spend the last 2 weeks in their house heard about it, is the  dramatic amount of inflation that is out here.   One thing that bothers me, and it bothers me about my own party, is I  don't think we spend enough time talking about where the inflation came  from. It came from excessive government spending and the need of the  Federal Reserve to, in essence, print money to deal with that spending.   I point out that this was not a surprise. I personally--I could say  who am I--personally pointed out at the time the original stimulus  package that President Biden signed almost immediately upon getting-- coming into office, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package, predictably  caused this dramatic increase in cost of food, cost of oil, certainly,  cost of housing.   I remind people that Larry Summers, key economist, key economic  adviser to Barack Obama, said at the time that this was the least  responsible economic policy in 40 years. That is what Barack Obama's  economic adviser said.   But, instead, we got from the other side of the aisle, they ignored  Mr. Summers' concerns. They ignored the concerns of Republicans. And  upon President Biden taking office, whoosh, a new $1.9 trillion  stimulus package.   Soon thereafter, they added to that an over $1 trillion  infrastructure bill which was bipartisan because they got a few  irresponsible Republican Senators to vote for it. But, again, outside  of regular budget process, these massive bills.   And predictably, what happened is what Larry Summers and, quite  frankly, me and many Republicans said was going to happen, dramatic  increase in inflation; huge increases in the money supply; increases in  the money supply even greater than what we saw in the 1970s under the  Carter inflation.   It is such a dangerous path we are taking. And I think, in the  future, as President Biden continues to ask for more spending, and I  think the level of spending he asked for in the regular budget is  excessive in its own right; over 12 percent increase in nondefense  spending there. It would be good if not just the Republicans, because  we are in the minority, but the Democrats as well would stand up to  President Biden and say no.   We cannot have any more inflation. Inflation used to be known--and  what it is is a regressive tax on the public. The average person spends  more on gas--the average middle-class person spends more on gas than  the wildly well-off person. They spend more on housing. They spend more  on food.   This is a policy that harms the middle class and harms the poor,  quite frankly, far more than the billionaires which have such influence  politically and get so involved in the last election.   I know there were times where Republicans stood up to President Trump  when he wanted to issue new checks on some of this COVID bills and  voted ``no.'' It would be refreshing in the future if we had some  Democrats stand up and say, I voted for you President Biden, but this  spending was just irresponsible and out of control, and I cannot stand  with you.   I would love it, in the appropriation bills, if we pass--in the  current fiscal year, had no increase at all. That is not a dramatic  thing. They should be cut dramatically. But it would be good if both  the Republicans and Democrats got together and said we are going to go  back to sequester sort of increases; things that we saw under Barack  Obama even, and try to hold the increases into under 1 percent, or  perhaps nothing, because it is going to take quite a while to recover  for the excessive COVID spending, as well as the huge stimulus package  that President Biden led off with.   This is not something that was a surprise. It was not something that  was caused by Ukraine. It was something that every middle schooler  should know. You cannot just print money and not have a huge impact on  inflation.   The next thing we are going to look at here tonight is, quite  frankly, the reason I ran for the job, and what I thought was the major  problem in America, and still believe, other than the border, which  maybe is nudged by it, or the threat of some catastrophic war in  Europe, and that is the role that the Federal government has played in  the breakdown of the American family.   The number of children born without a father in the home was under 5  percent before World War II, and kind of in the golden age of America,  that is what was the norm.   It is hard to believe anybody would not want the nuclear family to be  the standard that American children grow up in.                                time  2100    However, we do know that Karl Marx--and there is this romance with  socialism that permeates part of the Democrat Party, permeates a lot of  our academic institutions. Karl Marx felt that we had to destroy the  American family.   As I have said many times before, Black Lives Matter, on their  website around the time of the last campaign, said that they wanted to  get rid of the Western-proscribed nuclear family.   First of all, it is an insult to the rest of the world because  families with mothers and fathers at home are common in Asia, common in  Africa, common everywhere.   But in any event, it is apparent that the powerful Black Lives Matter  at least said they wanted to get rid of the nuclear family. Karl Marx  wanted to get rid of the nuclear family.   What happened in America that we went from very few children not  having a mom and dad at home to working our way to 40 percent of the  children born in America without mom and dad at home?   It didn't just happen. It happened because this institution,  beginning with who I think is the worst President in the country's  history until now, Lyndon Johnson, began a war on the family. I guess  he called it a war on poverty. He really should have called it a war on  the family.   He began to put the government in a position in which they would take  care of the children instead of both parents--traditionally, the  father. So, in other words, they substituted the government for the  father in the home.   Quickly, we reached the point where it ramped up from the middle  sixties to the nineties, then dipped a little with welfare reform in  the sixties, and now is on the upward climb. Forty percent of children  go home to one parent.   There are some parents who are able to swing it and do a good job,  but let's face it: It is much more difficult to raise kids in that  circumstance, and the statistics show it.   So, how has this body responded? It has responded by increasing the  incentives to not form a nuclear family. Right now, all the government  transfer payments, be it medical care, be it food stamps, be it low- income housing, be it the earned income tax payment, be it the TANF  payments, are all conditioned upon families being in poverty.  [[Page H5407]]    A lot of people considered in poverty I don't think we would consider  in poverty. They maybe have an air-conditioned apartment. They may have  iPhones. They may have cars. But you are considered in poverty if you  are not earning a great deal of money. And the bag of things you are  getting can, in many cases, exceed that of what a working parent,  frequently a father, in the home can provide.   The government says provided you don't get married to a guy with an  income or much of an income, we are going to give you a free apartment,  frequently a nicer apartment than people who are not in the system yet.  We are going to give you free food.   When I talk to the clerks at the grocery stores and such, they  frequently say the food one gets is more expensive than the clerks who  work at the grocery stores can afford.   When you give free healthcare, when you give additional checks of  some basis, TANF checks, you can quickly wind up in a situation in  which, like I said, you are better off financially not getting married.   This was, I think, the biggest policy mistake we have seen in  America, perhaps in hundreds of years, the decision in the 1960s to, in  essence, have the government replace the husband.   I think so many of the problems in America today, including the crime  problems that we addressed or tried to address in the gun bills that  were passed earlier today, actually wouldn't be anywhere near the  problem they are had we not done what we could to destroy the American  family as Karl Marx wanted.   It is the bag of things one gets. Efforts have been made throughout  the last year and a half, some successful, some not, to push more and  more money in the system for people or for single parents--could be a  man, could be a woman--who are not married to someone with much of an  income, the efforts made to increase the earned income tax credit, the  increases in the food stamps, the efforts made to put more low-income  housing out there.   I remember, too, as I mentioned, I talked to some of the admittedly  more liberal people who administer the low-income housing. I asked  them: What about the program don't you like?   Well, it is a good program I am glad to be part of here, but these  people are getting nicer housing than I am getting.   It kind of reminds me like when you talk to the clerk at the grocery  store. The people in the system are getting nicer groceries than the  people not. The people getting the low-income housing, once they get  off the waiting list, are sometimes getting better accommodations than  people who are off on their own, particularly couples starting out.   In any event, I think if there is one thing I would like to have the  Republican Party do, if we ever do get both Houses and the Presidency  again, is to make a concerted effort to change these welfare programs  so never again will the United States be in the business of encouraging  families without both parents, particularly encouraging families  without a father at home.   The results of Lyndon Johnson's policies have been written about for  50 years now. Whether we are talking about Daniel Moynihan or George  Gilder or Robert Rector, everybody points it out.   This breakdown in the family, which everybody knows is ruining  America or is largely responsible for causing the moral decline in  America, it didn't just happen. It happened because the U.S. Government  and people in this body wanted to take money and give it to people  living a certain lifestyle and take it from the tax dollars of people  living the nuclear family lifestyle.   I strongly encourage people in this body, including Republican  leadership, if we take control of this House 2 years from now with the  Presidency, to make their number one priority flipping around these  welfare programs which have done so much to lead to the moral decline  that we have in America today.   I realize it means standing up to the media. It is standing up to--a  former Democrat mayor of Milwaukee used to refer to the poverty pimps.  I don't know whether they use that word anymore.   It will take standing up to the poverty pimps and finally getting the  strength of the American family back where it was in the 1960s, back  where it was in the 1950s where our schools seemed to be doing a better  job, where it didn't seem like the crime was anywhere near as great as  today.   By the way, things like the murder rate should be falling  precipitously because of improved medical care, but we still have a  higher murder rate today, last year, than we did in the fifties, which  is just preposterous but one of the effects of Lyndon Johnson's war on  the family.   I leave that goal for both the Republicans and Democrats, to stop and  think what they can do to get the American family back where it was 60  years ago.   Those are some of what I consider the major issues in America, issues  that should be talked about today and are, quite frankly, of more  significance than some of the things that the media talks about.   I hope when we get done taking our break near the end of June that we  do something to address the border, or President Biden would address it  immediately, that we do something to address the huge number of drug  overdoses and all the broken hearts out there of the people who died  because of this problem.   I hope we begin to address the breakdown of the family that didn't  just happen. It happened almost by design of the government. I hope we  do something about the excessive spending, which results in this  inflation that makes it difficult for people at all ages of life. But I  think it must make it so difficult for the youngest people as they look  forward: Can we buy a home? Can we have children?                            ____________________
