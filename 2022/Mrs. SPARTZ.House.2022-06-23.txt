 Madam Speaker, my district in central Indiana represents  a cross-section of our Nation, cities, suburbs, and rural farmland,  none of which have proven themselves immune to the devastating  possibility of opioid addiction.   Americans know that we must use every tool at our disposal to combat  the opioid pandemic killing young and old. Unfortunately, the Federal  Government ties the hands of doctors, limiting their ability to hold  long-acting injectable addiction treatment to just 14 days after  receipt from pharmacy.   To remedy this problem, last November, I introduced the IMPACT Act  with Congresswoman Dean, which passed the House as part of H.R. 7666. I  am grateful to my colleagues for their support of this legislation, and  I urge the Senate and administration to do the same.  [[Page H5836]]                                ____________________
