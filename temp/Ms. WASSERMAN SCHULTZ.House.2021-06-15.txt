 Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I  rise to honor the remarkable life of David Samrick of Fort Lauderdale,  Florida.   David's faith and love for the Jewish community were evident in his  support of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. He served on  the AIPAC national board since 2015, working closely with Members of  the United States Congress to strengthen and promote a strong and  unbreakable U.S.-Israel relationship.   Through his work with AIPAC, he led citizen activists in building  relationships with Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, a  key to the success of the pro-Israel movement. We worked together to  address a multitude of issues facing our community, from the scourge of  anti-Semitism to ensuring we maintain our strong U.S.-Israel  relationship.   I am proud to have considered him my very dear friend. I will miss  his guidance and wisdom but mostly his friendship.   My heartfelt sympathy goes out to his wife, Susan, and his entire  family. David was one of a kind, a selfless, compassionate, and  tireless advocate. May his memory be for a blessing.                            ____________________
