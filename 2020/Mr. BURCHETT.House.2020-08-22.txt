 Madam Speaker, the United States Congress needs to get  back to work. We need to start working on the issues that deal with our  constituents.   One of those that is of great concern in Tennessee is invasive Asian  carp. They are a nuisance in too many of our Nation's waterways,  preventing folks from fully enjoying our Nation's lakes, rivers, and  streams, and destroying our ecosystem.   Many in my district, including the residents of Tellico Village, have  expressed legitimate concerns to folks at TVA and others over Asian  carp and their potential spread into our local waters, and I have been  proud to work with them to tackle this issue.   Madam Speaker, to control the spread of these pests, I have worked to  secure $25 million in funding in fiscal year 2021. If approved by the  Senate, these resources, combined with language in the Water Resources  Development Act, would allow researchers to study the reproductive  habits of Asian carp in the Tennessee and Cumberland River basins so we  are better equipped to battle these invaders.   I thank both the Committees on Appropriations and Transportation and  Infrastructure for working with my office on these requests.  Problematic Asian carp harass boaters, fishermen, and swimmers across  this country of ours. My constituents are passionate about getting the  Asian carp population under control and keeping them out of our waters.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to working with them further on this  important local issue.                            ____________________
