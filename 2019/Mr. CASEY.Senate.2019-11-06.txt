 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Thank you, Mr. President.   First, I want to briefly recognize this afternoon the brave public  servants who have testified in the House in recent weeks in defense of  national security, the rule of law, and our democratic institutions-- most recently, LTC Alexander Vindman.   Despite Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's two decades of military service  and a Purple Heart for his sacrifice to our country in Iraq, his  character has faced brutal attacks from cable news and from some  current and former Members of Congress. These comments about him are  reprehensible attacks with no basis in fact.   Verbal abuse of Lieutenant Colonel Vindman not only disrespects his  integrity and his service but undermines our institutions and  ultimately makes our Nation less safe--less safe. So questioning the  character, loyalty, or patriotism of Lieutenant Colonel Vindman is an  attack on all veterans and is also an attack on our military.   Former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul put it this way in a  Washington Post column just last week, and I will quote part of the  column:         Such smear tactics are revolting and un-American. Vindman       has served our country with honor and distinction, both on       and off the battlefield. . . . And he is a patriot--as you       would expect from someone with his outstanding resume. . . .       The idea that Vindman might have dual loyalties with another       nation is preposterous. Vindman was born in the totalitarian       Soviet Union, not ``the Ukraine.'' His family, which is       Jewish, fled religious persecution. He is not Soviet or       Ukrainian or Ukrainian American: He is simply an American.       Using birthplaces or hyphenated adjectives to disparage       fellow Americans is always wrong. It is especially so in the       case of Lt. Col. Vindman.    That is the op-ed from a distinguished Ambassador.   When I reflect upon Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's service to our  country and his integrity, I am reminded of one of the lines--we could  use many--from ``America the Beautiful'':       Oh, beautiful for patriot dream        That sees beyond the years         That is what he was doing when he testified, just like that       was what he was doing when he was serving our Nation in Iraq       and when he was wounded in Iraq, and what he has done as a       member of our national security team as part of the work he       has done in this administration--seeing beyond the years.       Part of the dream of a patriot is thinking about the impact       of your actions on future generations.    We need to make sure that we are very clear about where we stand on  his character, on his commitment to the country, and on his courage in  coming forward.    Mr. President, I am going to turn to another matter of  importance for U.S. national security, and that is climate change.  Climate change is the most significant challenge our world faces right  now, transcending borders and affecting every aspect of our lives.   Climate change is a threat to human life. It is caused by human  activity, and we must confront it. Our Nation has a moral imperative to  protect the Earth, God's creation, and the people living on that Earth,  particularly children whose health and well-being will be affected--I  would say adversely affected--by climate change in incomprehensible  ways.   For far too long we have discussed climate change, food insecurity,  and political stability in separate silos. However, these issues are  inextricably  [[Page S6433]]  linked, and we must apply an integrated approach to ensuring that  global food supply keeps pace with population growth amidst a  continuing trend of climate change in a way that promotes stable,  transparent democratic societies around the world.   The late Senator Dick Lugar from the State of Indiana asked me to  work with him to introduce the Global Food Security Act way back in the  2007-2008 time period. At that time, Senator Lugar wanted to try to  pass legislation that would authorize USAID's Feed the Future Program.  Senator Johnny Isakson was a steadfast partner in actually passing the  Global Food Security Act. We passed that legislation years after  Senator Lugar and I were starting the work.   The Global Food Security Act is empowering the USAID to develop a  more integrated, interagency approach to food security across  agricultural value chains and expanding farmers' access to local and  international markets through the Feed the Future Program.   We, as a body, must continue to advocate for the next generation of  agricultural policy: Promote sustainable agriculture that will be able  to keep pace with growing global demand, population growth, and climate  change.   As a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and  Forestry, I am increasingly concerned about our ability to keep pace  with agricultural production as global population grows. The global  population is expected to grow from 7.7 billion to 10 billion by 2050,  and with that, demand for meat and dairy could increase between 59 and  98 percent, according to Columbia University's Earth Institute.   The impact of climate change on food systems across the globe will be  almost incomprehensible, but perhaps nowhere larger than Sub-Saharan  Africa. Now, 90 percent of the region's cropland, meaning Sub-Saharan  Africa--90 percent of that region's cropland is expected to see yield  losses of up to 40 percent--90 percent seeing yield losses of up to 40  percent.   We face some of the same challenges here at home, and we are working  to help farmers adapt to these pressures while also being part of the  solution through climate-friendly agricultural policies.   While we have made advances in recent decades, we still have high  rates of undernourishment and child stunting around the world. The  number of chronically hungry people around the world has increased  today to 821 million people, representing one out of every nine people  on the planet, many of whom are women and children. I will say that  again. The number of chronically hungry people around the world has  increased to one in every nine people on the planet.   The number of children under 5 affected by stunting has decreased by  10 percent in the past 6 years. That is a little bit of good news, but  149 million children are still stunted. This pace is too slow to meet  our United Nations Sustainable Development Goal to cut stunting in half  by 2030--just 11 years away.   Our own intelligence community has linked global food insecurity to  instability, which can lead to a rise in violent extremism and  international crime that will affect the United States. In January  2014, the worldwide threat assessment of the U.S. intelligence  community reported that ``lack of adequate food will be a destabilizing  factor in countries important to [U.S.] national security.''   The ``2010 Quadrennial Defense Review'' marked a turning point in how  the United States grappled with the issue of climate change. For the  first time, in 2010, climate change was cited as a ``threat  multiplier'' by the Department of Defense, noting ``the impacts of  climate change may increase the frequency, scale, and complexity of  future missions.''   From Syria to Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin, but also in urban  upheaval in Sudan, we see the impacts of environmental stress and high  food prices on political stability in regions vital to U.S. national  security interests.   This brings me to political stability. According to the U.S. Global  Food Security Strategy, food insecurity exacerbated by climate change  will contribute to ``social disruptions and political instability. . .  . Projections indicate that more than two-thirds of the world's poor  could be living in fragile countries, where state-society relations are  already strained, by 2030.''   When societies break down because governments are unable to provide  resilient infrastructure against climate events, as well as protect  local markets from vulnerabilities due to climate events, trust in  institutions erodes and nations are ripe for conflict. If we permit  climate change to proceed without aggressive action, investment, and  coordination with partners around the world, we are not only allowing  millions around the world to suffer extreme hunger resulting from  climate-related disasters, but we are also allowing conditions for the  rise of extremism and the breakdown of democratic institutions to  foment unchecked.   For millions of people across Africa, Asia, and Latin America,  climate change means more frequent and intense floods, droughts, and  storms, accounting each year for up to 90 percent of all natural  disasters. These disasters can quickly spiral into full-blown food and  nutrition crises.   I will wrap up with this: As we look to the hard work of  congressional oversight over the Feed the Future Program, I am pleased  that USAID has already begun to bridge its emergency humanitarian  programming with its longer term development efforts to build  resilience for communities affected by conflict and climate change.   The United States cannot do this alone. We need to work together on a  global scale not only to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also to  mitigate economic risk and ensure that agricultural and food supply  chains can withstand climate events. This administration's decision to  withdraw from the Paris climate agreement was a huge blow to U.S.  leadership in climate policy. I and many Members of Congress and  individuals throughout the U.S. Government, along with our State and  local government partners, as well as leaders in the business community  across the United States, will continue to fight for policies that  bring the United States in line with its Paris goals, ensuring we are  doing our part to address this global threat to human life.   I yield the floor.
