 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Dr. Dotty  Merrill for her work with the Nevada Association of School Boards. Dr.  Merrill joined the association as executive director in October 2006,  bringing more than 35 years of national, State, and local educational  experience affecting K-12 schools and higher education.   Dr. Merrill provides executive leadership to the Nevada Association  of School Boards, which represents and serves 107 elected and appointed  members of the governing boards in Nevada's 17 school districts. Prior  to joining the association, Merrill served as the superintendent of  public policy, accountability, and assessment with the Washoe County  School District, providing policy and fiscal representation on behalf  of the district in the Nevada Legislature from 1999 to 2005.   Additionally, Dr. Merrill has dedicated her life and career to our  State's education system and has extensive experience with charter  schools, assessment to improve classroom instruction, accountability,  State and Federal requirements, and molding collaborative and  cooperative relationships among educational communities.   I also want to recognize that, before becoming a district-level  administrator, Merrill taught high school English for 15 years and  served for 10 years as a high school administrator. As the husband of a  teacher and father of four who attended Nevada's public schools, I  understand that our educators have one of the most challenging,  important, and rewarding jobs, and I am extremely grateful for their  work because I have seen firsthand the positive impact that high- caliber teachers have on their students.   Dr. Merrill's holds a doctorate in educational leadership from the  University of Nevada, Reno, a master of arts in English from the  University of Nevada, Reno, and a bachelor of arts from the University  of Arkansas in Fayetteville. She has also been published in several  national education journals and currently serves on the editorial board  for the National Association of Secondary School Principals.   We all know that a good education is the key to success and a better  future, and as Nevada's senior U.S. Senator, I commend Dr. Merrill's  dedication to our State's education and academic achievement.                            ____________________
