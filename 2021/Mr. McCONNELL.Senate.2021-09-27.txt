 Madam President, I am glad to share that, a few  minutes ago, I received a booster vaccination for COVID-19. All  throughout the pandemic, I have followed the best advice from experts  and especially from my own healthcare providers. It was an easy  decision to receive a booster.   I am a survivor of childhood polio from before vaccines--before  vaccines eradicated that disease here in our country and around the  world now. So I have been a lifelong champion of vaccinations.   Mountains of evidence tell us these shots are safe, effective, and  dramatically shrink the odds of severe disease or death from COVID.  Like I have been saying for months, these safe and effective vaccines  are the way to defend ourselves and our families from this terrible  virus. They are also how we stay on offense against COVID as a country.  All Americans should speak with their doctors and get vaccinated.                                   Economy    Madam President, now, on a completely different matter, it is not  unusual for a President to have a rough spell. Every administration  faces a stretch of time where nothing seems to go their way. But what  we are witnessing today is entirely different.   President Biden has not been dealt a bad hand by forces outside his  control. This White House is not sailing through some unavoidable patch  of choppy water. No, the Democrats have steered our country straight  into a storm of serious crises all of their own making.   On issue after issue, Americans are hurting because of specific  policy choices that Democrats have made over the objections of people  who actually knew better. Democrats did not inherit most of the painful  inflation that is hammering working families. Their decisions have  fueled it. Even liberal economists warned the President that runaway  liberal spending could send costs soaring--soaring--for the middle  class. Now working Americans are paying dearly at the grocery store, at  the gas station, and practically everywhere that matters to families.   And what are Democrats doing today? Putting together yet another  reckless taxing-and-spending spree behind closed doors that would make  inflation even worse.   Now, President Biden did not inherit humiliation in Afghanistan  either; he deliberately chose that as well. The Biden administration's  own experts warned the White House that a reckless withdrawal would  embolden terrorists and harm our ability to gather intelligence that  keeps us safe. But the President clung to his made-up deadline, handed  huge momentum to the Taliban and their terrorist friends, and broke his  explicit promise to leave no American behind who wanted out. As one  former Democratic Member of Congress said last week, ``The way the  administration executed that withdrawal last week has been an utter and  abject disaster.''   Democrats did not inherit this border crisis either. This security  nightmare and human tragedy is yet another direct result of their own  policies. President Biden and his allies spent 2 years campaigning on  the concept of Big Government giveaways to people here illegally. Then  they took office and began dismantling enforcement on the border. So  what do they expect? Wave after wave of vulnerable people have been  lured into hellish conditions by the mirage the Democrats have set up-- cruelty masquerading as compassion. Untold thousands of people have  simply been released into our country with what amounts to a polite  invitation to show up--show up--for a hearing. Even before the Biden  surge, only about half of individuals actually showed up.   One self-created crisis after another from our unified Democratic  Party government. The latest additions are their confusion about how to  fund the government and raise the debt ceiling. For more than 2 months  now, Senate Republicans have been completely clear about how this  process will play out, so let me make it abundantly clear one more  time.   We will support a clean continuing resolution that will prevent a  government shutdown, get disaster relief to Louisiana, help properly  vetted Afghan refugees who put themselves on the line for America, and  support the Iron Dome assistance for our ally Israel. We will not  provide Republican votes for raising the debt limit.  [[Page S6685]]    As we speak, Democrats are behind closed doors, assembling a  multitrillion-dollar reckless taxing-and-spending spree. There is no  chance Republicans will help lift Democrats' credit limit so they can  immediately steamroll through a socialist binge that will hurt families  and help China.   There is no particular tradition that the minority will always vote  for debt limit hikes during united government. When Republicans had  unified control in the early 2000s, then-Senators Biden and Schumer  voted no on a debt limit increase and made the party in power handle it  on their own--exactly the situation we are in now. The roles were  reversed. Bipartisanship is not a light switch--a light switch--that  Democrats get to flip on when they need to borrow money and switch off  when they want to spend money.   The debt suspension that expired in August covered all the debt that  had been accumulated to that point. This is an argument about the  future. Democrats want to use this temporary pandemic as a Trojan horse  for permanent socialism. They have all but said so. And that is what  millions and millions of Americans elected 50 Republican Senators to  fight against.   For 10 weeks now--10 weeks--Democrats have known what kind of  government funding legislation could pass the Senate and what kind  would fail. Republicans are not rooting for a shutdown or debt limit  breach. We have given the united Democratic government total clarity  about how each can be avoided. Republicans have explained exactly what  kind of continuing resolution can pass the Senate with our support.   Late last week, the House Democratic leader publicly said House  Democrats are ready to swallow whatever CR the Senate can send them. So  the House is ready. Senate Republicans are ready. We could have a  bipartisan vote to fund the government today if not for the odd tactics  of the Senate Democratic leader.   Before we vote this afternoon, I will ask consent to strike the  partisan CR that is dead on arrival and instead have the Senate vote on  a clean continuing resolution that could pass this Chamber easily. We  will see if Washington Democrats actually want to govern or whether  they want to add the prospect of a government shutdown to the list of  inflation, Afghanistan, the border, and all the other national crises  that are the direct results of their own decisions.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators  Cassidy, Kennedy, and I be allowed to complete our remarks prior to the  vote.    So, Madam President, the Democratic leader has  scheduled a vote today that he knows will fail. For more than 2 months,  since July, Republicans have been clear about where we stand: We are  willing to work together to keep the government open. We are not  willing to help Democrats raise the debt ceiling while they write a  reckless taxing-and-spending spree of historic proportions behind  closed doors.   Democrats control the entire government--the Senate, the House, the  White House. They intend to sideline Republicans and go it alone to  slam American families with historic tax hikes and borrowing. So they  will need to raise the debt limit on a partisan basis as well. And they  have known that for 2 months now--2 months.   Just like then-Senator Biden and Senator Schumer voted no on a debt  limit increase and made a unified Republican government handle it alone  back in the early 2000s, this has happened before.   Earlier this year, Senate Democrats requested and won additional  flexibility to make policy on party lines. They have every single tool  they need to do their job.   The Democratic leader, the Speaker of the House, and the President of  the United States have had 10 weeks--10--to plan for funding the  government and addressing the debt limit. There never had to be one  ounce of drama to any of this. Any drama here is self-created by the  Democrats. Republicans continue to try to help our Democratic friends  avoid multiple new crises of their own making.   On the debt limit, Democrats have all the time and all the tools to  do what they have to do, and I have explained in detail how they need  to proceed. Because Democrats ignored our warning back in July, they  must amend their previous budget resolution with debt limit  instructions and proceed through a fast-track process.   On the more urgent issue, government funding, Senator Shelby and I  have a clean CR that could pass today. Our bill tracks with bipartisan  talks. It would keep the government open, fund disaster relief for  Louisiana, and fund defensive assistance for our ally Israel and their  Iron Dome, and it drops the debt limit language that Democrats have  known is a nonstarter for more than 2 months.   The Senate could advance this bill tonight. If Democrats will let us,  we could take a bipartisan step tonight toward guaranteeing there will  be no government shutdown. If the Democratic leader lets us, the Senate  could advance government funding legislation with a big bipartisan vote  yet tonight.   The House Democratic majority leader has said they will take up  whatever CR the Senate sends them. The House is ready. Senate  Republicans are ready. The only holdout is the Senate Democratic leader  and his partisan tactics.   So, in just a moment, I will ask consent that Democrats forget about  the vote they know will fail and instead let the Senate vote on a bill  that can actually pass.   It is up to the Democrats. We can either move this legislation  forward tonight or we can have a show vote, which they know will fail,  and inch closer toward another crisis of their own making.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to Calendar No. 137, H.R. 5305. I further ask that the  first amendment in order be the Shelby-McConnell amendment to the text  of which is identical to Calendar No. 135, S. 2789; that there be 2  hours of debate, equally divided between the two leaders or their  designees, and upon the use or yielding back of that time, the Shelby- McConnell amendment be agreed to; finally, upon disposition of the  Shelby-McConnell amendment, the bill, as amended, be read a third time  and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as amended, with a 60- affirmative-vote threshold required for passage.
