 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed  to speak for up to 10 minutes, followed by Senator Johnson for 10  minutes, prior to the scheduled rollcall vote.    Mr. President, today was supposed to be the last day of  school in Uvalde, TX. Each of us can remember how excited we were as  children, as students, but especially we can remember being a parent  the last day of school our child attended. Your child  [[Page S2719]]  would perhaps run into your arms and recount a fun-filled day with  their classmates. They would sling their backpack on the backseat of  the car and talk about how excited they were about the summer, to spend  days playing with their friends and their siblings, swimming at the  local pool with friends, and maybe even going on a vacation with their  grandparents.   Today, those children, those parents, and those teachers in Uvalde,  TX, have been robbed of the excitement and normalcy that this day would  normally bring. Instead of celebrating the last day of school, 21  families are making funeral arrangements.   Earlier this week, a monster viciously murdered innocent children and  their teachers at Robb Elementary School. So far we know that 21 people  have been killed by the shooter, including 19 students and 2 teachers.  This tragedy has absolutely shattered the tight-knit community of  Uvalde, TX.   Uvalde is a town of about 15,000 people, about 65 miles from the  United States-Mexican border. There is one high school football team,  one H-E-B Grocery store, and one post office. The families of Uvalde  have known each other and loved each other's children for as long as  they can remember.    The grief caused by this attack is shared by the entire community,  and I join all Texans in lifting up the victims, their families, and  those who are struggling to make sense of this tragedy.   Yesterday, I was in Uvalde with my fellow Texans in mourning. I  joined hundreds of people in donating blood and received an update from  law enforcement and both State and community leaders. As though we  needed a reminder of the tight-knit community, a deputy sheriff himself  lost his own daughter in this attack, and two members of the mayor's  staff lost children as well.   One of the conversations I had that really struck home was with an  older gentleman who responded to the call for blood donations at the  Herby Ham Activity Center. As we waited our turn to donate blood, he  shared with me that he had lost two grandchildren in the shooting. It  is not possible for us to comprehend the pain he must be feeling, but  there he was, donating blood. Two young lives were stolen from his  family, and, still, this man stood in line so he could support his  community in some tangible way.   During the briefing from law enforcement, two of the Uvalde police  officers who responded to the shooting shared their harrowing  experiences with us, and in the face of such unthinkable evil, their  courage was unwavering. One of these Uvalde police officers responded  to the scene, and I had a chance to thank him personally.   I want to thank all of the law enforcement officials, the emergency  medical technicians, and healthcare workers who responded to this  tragedy and who continue to support the survivors and their loved ones.   At times like this, I am reminded of a quote I heard some time ago  from a county commissioner in the face of a similar tragedy. He said:         Being a Texan doesn't describe where you are from as much       as it describes who your family is.    Today, our entire family is mourning. Our hearts are broken by those  who lost loved ones and the survivors who will never forget this  terrifying and senseless attack.   While the terror of this attack will weigh on all of us, we saw the  spirit of my State on full display as resources poured out to help the  loved ones of the community who were hurting so badly. From mental  health counseling to food donations, there was an outflow of support  from the South Texas community.   At times like this, words seem so inadequate. There is no good way to  completely express the heartbreak and anger that swell in your chest at  a moment like this. All we can say, perhaps, is that our condolences  are with the families who are grieving such a cruel and unexpected  loss. I can't fathom the pain of seeing an empty bed where your child  slept the night before.   Knowing we can't turn back the clock to prevent this tragedy from  occurring, the obvious question then is, How do we prevent something  like this from happening again?   At this point, law enforcement is still investigating and piecing  together the full story. In the coming days, I expect we will have  better information about the shooter and his background and the  circumstances that led to this senseless, brutal act. Once it does, I  am eager to see whether there were any gaps that might have done  something to make this attack less likely, that might have actually  even prevented this attack from taking place.   In the past, I have worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to prevent senseless tragedies from occurring, through things like Fix  NICS and the Mental Health and Safe Communities Act. Fix NICS, you will  recall, occurred after the Sutherland Springs shooting, where the  shooter's criminal convictions were not uploaded by the Air Force into  the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, so he was able  to go to a local sporting goods store and buy weapons--by lying and  buying. I am convinced that in working with Senator Murphy and all of  our colleagues, we were able to get 70 or more cosponsors on that bill  because it actually addressed a real gap in the system, and it would  actually give us some hope that we would actually save lives in the  future.   I am not interested in making a political statement. I am not  interested in the same old tired talking points. I am actually  interested in what we can do to make the terrible events that occurred  in Uvalde less likely in the future. We don't know everything we need  to know, but once we do, I expect there will be an informed debate  about the reforms we can make, and I look forward to participating in  those discussions.   For now, the focus should remain on supporting the people of this  little community, who suffered an immeasurable loss this week.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print my bill  for introduction in the Congressional Record. The bill addresses the  foreign production of precursor chemicals that are used for the illicit  production of narcotics and psychotropic drugs and other controlled  substances.
