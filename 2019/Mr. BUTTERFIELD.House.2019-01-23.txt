 Madam Speaker, I rise this morning to recognize a  great American and a great friend, Dr. Cureton L. Johnson, a longtime  theologian and community leader in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Dr.  Johnson will approach his last official sermon as pastor of historic  First Baptist Church in Fayetteville on Sunday, January 27, 2019. I am,  therefore, honored to share with my colleagues in the United States  House of Representatives the accomplishments of this remarkable man of  God.   Cureton Lee Johnson was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, to the late  Dr. and Mrs. Paul H. Johnson. He is a graduate of the University of  North Carolina at Chapel Hill and received his master's degree from  American University here in Washington, D.C., and the Shaw University  Divinity School in Raleigh. He also received his doctor of ministry  degree from Drew University in Madison, New Jersey. He previously  served on the public relations staffs at North Carolina A&T State  University in Greensboro and Howard University here in Washington.   Over the years, Madam Speaker, Dr. Johnson remained true to his  commitment to be active, productive, and dedicated to every facet of  his beloved community. As a young student at UNC-Chapel Hill, Dr.  Johnson served as president of the Black Student Movement Association.  He was the founding editor of the BSM's newspaper, referred to as Black  Ink, which is still in publication today.   A longtime social activist, Dr. Johnson was a member of the anti- apartheid movement during the 1980s and was arrested while  demonstrating at the South African Embassy in the District of Columbia.   Dr. Johnson also served as the editor of the Baptist Informer, which  is the official publication of the General Baptist State Convention of  North Carolina, Incorporated, the oldest organization of Black Baptists  in the Nation, founded in 1867.   The son and grandson of Baptist ministers, Dr. Johnson was called  into the ministry in 1976 and ordained in 1978 under his father, the  legendary Dr. Paul H. Johnson, Sr., at Martin Street Baptist Church in  Raleigh.   Dr. Cureton Johnson served as an associate minister at Martin Street  Baptist Church and at Florida Avenue Baptist Church in Washington, D.C.  Dr. Johnson is also pastor at New Red Mountain Baptist Church in  Rougemont, North Carolina, and Baptist Grove Baptist Church in Raleigh.   On the first Sunday in June 1991, Dr. Johnson assumed full pastoral  responsibility at his current First Baptist Church in Fayetteville.   I might say, Madam Speaker, First Baptist Church in Fayetteville was  formed in 1868, 5 years after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed  by President Abraham Lincoln and months following the ratification of  the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, ending slavery in America. It  is the oldest missionary Baptist church in the city of Fayetteville, a  church that I have attended on many occasions, including when I was  stationed at Fort Bragg Army post in Fayetteville.   Madam Speaker, much of First Baptist Church's growth in recent years  can be attributed to the leadership of Dr. Johnson and its spirit- filled church congregation. Under Dr. Johnson's leadership, the church  has been a powerful force for uplifting God's people in this community,  launching a free summer children's reading camp in 1993. It continues  to serve over 100 children every year.  [[Page H1004]]    In 1999, First Baptist Church broke ground on a $2 million Christian  center. The two-story facility includes 11,000 square feet, a library  and learning center, nursery, children's church, clothes closet, and a  multipurpose room for neighborhood development and outreach ministries.   First Baptist Church remains active in the Union Baptist Association,  the General Baptist State Convention of North Carolina, and the Lott  Carey Foreign Mission Convention.   During his pastorate, Dr. Johnson has preached more than 2,300  sermons and welcomed more than 500 souls into the fellowship, presided  over 750-plus funerals, officiated at more than 125 weddings, and  dedicated some 130 babies. He has ordained 15 ministers, including  First Baptist Church's first five women ministers. He has also ordained  the church's first five women deacons.   In closing, Madam Speaker, Dr. Johnson is blessed with a loving wife,  the former Lena A. Goode of Durham. They have two sons, Paul and  Cureton; one grandson, Jayden Cureton; and one granddaughter, Jaelynn.   By the grace of God, Dr. Johnson retires after three decades of  outstanding leadership at First Baptist Church. Although Dr. Johnson is  retiring from an active ministry, he will never retire from his  unwavering service to God.   On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, we thank Dr.  Johnson for his service to community. His life has been one of  unlimited service. We will cherish his leadership for years to come. I  extend my congratulations and best wishes to Dr. Johnson, his wife, and  the entire congregation at First Baptist Church and the Fayetteville  community.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the  Reverend Dr. Cureton Lee Johnson on this auspicious occasion.                            ____________________
