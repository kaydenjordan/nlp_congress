 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Trig Solberg  and his wife, Tula, on the 50th anniversary of their business, T.A.  Solberg Company, which operates several supermarkets and fuel and  convenience stores throughout northern and central Wisconsin.   Trig and Tula started their first business together in 1971, with a  single small store in Land O'Lakes, Wisconsin. Today, they operate  several stores in the communities of Rhinelander, Minocqua, Eagle  River, and Tomahawk, employing more than 1,200 people. The Northwoods  of Wisconsin is dear to the Solbergs, so they make sure each of their  stores keeps the personality of the region intact.   I can attest that Trig is admired by staff, colleagues, and industry  peers for his dedication to his community and commitment to excellence.   Congratulations again to Trig and Tula Solberg for 50 years in  business and their service to Wisconsin.                            ____________________
