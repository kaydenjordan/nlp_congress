 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as  chairman of the committee of jurisdiction, I have reached out to the  Federal Emergency Management Agency for its views, and the Agency  opposes this legislation.   According to the Agency:         FEMA has spent more than $432 million on . . . [the       Transitional Shelter Assistance program], and provided rental       assistance to more than 25,000 TSA participant families to       help them find permanent housing solutions.        [Ninety-seven] percent of those enrolled in the program       have successfully transitioned to more permanent housing.        The remaining households in [the Transitional Shelter       Assistance program] have either received rental or repair       assistance from FEMA; have a habitable home with utilities       on; or are not eligible for additional FEMA housing       assistance.        Federal, state, and voluntary organization partners will       continue to provide assistance through disaster case       management to those who still require long-term solutions.    Again, as the chairman of the committee with oversight and  jurisdiction over FEMA, I really do believe it is important to support  FEMA's objection to this. For those reasons, I object.    Mr. President, I have been asked by the chairman of the  Senate Finance Committee to object on his behalf. On his behalf, I  object.
