 Mr. President, I would first like to address the harsh  [[Page S1883]]  and very inclement weather that is sweeping across the State of  Nebraska.   My prayers are with the Nebraskans who have been affected by the  damaging storm.   This massive storm they are calling a bomb cyclone has brought  blizzard conditions, hurricane force winds, and dangerous floods to  Nebraska. Some people have had to evacuate their homes. Others have  been working tirelessly for the safety of their livestock.   I thank our emergency responders, the State, and local officials who  are helping the citizens of our State during this time.   I want all Nebraskans to know that my office stands ready to assist  you in any possible way.                          Honoring our Armed Forces                         Sergeant Cory Ryan Mracek    Mr. President, I rise to continue my tributes to the current  generation of men and women who have lost their lives in Iraq and in  Afghanistan while defending our freedom. Each of these Nebraska heroes  has a special story to tell.   I recall today the life and service of SGT Cory Mracek, who was a  native of Hay Springs, NE.   Though Cory spent most of his life in Hay Springs, he was born in  Chadron, NE. Both of his parents, Pat and Jim, were born and raised in  Nebraska as well.   As a young child, Cory was always trying to have a good time. He was  often found either laughing or trying to make others laugh. Cory talked  a lot, starting at age 1. Pat, his mother, fondly remembers that Cory  was a curious child, and when they would go into stores, Cory would  always touch different items because he wanted to know more about them.  He was an easygoing kid, and he loved watching Sesame Street on a  regular basis.   Cory was close to his grandfather, and they would often go places  together and spend time together. Both of Cory's younger sisters, Stacy  and Heather, came into the world when he was a young child, and he had  a very close relationship with both of them. As is often the case with  siblings, though, they sometimes quarreled.   Like many kids his age, Cory was fascinated by ``Star Wars'' and  ``The Simpsons.'' The original ``Star Wars'' movies came out when Cory  was young, and he had all kinds of ``Star Wars'' figurines and action  figures around the house.   Cory attended several small schools in northwest Nebraska before  enrolling in Hay Springs High School. Around the time Cory started high  school, Michael Jordan was changing the sport of basketball all over  the world. The Chicago Bulls' legend became Cory's sports hero. His  bedroom was covered with Michael Jordan posters, basketball cards, and  memorabilia.   During his high school years, Cory became involved in many  extracurricular activities. Fishing was one of his favorites, and he  would often go to nearby Walgren Lake, southwest of Hay Springs.   In high school, Cory was also involved in basketball and football,  where he played fullback.   Pat vividly remembers when she worked in the eastern part of Nebraska  one week so that Cory could attend Tom Osborne's Big Red Football  School for 3 days. This was a popular football camp that many teenage  boys in Nebraska participated in over the years.   At Hay Springs High, Cory wasn't too fond of actually going to  school, but he was more than capable. He scored a 30 on his ACT, and  his armed services vocational aptitude battery score was also  exceptionally high.   After graduating from Hay Springs High School, Cory attended Chadron  State College, just down the road from where he grew up. While at  Chadron State, Cory had a hard time finding a good job. With his high  marks on the test, Cory decided to enlist in the Nebraska Army National  Guard. He graduated from basic training at Fort Sill, OK, in 1996.   After 1 year, Cory transferred to the Active Army because it provided  him with a year-round job. Cory's military occupation specialty was 13- bravo or cannon crewmember for artillery, and he was stationed at Fort  Campbell in Kentucky.   Immediately after joining the Active Army, Cory was deployed to South  Korea for 1 year. He enjoyed his time in Korea, and he participated in  the tradition of the Manchu Mile, a daunting, 24-mile march in full  combat gear across Korea's mountainous terrain.   Cory was also involved in the honor guard.   In January of 2001, Cory returned home to Nebraska and transitioned  back to the National Guard. Months later, the September 11 terrorist  attacks changed our Nation and the world. The events of that fateful  day ignited deep patriotism within Cory. While he and his parents were  outside their home holding up candles in memory of the lives lost in  the 9/11 attacks, Cory told his mom that he was going to transition  back to the Active Army to serve his country.   In early 2002, Cory transitioned back to the Active Army from the  Nebraska National Guard. Cory then deployed to Korea for a second  time--this time for 15 months, serving near the demilitarized zone  between North and South Korea.   When he returned from Korea, Cory was assigned to the 82nd Airborne  Division at Fort Bragg and completed airborne school in November of  2003. Shortly after, Cory received notice that he was deploying to  Iraq. Cory arrived in Iraq for his deployment in January of 2004. Pat  had already sent care packages over for Cory so they would be there  when he arrived.   On the morning of January 27, 2004, Pat instant-messaged with Cory to  catch up and see how things were going. Later that same day, Cory and  his reconnaissance platoon were performing a mission near Iskandariyah,  Iraq. This particular area of Iraq saw major combat activity and  sectarian violence from 2003 to 2007. During Cory's reconnaissance  mission that day, his platoon came across an IED. Cory and two other  U.S. servicemembers were killed by that explosion.   On Wednesday, February 4, 2004, at the Chadron State College  gymnasium, more than 600 family members, friends, and military  officials gathered to celebrate and honor the life, service, and  sacrifice of SGT Cory Mracek. He was eulogized by many, including his  two sisters, Stacy and Heather.   He was laid to rest at the Gordon City Cemetery next to his  grandfather. The funeral procession from Chadron to Gordon was a short  drive by western Nebraska standards--46 miles. From Chadron to Hay  Springs to Rushville, people lined the streets to pay their respects,  wave American flags, and salute Cory.   For quite some time, Cory's parents thought about the best way to  memorialize him. Eventually, Pat came up with the perfect tribute:  renaming the local Chadron, NE, post office after Cory. Pat had  previously worked at the post office for 10 years, and she asked GEN  Roger Lempke, Retired, who is now a member of my staff, how we could  make this happen.   I had the privilege of working alongside former U.S. Senator Mike  Johanns on legislation to rename the Chadron Post Office the ``Sergeant  Cory Mracek Memorial Post Office.'' The bill was passed by Congress,  and it was signed into law on November 2014.   To this day, Cory's mother, Pat, remains heavily involved in many  veteran and military organizations. She is the president of Nebraska  Gold Star Mothers and the cochair of the Honor and Remember Nebraska  Chapter.   Both Pat and Cory's father, Jim, would like our Nation to remember  how happy Cory was. He liked to laugh, have fun, and enjoy life.   I join Nebraskans and Americans across our country in saluting Cory's  willingness to serve and the sacrifices he and his family made to keep  us free, and I am honored to tell his story.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, Democrats have put forward proposals  claiming that it is the duty of the Federal Government to create a so- called Green New Deal.   My colleagues have listed a variety of goals, like net-zero  greenhouse gas emissions within a decade, good jobs for all, and a  sustainable environment and infrastructure, but they haven't proposed  any specific policy changes or a roadmap of how to reach these goals.  The reason for that is clear. As the resolution's authors have said,  these proposals would require a massive Federal Government takeover and  reorganization of our country as a whole. We are learning that what it  would take to accomplish these goals is unrealistic. We should call the  Green New Deal exactly what it is--an attack on what should be the  limited role of the Federal Government in our lives.   I want to address Nebraskans directly, and I want to analyze a few  details that are part of this resolution's attack on rural America,  which is an attack on Nebraska because our State's economy and the  well-being of all Nebraska families is reliant on a strong agricultural  economy.   One section of the resolution speaks to our Nation's agriculture  sector. Properly managing our environment is important, and Nebraska's  agricultural producers who feed and fuel our world know better than  anyone about conservation and stewardship. This is a serious issue, and  it deserves a serious and a sensible approach.   The early fact sheets that came out describing the Green New Deal  offered mind-boggling proposals, like eliminating cows. This idea was  so ridiculous that the Democrats balked and distanced themselves from  this concept. In fact, while the Nebraska Democratic Party announced  their support for the Green New Deal, Nebraska's Democratic Party  chairman recently apologized to fellow Nebraskans for the anti- agriculture ideas that are included in it.   Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa Governor and former Secretary of  Agriculture in the Obama administration, was spot-on with his comments  about the greatness of American agriculture during a congressional  hearing in 2016. He pointed this out:         Every one of us that's not a farmer, is not a farmer       because we have farmers. We delegate the responsibility of       feeding our families to a relatively small percentage of this       country. Eighty-five percent of what's grown in this country,       it's raised by 2- to 300,000 people. It is an incredible       freedom that we take for granted . . . and rather than being       criticized, we ought to be celebrating these people . . . and       we don't do it enough.    I could not agree more. Nebraska farmers and ranchers feed a hungry  world. Our soybeans, dairy, wheat, pork, eggs, and potatoes reach  family dinner tables around the globe.   Nebraska is known as the Beef State. We are the No. 1 exporter of  beef in the Nation. In 2017, Nebraska exported well over $1 billion in  beef products. Our beef producers are known around the globe as the  best at what they do.   Here are some facts.   Fact: According to a recent USDA report, beef production accounts for  only 3.3 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.   Fact: According to a Smithsonian article published in 2016, wetlands  account for nearly 22 percent of global methane emissions. I would  suggest to you that no one wants to eliminate wetlands.   Nebraska ag producers care for our land and our water, and our cattle  producers already have elevated levels of water regulations. For  example, our feedlots must maintain a livestock waste control facility  permit from the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality. Existing  and new livestock operations must be inspected by the DEQ to determine  if a waste control facility construction permit is required. Our  producers also need a national pollutant discharge elimination system  permit if their livestock facility has the potential to discharge into  surface waters.   As I said, Nebraska is the Beef State, but we are also the  Cornhuskers, and the two go hand-in-hand. Nebraska is a top producer of  corn, and that corn is fed to livestock and establishes Nebraska as the  No. 1 cattle on feed State in the Nation. Our producers do this while  conserving our natural resources--our land and our water.   Consider this: The Omaha-based Lindsay Corporation recently developed  a tool that connects to the center pivot irrigation system and remotely  controls the water based on the irrigation prescription for each  individual field. The company estimated that since the tool was  launched, it has saved over 21 billion gallons of water, over 34  million kilowatt hours of energy, and over 57 million pounds of carbon  dioxide emissions globally.   Nebraska also has a unique system of 23 natural resources districts.  The districts are managed by locally elected boards. The boards have  tax levy authority to support conservation efforts tailored to each of  the district's unique needs. Through this process, we regulate our  groundwater more than any other State, and it is an effective use  because our local communities are the ones in control. No other State  in the country has this advanced form of ground and surface water  management. Because of the adoption of more efficient irrigation  systems by our corn and soybean producers, water applied in three  natural resources districts in Nebraska has decreased significantly,  conserving our water.   Nebraska's producers also take good care of our soil. Our natural  resources districts can require landowners to manage soil erosion on  their land and connect them with cost-sharing programs to help  implement effective soil management practices. The use of planned  grazing on our ranches--my family's ranch included--improves the amount  and the diversity of grass available to cattle, and cattle improve the  overall health of that rangeland.   The Natural Resources and Conservation Service estimated that soil  erosion and planned or, as some call it, rotational grazing practices  have saved over $80 million in annual damages from flooding or  erosion. Additionally, with the adoption of no-till farming practices  in row crop production, combined with cover crops like millet and rye,  we have vastly improved the health of our soil.    The bottom line is this: Ag producers are conservationists who  utilize proven practices to manage our land and water resources.   As more facts have come out, we have learned that the cost alone of  the Green New Deal is astounding. One estimate by the American Action  Forum  [[Page S1890]]  found that if the deal were fully enacted, it would cost anywhere from  $51 trillion to $93 trillion over the next 10 years--$93 trillion. That  is a staggering expense that our families, our businesses, and our  economy simply cannot afford.   One of the main goals of the Green New Deal is a mandate to move our  country to 100 percent renewable energy and achieve carbon neutrality  within the next decade. The American Action Forum's estimate warns that  households would shoulder this weight with up to a nearly $4,000  increase in their yearly electric bills, and if our country relied on  foreign energy, those rates would skyrocket even higher.   Higher electricity bills are a concern for me, and they are a concern  for Nebraska families, but my colleagues across the aisle don't seem  fazed. Recall that in 2009, former President Obama said he was willing  to have the average household pay nearly $1,600 per year to reduce  carbon emissions by 15 percent. Hard-working families said then that  they could not afford that. So how can people now afford up to spending  $4,000 a year?   Attempting to move to all renewable energy would also mean shutting  down every nuclear, coal, and natural gas plant. According to some  estimates, this would cost Nebraskans and the American people $7  trillion by 2030. If we eliminated the use of natural resources like  gas, oil, and coal production, the United States would rely on other  countries to supply our energy.   The United States leads all G20 countries with the best record of  carbon dioxide emissions reduction in recent years. From 2005 to 2017,  the United States reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 862 million  tons--a 14-percent cut. Comparatively, in the same timeframe, India  increased its carbon emissions by 1.3 billion tons, and China raised  its emissions by 4 billion tons--a 70-percent increase. Though China is  moving toward plants with higher efficiency, China already accounts for  nearly half of the global coal consumption.   The Green New Deal misses a crucial point: The United States is  already making voluntary changes to lead the world in reducing carbon  dioxide emissions. A line from the 16-page resolution reads that the  Green New Deal would include ``overhauling transportation systems in  the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.''   A background document released by the Green New Deal's author called  for a plan to build out high-speed rail and replace every combustion  engine vehicle at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary. As  chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee's Transportation and Safety  Subcommittee, I welcome all commonsense, bipartisan proposals to  improve our infrastructure so that we can provide the safe and  efficient movement of our people and our goods.   Yet the Green New Deal is a far cry from a commonsense proposal. The  call to replace every combustion engine wouldn't just hurt our Nation's  infrastructure; it would mean scrapping our personal cars and the  commercial trucking industry. It would mean eradicating planes and air  travel altogether. Don't forget that we are a Nation of vastness. Light  rail is not feasible. It is not feasible in many parts of our country,  and people in sparsely populated areas have a right to receive  services, participate in commerce, and have transportation options that  meet their unique needs.   In closing, as the activists continue to push their wish lists, I am  going to continue to focus on addressing those regulations that make  life difficult for families and businesses in Nebraska. Excessive  regulations cause our ag producers to focus on mountains of paperwork  instead of on ways to innovate and implement new practices so they can  continue being good stewards of our land. The key to finding realistic  solutions in addressing carbon dioxide emissions lies in the hands of  America's innovators, not in the heavy hand of the Federal Government  through an economic takeover.   In moving forward, I am going to work on updating the aging  infrastructure that our citizens rely on in their everyday lives. I am  going to fight for policies that will help to promote economic growth  and help families across this country provide for their loved ones, and  I will continue to highlight the good work our farmers and ranchers are  doing to protect our air, water, land, and wildlife.   I yield the floor.
