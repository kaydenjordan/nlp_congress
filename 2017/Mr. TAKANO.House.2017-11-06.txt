 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3562 requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to  provide funding for home adaptations for severely disabled veterans  within the Vocational, Rehabilitation, and Employment, or VR&E,  program.   Currently, VA provides severely disabled veterans assistance to lead  a more independent life through the VR&E program, which can include  help with adaptive housing. However, as their name suggests, VR&E  counselors are primarily trained to provide vocational and employment  assistance, and they do not necessarily have the expertise to provide  the best guidance on adaptive housing.   The agents and contractors who are part of VA's Specially Adaptive  Housing program, however, do have this expertise. The SAH program is  specifically geared towards helping severely disabled veterans with  adapting their homes to be equipped for independent living.   Therefore, in order to better serve severely disabled veterans, this  bill authorizes the SAH program to provide assistance to home  adaptations for  [[Page H8504]]  VR&E-eligible veterans. The amount of assistance would be capped at the  same level of funding that is currently provided to SAH-eligible  veterans.    This is a solution that puts the right VA employee in charge of  assisting a disabled veteran to adapt their home. This will also reduce  the workload on VR&E counselors, allowing them to spend more time  helping veterans with employment services.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3562, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1066, the VA Management  Alignment Act of 2017, as introduced by my colleague from Washington,  the most excellent Representative, Derek Kilmer. His advocacy and hard  work on behalf of veterans is commendable.   This bipartisan measure will require the VA Secretary to report to  Congress on the roles, responsibilities, and accountability of  employees within VA.   This oversight is sorely needed. Last Congress, in testimony before  the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the bipartisan co-chairs of the  Commission on Care both highlighted how little attention is paid to the  VA's human resources to ensure the Department is functioning  efficiently. Representative Kilmer's legislation will help lead to a VA  that more effectively meets veterans' needs.   I have enjoyed working with Representative Kilmer to advance this  legislation through committee and truly appreciate his work on this  issue.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Kilmer).                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1066, the VA Management  Alignment Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3122, as amended,  the Veterans Care Financial Protection Act of 2017, and thank the  bill's sponsor, the congressman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright), for  introducing it.   Veterans who served during wartime, and their spouses, may be  eligible to receive pension benefits if they meet certain income and  other eligibility requirements. Such veterans and survivors may also be  eligible for additional financial benefits, known as Aid and  Attendance, if the applicant needs assistance performing personal  functions required in everyday living such as bathing, feeding, and  dressing.   Now, VA does not charge veterans and their families to apply for Aid  and Attendance benefits. In addition, veterans service organizations,  such as The American Legion and VFW, offer free assistance to veterans  and their families who wish to apply for this benefit.   Yet, in all parts of the country, some individuals attempt to charge  fees for helping veterans apply for Aid and Attendance benefits.  According to organizations, such as AARP and the Federal Trade  Commission, senior veterans have increasingly become subject to scams  involving insurance agents and financial planners trying to convince  veterans to make quick decisions about pursuing Aid and Attendance in  addition to their pension incomes. Some scammers use false  representations such as suggesting automatic entitlement to benefits.   Of greater concern, though, are those who help the veteran  restructure financial assets in order to qualify for pension and/or Aid  and Attendance. For example, moving financial assets into a pooled- asset irrevocable trust might render a veteran eligible for pension and  Aid and Attendance, despite having assets in excess of the qualifying  income thresholds.   While it appears that this would benefit the veteran, what these  salesmen do not tell them is that this type of restructuring might  preclude them from Medicaid eligibility because of rules such as a 5- year look-back period, which considers whether one has moved  substantial assets at less than market value.   H.R. 3122, as amended, would require that VA post warnings on its  website about dishonest individuals who would charge fees to this very  vulnerable group of veterans and their families to help beneficiaries  apply for pension with Aid and Attendance benefits.   Now, this bill would also require GAO to submit a report to Congress  on the types of standards used by Federal and State agencies intended  to protect vulnerable populations from financial exploitation, an  analysis of the types of financial exploitation facing veterans who are  eligible for Aid and Attendance benefits, and any other gaps and  efforts to address these issues.   H.R. 3122, the Veterans Care Financial Protection Act, enjoys broad  bipartisan support in the House of Representatives as well as from our  veterans service organizations. I want to also acknowledge the work of  the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Chairman  Mike Bost and Ranking Member Elizabeth Esty for their efforts to  protect veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and again, I  strongly support H.R. 3122, as amended, and urge my colleagues to do  the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3656, as amended, which  resolves an inconsistency in the eligibility for nonveteran spouses and  children receiving memorial headstones. The legislation ensures a  consistent applicability date for memorial headstones and markers for  eligible nonveteran individuals whose remains are not available.   Under current law, a surviving spouse who dies on or after November  11, 1998, is eligible for a headstone or marker. But for dependent  children who pass away, the date of eligibility for a headstone or  marker does not occur until December 22, 2006.   This arbitrary difference causes situations in which VA can provide a  marker for the parent, but not the dependent child. Clearly, this  change would make it easier for surviving family members to make  funeral and burial plans.   H.R. 3656, as amended, is supported by the major veteran service  organizations and enjoys bipartisan support in the House Veterans'  Affairs Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 3656, as amended, and I urge my  colleagues in the House to do the same. I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. Again, I  strongly support H.R. 3656, as amended, and I urge my colleagues to do  the same.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3657, as amended, which would  authorize VA to provide headstones and markers for the graves of  spouses and children of veterans who are buried in Tribal cemeteries.   VA currently provides a headstone or a marker for eligible spouses or  dependent children who are buried or interred in a national, military  post, or State veterans cemetery. However, spouses and dependents are  not eligible for a government-furnished headstone or marker if they are  buried in a private or Tribal cemetery.   H.R. 3657, as amended, would resolve this inequity by ensuring that  veterans' spouses and children who are buried at Tribal veterans  cemeteries are provided government-furnished headstones or markers,  which would be the same treatment family members buried at national and  State veterans cemeteries receive.   H.R. 3657, as amended, enjoys broad, bipartisan support among the  Members of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, and I wish to thank  the bill's sponsor, Representative Bruce Poliquin, for his sponsorship  and the work of the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs  Subcommittee for bringing it to the floor.   Native-American veterans have earned, and deserve, the same rights,  privileges, and honors that other veterans receive. For this reason, I  strongly support H.R. 3657, as amended, and I urge my colleagues to  join me.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.   Again, I strongly support H.R. 3657, as amended, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.   I yield back the balance of my time.
