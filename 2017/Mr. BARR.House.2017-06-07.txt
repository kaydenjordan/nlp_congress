 Mr. Speaker, when former President Obama signed the Dodd- Frank financial control law into law about 7 years ago, supporters  promised that it would repair the economy; they promised that it would  end too big to fail; they promised it would enhance financial stability  and protect consumers. But none of those promises have been kept.   Nearly 9 years after the financial crisis, Americans are still stuck  in the slowest, weakest economic recovery in 70 years. The percentage  of Americans who are actually in the workforce is at its lowest level  since the late 1970s, and we still have not fully reached the potential  of our economic recovery. This is precisely because of the Dodd-Frank  law. The Dodd-Frank law has clogged the plumbing of our economy with an  avalanche of red tape.   Far from ending too big to fail, Dodd-Frank has guaranteed that too- big-to-fail banks will get a taxpayer bailout whenever they go into  distress.   As big banks have gotten bigger as a result of Dodd-Frank, the small  banks, the community banks, the credit unions--the credit providers for  the entrepreneurs, the small businesses, the job creators in this  country--are fewer. That is a huge problem for the dynamism of the  economy, and that is one of the reasons why we haven't seen economic  recovery the way that we should.    Dodd-Frank has made it more difficult for small businesses and  startups to obtain capital to grow, invest, and hire. Before Dodd- Frank, small business lending was more than 150 percent of large bank  lending. Today, due to Dodd-Frank, small bank lending is about 80  percent below that of large bank lending. This is why new business  formation is at a generational low, because small businesses and  startups and entrepreneurs have much more success obtaining capital  from community banks than Wall Street banks.  [[Page H4669]]    Financial services and products have been impaired. Since Dodd-Frank,  the number of banks offering free checking has shrunk from 75 percent  to 37 percent, the ranks of the unbanked have gone up, and one in five  community banks in my home State of Kentucky have disappeared as a  result of Dodd-Frank.   Consumer protection? Hardly. Taking away financial services and  products, eliminating competition and choice from the marketplace,  eliminating free checking, taking away access to credit, that is not  protecting consumers. That is hurting consumers. Dodd-Frank is the  worst bill for consumers that we could possibly have.   We need the Financial CHOICE Act, which will preserve access to  financial services and products and give consumers access to mortgages  and access to financial products like credit cards and overdraft  protection and home equity loans. All of these services and products  are going away because of Dodd-Frank and the busybodies in Washington.   We need to protect consumers. There is nothing wrong with effective  regulation, but this is regulation gone awry. It is unaccountable, it  is not transparent, it is hurting the American consumers, and it is  certainly not adding to financial stability when big banks and Wall  Street are getting bigger and our community banks are going away.                                time  1345
