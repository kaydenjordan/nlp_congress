 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  submit extraneous materials.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As the Dean of California's Republican delegation, it is my honor and  privilege to come to the floor of the people's House to recognize  someone from the Golden State who has made a historic impact on this  institution.   Kevin McCarthy is not from one of California's world-famous cities.  He hails from the blue-collar city of Bakersfield. Kevin is not the son  of politicians or corporate titans. He is the son of a firefighter.   His story is an American story. He is the grandson of an Italian  immigrant. From staffer to Speaker, he has devoted the better part of  his life to the House of Representatives.   In politics, nothing is handed to you. That certainly holds true in  this town and in this building. Kevin's success is the result of hard  work and determination. Kevin is a fighter. Time and time again, he  fought for his constituents, his State, his conference, and his  country.   The first sign of Kevin's go-get-em attitude was when, at the age of  19, he started his own small business selling sandwiches. While  attending college at Cal State Bakersfield, Kevin got interested in  politics, took a job working for our former colleague, former chairman  of the Ways and Means Committee Bill Thomas. For the next 15 years, he  worked as a congressional aid and ultimately served as a district  director for Congressman Thomas.   In 2000, Kevin stepped forward as a candidate for the first time and  was elected as a Kern Community College District trustee. Just a couple  years later, in 2002, he was elected to the California State Assembly.  After just one term in the Assembly, he was chosen to serve as the  minority leader.   Upon retirement of Mr. Thomas, Kevin was elected, in 2006, to follow  in the footsteps of his former boss here in the House. As a freshman,  Kevin was appointed to serve on the Republican Steering Committee.   From those early days in the House until today, Kevin has been a  strong and effective advocate on a number of important issues.   Water is the lifeline of the Central Valley in California. In  California, we have a saying: ``Whiskey is for drinking and water is  for fighting.'' Kevin approached the issue of water with his  characteristic optimism that brought anyone together who wanted to find  real solutions.                                time  1130    California has a proud history of being at the forefront of  aeronautics and space exploration, including the region Kevin has  represented. He has been a champion for recognizing that past and  investing in the future.   Our State is a leader in innovation, and Kevin has always been a  vocal promoter of industries that will shape our economy and America's  competitive edge in the years ahead.   Here in the House, we have seen Kevin answer the call to lead time  and time again--as chief deputy whip, majority whip, majority leader,  minority leader, and then, ultimately, Speaker. Kevin has consistently  led the charge for our Conference and conservative priorities. During  some difficult times, Kevin was always the calm in the storm,  levelheaded and positive.   Republicans would not be in the majority here today without Kevin's  tireless work and leadership. To say he will be missed is an  understatement. Our loss is his wife Judy's gain. I wish his family,  including his son, Connor, and his daughter, Meghan, the very best as  we head into the holidays and the next chapter of his life.   As I mentioned earlier, Kevin is from Bakersfield. He is probably the  second most famous person to hail from Bakersfield. Country music  legend Merle Haggard has had him beat for that top spot. A few years  back, Kevin introduced and passed a bill renaming the Bakersfield post  office in honor of Merle Haggard.   As we join here today to celebrate another son of Bakersfield whose  journey in the House is coming to an end, it seems fitting that Merle  had a song titled ``If We Make It Through December.'' In that song,  Merle sings:       If we make it through December      Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime      Maybe even California      If we make it through December, we'll be fine.    Kevin, I have no doubt that warmer days await. I am grateful for your  service, your friendship, and your leadership. You will continue to  make your mark, and I look forward to the many great things to come.   Until then, farewell, my friend. God bless, and I know I will see you  soon.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Steel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. McClintock).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Obernolte).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota  (Mr. Emmer), the Republican whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Mrs. Kim).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. McHenry).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Duarte).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Valadao).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Kiley).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Hill).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Guam (Mr.  Moylan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. McCarthy), the Speaker Emeritus, for any remarks he may want to  make.    Mr. Speaker, it has been my privilege to lead this  Special Order for the last hour to say good-bye to our friend from the  floor but not from our lives. He will be around.   Finally, I will requote our friend from Bakersfield, California,  Merle Haggard, once again:       If we make it through December      Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime      Maybe even California      If we make it through December, we'll be fine.    Merry Christmas, happy Hanukkah, and I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________
