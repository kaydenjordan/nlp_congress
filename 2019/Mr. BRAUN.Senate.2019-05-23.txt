 Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the talent and  steadfast dedication of Purdue University's All-American Marching Band,  which will be performing for the 100th time at the 103rd Running of the  Indy 500.   Every year, the ``Greatest Spectacle in Racing'' attracts hundreds of  thousands of fans to our State's capital. Throughout the last century,  Purdue University's marching band has become an indispensable part of  the annual festivities with their highly anticipated performance of  traditional Indy 500 songs and other popular hits.   I commend the efforts and hard work put forth by the band's nearly  300 members. Their dedication in rehearsal is sure to pay off when they  take to the famed Indy Motor Speedway this Sunday, welcoming spectators  from around the world with familiar favorites, including the now  customary performance of the classic ``Back Home Again in Indiana.''   I especially commend the Purdue University marching band directors,  past and present, whose work make this tradition possible. This year,  the band will be led by the acclaimed Hoosier, Jay Gephart, professor  of music, and Al Wright, chair director of bands and orchestras at  Purdue University. I am sure that under his direction, the All-American  band will do Indiana proud.   I also recognize Purdue University's first marching band director,  the late Paul Spotts Emrick, who initially forged the relationship  between the University and the speedway. He directed Purdue's first  performance at the famed 500-mile race in 1919, 100 years ago.   I applaud Purdue University's marching band for each year dedicating  themselves to sharing our Hoosier traditions and heritage with millions  of viewers around the world. I extend my thanks to all who ensure that  the tradition endures, and I look forward to another great performance  this weekend from the Boilermakers. Go Boilers.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
