 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to  H.R. 840, the Veterans' Access to Child Care Act.   Let me just first say to my good friend, the ranking member of the  House Veterans' Affairs Committee, I appreciate the opportunity and the  privilege and the responsibility to serve in this Congress on the House  Veterans' Affairs Committee so we can continue to advocate for the  veterans of the Sixth Congressional District of Kentucky and throughout  the Nation.   This amendment would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to  conduct a study on the effects of childcare assistance provided in the  underlying bill on access to healthcare services and compliance with  treatment protocols. While I certainly support the underlying bill,  this amendment is a commonsense measure that would improve the  legislation.   We should always be willing to evaluate and assess whether or not the  policies we enact are actually producing their intended result; and  this amendment, by requiring the Secretary to conduct a study after 1  year of the effects of the childcare assistance on the actual access to  the covered healthcare services and the requirement to report the  findings of that study after 18 months to Congress, will ensure that  the policies we implement are actually successful in increasing  veterans' access to care.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  David P. Roe), the ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the chairman's kind words, and I  appreciate the chairman's support of this amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.
