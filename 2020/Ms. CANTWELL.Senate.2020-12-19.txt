 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute on the next vote and the nomination to be FCC IG.    Mr. President, the FCC is one of the most important  independent agencies that we are counting on for the future of the  information age. When you think about the fact that they regulate  interstate commerce, radio, television, wire, and satellite in all 50  States, it is imperative--imperative--that we have someone as the IG  who understands these policies.   I believe the next era of telecom is going to usher in 5G. I do think  we are going to solve our rural IT problems. I do think we are going to  connect schools. But if we have an IG who does not understand  communication policy, has no experience in communication policy, has  never had a role in that, I say we won't accomplish the mission of  oversight or the mission, ultimately, at the FCC.   It is clear we don't all agree. It is clear we don't all agree. You  got a nominee last week; I didn't spend all my time talking about why  we opposed them. There was no debate.   But when it comes to an IG, we have to get on the same page. We need  an IG we can believe in. So I ask my colleagues to turn down this  nomination and get us someone who has a depth of experience we all can  believe in.
