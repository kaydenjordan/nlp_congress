 Madam Speaker, we have a record-setting surge of illegal  drugs coming in across our southern border, including the very, very  deadly fentanyl, which takes only small amounts to greatly affect many  people, as well as whatever other activities the cartels want to do.   The U.S.-Mexico border is basically unprotected, and it doesn't seem  to be a priority of the Biden administration at all. Please, prove me  wrong.   Yet, the Biden administration is happy to, once again, push the idea  of perhaps shutting down the country over COVID again. Is it because of  the delta variant, or now is it going to be over a new Mexico variant?  But it seems to be coming our way.   Yet, they will not control the border and the flow of illegal  immigrants that might be carrying COVID themselves, whether it is  through the new Mexico variant or not.   So you have to ask, whose side is this administration on with this  open sieve of a border, these drugs coming through, illegal immigrants  coming through, and then putting the clamps down on our own economy and  our own people?                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I appreciate both my colleagues from  Texas and the spirited debate here.   You know, I hadn't intended to talk about the draft there, but Mr.  Roy was bringing that up very vigorously. I have to agree 100 percent  that our volunteer military has worked pretty well for us for  approximately, I think, 40 years.   What is it that would have anybody even institute the idea of draft  for men or women, incredibly, at this point? Is it because our numbers  are down? Is it because we are not getting the people in or is it  somehow some kind of equity?   I am not sure what the mind set is, but if you want to inspire people  to be part of our military, why don't you make it inspiring instead of  a bastion of political correctness and the woke racism conversations  happening everywhere else where even a member of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff is bringing it up and bringing this literature out that is  supposed to make people feel bad about serving as brothers in arms in  the military, you know, because of their race.    If you want to inspire people, don't make them feel bad about  joining. Therefore, you don't even have to talk about draft, because  you could get folks who want an opportunity, whether it is their  dedication to completely serving their country or they see some  opportunities there with the education that can be offered through the  program with the military. Whatever the combination is, you inspire  people to be part of it, just as if you are selling a product anywhere  else in the free market in this country.   Why in the world would we do this political correctness, this  continued race conversation that is driving people away? I don't  understand.    Sure.    It is a pretty clear defined mission what our military  is supposed to be doing in protecting our shores. We have certainly  strayed very far from that. As I mentioned, it is not inspiring the  best, the brightest, the toughest to come in.   I have had some of these conversations with the parents and some of  the people already in the military here. A young man just the other  day, during the 4th of July, of all things, I said, ``What do you think  of what is going on?'' This young man is very, very gravely concerned,  because by far there are a lot of great, great young people there. They  are standing up for their flag, for their country, and they are  wondering what is going on with their leadership.   Indeed, if we want to be at the point of the type of readiness that  is even more acute than ever right now in this world with China, China  is just waiting. China is probably over there laughing at us right now  with what is going on with this administration and the priorities for  our military. Russia is poised to continue to do more aggression in  their zones over there. And let alone an unstable place like Iran and  even North Korea. What is it they can do or be capable of doing? Now  with this pullout in Afghanistan, what are we unleashing there?   We have got to return to a commonsense approach that goes back to  what the true military role and duty and mission is, and we are  drifting far from it.                                time  2150    What I wanted to pick up on, too, as far as when we were talking  about our border, immigration, in general, and this recent topic of  with Cuba.   What do we learn from 60-plus years of oppression under Castro and  those who followed? Maybe everything wasn't beautiful under Batista  back in 1959 or what have you, but they certainly, when they had that  revolution then, I don't think the regular, normal, good people of Cuba  bargained for what they have had at all for the last 60 years.   The way this administration is handling it is almost basically  ignoring it. Look at the people in Cuba who are holding our flag, not  unlike in Hong Kong. It is very interesting. The question the gentleman  posed to my colleague, maybe he wants to pose it again here, but when  we are going in the direction of where Cuba is, where the Communist  Chinese Party is going, we are holding up pictures of Che Guevara. Even  in this Chamber we hear the type of sympathy towards the Castro era. It  is unbelievable to me how this has been allowed to happen.   Well, part of it, I guess, is the American public isn't paying enough  attention. You need to demand more or demand better of who you are  electing and compare this, contrast it with what hasn't worked around  the world under communism for many decades.   So with Cuba, you have a situation where this administration is  ignoring those who are seeking asylum from a Communist regime for years  and years. We have a lot of good Cuban people who have come to this  country years ago--they even trickle in now--colleagues that Mr. Roy  had mentioned here that some were in this Chamber of Cuban descent.  They love this country and see the opportunity here. That is why they  cobble together these boats and rafts. I would like to say they are  made basically made out of milk cartons. They coming toward us.   We don't see these people complaining about this country and its flag  and desecrating its flag cobbling together milk carton rafts and going  toward Cuba for their amazing healthcare system and their amazing  education system that we hear people on other side of the aisle  claiming to be the way to go. So what is it?   What is asylum? When we are granting it to people coming up illegally  from Central America, they are not seeking the true definition of  asylum, they are seeking economic opportunity. Do I blame them? No.  They live in bad conditions down there, but they also see this giant  green light at our border saying: Come on across. Even though the laws  on the books say ``no'' and we have people hired to patrol the border.  Instead, they are being focused more and directed more to be a welcome  wagon at the border. What are we doing?   Asylum is defined: ``The protection granted by a nation to someone  who has left their native country as a political refugee.''   The people who have been trying to and some successfully escaping  Cuba for 60 years are the perfect definition of that. Those are the  ones we should be looking at, and this administration should be looking  at finding a way to help them.   Those in Central America who are coming here for jobs, we have  legislation to work in that direction to have a legal workforce come  here, or those who are already here illegally, find a way to get to  legal status under our rules, under our laws.   But, no, this administration is leaving our border wide open, as was  mentioned. The fentanyl, thousands of pounds, how far would that go?  And where is it landing? The stuff we do catch is significant, but the  stuff that we are not catching up with at the border, where is it  going? Where is it being stockpiled? When is that going to come out?  That is extremely dangerous. Extremely.   I like to think that these freedom fighters, whether it is Hong Kong  or other places who are using our flag as a symbol of freedom and hope,  and the one they want to emulate and get to, whether it is in their  country or maybe even come here, and we are going in the other  direction. It is unbelievable to me when we can't even have our  Olympians respect our flag; we can't have our soccer team; when we  can't have basically the singing of the National Anthem or the  recitation of our flag salute in our schools.   One of the young men I talk about, now in the military, I am really  proud of that young man. I don't have authorization to say his name.  His first name is Grayson. What a great kid. He is going to be a real  doer in our military. He fought to just have his flag salute done at  his high school. It hadn't been done in 40 years, and he had to  overcome a bureaucracy that said: Oh, we don't know. It might offend  somebody. Oh, we haven't asked all of the teachers. We haven't asked  all of the school board.   This young man took it upon himself to petition his fellow students  to get this done. And I said: If they don't get it done, I will be  right there with you at 8:30 in the morning. We will do it right in the  front of the school. Well, they got it done. And I am so proud of him  and what he is going to do. But there are many, many Americans like  that all over this world, serving across the world, living here in this  country that believe in that as well and take that pledge.   Spontaneously, at the baseball game, if they are not going to do the  National Anthem, they spontaneously start it themselves. It is pretty  amazing. At the NHL hockey playoff game in New York, those Islander  fans stood up and joined in with one that was going on, and the singer,  she actually stood down so she could feel that moment. Pretty amazing.  This still exists in the hearts and minds of most Americans in this  country.   We will not allow ourselves to be beaten down by political  correctness, critical race theory, and all of these other things that  aren't really who we are or what is in the hearts of the vast majority  of the people of this country.   When we are talking about our border, it is a sieve, which is a giant  problem. It wasn't a problem nearly as much under President Trump, who  was trying to solve the issue, but also work with those countries and  help solve the issue within. Instead, it was just open season on all of  us, on our taxpayers, our schools, our healthcare system, and even all  of the COVID business that has been manipulated to a degree that  Americans really need to question how much longer they are going to  have their freedoms, as was mentioned by Mr. Roy: vaccine passports  being forced upon us.    In California, they are talking about you can't work in the State as  a State  [[Page H3905]]  employee unless you get the vaccine, or perhaps you can get off the  hook by getting a test every single week.   Where are our liberties? If you are not concerned about our liberties  and our basic freedom, you better wake up right now because you don't  get them back once they have been taken. It is much more difficult to  get them back than what our Founders had laid down and all of those  buried in Arlington--as I drove by in town today--fought to preserve.   We have a job as Americans. I wear this tie and suit. I leave my farm  every week to be a part of it, too, because we can't just sit still  anymore. We all have to be part of this.
