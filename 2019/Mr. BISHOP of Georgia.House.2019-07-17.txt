 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  my constituent and friend of longstanding, Hilton Ray Segler. On July  4, 2019, Hilton, a loving husband, father, and grandfather, passed away  at the age of 82 in Albany, Georgia.   He dedicated his professional life to agriculture. He began in 1957  selling ag chemicals, was co-owner of NIPAN, and later sold crop  insurance. He is most remembered for his leadership in the pecan  industry.   Hilton developed a special interest in pecans and became a leading  State leader and advocate for the pecan industry. He served as  president of the Georgia Pecan Growers Association for two terms. As  president, and a pecan grower himself, he testified before Congress on  behalf of pecan growers for three of the last four farm bills.   Hilton's hard work and desire to better the industry led to many  accomplishments, including crop insurance, ensuring that conservation  and emergency programs were available to pecan growers; and the Market  Access Program, to aid in building the pecan export market. His passion  and leadership will be sorely missed by the industry.   On a personal note, Hilton was my friend. I will miss his sage advice  and his wise counsel. He never told me what I wanted to hear. He always  told me what I needed to hear. The State of Georgia and our Nation have  been truly blessed to benefit from Hilton's leadership and his  advocacy.                            ____________________
