 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4771.   Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank Chairman Hensarling for his  support of this bill, as well as the cosponsors, Mr. Gottheimer and Mr.  Meeks, for making this a bipartisan effort to help community banks.   Economic freedom and personal freedom run hand in hand. In order to  ensure personal freedoms, Americans need access to credit as  individuals, on behalf of their families, and in their businesses. That  is why I am proud to have introduced this bill.   H.R. 4771 is a very simple bill to help small banks and savings and  loan companies get access to the capital they need to make credit  available in their communities. These small banking institutions are  critical to people in the local communities in which they reside. They  support the credit needs of families, small businesses, farmers, and  entrepreneurs.   Community banks are often the principal lending source for many  people, whether they are purchasing a home or starting a business. In  many counties around the Nation, our community banks are the only  banking presence that residents have.   When these community banking institutions are overwhelmed with  regulations and mandates, many of which are meant for larger  institutions, it is the hardworking families and low-income Americans  in those communities that suffer.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is about people. Community banks give people  the credit they need to pursue their dreams, buy a home, buy a car, and  own and grow their businesses. In fact, proximity to a community bank  increases the chance that a new small business will be approved for a  loan that they need to succeed.   By raising the consolidated asset threshold under the Federal  Reserve's Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from $1 billion  to $3 billion in assets, hundreds of additional small banks and thrift  holding companies will qualify for the coverage under the policy  statement and, therefore, be exempt from certain regulatory and capital  guidelines.   These capital standards were originally established for larger  institutions and disproportionately harm small holding companies. Many  holding companies that are above the current threshold face challenges  with regard to capital formation, just when regulators are demanding  higher capital levels.   The exemptions provided in the policy statement make it easier for a  small holding company to raise capital and issue debt. This bill is  about making sure that regulations fit the size of the institution.   Mr. Speaker, a similar effort was passed into law during the 113th  Congress under suspension by the House and by unanimous consent in the  Senate. That bill raised the threshold from $500 million, where it had  been since 1996, to $1 billion.                                time  1130    That legislation also extended the exemption to savings and loan  holding companies. While we are glad that we were able to achieve that  increase, which roughly helped 500 small bank and thrift holding  companies, why wouldn't we extend those benefits further?   H.R. 4771 would bring even more small institutions within the scope  of the policy statement. We have already seen the benefits of the last  increase. One success story we have heard was an instance where 35 bank  holding companies pooled their resources together to issue debt under  the policy statement. That debt was then downstreamed to their  respective banks where the capital was then used to make loans in the  communities they serve, illustrating the great multiplier effect that  the policy statement can produce. H.R. 4771 seeks to extend that  flexibility and success to a greater number of small institutions and  the communities they serve.   Opponents of this increase have alleged that changing the regulatory  threshold would put communities and the Deposit Insurance Fund at  higher risk. But the policy statement contains not one but several  safeguards designed to ensure that the small bank holding companies  that operate with the higher levels of debt permitted under the policy  statement do not present an undue risk to the safety and the soundness  of the subsidiary banks.   Mr. Speaker, to sum it up, this bill is not about supporting banks.  It is about supporting families. It is about supporting communities and  small business. It is about making sure that small-business owners have  access to the credit they need to expand and to thrive.   I recently heard of a businessowner in my community who employs about  30 people. Most of these people that she employs are women who are  trying to take care of their families and make a little bit more so  that they could put some money in their pocket or buy a car. She would  like to expand her business, but it----   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Byrne). The time of the gentlewoman has  expired.    Mr. Speaker, she would like to expand her business to  employ even more people, but she continuously receives red tape, and it  makes it very difficult for her to be able to provide for her  community. This is about families sitting around the kitchen table  imagining the possibilities of renovating their home and the  entrepreneur dreaming of starting a restaurant or being her own boss.   Raising the threshold received strong bipartisan support in the  Financial Services Committee, and I hope that it will receive equal  support in this Chamber.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman for this bill.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I don't know what the  other side wants. They want $5 billion at one point, they want $10  billion at one point, and now they want $3 billion. They just throw it  up against the wall and hope something sticks, and we are saying: Don't  put these community banks at risk.   Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), the vice ranking member of the Financial  Services Committee.
