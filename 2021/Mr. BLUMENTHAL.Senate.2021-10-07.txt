 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we have reached a really important  point in our relationship with one of our great allies in the world.  The United States has before it the challenge--and this Congress can  meet that challenge--for $1 billion of supplemental security assistance  to replenish Israel's Iron Dome system.   That funding is provided in H.R. 5323, the Iron Dome Supplemental  Appropriations Act of 2022, passed by the House of Representatives by  an overwhelming--and I emphasize ``overwhelming''--bipartisan support.   I want to thank my Connecticut colleague Rosa DeLauro of New Haven  for her leadership and all of the Members of the House of  Representatives for their vision and courage in separating this measure  and passing it. And we should do so now, as quickly as possible.   All of us know that the 2016 memorandum of understanding negotiated  between Israel and the United States provides $500 million per year in  security assistance for Israel's missile defense. The MOU allows Israel  to request additional funds to replenish and restore missile defense  capabilities in exceptional circumstances.   We all remember vividly the May 2021 conflict between Israel and  Hamas, and in our minds still vividly and graphically are the pictures  of that Iron Dome system intercepting missiles aimed at civilians in  Israel. The Iron Dome defense system intercepted about 90 percent of  those potentially lethal missiles targeting populated areas of Israel.   In total, about 4,400 rockets were launched by Hamas. Should the Iron  Dome have failed, countless Israeli civilians would have been killed.  This system performed with such extraordinary and exceptional prowess,  showing its necessity for both humanitarian and defensive purposes.   I recently returned from a trip to Israel, where I talked to the top  leadership of the new government, including Prime Minister Naftali  Bennett. I was inspired and excited by the determination of the Israeli  leadership and, I believe, the Israeli people to inaugurate a new era  where we are even closer to Israel than we have been in the past.   There have been some bumps in the road; there have been some  potential disagreements in this body; but we should focus on making  sure that Israel's defense is completely bipartisan; that our  relationship with Israel crosses party lines. We have that opportunity  today to renew the sense of bipartisanship in our unshakeable  relationship with Israel.   And that relationship goes beyond just security concerns. We are  bound by culture, heritage, faith, and a common commitment to  democracy. And Israel has that commitment in perhaps the most  constantly dangerous neighborhood in the world.   Iron Dome is a defensive system. It is solely defensive, and it  defends against the loss of civilians on both sides, in Gaza as well as  Israel, because the loss of life in Israel, if it occurs, if Iron Dome  is lacking, will lead to escalating violence that will cost lives in  Gaza as well.   The Iron Dome prevents escalating hostilities that will cost lives  among both Palestinians and Israelis. So its defensive value is  indisputable, and that is why it does have bipartisan support here. It  has the President's support. He stated:         We're also going to discuss Israel's unwavering--unwavering       commitment that we have in the United States to Israel's       security. And I fully, fully, fully support replenishing       Israel's Iron Dome system.    A quote from his meeting prior to meeting with Prime Minister Bennett  at the White House.   Just 2 days before he made those remarks, Secretary Austin also  expressed his support:         You can also see that commitment as we advocate for the       replenishment of the Iron Dome missile defense system. The       administration is committed to ensuring that Iron Dome can       defend Israeli civilian population centers targeted by       terrorist attacks, and we're working closely with Congress to       provide all the necessary information to respond positively       to your request for the--for $1 billion in emergency funding,       and it's going to save more innocent lives.    I am concerned that Members of the U.S. Senate are blocking passage  of this bill. Senator Paul has demanded that we add unrelated language  to rescind funds from the Department of State and the Department of  Defense before he will agree to a unanimous consent decree. We should  prevent this sacred relationship from becoming a political football. We  should make sure that we preserve it as a bipartisan source of  consensus.   And that is not to say necessarily that we agree with every single  act, every single measure that our Israeli allies take. We can be  friends and family and still disagree.   But our aid should not be conditioned on agreeing with every single  policy or action taken by our Israeli friends. This measure is a  defensive platform that saves lives. It is a humanitarian step that  should be regarded for what it is--essential to our alliance, our  relationship, and our bond with Israel.   Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that, at a time to be determined by the majority leader, following  consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed to the  consideration of Calendar No. 140, H.R. 5323; that there be up to 2  hours of debate; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the bill  be considered read a third time, and the Senate vote on passage of the  bill, without intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, in reserving the right to object,  let's set the record straight.   There is no possibility of this money or any other money going to the  Taliban. Section 9021 of the fiscal year 2021 Defense Appropriations  Act--we all voted for it--makes funding the Taliban illegal, and if any  Pentagon official breaks that law, they could go to jail under the  Antideficiency Act.   Whatever the Secretary of State may have answered to Senator Paul's  question at a hearing, we should know and he should know that spending  money in any way that enables it to go to the Taliban would be breaking  the law, and he would have to come to Congress to use any of that money  to aid the Taliban. So this is a false issue.   The funds that the Paul amendment seeks to rescind have actually not  yet been appropriated. He targets the $3.3 billion in the fiscal year  2022 request. You can't rescind funds that haven't yet been  appropriated. So the amendment falls of its own weight, but I want to  deal with the merits.    No. 1, the Paul amendment seeks to rescind funds from the Department  of Defense's Afghan Security Forces Fund. Those funds are still needed  to complete the withdrawal. They are in an account that is urgently  needed to terminate contracts that are already in place and secure  military equipment that has been withdrawn from Afghanistan.   All of the complaints about the withdrawal and all of the complaints  about the need to secure that military equipment are met by this  funding. Defunding the Pentagon in this way will, in fact, disrupt the  shutdown of these activities and open the United States to legal action  from contractors. I have been advised, for those reasons, that the  Department of Defense strongly opposes the Paul amendment because it  makes ending the war in Afghanistan more difficult.   Let me just close by saying that there is a need for humanitarian  support in areas where the Palestinians live. There is a need for aid  for water treatment and vaccines and health and all of the needs-- humanitarian needs--of the Palestinian people.   One of the encouraging parts of my visit with the Israeli leadership  was their recognition that Israel has a humanitarian obligation in this  area. They recognize, as well, that we may not always agree on every  facet of our relationship, but this measure should be unconditional  because it is defensive, and it is humanitarian to support the Iron  Dome.   I wish my Republican colleagues were here to refute Senator Paul,  because I know many of them support it.   Therefore, I will not modify my request.    I would just close, Mr. President, by saying we need  to pass this measure. We need to do it now, and there is no need for  pay-for. We should move ahead with this unanimous consent. I regret the  objection.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Michael  Jones, a fellow in my office, be granted floor privileges for the  remainder of the year so he can participate in the National Defense  Authorization Act consideration.
