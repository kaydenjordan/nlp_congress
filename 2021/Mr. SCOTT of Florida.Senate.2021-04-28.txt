 Madam President, Americans are worried about  inflation. New polling shows that 87 percent of Americans are concerned  about the rising costs of household items, like diapers and gas and  groceries. That is up from 77 percent just last month. They have good  reason to feel that way. Right now, reports show that a third of  American households making less than $50,000 in annual income are  buying less because of increasing prices, and more than one-quarter of  all households report that rising prices on goods are causing them to  purchase less.   Just this month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that, over  the last 12 months, food prices have gone up, and gas prices have risen  23 percent. That means, since Biden was elected, gas prices have  increased about 70 cents per gallon across the Nation. Year over year,  consumer prices increased 2.6 percent in March. That is up from an  annual 1.7 percent increase in February. This is all in addition to  statements from some of America's largest corporations, like Procter &  Gamble and Kimberly-Clark, which recently announced that they are  increasing prices on a number of their products. That includes  essential household goods, like toilet paper and diapers.   The evidence of inflation is right in front of us. Just look at these  numbers that show the percentage change in average unit prices versus  last year: groceries up 2.6 percent; household goods up 5.2 percent;  baby care up 7 percent; general merchandise up 7.1 percent. Wages never  go up this fast. So who does it hurt? It hurts the poorest and those on  fixed incomes.   Businesses are also expecting price increases to continue.   According to data from FactSet, 47 S&P companies have mentioned  inflation on their earnings calls for Q1 2021. That is more than during  any other quarter in the last 10 years.   On its most recent earnings call, Procter & Gamble's chief financial  officer, Andre Schulten, said:         The commodity cost challenges we face this year will,       obviously, be larger next fiscal year.    Who gets hurt the most when inflation rises? Not the rich. It is  working families, especially those on low and fixed incomes.   I grew up poor and watched my parents struggle to put food on the  table. I know just how much a slight rise in prices can hurt a family,  because I saw it while I was growing up, and that is what is happening  right now across our Nation.   We know that those in the Biden administration are worried about  this. They know that rising costs caused by their massive spending are  bad for Americans, but they won't say it. While they are reportedly  worrying in private about the effects of their spending plans, they  have had a different message in public.   On April 13, the New York Times reported that officials and aides at  the White House and the Department of the Treasury have been holding  private meetings for months to discuss inflation and have conducted  indepth internal analyses for senior officials and President Biden.   The article goes on to read:   [[Page S2279]]              Mr. Biden's aides are sufficiently worried about the risk       of that spending fueling inflation that they shaped his       infrastructure proposal, which has yet to be taken up by       Congress, to funnel out $2.3 trillion over eight years, which       is slower than traditional stimulus.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record this New York Times article, dated April 13, 2021   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, Apr. 13, 2021]        The Biden Administration Is Quietly Obsessing Over Inflation                            (By Jim Tankersley)         Washington.--Even before President Biden took office, some       of his closest aides were focused on a question that risked       derailing his economic agenda: Would his plans for a $1.9       trillion economic rescue package and additional government       spending overheat the economy and fuel runaway inflation?        To find the answer, a close circle of advisers now working       at the White House and the Treasury Department projected the       behaviors of shoppers, employers, stock traders and others if       Mr. Biden's plans succeeded. Officials as senior as Janet L.       Yellen, the Treasury secretary, pored over the analyses in       video calls and in-person meetings, looking for any hint that       Mr. Biden's plans could generate sustained price increases       that could hamstring family budgets. It never appeared.        Those efforts convinced Mr. Biden's team that there is       little risk of inflation spiraling out of the Federal       Reserve's control--an outcome that Wall Street analysts, a       few prominent Republicans and even liberal economists like       Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary, have said       could flow from the trillions being pumped into the economy.        Traditional readings of price increases are beginning to       turn upward as the recovery accelerates. On Tuesday, the       Consumer Price Index rose 0.6 percent, its fastest monthly       increase in more than a decade, while a less volatile index       excluding food and energy rose a more muted 0.3 percent.        But Mr. Biden's advisers believe any price spike is likely       to be temporary and not harmful, essentially a one-time event       stemming from the unique nature of a pandemic recession that       ruptured supply chains and continues to depress activity in       key economic sectors like restaurant dining and tourism.        The administration's view mirrors the posture of top       officials at the Fed, including its chairman, Jerome H.       Powell, whose mandate includes maintaining price stability in       the economy. Mr. Powell has said that the Fed expects any       short-term price pops to be temporary, not sustained, and not       the type of uptick that would prompt the central bank to       raise interest rates rapidly--or anytime soon.        ``What we see is relatively modest increases in       inflation,'' Mr. Powell said in March. ``But those are not       permanent things.''        Armed with their internal data and conclusions,       administration officials have begun to push back on warnings       that a stimulus-fueled surge in consumer spending could       revive a 1970s-style escalation in wages and prices that       could cripple the economy in the years to come.        Yet they remain wary of the inflation threat and have       devised the next wave of Mr. Biden's spending plans, a $2.3       trillion infrastructure package, to dispense money gradually       enough not to stoke further price increases right away.       Administration officials also continue to check on real-time       measures of prices across the economy, multiple times a day.        ``We think the likeliest outlook over the next several       months is for inflation to rise modestly,'' two officials at       Mr. Biden's Council of Economic Advisers, Jared Bernstein and       Ernie Tedeschi, wrote on Monda in a blog post outlining some       of the administration's thinking. ``We will, however,       carefully monitor both actual price changes and inflation       expectations for any signs of unexpected price pressures that       might arise as America leaves the pandemic behind and enters       the next economic expansion.''        Some Republicans call that posture dangerous. Senator Rick       Scott of Florida, the chairman of his party's campaign arm       for the 2022 midterm elections, has called on Mr. Biden and       Mr. Powell to present plans to fight inflation now.        ``The president's refusal to address this critical issue       has a direct negative effect on Floridians and families       across our nation, and hurts low- and fixed-income Americans       the most,'' Mr. Scott said in a news release last week.       ``It's time for Biden to wake up from his liberal dream and       realize that reckless spending has consequences, inflation is       real and America's debt crisis is growing. Inflation is       rising and Americans deserve answers from Biden now.''        Economic teams in recent administrations spent little time       worrying about inflation, because inflationary pressures have       been tame for decades. It has fallen short of the Fed's       average target of 2 percent for 10 of the last 12 years,       topping out at 2.5 percent in the midst of the longest       economic expansion in history.        Shortly before the pandemic recession hit the United States       in 2020, President Donald J. Trump's economic team wrote that       ``price inflation remains low and stable'' even with       unemployment below 4 percent. As the economy struggled to       climb out from the 2008 financial crisis under President       Barack Obama, White House aides feared that prices might       fall, instead of rise.        ``Given the economic crisis, we worried about preventing       deflation rather than inflation,'' said Austan Goolsbee, a       chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during Mr.       Obama's first term.        The conversation has changed given the large amounts of       money that the federal government is channeling into the       economy, first under Mr. Trump and now under Mr. Biden. Since       the pandemic took hold, Congress has approved more than $5       trillion in spending, including direct checks to individuals.        Mr. Biden's aides are sufficiently worried about the risk       of that spending fueling inflation that they shaped his       infrastructure proposal, which has yet to be taken up by       Congress, to funnel out $2.3 trillion over the course of       eight years, which is slower than traditional stimulus.        Even before Mr. Summers and others raised economic concerns       about Mr. Biden's $1.9 trillion relief bill, officials were       wrestling with their own worries about its inflation risks.       They had internally concluded, with direction from Mr. Biden,       that the biggest risk to the economy was going ``too small''       on the aid package--not spending enough to help vulnerable       Americans survive continued stints of joblessness or lost       income. But they wanted to know the risks of going ``too       big.''        They tested whether an uptick in inflation might cause       people and financial markets to expect rapid price increases       in the years to come, upending decades of what economists       call ``well-anchored'' expectations for prices and       potentially creating a situation where higher expectations       led to higher inflation. They estimated the odds that the Fed       would react to such moves by quickly and steeply raising       interest rates, potentially slamming the brakes on growth and       causing another recession.        The informal group that initially gathered to research       those questions included Mr. Bernstein, a member of the       Council of Economic Advisers; David Kamin, a deputy director       of the National Economic Council; Michael Pyle, Vice       President Kamala Harris's chief economic adviser; and two       Treasury officials, Nellie Liang and Ben Harris. More members       have joined over time, including Mr. Tedeschi.        The group reports regularly to Ms. Yellen and other senior       officials including Brian Deese, who heads the N.E.C., and       Cecilia Rouse, who leads the C.E.A. Its work has informed       economic briefings of Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris.        ``The president and the vice president, their job is to       deliver good economic outcomes for the American people,'' Mr.       Pyle said in an interview. ``Part of what delivering strong       economic outcomes to the American people means is ensuring       that their team is fully on top of both the tailwinds to the       U.S. economy but also the risks that are out there. And this       is one of them.''        Mr. Pyle and his colleagues looked at financial market       measures of inflation expectations, including one called the       five-year, five-year forward, which currently shows investors       expecting lower inflation levels over the next several years       than they expected in 2018.        At the same time, officials at the Treasury's Office of       Economic Policy conducted a series of modeling exercises to       ``stress test'' the virus relief package and how it might       change those price and expectation measures if put in place.       They considered scenarios where consumers quickly spent their       aid money, which included $1,400 checks, or where they did       not spend much of it at all right away. They talked with       large banks about trends in customers' cash balances and how       quickly people were returning to the work force. Ms. Yellen,       a former Fed chair, helped adjust the models herself.        The exercises produced a wide range of possibilities for       inflation. But they never suggested it would rise so rapidly       that the Fed could not easily handle it by adjusting interest       rates or other monetary policy tools. They saw no risk of a       sharp return to recession--and no reason to pull back from       spending proposals that administration officials believe will       help the economy heal faster and help historically       disadvantaged groups, like Black and Hispanic workers, regain       jobs and income.        ``We're going to see some heat in this economy,'' Mr. Pyle       said. ``That heat is going to be good and redound to the       benefit of wages and labor market conditions overall and       particularly for a number of communities that have been at       the margins of the labor market for too long.''        If the data proves that forecast wrong, officials say       privately, they will be quick to adapt. But they will not say       how. If inflation were to accelerate in a sustained and       surprising way, some officials suggest, the administration       would trust the Fed to step in to contain it.        There is no plan, as of yet, for Mr. Biden to consider       inflation-fighting actions of his own.    The content and conclusions of these meetings  and working groups have not been disclosed or been made available to  the public.   While privately worrying about the same issue I have been sounding  the  [[Page S2280]]  alarm on for months, the Biden administration continues to mislead the  American public and ignore the threat of inflation.   Over the last 2 months, I have asked the National Economic Council  about its plans to fight inflation and protect American families.   I have written a Federal Reserve member, asked him what can be done  to help families who are seeing skyrocketing gas prices and increasing  mortgage rates.   I have called on President Biden and Federal Reserve Chair Powell to  lay out their clear plan to address inflation and rising prices that  threaten American families. I have yet to get a straightforward or  acceptable response. I have yet to hear them acknowledge this very real  threat or propose a solution to protect families.   So today Senator Braun and I are making a simple request that the  Biden administration share with the Senate all of its notes, memos, and  reports regarding their discussions and plans to mitigate and prevent  growing inflation.   Inflation is a very real threat to the well-being of already  struggling families, and the last thing American families need is to be  misled by this administration.   Right now, Democrats in Washington are living in a fantasyland where  debt doesn't matter, spending has no consequences, inflation is  impossible.   But the reality is that inflation does have consequences, and it is  the duty of everyone here, especially the President of the United  States, to be open and transparent with the American people about what  is happening with inflation.   There is no reason the Biden administration should be hiding this  information. Americans deserve to know the consequences of massive  government spending, and they deserve leadership that will show some  fiscal responsibility when it comes to their taxpayer dollars.   I look forward to all my colleagues supporting this effort to  increase transparency.   Madam President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 185,  submitted earlier today. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be  agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, the decision by my colleague  to block this resolution is clearly disappointing.   Let's remember what this was about. This was about transparency. They  just blocked the Senate from requesting basic information that is going  to help all Americans.   And just look at these numbers again. Just in the last 4 months,  grocery prices are up 2.6 percent; household care is up 5.2 percent;  baby care is  [[Page S2281]]  up 7 percent; general merchandise up 7.1 percent. We are clearly seeing  inflation.   Senate Democrats just objected to transparency. That means they are  against getting the facts, against ensuring accountability, and against  getting the American people the information they need to make smart  decisions as prices keep rising.   Eighty-seven percent of Americans are worried about the rising costs  of goods. Apparently, so is the White House. So don't the American  people deserve the same information about what is happening with the  economy?   Floridians deserve to know the truth about inflation and so do the  people of Ohio. Why does my colleague want to keep them in the dark?   This administration is telling the American people one thing but  saying something else behind closed doors. That is wrong.   The American people deserve the truth. Inflation is real. It is  happening. It is hurting American families. It is time President Biden  does something about it, and I am extremely disappointed my colleague  is actually today helping the President mislead the American people.   I yield the floor.
