 Mr. Speaker, it has been 8 years. For 8 years, from the  day Barack Obama was sworn in until the day he left office, I heard my  Republican colleagues telling me that we weren't paying enough  attention to the national debt, that we were mortgaging our children's  future, and that we needed to do more to get our debt and deficit under  control. Heck, to be honest with you, I agreed with what they were  saying.   But now that they are in power--control the Presidency and both  Chambers--what are they doing?   Totally ignoring the debt deficit is what they are doing.   Worst yet, actually, the budget of theirs that has just come out adds  $1.5 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. This is their  stated strategy in the budget. This is $1.5 trillion our children and  grandchildren need to pay back. I just can't believe it. The hypocrisy  is beyond belief.   Apparently, my Republican colleagues are only fiscally conservative  when the Democrats are in control.   Let's reject this unconscionable budget and work across the aisle for  tax reform that actually improves our children's future.                            ____________________
