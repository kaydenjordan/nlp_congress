 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I rise  today in opposition to S. 251, legislation that would ban transgender  women and girls from participating in sports consistent with their  gender.   My Republican colleagues falsely claim that allowing transgender  women and girls to play sports is harmful to cisgender women and girls.  They continue to hurl insulting lies about transgender girls dominating  sports, but what is true is that these bans are deeply harmful to  transgender girls, particularly transgender girls of color, girls who  are gender-nonconforming or born with intersex traits, as well as  cisgender girls.   These sex tests invade every girl's privacy and open the door to  harass anyone who is perceived as different.   If my Republican colleagues were actually worried about women and  girls in athletics, they would join in our efforts to address unequal  athletic opportunities in school, unequal pay, sexual abuse and  harassment, and more. But this isn't about supporting women and girls;  this is about discrimination.   Earlier today, I stood in Statuary Hall as we unveiled the portrait  of the late Congresswoman Patsy T. Mink on today's 50th anniversary of  title IX becoming law. Title IX, which was renamed the Patsy T. Mink  Equal Opportunity in Education Act, says:         No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex,       be excluded from participating in, be denied the benefit of,       or be subjected to discrimination under any education program       or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.    Thirty-seven words that are just as relevant today as they were 50  years ago.   Patsy fought for equal opportunities for all, and this bill stands in  direct opposition to her work. And to listen to my colleague talking  about title IX as being that act that is going to support his bill, I  can tell you, as someone who knew and was friends with Patsy T. Mink,  she would be standing right next to me to say that title IX in no way  or shape supports what my colleague is attempting to do.   Republicans have the wrong priorities. We shouldn't be banning anyone  from playing sports; we should be fighting the discrimination that all  women and girls continue to face in athletics, in the classroom, and in  workplaces.   I am proud to stand up and oppose this harmful legislation and  continue to advance Patsy Mink's legacy of equal opportunities for all.   Mr. President, for these reasons, I object.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, the  Kaena Point National Heritage Area Act. This bill requires the  Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study to assess the suitability  and feasibility of designating certain land in Hawaii as the Kaena  Point National Heritage Area. Such a designation would bring Federal  resources to bear on elevating public awareness of Kaena Point through  increased interpretation and enhanced management activities to protect  resources, both cultural and natural, for future generations.   The National Park Service currently oversees 55 National Heritage  Areas across the country, none of which are in Hawaii. Kaena Point,  located on the westernmost tip of Oahu, is home to some of the last  remaining unimproved semiwilderness areas on Oahu and one of the last  intact dune ecosystems in Hawaii. Native species such as critically  endangered Hawaiian monk seals, humpback whales, spinner dolphins, and  green sea turtles can be found in the waters at Kaena Point. Native  shorebirds such as albatrosses and shearwaters also frequent Kaena  Point to nest. In addition, the area is one of the last remaining  examples of intact coastal strand vegetation on Oahu and is home to a  number of endangered plant species and the endangered yellow-faced bee.   Kaena Point is significant to Native Hawaiian culture, being deemed  one of the most sacred places on Oahu as it is home to numerous  cultural and historic sites. The area currently includes a State park  and a Natural Area Reserve, both operated by the Hawaii Department of  Land and Natural Resources. Kaena State Park is the second most visited  park on Oahu, illustrating the significance of the area.   This bill directs the U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary to  conduct a study in consultation with State and local historic  preservation officers, State and local historical societies, State and  local tourism offices, and other appropriate organizations and  governmental agencies. This study would, among other things, assess the  area's unique cultural, historic, and natural resources, cultural  contributions to the story of the United States,  [[Page S3163]]  ability to provide recreation and educational opportunities, resources  available for interpretation by visitors, inclusion of local  stakeholders supportive of and involved with the planning of the  Heritage Area, existence of a local management entity willing to work  with these stakeholders to develop the Heritage Area, and include a map  identifying the boundaries of the Heritage Area.   The Secretary of the Interior is given 3 years to conduct the study  and report the results to Congress. Information from that report will  then indicate if Kaena Point is a suitable location to be added as a  National Heritage Area and if so, the boundaries for such a  designation. This bill is supported by the Hawaii Department of Land  and Natural Resources.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. King):   S. 4478. A bill to provide for assistance to improve the resilience  of historic light stations, to study the long-term protection needs of  historic light stations, and to establish a national database of  historic light stations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Environment and Public Works.
