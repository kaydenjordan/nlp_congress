 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a law  enforcement official who was recently named Police Chief of Newtown  Township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.   Earlier this month, Newtown Township's Board of Supervisors  unanimously supported Philadelphia Police Department Captain John Hearn  to become the next police chief. John, a Northampton Township resident,  is a 29-year veteran of the Philadelphia Police Department. He  previously served as a lieutenant in that department's highway patrol,  helping to escort dignitaries such as Pope Francis and former  Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush.   Throughout his esteemed career, John distinguished himself as an  innovative leader. He represented Philadelphia when five neighboring  counties established protocol and a coordinated response to terrorist  threats, and he served as a volunteer with fire companies in Montgomery  County.   Mr. Speaker, we congratulate John on his new role, and I look forward  to working closely with him to keep our Bucks County families safe.           Recognizing Officers Megan Klosterman and Gina Ferzetti     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize members of  our law enforcement community who recently joined our Bucks County  family as members of the Solebury Township Police Department.   Earlier this month, Officers Megan Klosterman and Gina Ferzetti were  sworn in by Magisterial District Judge Maggie Snow as the department's  first full-time female officers.   Officer Klosterman is a graduate of Upper Dublin High School and  Pennsylvania State University. Officer Ferzetti is a graduate of Ridley  High School and previously served with the Temple University Police  Department. Both of these dedicated public servants served as part-time  members of Solebury Township Police Department prior to their full  instatement.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud Officers Klosterman and Ferzetti on their  promotions and their dedication to keeping all of our families safe in  our community. Their hiring is truly an inspiring moment for Solebury  Township and for Bucks County.   I would also like to thank Police Chief Dominick Bellizzie and  Township Manager Dennis Carney for their leadership.                          Recognizing Julie Uchitel     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a student  from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who was recently awarded a coveted  scholarship to study in the United Kingdom.   Julie Uchitel, a resident of Upper Southampton, was selected to  receive a Marshall Scholarship, one of only 40 recipients out of over  1,000 applicants. Julie is a senior at Duke University where she is a  neuroscience and French double major. She is the president of the  Neuroscience Majors' Union at Duke and has conducted clinical and basic  pediatric research at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Duke  Children's Hospital. She is the author of two published articles and  has volunteered in Paris and in Honduras to offer medical assistance to  those in need.   Mr. Speaker, Julie's resume is too voluminous to summarize. We are so  proud to have her as part of our community, and we wish her all the  best as she pursues her studies at Cambridge and King's College in  London. I look forward to seeing all of her accomplishments in the  years to come.                            ____________________
