 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 150 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 150         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 998) to provide for the establishment of a       process for the review of rules and sets of rules, and for       other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. No       amendment to the bill shall be in order except those printed       in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution. Each such amendment may be offered only in the       order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question in the House or in       the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 83) disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of       Labor relating to ``Clarification of Employer's Continuing       Obligation to Make and Maintain an Accurate Record of Each       Recordable Injury and Illness''. All points of order against       consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The joint       resolution shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the joint resolution are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the joint       resolution and on any amendment thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Education and the       Workforce; and (2) one motion to recommit.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for  1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Hastings), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.

General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on House Resolution 150, currently  under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward  this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule provides for  consideration of H.R. 998, the SCRUB Act, and H.J. Res. 83, a  resolution disapproving a Department of Labor rule relating to employee  recordkeeping.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate for each piece of legislation,  equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the  Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the  [[Page H1364]]  chairman and ranking member of the Education and the Workforce  Committee. The rule also provides for a motion to recommit for both  pieces of underlying legislation. Additionally, the rule makes in order  12 amendments--11 from our friends across the aisle--to the SCRUB Act.   Yesterday, the Rules Committee had the opportunity to hear from  Chairman Chaffetz and Congressman Cartwright on behalf of the Oversight  and Government Reform Committee, and Congressmen Byrne and Courtney on  behalf of the Education and the Workforce Committee.   Both pieces of legislation before us today take steps to remove  unnecessary burdens that the government has levied on hardworking  Americans from coast to coast. The regulatory burden in this country is  staggering. In fact, the Code of Federal Regulations spans more than  178,000 pages and contains more than 1 million regulatory restrictions.   Let's let that sink in for just a moment, Mr. Speaker. Let's think  about that for a second. 178,000 pages and over 1 million regulatory  restrictions. An average of nearly 12,000 new restrictions are added  each year.   Let me be clear. Some regulations are necessary. They are completely  what we need to have. I don't believe that all regulation is bad. So  before we go down that path, let me just say that this is a fact, and  we can continue this.   I believe we need clean air, clean water, smart standards for how we  handle nuclear energy, and worker protections, just to name a few. I  also believe that we have allowed the regulatory scheme to run amok.  Congress has ceded power to agencies, which have implemented more and  more regulations, oftentimes with less and less benefit to Americans.   Far too many regulations offer our citizens minimal benefits at  confounding cost. Taxpayers and businesses alike are withering under  regulations that are outdated, irrelevant, and nonsensical.   Do we really need a regulation to mandate what kind of latch a baker  uses on a flour bin? Do we really want to tell people that their  dishwashers are forbidden to use enough water to actually clean their  dishes, forcing them to wash their dishes twice rather than it actually  conserving water?   Unfortunately, these stories aren't works of fiction. They are real  regulations put in place by Federal agencies. We have to take steps to  restore common sense to the regulatory process and clean up the  regulation roster.   It is time we identify and abolish those regulations that are  pointless, those that prevent people from doing their jobs, and those  that are inefficient and ineffective. The SCRUB Act, Mr. Speaker, takes  steps to do just that and contributes to our efforts to rein in  overregulation.   The SCRUB Act, introduced by my friend from Missouri, Congressman  Jason Smith, establishes a bipartisan Retrospective Regulatory Review  Commission to identify unnecessary rules that are hindering economic  growth. The commission will then identify which rules need to be  repealed immediately and which ones can be addressed by more flexible  procedures outlined in the legislation.   The commission will report these findings to Congress, and Congress  can then vote on these recommendations and take steps either to begin  immediately repealing regulations or implementing a CutGo process.   Importantly, the commission created by the SCRUB Act will also ensure  that redundant regulations from different agencies will be reviewed.  Currently, agencies implement their directives absent a systemwide  view, meaning that overlapping and even conflicting regulations are  enacted far too often.   From conversations with my constituents in northeast Georgia, I have  witnessed how overregulation is stifling growth in our communities. The  remedy for this economic anemia is to get unnecessary regulations off  the books and, instead, focus on enforcing regulations that are  actually achieving benefits for our neighbors.   The second piece of legislation that this rule provides for also  returns us to reasonable policies that reinstate the spirit of the law.  H.J. Res. 83, introduced by my fellow Rules Committee member,  Congressman Byrne from Alabama, utilizes the Congressional Review Act  to overturn a rule from the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration, or OSHA.   Worker protections are critically important, yet they lose their  purpose when they fail to protect workers and jobs effectively. Too  often, OSHA forgets that mission, and the rule we are talking about  today is the latest example of misguided regulatory zeal.   In the waning days of the previous administration, OSHA put forth a  final rule implementing punitive standards on employers, a move that  contradicts the underlying statute. Under the law, employers are  required to record and maintain logs of workplace injuries and  illnesses that occur during a 5-year period; however, the employers can  only be cited for recordkeeping violations within a 6-month time  period.    Now, think about what was just said here. They have to keep it for 5  years, but they can only be cited for violations within a 6-month time  period.   This arrangement is constructive. Logs should be kept up to date so  that businesses can make informed decisions about health and safety in  the workplace. This requirement encourages businesses to improve safety  measures in a timely manner. However, the previous administration  decided to rewrite the law through regulation in a way that penalizes  and burdens small businesses without achieving meaningful benefit. OSHA  finalized a rule that would extend the threat of penalty for  recordkeeping violations up to 5 years.   Aside from ignoring existing law and court decisions that directly  contradict this new regulation, OSHA has chosen to punish small  businesses for paperwork violations rather than focusing resources on  improving worker safety.   We can agree that keeping our workplaces safe is nonnegotiable, but  OSHA has repeatedly overstepped its mission in order to collect fines  and apply oppressive rules at the expense of opportunities to cultivate  healthier working conditions. It is time to bring this regulatory  mischief to an end, which is why I am glad to see this resolution of  disapproval to overturn the most recent OSHA overstep.   Mr. Speaker, both the SCRUB Act and the resolution of disapproval  provided for by this rule take commonsense steps to unlock the  regulatory shackles Federal agencies have put on our economy and  taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I enjoy coming down here. I love being a part of  debating and coming here to the floor. My friend from Florida and I do  that quite regularly in the Committee on Rules, and it is a good thing.  He has brought up a lot of bills over the last month. He listed out a  list of horribles that was all discussed on this floor. I would  encourage everyone to go back and look at the other side, as Paul  Harvey used to say, and the rest of the story. So for all the list of  horribles, Mr. Speaker, we also need to balance on the votes that were  cast on this floor and the debate had on this floor was not a one-sided  affair. It was two, and the applicants were going.   The other thing that just struck me, Mr. Speaker, was this,  especially dealing with the CRA, the records. It was interesting to see  that this was a carefully thought-out proposal. It was not a carefully  thought-out proposal. It was a reaction to a 2012 court case, the Volks  case, in which the three D.C. Appellate Court judges, including  Henderson, Brown, and Garland, said: OSHA, you can't do this, you can't  go back and maintain the records and then only be able--what the law  actually says is, punish within 6 months of this.   So this is not long and thought out. It was a way, as was established  in the Volks case, actually the case said: ``We do not believe  Congress''--these were the judges speaking--``expressly established a  statute of limitations only to implicitly encourage the Secretary to  ignore it.''   So this goes back to the heart, Mr. Speaker. If we are wanting to  discuss the face of a Republican majority that is listening to the  Constitution and the American people saying we need relief from some of  these regulatory burdens in which good people--I will never not state  that good people work in these agencies, but when you give good people  a job, and you tell them to go do something and to sit in their  cubicles or sit in their offices and say how can I come up with more  regulatory, they are going to do it. Americans are the best workers in  the world. They are going to use their talents.   The problem is when you put them in a position in which many times  their talents do not equal what is happening in the real world. Mr.  Speaker, you have seen that in your State. I have seen that in my  State. In fact, we have seen it in Florida, as well, and other States.  It is simply bringing us back to commonsense reasoning in this in  saying why, when you cannot by law punish this, why are you keeping it?   The court actually also made an interesting statement as well in  this, and in one of the footnotes it said: ``That OSHA did not cite  Volks for a failure to retain injury records when that is the only  conduct for which the statute of limitations would not have clearly  expired suggests that OSHA had, at some point, correctly understood  that an unmade record cannot be said to have not been retained and that  an employer's obligations with respect to making and keeping records  are distinct.''   The idea that you are somehow going to harm recordkeeping here--which  is a separate violation, by the way, which has nothing to do with the  keeping of the records 5 years, let's at least get this process  straight here. If you do not, as an employer, record workplace injuries  and record these incidents, you are in an issue there. You are  violating the law there. So let's look at this.  [[Page H1366]]  OSHA has a great place. It should be the teaching arm. It should be the  encouraging arm for every employer to look to for best practices and  standards on how to do what I believe every employer here inherently  gets up every morning wanting to do. They do not want to have a  workforce that is hurt, maimed, or put at risk in their jobs every day.   Instead, OSHA has morphed, over time, and this body is partially to  blame. It has morphed into something that, frankly, has left its  Occupational Safety and Health Administration. It has become punitive.  It has become a way of not being helpful, but yet actually hurtful in  the marketplace.   So as we look at this, as we talk about this--and I appreciate my  friend from Florida, and he makes a good case for his side--I am going  to simply make the case for our side that when you look at regulatory  burdens that shouldn't be there, when you are looking at it, as we just  talked about, where every regulatory burden does not come down to clean  air and clean water. Every regulatory burden we talk about does not  come down to clean water, clean air, or working on airplanes or  anything else. There are some that just simply are in the way in  business. Like I mentioned earlier in my talk concerning how the  linchpin on a baker's can actually should work. Really, Mr. Speaker?   So in this issue, let's continue to move how we are, let's continue  to put forward commonsense regulations. We can disagree, and that is  why that vote total on that board will show up in just a little while.  But at the end of the day, who is on your side? It is the Republican  majority who says: let's get to work safely, helpful, let's make sure  everybody has the opportunity to continue to do what they intended to  do, but do so in a sense that makes sense and doesn't continue to be  punitive.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   As my friend from Florida just said, I think we can sum it up very  easily right here on this discussion. And, no, I did not choose not to  continue the other quotes in the ruling which were, again, pretty  amazing. I will just say  [[Page H1367]]  this. The reason is because I was saving it for now.   They said: Well, you can go ahead and do a new regulation you can  make them keep for 5 years. But as an Old Scripture taught me years  ago: all things may be lawful, but not all things are profitable. You  can do some things, but, in the end, are they really getting at the end  result of what OSHA is supposed to do? Are you protecting employers and  employees? Are you making the workplace safer? And right here, we are  just not seeing that.   I think what is also interesting as we look at this is let's just  have common sense in this. You still cannot punish up to 6 months. The  court actually even said also, as well, as much the same on page 13 of  their opinion.   I think what we have to look at here is, in looking at this, let's  talk about the issues of common sense; let's talk about regulatory  burden that works instead of regulatory burden that does not.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   As we come to the close of this time of rule debate, I think we have  laid this out. I think, again, it is very clear, Mr. Speaker, what we  determine and what we go forward with in the process.   As we move forward, it is interesting to me--and I would be, too, if  I were in the minority and didn't really have a plan except the one  that has been tearing up the health insurance market, that has been  hurting others. And now as we look to actually make movement on a  replacement and repeal of that, I would say that I would watch for  divisions. I would watch for cracks and the fissures. I would do  whatever I could.   But the truth of the matter is that, over the next month, in this  body, we are going to move forward with what we have said we are going  to do. We are going to be working on those aspects. We are going to be  bringing it to the floor, and the American people can make the judgment  for themselves.   People will continue to discuss. It is healthy in our country to have  that discussion. It is healthy that we move forward. It is also healthy  we examine all of the facts.   This rule today, though, simply deals with common sense. Let's look  at our regulatory burden. Let's look at issues that--again, it is one  thing to look at a rule that is there for protection. Workplace safety  is enhanced by making you record what is going on and making you be  able to then correct what may be a problem in your business. But simply  keeping records for 5 years when you can't be punished but for 6 months  of those is simply putting a burden on business to keep records that  are really at the end of the day not accomplishing your bottom line.   It goes back to what I said earlier, Mr. Speaker. I believe that OSHA  is a valuable organization when doing what it is supposed to be doing:  protecting workplace safety, doing things that actually matter, doing  things that actually help. But many times in my businesses that I go  to, they have put in rules over the years that say that we are now in a  continuing violation.   In other words, if one time they come in and they say that an  electrical outlet is not plugged in properly to an extension cord, you  fix that. When they come back 2 or 3 months later and see something on  the other side of the building that deals with electrical, then they  will say, well, it is a continuing violation, not the violation  previous, and they triple the fines.   OSHA now, and the good folks who work there, I believe, truly want to  help. They truly have set out best practices. But they have grown to  the point where we have allowed them to become not the help that they  should be, but are basically and many times a hindrance and a menace to  our businesses, from the farms to the factories, to the coal mines, all  that. It has just gotten out of hand.   So my discussion, Mr. Speaker, is this. How do you get regulatory  burden that actually makes sense?   We are not going to stand here and argue over a rule that makes  sense. I will never sit here and say that we should not record  workplace injuries and let businessowners then be fined if they are  doing something wrong. We will never argue about that.   But when it comes to the point of excessive recordkeeping that, at  the end of the day, does nothing except burden the business, how do you  explain that as helping workplace safety? If my son is in the pool and  can't get to the side and I do nothing, I can have great intentions;  but unless I get in and bring him to the side, then I have actually  done something.   A rule that has no end result to the bottom line of what you are  doing is simply waving and saying, ``Oh, I am doing something,''  instead of getting back to the purpose that OSHA should be about. When  businesses and OSHA cannot work together collaboratively to seek and to  set a process in which businesses are safer and employees are  healthier, then OSHA is failing and they have become punitive in  nature.   Why don't they come in and help businesses? Why don't they come in  and start? And if there is a business that continues the process of  being bad actors in the marketplace, then take them out, fine them, do  what you need to do. But I, myself, believe that most businessowners-- and I was one at one point--that we don't go in every day wanting to  hurt employees. We don't want to do that. We want to have a safe  workplace that presents a good product, that presents a good service,  that presents the activity that continues our economic engine.   Let's quit defending rules that don't work. Let's quit wasting time  defending rules and having our agencies in this city determine that all  they want to do is generate rules because that is their job  description. Let's see the things that actually work. If they want to  be policy experts, then let them run for office. But if you are going  to at least look at it, do it by the law.   Mr. Speaker, these rules before us today provide two very important  bills that take steps to get our economic engine going again. They do,  as we have talked about, look at unnecessary rules. They look at things  that need to be examined.   But we also can't simply pretend existing nonsensical regulations  don't exist, because they are being enforced at the expense of  innovators and job creators across the country, and they are being  enforced without using any common sense.   A case in point, did you know that trains have to have an F painted  on the front of them so that people can tell which end is the front? I  don't know about you, but I believe Americans can tell the front from  the back of a train.   We have got to identify existing business regulations like this that  are outdated and simply don't make sense  [[Page H1368]]  anymore and start taking steps to repeal them. The bills before us  today are a step in the right direction.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the  underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 150 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       305) to amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to require       the disclosure of certain tax returns by Presidents and       certain candidates for the office of the President, and for       other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and       controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority       members of the Committees on Ways and Means and Oversight and       Government Reform. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 305.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
