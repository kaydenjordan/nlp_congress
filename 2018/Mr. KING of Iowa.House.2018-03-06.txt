 Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to have the  opportunity to be here on the floor of the United States House of  Representatives. I ask that people who are listening to our  conversation weigh heavily on some of the remarks that will be made  here this half hour.   I come to the floor tonight, Mr. Speaker, to address the situation of  innocent, unborn human life in America and to recount the path that we  have followed and to lay out a path for the future that gives us a  better opportunity to save as many lives as possible.   For me, Mr. Speaker, I recall that when 1973 rolled around--January  22, 1973--on that date, we had two major decisions that came down from  the United States Supreme Court: Roe v. Wade, which most everybody  knows; and the other was Doe v. Bolton. Of those two cases that dropped  on us in January of 1973, not very many people, if any, understood the  magnitude of the decisions that had been made that day or the impact it  would have on the population of the United States of America.   They did not believe that we would see 45 years of pro-life marches  coming to the city in the middle of the winter and sometimes marching  through the snow from down on the Mall, all the way up to the United  States Supreme Court building, calling upon the Supreme Court to  correct the decision that was made by an activist court in 1973.   The bottom line of that decision was that an abortion was essentially  declared to be, some would say, a constitutional right for any reason  or no reason at all, as much as you might want to parse the phrases in  Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, Mr. Speaker.   Of course, for me, I didn't realize the impact of this in 1973. But  by 1976, when my first son was born, I remember holding him in my hands  and looking at David Steven King, understanding the miracle of life and  the miracle of birth and thinking within that first hour of his life  how anyone could take his life now, this little miracle child with that  big head and dark hair and blue eyes and gurgling a little bit and  crying some and squirming a lot, but a miracle.   I thought: How could anyone take his life now, when he is an hour old  or a minute old or a minute before he was born or an hour before he was  born? Could they take his life a day before, a week before, or a month  before, or a trimester before?   When could you decide that this child's life could be ended, and do  so within a moral framework rather than a framework of maybe self- interest?   I concluded that there was only one moment, only one instant. We have  to choose that moment when life begins. There is only one, and that is  the moment of conception. We all know that. I knew it in 1973. I am  sure I knew it before then, but I hadn't thought about it very much.   And here we are today and we know. We know by the benefit of  ultrasound. We are watching little babies squirm around in the womb. We  are watching them yawn and stretch and suck their thumbs and try to  talk and stretch themselves and belch and do all the things inside the  womb that they do pretty shortly when they get outside the womb. It is  life. It is miraculous life. Little hands, little feet, little fingers,  a little nose, little eyes. They are little babies that are  defenseless.   This Congress has allowed a Supreme Court to impose abortion on  demand in America, and we have worked to put together very few  limitations on that abortion on demand. I don't think we have done  enough, either, to send the message to America that life begins at the  moment of conception. But ultrasound has shown many of us in this  country--millions of us--that life does exist inside the womb.   We know that we can, even with a transabdominal ultrasound, verify a  heartbeat in 7 to 8 weeks from conception. In 7 to 9 weeks, that little  baby is formed by then with a beating heart. We know that of those  babies that have a detectable beating heart, 95 percent of those babies  will experience a successful birth. It is at least 95 percent. Some say  more.   So 95 percent of them, or more, are destined to experience a  successful birth. Yet the most dangerous place for a baby is in the  mother's womb. It is the most dangerous place because our hearts are  hardened by a Supreme Court decision that some think will not change,  that we have to live with it  [[Page H1435]]  in perpetuity and accept the consequences of 60 million Americans being  aborted.   There is a hole in the population of America that is 60 billion  babies strong. Some of those little girls who were aborted would be  mothers by now. When you do the math on that just on the back of the  envelope, that is perhaps as many as another 60 million babies--a  missing 120 million Americans that would otherwise have been born in  this country and had the opportunity to live, to love, to laugh, to  learn, to worship, to be mothers or fathers themselves. That is what we  are asking for here in this Congress with 170 cosponsors on the  Heartbeat bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa),  one of those cosponsors who is a bit of a rare commodity himself, a  conservative from California.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman gives me a little too  much credit and doesn't take enough credit for himself.                                time  1845    That is that measure of humility I was asked about earlier today.  Trent Franks always said: The funny thing about humility, about the  time you think you have achieved it, you have lost it.   Mr. LaMalfa is a solid principled conservative, and I appreciate him  coming to the floor to defend life. The effort that we have had is the  whip team has gone out and pulled together 170 cosponsors on this bill  that has set the stage for a path that I believe soon will be to the  floor of the House of Representatives. Let's put the Heartbeat bill  over on Mitch McConnell's desk. That is a good place for a lot of good  things to have a chance to happen, even though they are a little slower  at moving over there than we are over here.   One of the nimble folks who has been actively engaged in the pro-life  movement in the House of Representatives is Mr. Lamborn from Colorado.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado  for coming to the floor to make such a strong message here on the  sanctity of human life.   When I think about that heartbeat, a heartbeat is a certain indicator  of life. If the baby has a beating heart, we know that baby is alive.  Statistically speaking, 95 percent or more of those little babies that  have a beating heart, that can be detected by an ultrasound in that 6-  to 8-week period of time, 95 percent of them will experience a  successful birth.   I have asked the question to those who weren't supportive of the  bill: Did you ever hear the expression, ``Let's error on the side of  life?''   Well, let's not error with life at all if we can help it. If we have  a 95 percent chance of a successful birth, we can't take a chance on  ending that little baby's life.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is a bill that has come together over the last  year and a half or so. Just to mention some of the points here that I  think are important is that we have at least 162 pro-life organizations  and leaders that support the Heartbeat bill. I have a little  demonstration here.   These are some of the organizations and leaders that support the  Heartbeat bill. We have to really search pretty hard to find somebody  that is not onboard.   You can go down through this list. I could read these all off, but I  think it would be a little bit tiresome and maybe a little bit  redundant. I put this together. This may be one-third of--or maybe even  one-fourth--of the overall list of 162 pro-life organizations and  leaders that support the Heartbeat bill. It is nearly universal across  this country.   Of course, we don't have Planned Parenthood on here. We don't have  the NARAL here. The National Abortion Rights Action League is what they  used to be. They say they aren't anymore, but, yes, they are.   We have the pro-life organizations here: the people who care about  life, the people who understand that human life is sacred in all of its  forms, it begins at the moment of conception, that we have to protect  life from that time on, and that we have a constitutional duty to do  so. We have an equal protection clause in the Fourteenth Amendment of  the Constitution that tells us that.   But it seems as though the United States Supreme Court, in Roe v.  Wade and Doe v. Bolton, upset that. They decided that a right to  privacy, which was a manufactured right--I don't think I have it in my  memos--but it is Griswold v. Connecticut back in the 1960s. It is a  decision that a couple had a right to privacy in order to buy birth  control pills. It was in Connecticut in that period of time. Shortly  after that decision, they decided it wasn't just a married couple that  had a right to privacy; it was an unmarried couple that had a right to  privacy in the form of contraceptives. That was only in the mid- sixties.   Then Roe v. Wade came along. I think that this Court can never be  defended for the decision that they made, the idea that privacy trumps  life, and that the privacy of a mother will allow for an abortion at  any stage, is how this all came together between Roe v. Wade and Doe v.  Bolton.   But even some of our professors that you might think have been on the  other side of the issue had their skepticism. In fact, there is a bit  of it here in Ruth Bader Ginsburg in a statement that she made in 1985.  Our Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg said:         Roe, I believe, would have been more acceptable as a       judicial decision if it had not gone beyond a ruling on the       extreme statute before the court. Heavyhanded judicial       intervention was difficult to justify and appears to have       provoked, not resolved, the conflict.    I would restate the Fourteenth Amendment. It says this: ``No State  shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or  immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State  deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of  law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal  protection of the laws.''   This comes back to personhood. I believe that a conceived baby from  that moment is a person. We don't have the technical medical ability to  define that moment at this point, Mr. Speaker, but we can define  ``heartbeat,'' and we have done so in the Heartbeat Protection Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Rothfus), who has been a leader and a fighter for life since back in  the 1980s or so, when I was still in the crib.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania for his eloquent words.   I hadn't heard the description delivered by Governor Casey in those  years back. But Governor Bob Casey--God rest his soul--captured my  attention years ago, 20 or more years ago. I had a quote from Governor  Bob Casey, a Democrat, that I had on my bulletin board that I don't  have to look up anymore. And it was this:         Human life cannot be measured. It is the measure itself       against which all other things are weighed.    It rang so clear and true to me that I cut it out of the magazine and  stuck it up on the bulletin board. His words echo in this Chamber  today. I wish they echoed in his son over in the Senate the same way  they echoed out of the mouth of Governor Bob Casey back in those days  when he was denied the opportunity to speak before the Democratic  National Convention because he is pro-life. And we look today and we  see this issue has been more and more polarized. I hope that we can be  more broad with this and that we can be more bipartisan than we are.                                time  1900    We do have bipartisan cosponsorship on this bill. It is narrow, but  it exists.   I urge, Mr. Speaker, this body to take this bill to the floor. 170  cosponsors is further ahead than any comparable piece of pro-life  legislation. To have that many cosponsors and a good number of other  Members who have said, ``I am not ready to sign on the dotted line, but  you bring it to the floor, and I will vote `yes,' '' I think we get to  ``yes,'' but we need to bring it here.   There are concerns that, well, if we pass it off the floor of the  House, the Senate won't take it up. Well, we know they won't take it up  if we don't pass it off the floor of the House.   There is concern about the Supreme Court. Of course there is. We have  to challenge the Court. We are going to live with the 1 million  abortions a year in this country until we are willing to challenge the  Court and do so successfully.   I believe, Mr. Speaker, that we are going to see one or two more  appointments to this Court in the next 2 or 3 or more years, and we  need to get the bill off the floor, onto the desk of Leader McConnell  so that it has a chance then to go to the President's desk, where I am  very confident that President Trump will sign the bill. And then it has  a chance to go--I am happy with it not being litigated, but we expect  it will be litigated like every other effective piece of pro-life  legislation.   I appreciate the attention tonight, Mr. Speaker, and the speakers who  have come to the floor to weigh in for innocent, unborn human life and  to lay out the path for the future that we have to follow here if we  are to answer to God and country for that gift from God, which is life,  in the first priority, then liberty, then the pursuit of happiness.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 1 minute  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, March 7, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
