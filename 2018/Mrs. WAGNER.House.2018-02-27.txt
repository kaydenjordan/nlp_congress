 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to  me.   Mr. Speaker, I love this opportunity to testify on the rule for H.R.  1865, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act,  or FOSTA. This legislation has been born, sadly, out of necessity, but  has been truly a labor of love for me since I was first elected to  Congress over 5 years ago. The bill is the result of meetings with  trafficking survivors across the country who have been victimized by  the online sex trade and unable to access either justice or relief in  our court systems.   Today's consideration of the bill is an historic achievement, a long- awaited clarification from this Congress that the businesses that sell  our children online can no longer do so with impunity. It is a clear  statement that there are serious legal consequences for websites that  actively profit from the exploitation of our most vulnerable. It is a  wake-up call to America's judicial system, making clear that section  230 of the Communications Decency Act does not provide immunity to  websites that are actively engaged in modern-day slavery.                                time  1130    FOSTA is a recommitment to Americans that Congress never intended to  create a system that allows businesses to commit crimes online that  they could not commit offline. It is in many ways just a simple  statement of the obvious: Congress does not believe--and did not ever  believe--that rape was a perquisite of a free and open internet.   This bill is a promise to our State and local law enforcement and  prosecutors. Congress is making it clear that we believe in and support  their missions to protect our communities. Combined with the Walters  amendment, which reinstates victim-centered provisions from my original  bill last April, this legislation is now a guarantee of the fundamental  rights of the most vulnerable members of our society. It is a message  to the children and victims who have been robbed of their basic  dignities that Congress hears them and is responding to the injustices  that they all have faced.   It has not been an easy journey to get to this point, to find middle  ground with the tech industry and the victims' advocates to incorporate  the concerns of prosecutors and the law enforcement community to move  this bill through committee and to get both FOSTA and the SESTA Walters  amendment to the floor today. So I am very grateful for the many, many  people who joined my crusade to restore justice to the brave children,  women, and men across our country who have been sold online.   I am grateful to Chairman Goodlatte and his team for going the extra  mile in helping us include a strong, new crime that will enable  prosecutors to better target online trafficking and prostitution. I am  grateful for the Energy and Commerce Committee and House leadership and  their willingness to prioritize this issue.   I must give a big thank-you to Majority Leader McCarthy, our Whip  Scalise, and Speaker Ryan for leading the way in doing the right thing  for America's children.   I am grateful for Senators Portman and Blumenthal and Senators Cornyn  and McCaskill for carrying SESTA on their shoulders and advocating for  a solution that allows victims to access the civil remedies that they  deserve. I am grateful to each and every one of our 176 bipartisan  cosponsors, many of whom personally stopped on the House floor to hear  and express their concerns about victims of online sex trafficking. I  especially want to mention Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney and  Congresswoman Joyce Beatty who fought the good fight on the other side  of the aisle for what is truly a landmark, for a bipartisan piece of  legislation that is going to save lives.   I am also so thankful for my dedicated staff who have poured their  hearts, their minds, and their lives into this fight in more ways than  the public will ever know.   FOSTA, combined with the Walters amendment, which is SESTA, will  provide better civil justice for victims, more prosecutions of bad  actor websites, more convictions, and more predators behind bars.  Because of this package, fewer businesses will ever dare to enter the  sex trade and fewer victims will be sold into modern-day sex slavery.   Last, but most importantly, I am in awe of and grateful for the  contributions of the survivors in this fight to turn FOSTA and SESTA  into law. It is heartbreaking to watch survivors struggle to piece  their lives back together alone while our justice system shields the  websites that sold them. That is why I introduced this bill, and that  is why it must become law.   I expect this piece of legislation to sail through the Senate and  make its way to the President's desk so that we can put those bad actor  websites behind bars, deter others from entering this ecosystem, and  make sure that there are rights and justice for our victims.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Chair and our colleagues because, when we  vote today for FOSTA and the Walters amendment, our survivors will know  [[Page H1279]]  that they are not alone and justice will indeed no longer be out of  reach.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Alabama, my  friend, Mrs. Roby, for her fearless leadership and support on this  issue.   Today we bring, Mr. Chair, H.R. 1865, the Allow States and Victims to  Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, or FOSTA, to the floor, finally.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank my partners on the other side of the  aisle, my dear friends, Congresswoman Joyce Beatty and Congresswoman  Carolyn Maloney, for their tireless support on this effort.   The sad truth is that sex trafficking is a crime as old as the Nation  itself. Over the past few years, Congress has routinely taken  bipartisan action to fight it, yet sex trafficking seems to continue  unabated. This is largely because the methods of recruitment and sale  of sex trafficking victims have evolved with technology, and U.S. laws  have remained stagnant.   Today, when the House votes on FOSTA, we will be sending a clear  message: businesses that sell human beings online can no longer do so  with impunity. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act explicitly  allows enforcement of Federal criminal law, but courts have mistakenly  found that it does not allow robust enforcement of State criminal law.   Last summer, 50 State attorneys general called on Congress to untie  their hands to allow them to bring justice to the websites that sell  our children and the victims. Empowering our State and local  prosecutors is in the best interests of the American people. Federal  prosecution is discretionary, and the vast majority of crimes are  prosecuted at the State and local level.   Most websites engaging in the online sex trade are first identified  at the local level and should be quickly addressed before they ever  reach the size of Backpage.com. Without proper State and local  enforcement, there is no real  [[Page H1294]]  criminal deterrent against businesses looking to enter the sex trade.  Today, we will change that.   FOSTA will allow prosecutors across the country to protect their  communities without fear of section 230 preemption. FOSTA will produce  more prosecutions of bad actor websites, more convictions, and put more  predators behind bars. It will provide a meaningful criminal deterrent  so that fewer businesses will ever enter the sex trade and fewer  victims will ever be sold and raped.   Clarification of section 230 is desperately needed. In August 2017,  the Sacramento Superior Court dismissed charges brought against  Backpage by the California attorney general, saying: ``If and until  Congress sees fit to amend the immunity law, the broad reach of section  230 of the Communications Decency Act even applies to those alleged to  support the exploitation of others by human trafficking.''   Today, Mr. Chair, Congress sees fit to amend the immunity law to hold  accountable websites that support exploitation. FOSTA also creates a  new crime targeting websites that are intentionally promoting  prostitution, and it encourages States to use or adopt similar laws.   Unfortunately, sex trafficking ads are written to evade law  enforcement. Looking at these ads, you usually can't tell that force,  fraud, and coercion were used against the victim or that the person  depicted in the ad is a minor.                                time  1430    Because indications of knowledge of sex trafficking are typically  hidden, it is nearly impossible for prosecutors to demonstrate beyond a  reasonable doubt that the website operators knew that the ads involved  sex trafficking. This is why prosecutors tell me that they would  oftentimes prefer to use prostitution laws instead of sex trafficking  laws when charging these websites.   Sex trafficking laws are written to target pimps, johns, and  businesses, but are not always the best tool against the online sex  trade. FOSTA gives prosecutors the freedom to use both State sex  trafficking laws and the State prostitution laws, and lets prosecutors  decide how best to do their jobs.   Importantly, prosecutors will be able to seek a higher penalty for  websites that promote prostitution and recklessly contribute to sex  trafficking. Online sex trafficking is flourishing in America because  there are no serious legal consequences for the websites that profit  from the exploitation of our most vulnerable.   FOSTA, combined with the SESTA Walters amendment that adds back in  victim-centered provisions from my original language, will finally  create these serious legal consequences.   Today we are voting to keep our commitment to trafficking survivors,  both by empowering them to hold accountable the websites that stole  them and by arming prosecutors with the tools they need to ensure that  the most vulnerable members of our society are never sold online in the  first place.   I trust that my colleagues will join me in this vote to fundamentally  transform the fight against online sex trafficking in America.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for  bringing up the Walters amendment to H.R. 1865, the Allow States and  Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, called FOSTA.   The Walters amendment reinstates critical pro-victim provisions from  my original bill. It also reflects the work that has been done in the  Senate on these provisions, which are the meat of S. 1693, the Stop  Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, or SESTA.   FOSTA has over 175 House cosponsors and SESTA has over 67 Senate  cosponsors. These two bills depend on each other to address the problem  of online sex trafficking.   Mr. Chair, we should not allow Big Tech money and special interests  to try and overdefine this conversation and override our criminal  justice system.   FOSTA amends section 230 to allow for stronger criminal enforcement  against websites that profit from human trafficking, and SESTA amends  section 230 to allow for stronger civil enforcement against websites  that profit from human trafficking.   They are two sides of the same coin and they must pass together. We  need both criminal and civil tools to properly combat the highly  ``lucrative'' industry of online sex trafficking.   Moreover, it is imperative that we clarify that section 230 does not  impair or limit the ability of trafficking victims to use the Federal  private right of action that Congress clearly provided in the  Trafficking Victims Protection Act.   Two years ago, the First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that there is  a fundamental tension between these private right of action and section  230. Today, by voting ``yes'' on the Walters amendment, the House will  dispel this tension. No website is immune from civil liability for  knowingly facilitating the sale of trafficking victims.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Alabama for  yielding.   Mr. Chair, in recent years, sex trafficking has moved from the  streets to the internet. The National Center for Missing and Exploited  Children has witnessed an 846 percent increase in suspected child sex  trafficking reports. Eighty-one percent of these reports concern online  trafficking facilitated by websites that help traffickers post  advertisements of child victims.   I find it hard to imagine that if a neighborhood business hosted a  slave auction, the auctioneer would not be considered liable. But that  is actually what is happening with websites like backpage.com and  hundreds others.   I have spoken with State and local prosecutors across America who  want to hold online advertisers accountable for facilitating traffic  and promoting prostitution, but they cannot.   Section 230 has been interpreted so broadly that courts have ruled in  favor of backpage.com in criminal and civil cases, despite the  website's clear criminal conduct. These rulings defy congressional  intent.   Twenty-two years ago, Senator Jim Exon from Nebraska, the sponsor of  the Communications Decency Act, stated that ``the information  superhighway should not become a red-light district.''   Section 230 was an amendment to the CDA that intended to motivate  websites to screen explicit content in ``good faith,'' and to shield  websites from unfair liability for third-party content. However,  section 230 was never intended to shield websites from liability for  criminal conduct.   Congress did not intend to allow businesses to commit trafficking  crimes online that they could never commit offline. It never meant to  imply that criminal conduct can hide behind the defense of legitimate  publishing or editing.   H.R. 1865 is a long-overdue clarification of section 230 explaining  to America's courts that State and local prosecutors are not handcuffed  from protecting their communities and that the State laws should be  freely enforced against websites that unlawfully promote prostitution  and sex.   Mr. Chair, the Jackson Lee amendment will help us track the use of  this new crime, and I am delighted to support it. I thank the  gentlewoman for offering it.   Mr. Chair, I am horrified that children and adults are sold on the  internet like a T-shirt or takeout. I am horrified that human beings  are sold with impunity and have no access to justice.   Today, please vote ``yes'' for justice.
