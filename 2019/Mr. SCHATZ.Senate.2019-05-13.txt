 Mr. President, due to a clerical error, the senior  Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski, was not added as an original  cosponsor and co-lead of the Compact of Free Association Veterans  Review Act when we introduced the bill together on April 29, 2019.  Senator Murkowski has been a tireless advocate of veterans from the  Compact States and a strong partner in our effort to expand Department  of Veterans Affairs care to those veterans still living in the  Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands,  and Republic of Palau. I thank her for her partnership to fulfill our  commitment to provide veterans everywhere with the access to high- quality care they have earned and deserve. Thank you.                            ____________________
