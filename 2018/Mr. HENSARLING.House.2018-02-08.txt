The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and submit extraneous materials on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in very strong support of H.R. 4771, the  Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act of 2018. It is a bipartisan bill  which passed our committee with a strong bipartisan vote of 41-14.   Mr. Speaker, this exact same provision came out of the Senate Banking  Committee also with a very strong bipartisan vote of 16-7.   First, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. Love) who is a  very hardworking member of the Financial Services Committee. I want to  thank her for introducing this legislation and helping lead our  congressional efforts to provide regulatory relief to our Nation's  community banks. She is a great asset to our committee and widely  respected.   The Federal Reserve Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement is a  regulation that allows certain bank holding companies that have less  than $1 billion in assets to hold more debt at the holding company  level than would otherwise be permitted by current capital  requirements. They do this as long as they meet a number of ongoing  requirements and restrictions.   H.R. 4771 would raise that threshold for qualifying institutions from  $1 billion to $3 billion, thus allowing more community banks to raise  more capital by the issuance of debt. By increasing this threshold,  H.R. 4771 provides much needed relief for bank holding companies from  overly burdensome capital and leverage requirements that were truly  intended, Mr. Speaker, for the largest and most complex global  financial institutions.   It is a reoccurring problem, Mr. Speaker. Again, over and over, the  regulatory burden on our community financial institutions is causing us  to lose one approximately every other day in America. These are rules  that have made it, again, more difficult for small banks to raise  capital. And while the bank holding companies will no longer have to  abide by these rules under this bill, again, there are plenty of  safeguards that continue to be in place to protect the safety and  soundness of the institution and its customers. But these institutions  present no threat to the safety and soundness of our financial system.   First and foremost, the Federal Reserve retains the right to impose  capital standards on a holding company if they determine it is needed.  In other words, this is a ``may'' bill and not a ``shall'' bill. The $3  billion threshold remains totally within the discretion of the Federal  Reserve. It is permissive.   Next, capital rules and regulations will continue to apply to the  subsidiary banks of the holding company level. Again, let me repeat,  the capital rules and regulations continue to apply to subsidiary  banks.   All institutions must continue to meet certain qualitative  requirements, including those pertaining to non-banking activities,  off-balance-sheet activities, and publicly registered debt and equity.  These requirements ensure that the higher leverage the policy statement  allows does not pose any undue burden on subsidiary depository  institutions.   So the Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act will indeed make it  easier for small, hometown community banks to raise capital. And as  they raise more capital, they can turn it into more Main Street jobs,  more economic growth, and more home ownership opportunities for our  constituents.   In fact, passing this bill will immediately benefit community banks  all across America. Not the big banks, not Wall Street banks, as I have  no doubt the ranking member will say in her remarks, but again, it will  be community banks that will benefit.   If you don't believe me, ask them. Ask the Independent Community  Bankers of America and its 5,700 community bank members.   As a matter of fact, the passage of this bill, Mrs. Love's bill, has  been an important, longstanding goal of the Independent Community  Bankers of America because they have been suffering and suffocated by  an avalanche of red tape with massive increases in regulatory burdens,  which has caused consolidation with much, much larger competitors.  Because of increased regulation and compliance costs, again, many of  them have found it difficult to access and raise capital. This is the  capital that is needed to capitalize our small businesses.   Small businesses are struggling for access to credit, and the  incredible regulatory burden placed on home buyers has simply  complicated the buying process.                                time  1115    These higher costs are being felt at the same time that paychecks are  only now beginning to grow for working families thanks to the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act.   Just don't take my word for it, Mr. Speaker. Let's listen to just one  community banker who happens to be from West Virginia. They wrote in  and said:         What no one in a position of power seems to realize is that       many customers in our  [[Page H984]]       country prefer to deal with a smaller, hometown institution,       with people they know and trust. If a customer has a question       about their loan or their deposit, they simply pick up the       phone and call or drop by. If we don't know the answer, we       find out and let them know as soon as possible. But it       appears that Congress and the administration are attempting       to get rid of smaller institutions, so there are a lot fewer       institutions to deal with, and those are the large ones who       are too big to fail.    Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what happened under the Dodd-Frank Act.   Continuing:         Please just try to remember that small financial       institutions and small businesses are the heart of America.       The American Dream is to work hard, learn, and make a good       life for yourself and your family. In the meantime, it       includes working in your community or neighborhood to help       others out. Even as a small institution as ours, we sponsor       Little League Baseball teams, soccer teams, the county junior       fair, and many other activities. We realize if we don't       support local small businesses, they soon won't be here.    Those words could have been written by almost any community financial  institution in America, Mr. Speaker, and they ring so true. In order to  keep our small communities alive, we have to keep their small  businesses alive and we must keep their small banks alive.   So, again, it is so important that we enact H.R. 4771 and that we  reduce this red tape on our community financial institutions.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Utah for introducing the  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4771, the Small Bank  Holding Company Relief Act of 2018. This bill is another Republican-led  measure to roll back appropriately tailored policies to regulate the  financial services sector that ignores the hard-learned lessons of the  catastrophic 2008 financial crisis.   We have seen this same flawed approach in H.R. 10, which I called the  ``Wrong Choice Act,'' last year, and we are seeing it again in the  Senate as it considers advancing Senator Crapo's Wall Street giveaway,  which includes a provision identical to the bill that we are  considering today, along with several other harmful provisions.   The Federal Reserve's Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement was  first issued in 1980 to enable the transfer of ownership of small  community banks by allowing small, noncomplex bank holding companies to  operate with higher levels of debt than would normally be permitted.   The original policy statement established a threshold of bank holding  companies with less than $150 million in assets, but this level was  increased to $500 million in 2006.   The policy statement allows certain small bank holding companies and  savings and loan holding companies to hold more debt at the holding  company level than would otherwise be allowed by capital requirements  if the debt is used to finance up to 75 percent of an acquisition of  another bank. Put another way, the policy statement is important  because it allows small institutions like community banks and minority- owned insured depository institutions to access additional debt so they  can continue serving their communities without compromising bank safety  and soundness.   Thus, it is important that the threshold level be carefully  calibrated so it cannot be abused by speculative investors. If the  threshold is raised too high, it will encourage more mergers and  acquisitions, riskier banking activities, and reduced banking services  and credit availability to rural, low-income, minority, and underserved  communities.   In 2014, Democrats worked with Republicans to examine this threshold  and reached a reasonable compromise to raise the threshold to $1  billion. This change was implemented only after closely consulting with  regulators to determine the appropriate threshold level to help  community banks grow without making them targets for mergers and  acquisitions.   The $1 billion threshold is sensible and reasonable in light of the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's exhaustive study several years  ago on the definition of ``community bank.'' While the FDIC factors in  other considerations, their definition of a community bank includes a  dollar threshold of banks with less than $1 billion in assets.   According to 2016 data from the Federal Reserve, 87 percent of all  bank holding companies are covered by the current $1 billion threshold.  This means that a large majority of the industry currently benefits  from the adjusted 2014 threshold increase in the policy statement,  including all truly small community banks.   Furthermore, it is worth highlighting that the bipartisan compromise  reached in 2014 included other important safeguards, such as excluding  any bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with  less than $1 billion that are engaged in significant nonbanking  activities. It also gives the Federal Reserve the ability to exclude  any bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies from  the policy statement, regardless of size, if it concludes that the  exclusion is warranted for supervisory purposes.   But my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have not hesitated  to try and push the threshold higher. Last Congress, just a little more  than a year after a bipartisan compromise to increase the threshold,  Republicans pushed through the House another bill, H.R. 3791, that  would have significantly increased the threshold from $1 billion to $5  billion. That bill faced a veto threat from the Obama administration,  as it should have, and it went nowhere in the Senate.    Last year, Chairman Hensarling included a provision in H.R. 10, the  ``Wrong Choice Act,'' to drastically raise the $1 billion threshold to  $10 billion. Because the Senate now appears set to move a bill that  raises the threshold, but to nowhere near that level, we now find  ourselves back on the floor of the House today considering a new bill  to triple the threshold from $1 billion to $3 billion.   While it is a slightly less drastic increase than the one in the bill  Republicans pushed through the House last Congress, tripling the policy  statement threshold to $3 billion so soon since the last threshold  increase is still unwise. There simply has not been sufficient time to  see what effect doubling the policy statement threshold from $500  million to $1 billion really means for community banks.   Congress should at least examine the data and understand the effects  of the last change before making another one. We should not ignore the  concerns raised by experts that this approach will allow small banks to  take on more debt than they otherwise need and may actually promote  mergers and acquisitions so that we have fewer community banks, not  more.   While Republicans push bills like H.R. 4771 in the name of helping  community banks, this is yet another proposal that would likely result  in fewer, not more, community banks.   Even the Treasury Department under this President, President Trump,  only recommended raising the threshold to $2 billion. So they are $1  billion even beyond what the President supports. That was in a report  issued last year.   As I mentioned, H.R. 4771 is one of the many harmful provisions in  Senator Crapo's financial deregulatory bill that is advanced in the  Senate. Senator Crapo's bill also includes many other harmful rollbacks  that would fundamentally weaken our framework. It would roll back  certain stress testing requirements for megabanks like Wells Fargo and  would exempt or weaken enhanced standards for many of the large banks  in the country.   The Senate bill also would gut rules for foreign banks like Deutsche  Bank and Credit Suisse.   It would also eliminate a requirement that many banks collect and  publicly report critical Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, or HMDA, data.  HMDA data is used for many important policy purposes, including to  identify mortgage lending discrimination against many Latinos, African  Americans, and other minority groups.   I could go on and on, but the list is longer than the time that we  have allotted. The bottom line is I strongly urge my colleagues to  reject H.R. 4771 and the other efforts by congressional Republicans and  this administration to deregulate Wall Street and the banking industry  and roll back the clock to a time not long ago when we had weak  [[Page H985]]  oversight and few safeguards that protect consumers, investors, and  taxpayers.   You can see what is happening. At one point, the opposite side of the  aisle said: ``Let's jump to $5 billion.'' And then, Mr. Hensarling  said: ``No, let's jump to $10 billion.'' This is done without any  thought or consideration for what they are doing and the risks that  they are placing on these little banks to be bought up and the mergers  to take place.   You can see there is no real thought, no real review, no real  consideration given when you say: ``Let's go from $1 billion to $3  billion to $5 billion to $10 billion, whatever we can get.'' We are  saying: ``No, that is wrong. Don't do that. Don't do that to these  community banks.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Utah (Mrs. Love), the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Utah.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Utah.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds to say that,  as the ranking member appears to be vexed at where the $3 billion  number came from, it is the product of bipartisan compromise, something  I invite her to engage in more often, and this particular bill is  supported by almost half the Democrats on the committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Luetkemeyer), the chairman of the Financial Institutions and Consumer  Credit Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds just to say  that I am shocked that anybody would come here and say that they want  to support community banks and they supported Dodd-Frank--the very  reason these community banks are being gobbled up. The whole idea of  this legislation is to allow them to come together and protect  themselves and not be gobbled up by the big banks they vilify in the  first place.   Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds to simply use  a term popularized on the other side of the aisle. These are crumbs,  deregulatory crumbs, offered by the ranking member when, in fact, she  and others on the other side of the aisle have their handprints all  over Dodd-Frank, which 90 percent of community bankers will tell you is  the number one reason they are going out of business, which is why we  have to enact this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the vice chairman of our Subcommittee  on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit.    Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Ross), vice chairman of the Housing and  Insurance Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds just to  request of the ranking member, on her time, if she will begin to name  the community banks that were responsible for the 2008 financial  crisis, ostensibly, that was supposed to be answered by Dodd-Frank. She  will have some time to think about that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Zeldin).  [[Page H989]]         I yield the gentleman from New York an additional 30  seconds.    I yield the gentleman from New York an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Davidson), a hardworking member of the Financial Services  Committee.    I yield the gentleman from Ohio an additional 30  seconds.    I yield the gentleman from Ohio an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is  remaining.  [[Page H990]]    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 4\1/4\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, our community financial institutions play a vital role  in our local communities, particularly in rural areas like the Fifth  District of Texas, our east Texas counties, and yet they are being  crushed, crushed by the sheer weight, volume, complexity, and expense  of regulation brought about by Dodd-Frank.   I hear so much from the ranking member about how much her side of the  aisle cares about community banks, but their words are belied by their  actions in supporting Dodd-Frank, supposedly meant for Wall Street, but  it is hurting Main Street.   We have a bill before us today, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4771, that will  give a little bit of ability for community banks to protect themselves  from the onslaught of this regulatory burden. The whole idea, again,  Mr. Speaker, is to ensure that community banks can at least gather and  merge amongst themselves so they are not gobbled up by the big banks  that are vilified by the other side of the aisle in the first place.   Again, Mr. Speaker, this is actually--you wouldn't know it from the  ranking member--a bipartisan proposal, supported by almost half--half-- of the Democrats on the Financial Services Committee. And again, there  is great bipartisan work on our committee. Almost three-quarters of our  bills are bipartisan; it is just few of them that are supported by our  ranking member.   Let's do one small thing today. Let's have the House do one small  thing today, Mr. Speaker, that will help them survive a day more so  that they can lend money to a hardworking family to buy that first  home, so that they can lend money to somebody to realize their American  Dream of perhaps starting their own small business. After having to get  that paycheck at the local factory for so many years, now they can  finally go out and start their own small business. Maybe it is a matter  of sending the first kid to college.   But all of this, all of this disappears. These hopes and dreams  disappear with our community banks who are still failing,  unfortunately, at the rate of one approximately every other day. This  is unacceptable. This is totally unacceptable.   So we have one deregulatory measure here--one--to help our community  banks survive. And we hear from so many of them, Mr. Speaker.   Here is one from Indiana that says:         Regulations have significantly reduced our ability to make       judgment calls on credit decisions. When I first came to       First Savings Bank, I had a number of people tell me that the       First Savings Bank gave them their first loan, probably when       they didn't deserve it. Today, they are business and civic       leaders. And I guess we made the right call then. However,       today we cannot make that call. Washington has made that       call, and the answer is no.    One reason, one voice of one banker telling us why we need the bill  from the gentlewoman from Utah.   Here is another from a banker in Texas, who said:         When I started banking, the community bank business model       was built around bankers helping their communities to thrive.       Today, customers are confused when they have to sign so many       papers to open a deposit account or borrow money. I can only       think of one explanation, and that is our government thinks       our customers are too stupid to come into the bank and       negotiate a private transaction with their banker, the       community banker that they go to church with, the community       banker whose kids go to school with the customers' kids, and       the community banker whose wife is in the local charity with       the wives of the banker's customers' wives.                                time  1215    Here is another one from Nevada:         I have been a banker for over 30 years, and I have never       been more discouraged than I am now. Good bankers are fleeing       the industry. The days of making a commonsense decision for       the benefit of a customer are gone. For me, retirement can't       come soon enough.    I have got binders and binders full of these testimonies, Mr.  Speaker. As the local community banks leave, so leave the credit  opportunities of so many low-and moderate-income Americans. It has got  to stop.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for the House to enact H.R. 4771. Let's stop  the carnage, let's encourage community bank living, and I yield back  the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 725, the previous question is ordered on  the bill, as amended.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on passage of the bill.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________
