 Madam President, I thank my friend from Vermont for his  courtesy.   Yesterday, Texas reported almost 7,000 new coronavirus cases, setting  a new single-day record.   As cases have climbed in recent weeks, it has become clear that we  need to take what we have learned about this virus and adjust our  strategy.   In the beginning, we were still learning about this novel virus and  how it is transmitted, while also trying to maximize scarce resources.  I think the best analogy I can think of--we were trying to design and  build an airplane while we were flying it.   Because of that, only individuals with symptoms or who had been in  contact with a person who had tested positive could be tested  themselves, but we know a lot has changed in the last few months. We  have learned that individuals can have the virus even if they aren't  showing symptoms.   Recent studies in North Carolina and New York have shown that  somewhere between 12 and 20 percent of people could have the COVID-19  antibodies. In other words, they have had the virus, and they  recovered, but they didn't even know they were sick in the first place,  but the problem is they can still spread it to others.   As our knowledge about the coronavirus has increased, so have our  testing capacities, but I think it is important to take stock of where  we are and to see how we need to adjust further to, again, what we have  learned by hard experience.   On Sunday, I traveled to Dallas, TX, with Vice President Mike Pence  for a briefing on the coronavirus response efforts, and we were joined  by two of those members--Dr. Deborah Birx and HUD Secretary Dr. Ben  Carson.   On the flight down, I was able to spend some time talking with Dr.  Birx about testing strategies and the ways we can more effectively  identify positive cases and stop the spread, especially among  asymptomatic individuals who have no incentive, no motivation to  request a test in the first place. If I am feeling well, why would I go  ask for a coronavirus test unless I am just curious. That is the  conundrum.   Dr. Birx talked about the concept of pool testing, which is one of  the most efficient ways to test large numbers of people using the least  amount of time and resources.   Let's say, for example, that a number of employees at a meat packing  plant are tested simultaneously. Rather than running each sample  individually to see if any of the employees had the virus, you would  pool the sample together and run it as a group. If the pool sample  comes back negative, you know that each individual within that pool is  negative. And if it comes back positive, each sample is run  individually to identify positive cases.   But this is a way to magnify the number of testing cases we can do by  maybe as much as a factor of 10.   This pool-testing model makes it much easier to conduct repeated  tests for individuals in a single setting such as workplaces, schools,  or nursing homes.   This is exactly the kind of strategy we are going to need as we  contemplate sending our children back to school.   Dr. Birx was recently quoted as saying: ``If you look around the  globe, the way people are doing a million tests or 10 million tests is  they're doing pooling.''   So as we are seeing spikes in Texas and a number of other States  across the country, it is clear we need to adapt to everything we have  learned and embrace a new and different strategy. We need more  efficient and effective ways to test broad swaths of people so we can  identify positive cases as soon as possible.   Now, we know this virus is particularly deadly if you are over 80  years old or if you have underlying health problems. For the rest of  us, honestly, if you get symptoms, you are probably going to recover.  Sadly, some will have to be hospitalized, but, actually, the level of  fatalities we have seen from the coronavirus infection have remained  remarkably low because our healthcare providers have discovered new  treatments and new ways to save lives.   A data scientist and associate professor at Cornell University named  [[Page S4096]]  Peter Frazier has said about pool testing that ``if you don't test  people without symptoms and focus only on symptomatic people, then you  miss the epidemic and continue spreading.''   We need to constantly reevaluate and adapt our strategy to ensure  that we are identifying cases as soon as possible to stop the spread  and to protect the most vulnerable among us.   I know the administration and the task force are working around the  clock on this, but to be frank, we need to up our game, and I hope we  will focus on developing a comprehensive testing strategy based on what  we have learned from this hard experience to combat the rise in cases  and community spread we are seeing in places like Texas and elsewhere.                                   S. 4049    Madam President, this week, the Senate is fulfilling one of our most  basic responsibilities--and that is to support our common defense.   Passing the strong, strategic, and bipartisan national defense  authorization bill is something we have done for the last 60 years. It  is how this body has ensured that generations of servicemembers would  be paid, that they would have the equipment and training they need, as  well as the weapons, the planes, and the ships to bring them home  safely. It is how we have taken stock of the evolving threat landscape  and made adjustments to ensure that our military remains the very best  in the world. It is a belief in peace through strength.   We know our adversaries are constantly watching us to see whether we  are hesitant or pulling back from our world leadership or maybe we are  not investing like they are in modern weapons systems that can defeat  our defenses.   Well, we know for all the technologies and innovation that have made  our lives simpler and more efficient, that these changes in technology  have made safeguarding our national security that much more  challenging.   We are seeing new technologies on the battlefield, and the race to  develop next-generation weapons, such as hypersonic missiles, has  allowed our competitors to get a few steps ahead of us. The bottom line  is, unless we continue our investment and our determination to remain  No. 1, we are going to be losing ground against our adversaries. We no  longer enjoy the across-the-board strategic edge that we used to have,  and it is time for us to take bold action to reverse the tide before it  is too late. That is what I believe we can achieve with this year's  National Defense Authorization bill.   I appreciate Chairman Inhofe and the members of the Senate Armed  Services Committee, which operates almost entirely on a bipartisan  basis. It really is a great tradition and one we don't want to break,  passing the Defense authorization bill each year   It also provides funding to both modernize and grow our aging fleet,  so we can send our troops around the world with the confidence that  they have the best equipment available.   I'm glad this legislation includes a provision I offered to increase  the number of new F-35 aircraft. When we talk about providing our  servicemembers with the best possible equipment, the F-35 is a prime  example. This 5th generation fighter gives our servicemembers an edge  in stealth, surveillance, and weapons systems.   Growing our F-35 fleet has been a priority for a number of years, and  this legislation will continue moving us in the right direction. These  aircraft will be made by hardworking Texans in Fort Worth, and provide  our servicemembers around the world with the most advanced and capable  aircraft to see them through their missions.   But maintaining a competitive edge requires much more than a fleet of  top of the line aircraft or a stockpile of innovative weapons. It also  requires end to end security in our supply chains.   The COVID-19 pandemic has really shone a light on the vulnerabilities  that come from a reliance on other countries for critical  manufacturing. We lean heavily on China and other countries for masks,  gloves, gowns, ventilators--all the equipment we've needed over the  past few months. That reliance has led to a shortage of these supplies  at the most critical time, and forced our medical workers to go into  battle without their traditional armor.   It's been a wake-up call on supply chain vulnerabilities, and a  reminder that we need to keep our most critical supply chains right  here at home. One area where we need improvement is with 5G. For all  the rewards that come with this advanced technology, there are also a  lot of risks, and we need to ensure we're protecting this critical  asset. That's why Senators Burr, Warner, and I introduced the Secure 5G  and Beyond Act, which is now law.   It requires the President to develop a strategy to ensure the  security of next generation telecom systems, and help our allies  protect their systems as well. But I believe we need to take this a  step further, and safeguard not only the networks themselves but the  supply chains that produce them. The reality is, a lack of domestic  industry has caused the U.S. to fall behind our foreign adversaries in  developing 5G technologies.   I'm glad the NDAA includes an amendment I offered to support these  critical supply chains. It would give the Department of Defense the  flexibility to partner with industry for commercial development and  deployment of 5G technologies. This will ensure we're investing in  American companies to strengthen and secure our critical networks,  which are vital not only to our national security, but to our everyday  lives.   Beyond supporting 5G, another critical supply chain we need to  support is for semiconductors.   These devices are everywhere--they're the underlying technology in  everything from our cell phones, to computers, to cell towers, to  missile defense systems. Despite the pervasiveness of these devices in  our everyday lives, we're largely relying on other countries to  manufacture them. Since 2000, the U.S. has dropped from producing  roughly a quarter of the world's semiconductors to only 12 percent.   Meanwhile, China has gone from manufacturing zero chips to 16 percent  of the world's supply, and plans to invest another $1.4 trillion in  semiconductor technologies. America has lost ground to global  competitors, and unless the U.S. takes action, it's estimated that by  2030, 83 percent of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity will be  in Asia. We need to bring back some of the talent that was first  created here in the U.S.   0f course, that's much easier said than done. Building a new foundry  is a very expensive undertaking, and it's going to require an  investment from the federal government.   That's why Senator Warner and I introduced the CHIPS for America Act,  and I hope we can include a version of this bill as an amendment to the  NDAA. This would create a federal incentive program through the  Department of Commerce to encourage semiconductor manufacturing in the  U.S.   In short, this would help stimulate domestic advanced semiconductor  manufacturing, and boost both our national security and global  competitiveness.   I mentioned, these devices are everywhere--military systems,  telecommunications, healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing. Virtually  every industry stands to benefit from a more secure semiconductor  supply chain and our economy would reap the benefits of bringing these  manufacturing jobs back to the United States.   This legislation would serve as a boon to both our national security  and our economy, and I'm hoping it will be included as part of the  NDAA.   I'd like to once again thank Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Reed  for upholding the now 60-year tradition of a bipartisan process to get  this legislation over the finish line on time. I'm glad this  legislation prioritizes advancements in the critical technologies that  will modernize our national defense, and restore our competitive edge.   I yield the floor.
