 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week it is my privilege to recognize Lisle  Corporation of Clarinda, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the Week  during National Women's Small Business Month.   Lisle Corporation was founded by C.A. Lisle in Clarinda, IA, in 1903  as a manufacturer of horse-powered water well drilling machines. During  the 1920s, Lisle Corporation began producing tools, with their first  tool being a valve refacer. They also began producing a master ignition  vibrator for the Ford Model T during this time period. Prior to World  War II, they made magnetic drain plugs which were used in military  equipment during the war. In the decades after, Lisle Corporation's  manufacturing has grown to include additional automotive tools and is  now known for its mechanic's creepers, lubrication, and tire products,  among their 700 specialty automotive products. Lisle Corporation also  grew when it acquired EZ Way, Inc., a patient handling products company  based in Clarinda.   Lisle Corporation is currently run by Lisle family member Mary  Landhuis, who became president in 2018. She is also president of EZ  Way, Inc. in addition to her duties at Lisle Corporation. While in this  position, she has served on the Iowa State Workforce Development Board  and the Statewide Career and Technical Education Advisory Council.   Lisle Corporation is an exemplary family business. They have had six  generations of the Lisle family work at the company and have been  awarded for their contributions to the tool industry. In 2019, former  president Fred Lisle was posthumously awarded the Iowa Association of  Business and Industry Manufacturing Legend award for his contributions  to the industry and the Clarinda community. Fred was a board member of  several organizations in the community to help grow Clarinda and  encourage young residents to stay in the area, leaving a legacy of  generosity and leadership. For their work during World War II, Lisle  Corporation was awarded the Army-Navy ``E'' Award for their outstanding  war effort productions. In 2023, Lisle Corporation celebrated its 120th  business anniversary.   Lisle Corporation's commitment to providing high-quality automotive  tools to customers throughout the United States while maintaining their  Clarinda roots is clear. I want to congratulate the Lisle family and  the entire team at Lisle Corporation for their continued dedication to  providing affordable and high-quality tools to Iowans. I look forward  to seeing their continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
