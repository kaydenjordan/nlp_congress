 Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate the words of my friend from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), and she has an amendment that is going to  help a lot of folks in my district.   Mr. Speaker, I continue to hear some people say that they think  Robert Mueller is going to be fair-minded, he is going to do a good  job. But I think probably more than any of my Republican friends that  profess to think they know Robert Mueller, I don't think they know him  as well as I do, and on the research I have done on the man, the  dealings I have had with him, the questions I have asked him.   But I don't think they know him as well as Eric Holder does, and Eric  Holder said a month or so ago he has known Bob Mueller for 20, 30  years, and, in essence, he wasn't going to stop until he found  something he could pin on Donald Trump.   That is the essence, and I think he is right.   We see from Robert Mueller's history that when he decides somebody is  not a good person, even when he is 100 percent wrong, then it justifies  in his mind putting them in prison, leaving them for the rest of their  lives, destroying their lives, destroying any friendships, family,  caring relationship. He doesn't care.   He has destroyed good people, completely destroyed good people, and  as he has said more than once after he has destroyed good people, and  in the case of Dr. Hatfill, the government had an over $6 million  payout to him for the  [[Page H3968]]  way Bob Mueller destroyed his life as an innocent individual, he said  he had nothing to apologize for.   And see, in his mind, he doesn't think he does. He is justified in  destroying anybody he doesn't like, anybody he disagrees with. And he  is determined in his mind that Donald Trump is somebody that needs to  be brought down.   It is so ironic, though. Here he was, pleading for the job of  Director of the FBI again. He had already been that once. He did more  damage than anybody since J. Edgar Hoover, and got 2 extra years  because Obama liked the way that he was protecting President Obama and  Eric Holder, and they gave him 2 extra years, much to the dismay of so  many good FBI agents around the country and the thousands and thousands  of years of experience of good FBI agents that he ran off, leaving our  country all the more vulnerable because of his bad decisions.   But after I had had some of our Members approach me after a  Republican Conference and say: Louie, you know so much about Robert  Mueller. Is there one article we could go read where we would kind of  get up to speed on his background?   And I said: Well, there are hundreds of articles I have read; some  helpful, some not. But every time I did preparation to question him  when he came before our committee, I did more and more study. And they  said it would really be helpful if we had one place we could just go  read stuff about Robert Mueller's background.   So that inspired me to start writing, and I accumulated from other  writers, always giving them proper credit, and put together a 48-page  article about Bob Mueller. This does scratch the surface, but there is  so much more that could be touched.   Apparently, he served honorably and well in Vietnam, but that doesn't  give him the right to ruin the country. It doesn't give him the right  to destroy innocent people's lives.   And so here is just one chapter from my 48-page article, Mr. Speaker,  and this particular chapter is entitled ``Death of Dr. Steven Hatfill's  Reputation and Productive Life.''   Here is how Mollie Hemingway of The Federalist described the  combination Mueller/Comey debacle: ``The FBI absolutely bungled its  investigation into the anthrax attacker who struck after 9/11 terrorist  attacks.   ``Carl Cannon goes through this story very well, and it is worth  reading for how it involves both Comey and his dear `friend' and  current special counsel Robert Mueller. The FBI tried--in the media-- its case against Hatfill. Their actual case ended up being thrown out  by the courts.''   I believe this is Carl Cannon's account: ``Comey and Mueller badly  bungled the biggest case they ever handled. They botched the  investigation of the 2001 anthrax letter attacks that took five lives  and infected 17 other people, shut down the U.S. Capitol and  Washington's mail system, solidified the Bush administration's  antipathy for Iraq, and eventually, when the facts finally came out,  made the FBI look feckless, incompetent, and easily manipulated by  outside political pressure.''   And I would insert here, that is exactly what has been proven with  most of the big cases that Robert Mueller has personally been involved  in.   Carl Cannon goes on and says, ``In truth, Hatfill was an implausible  suspect from the outset. He was a virologist who never handled anthrax,  which is a bacterium. Ivins, by contract, shared ownership of anthrax  patents, was diagnosed as having paranoid personality disorder, and had  a habit of stalking and threatening people with anonymous letters,  including the woman who provided the long-ignored tip to the FBI.''   So I would insert here, the FBI has gotten a lot of tips and warnings  from very helpful, caring Americans, and even from Russia. Because we  know that Russian officials tipped off Robert Mueller, tipped off the  FBI, that the older Tsarnaev brother had become radicalized, he was  going to be a threat to the lives of Americans, and, in fact, Russia  had warned the U.S. twice.   So perhaps there is the Russian collusion. Bob Mueller and the  Russians, in fact. Unfortunately for all of those poor people that were  killed or injured at Boston, Robert Mueller was not competent enough to  realize the seriousness of the older Tsarnaev's radicalization, so  people died and Robert Mueller continued to go on witch hunts for wrong  people.   He continued to protect radical Islamists. As some FBI agents have  informed me, basically they said: Our training under Mueller on radical  Islam was, when you get a credible warning or tip from an American  citizen about a potential radical Islamist threat, then you probably  have gotten that tip from an Islamophobe, and you probably need to  investigate the person that gave you the tip.   We know of cases played out in the news where that is exactly what  happened. Poor guy, I believe it was in Florida, that gave the tips  this guy is a threat, and what happened? The FBI investigated him, but  they didn't investigate the man that would go kill others.                                time  2100    This article goes on: ``So what evidence did the FBI have against  Hatfill? There was none, so the agency did a Hail Mary, importing two  bloodhounds from California whose handlers claimed could sniff the  scent of the killer on the anthrax-tainted letters. These dogs were  shown to Hatfill, who promptly petted them. When the dogs responded  favorably''--of course, they were being petted--their handlers then  told the FBI that the dogs had alerted on Hatfill and he must therefore  be the killer.   There was no--let me repeat--there was no evidence whatsoever that  Steven Hatfill was the anthrax killer.   Talking to some folks in Washington recently, one of them pointed  out: Well, you know, actually, that also fits the mold that Mueller has  created for himself. Here he purged the FBI training materials of  anything that offended radical Islamist terrorists, but as agents have  told me, both intel and FBI, Mueller blinded our FBI of the ability to  see our enemy. He took away some of their best training materials, one  700-page bit of training workbook on radical Islam. He had ordered that  destroyed. He didn't want anybody to know how to recognize a radical  Islamist. He would rather his FBI--Mueller's FBI agents--investigate  those making complaints for being Islamophobes.   ``Unfortunately, both Mueller and Comey were absolutely and totally  convinced of the innocent man's guilt. They ruined his life, his  relationship with friends, neighbors, and potential employers.   ``And from Carl Cannon, Real Clear Politics:   ``You'd think that any good FBI agent would have kicked these quacks  in the fanny and found their dogs a good home. Or at least checked news  accounts of criminal cases in California where these same dogs had been  used against defendants who'd been convicted--and later exonerated. As  Pulitzer Prize-winning Los Angeles Times investigative reporter David  Willman detailed in his authoritative book on the case, a California  judge who'd tossed out a murder conviction based on these sketchy  canines called the prosecution's dog handler `as biased as any witness  that this court has ever seen.'   ``Instead, Mueller, who micromanaged the anthrax case and fell in  love with the dubious dog evidence, and personally assured Ashcroft and  presumably George W. Bush that in Steven Hatfill, the Bureau had its  man . . .   ``Mueller didn't exactly distinguish himself with contrition, either.  In 2008, after Ivins committed suicide''--that is the person he went  after after they were assured Hatfill was completely innocent. They go  after Dr. Ivins. He ends up committing suicide. ``. . . and the Justice  Department had formally exonerated Hatfill.''   It is important to know, Mr. Speaker, Mueller didn't exonerate  Hatfill; the evidence did. Mueller doesn't believe in apologizing after  he destroys people's lives, and he could not bother to apologize after  he wrecks a constitutional government, republic, as we are here, and  that is why, after the government paid Dr. Hatfill $5.82 million in a  legal settlement--that is $150,000 per year for 20 years, plus $2.82  million cash, but ``Mueller could not be bothered to walk across the  street to attend the press conference announcing the case's resolution.  When reporters did ask him about it, Mueller was graceless. `I do not  apologize for any aspect  [[Page H3969]]  of the investigation,' he said, adding that it would be erroneous `to  say there were mistakes.' ''   He ruins a man's life. People with better judgment than Mueller  decided: My gosh, we have destroyed an innocent man. We will pay him $6  million to try to recompense him in some way for all of the damage  Mueller did to him and his family and his life. All Mueller has got to  say is: It would be erroneous to say that mistakes were made.   You have got to understand, Mr. Speaker, when Mueller goes after  somebody to destroy them, even though they are not guilty of that for  which he is pursuing them, he doesn't feel he has made a mistake. He  presumes in his mind that he pursues only bad people, and when he  destroys a person who is innocent of the crime for which he was  pursuing them, in his mind it is not a mistake. He pursued a bad  person, and, therefore, he doesn't owe an apology to anybody.   Going back to the article: ``Though FBI jurisdiction has its  limitations, Mueller's ego does not.   ``Mueller and Comey's next target in the anthrax case was Dr. Bruce  Ivins. As the FBI was closing in and preparing to give him the ultimate  Hatfill treatment, Dr. Ivins took his own life. Though Mueller and  Comey were every bit as convinced that Dr. Ivins was the anthrax  culprit as they were that Dr. Hatfill was, there are lingering  questions about whether or not there was a case beyond a reasonable  doubt. Since Dr. Ivins is deceased and had some mental issues, we are  expected to simply accept that he was definitely the anthrax killer and  drop the whole matter. That's a difficult ask after taxpayer money paid  off Mueller's previous victim. Mueller had relentlessly dogged Dr.  Hatfill using life-destroying, Orwellian tactics. Either Mueller was  wrong when he said it would be a mistake, `to say there were mistakes,'  in the railroading of Hatfill or Mueller did intentionally and  knowingly persecute an innocent man.''   That is the bottom line. He says, ``we didn't make a mistake.'' If  they didn't make a mistake, if Mueller didn't make a mistake, then it  means he intentionally and knowingly used the full power of the United  States Justice Department to destroy an innocent man, again, innocently  and knowingly destroying the life of an innocent man.   So either he lied when he said ``we made no mistakes,'' or he didn't  lie when he said ``we made no mistakes.'' If he didn't lie, it means he  intentionally destroyed the life of an innocent man. It is that simple.   So the book goes through 48 pages, sets out a number of things like  this. When I hear my friends, especially down the hall in the Senate,  talk about what a great man Mueller is, either, number one, they are  intentionally keeping themselves ignorant of facts, or, number two,  they want Donald Trump kicked out of the White House as quickly as  possible. Those are the two possibilities, and I hope the American  public will wake up to that.    Now, it is also interesting, here we have got Mueller raiding, or  being an accessory to the raid of Donald Trump's personal attorney's  home and office, places where he was. Lo and behold, it shouldn't  surprise anybody, but it turns out this article from April 17, by Jeff  Murdock: ``Federal Judge Kimba Wood, who is overseeing the court case  against Donald Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, officiated the  2013 wedding of George Soros, a billionaire supporter of liberal  political causes, according to the news reports at that time.''   Now, I would submit, Mr. Speaker, that he is not just a supporter of  liberal political causes. He supports anything that will help destroy  the moral, upstanding United States of America that has been the  greatest gift freedom has ever had in the world.   The article goes on here, though it says: ``The judge,'' Kimba Wood,  ``is currently weighing whether to have a neutral third party review  the documents seized in FBI raids on the office, home, and hotel of Mr.  Cohen.   ``Mr. Cohen's attorneys have sought to keep the government from  reviewing the materials by asserting attorney-client privilege''--a  legitimate privilege, of course. ``Prosecutors have demanded access to  those documents claiming they are related to an ongoing criminal  investigation.   ``The government is currently probing Mr. Cohen's $130,000 payment to  porn star Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels, for  possible violations of campaign finance laws.   ``Judge Wood, who will decide those issues, married Mr. Soros, then  83, and his 42-year-old bride, Tamiko Bolton, in September 2013, media  outlets reported at that time.   ``The Bedford, New York, wedding was attended by 500 guests,  including top Democrats such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of  California and then-California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom. U2  front man Bono also attended the reception, Reuters reported in a 2013  article.   ``In lieu of gifts, the couple asked that donations be made to  several organizations, including Planned Parenthood and Global Witness,  an environmental activist group, according to Reuters.   ``Mr. Soros donated nearly $10 million to political action committees  that supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Presidential election. He  also chaired the national finance committee for a pro-Clinton PAC,  dubbed Ready for Hillary.   ``Judge Wood was also then-President Bill Clinton's second, but  failed nominee for U.S. Attorney General in 1993. Mr. Clinton had  nominated Zoe Baird, but she was withdrawn after it was revealed she  had hired an illegal immigrant as a nanny and did not pay taxes on the  employee. Judge Wood was then selected, but she had also employed an  illegal immigrant, but did pay taxes on the employee. Fearing a repeat  of the same disastrous nomination of Ms. Baird, Mr. Clinton quickly  removed Judge Wood from consideration.   ``Media reports at that time said Judge Wood had not told the White  House about the nanny even when she had been asked directly. Judge Wood  said in a statement that she had not misled the White House.''   In any event, people that care about fair, impartial, and blind  justice that doesn't decide a case by looking to see who is on either  side, they are sickened by what has been happening at the Department of  Justice, at the top of the FBI, and under a special prosecutor who has  made abundantly clear by his hires of those--not who would be fair and  impartial, but those who would help Mueller do as he is so good at  doing, and that is finding somebody he doesn't like and destroying  their lives.                                time  2115    The additional problem in this case is that if he destroys and uses  his illegal tactics and unfair weight to throw against innocent people  as he has in his past, it won't just be Bob Mueller destroying one  life, as he has in a number of these cases we discussed, but it will be  removing an elected President of the United States.   I pray and I will do what I can to ensure that people wake up, people  come peacefully out in America, and make clear that this railroading,  egotistical, and unapologetic man who has destroyed the good that was  once top to bottom of the FBI and who has destroyed innocent lives  without apology, this man has no business being special counsel. In  fact, he needs to be investigated for his role with Rosenstein, their  role, along with the guy that Mueller brought along to help investigate  Russia.   I am not talking about the alleged collusion of the Trump campaign in  Russia. I am talking about the real collusion with Russia where Mueller  even had an inside informant providing evidence of Russia's illegal  activity in trying to obtain American uranium, and instead of using all  of that information of Russia's illegal activity to obtain American  uranium, Rosenstein, Mueller, and Weissmann put the quash on  information about all of that investigation.   They threatened and coerced their informer into keeping his mouth  shut so that the sale could go through of American uranium that would  end up in Russian hands. So that sale would go through, and lo and  behold, the Clinton Foundation would be $145 million richer in gifts  from those grateful people that benefited from Russia ultimately  getting American uranium.   Mueller needs to be investigated, as does Comey, as does Rosenstein,  as does Weissmann. They are the last people on this Earth who ought to  be investigating somebody else over alleged  [[Page H3970]]  Russian collusion. Mr. Speaker, you needn't look any further than the  investigators themselves.   Mueller, in his arrogance, showed the country and world he was not  interested in fair, impartial justice. He wanted people who hated Trump  and who loved Hillary Clinton and helped her all they could, because he  had determined that he was going to undermine the election of Donald J.  Trump as President. And if he is not--Rosenstein is the one who has to  be removed first. He has got to be removed. He has got to be  investigated. I hope and pray that is going to happen, that Rosenstein  is going to be investigated.   I can't count on Bob Mueller to do the honorable thing. There are so  many examples where he had a great opportunity to do the honorable  thing by people whom he has wronged and whose lives he has destroyed.  He was careful always to avoid doing the right thing, making comments  as if he had nothing for which to apologize for destroying innocent  lives.   That doesn't even get into the Ted Stevens case. He had to have been  all over the top of that case. He was the director of the FBI. You know  good and well they didn't investigate the longest serving Republican  Senator without Bob Mueller being all over the case. They framed an  innocent man, manufactured evidence, and destroyed evidence of his  innocence. It wasn't just a reasonable doubt he was innocent; he was  innocent.   They manufactured charges, and one might say: Well, but we don't have  direct testimony, direct evidence that Mueller personally knew of the  frame-up of Ted Stevens. But what we do know is when the whistleblower  FBI agent came out with sworn testimony of the frame-up of the innocent  Ted Stevens, that God-fearing whistleblower was run out of the FBI, and  the one that he reported the wrongdoing on continued to get glowing  praise, advances, and promotions from Bob Mueller.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 20 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, May 16, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
