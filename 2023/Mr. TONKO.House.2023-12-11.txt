 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from New Jersey  for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this legislation. I thank my  colleagues and friends, Representative Guthrie and Representative  Kuster, for their work on the Support for Patients and Communities  Reauthorization Act.   As you may know, I serve as co-chair of the Addiction, Treatment, and  Recovery Caucus, or better known as the ATR Caucus.   The ATR Caucus is a bipartisan group of over 70 members committed to  advancing bipartisan solutions to the country's multifaceted addiction  crisis. Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the caucus, the  first in Congress to recognize that addiction, indeed, is a disease.   As a longtime champion for those facing addiction, I am all too  familiar with the devastating impact of the disease for individuals,  their families, and their communities. This is a loss many of us know  too well--the loss of a daughter, a son, a father, a mother, a sister,  or brother. The loss of a neighbor dying much too young and leaving  behind a grieving family and communities being ripped apart by poison  seemingly beyond their control.   Last year, in our Nation, there was an estimated 109,680 overdose  deaths. That is 109,680 lives lost.   Let's think of how many people that is every day needlessly dying and  having their lives cut so short. Think of the magnitude of all those  impacted by those 109,680 loved ones. For each of those individuals,  there is a whole universe of friends, of family, and, of course,  communities impacted.   As we consider the SUPPORT Act reauthorization, let me share that  clearly there are some good policies we are moving forward. I am glad  that we are reauthorizing several programs that have been successful. I  am pleased that we are including my Extending Access to Addiction  Treatment Act that I was proud to work on with my friend,  Representative Armstrong.   As you may know, medication-assisted treatment for addiction  significantly reduces the risk of overdose death. However, despite the  effectiveness, approximately 87 percent of individuals with opioid use  disorder who may benefit from lifesaving medication-assisted treatment  simply do not receive it.   My Extending Access to Addiction Treatment Act makes permanent the  requirement that Medicaid provide coverage for addiction medication for  Americans who need it. I also think we are taking a step in the right  direction by requiring States to suspend rather than terminate coverage  of Medicaid for justice-involved individuals making it easier to  restart those benefits upon release.   We also include a provision to allow pregnant incarcerated  individuals who are being detained pretrial to maintain their Medicaid  coverage. I fully support the legislation and remind everyone that we  have a lot more work to do in order to take the necessary steps to  address the deep need of this crisis.   We all know the scale of the devastating disease of addiction. We  also know that our justice system is a revolving door for those  struggling with addiction and mental health issues. Over one-half of  people in State prisons and two-thirds of individuals in jails have  substance use disorder, or SUD.   To truly address it, I urge us to take bold action and move forward  as soon  [[Page H6796]]  as possible with the Reentry Act and the Due Process Continuity of Care  Act. By allowing inmates to receive addiction treatment and other  services before returning home, my Reentry Act would bring targeted  treatment to those at the highest risk of overdose.   The Reentry Act would be a game changer for reducing overdose deaths  and suicides by allowing all States to provide prerelease care to  Medicaid-eligible individuals up to 30 days prior to release from  incarceration.   The Due Process Continuity of Care Act would make certain that  pretrial detainees are not kicked off Medicaid prior to even being  found guilty of a crime.    Mr. Speaker, we know the human cost of inaction. To be  precise, last year it was 109,680 lives we lost. Is that a cost we are  willing to bear?   With that in mind, our work is not done, and I hope we can find the  will to truly meet the moment.   This legislation is a good step forward, but it is not the end of the  road. Again, this disease of despair requires hope, and we can provide  that hope to the individuals who look to us to be the agents of that  hope.   Mr. Speaker, again, I would urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to celebrate the life and  service of Mr. Ron Byrne, a pillar of New York's Capital Region  community who sadly passed away on November 8.   When Ron's mother experienced a debilitating fall, he saw a group of  local retirees come together to assist her with her daily needs.   Inspired by that outpouring of support, Ron devised an idea: an  organization that would connect handy retirees and certified  contractors with elderly homeowners who need help with errands, home  repairs, or landscaping.   In 1995, Ron brought this idea to life and founded the Umbrella of  the Capital District.   Today, this organization serves more than 500 homes in Albany,  Saratoga, Schenectady, and Rensselaer Counties, enthusiastically  helping seniors and people with disabilities to maintain their homes,  their independence, and, yes, their dignity.   His unwavering commitment to service and community was a beacon to us  all, and his impact will continue to be felt by all in my district.   Ron Byrne, rest in peace.                            ____________________
