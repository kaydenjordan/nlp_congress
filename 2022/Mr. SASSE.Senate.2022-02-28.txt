 Madam President, first I would like to associate myself  with the comments of the Senator from Ohio, Senator Portman. He was  eloquent, as always, about a pressing issue--not only the defense  budget issues but the heroism of the Ukrainian people and the  implications it should have for us in this Chamber this week and  beyond.   Thank you, Senator Portman.   Madam President, it is a little after 4 a.m. in Kyiv, the capital of  Ukraine, and President Zelenskyy is still fighting, Ukrainians are  still fighting, and Americans need to know their stories. Ukrainians  need us to tell their stories.   This story starts, of course, with an unjust, unprovoked invasion.  The people of Ukraine posed no threat. They provoked no violence. They  lived freely on Russia's southwest border with their iconic wheat  fields.   Many of us have been to Ukraine. We made friends there, but we also  have Ukrainian American friends back in our States.   Living freely on the southwest border of Russia was enough to provoke  the small man--the tyrant of Russia--to hatred. It is bizarre. They  lived in freedom. So Putin decided he was threatened.   Vladimir Putin, Russia's desperate Nebuchadnezzar, thought he could  crush Ukraine. He thought he could break their spirit. He thought he  could put his boot on their neck. He actually thinks that freedom makes  people soft; so he thought this would be easy.   He was wrong. Over the last week, Ukrainians have shown us their  fighting spirit. They have shown the world their fighting spirit. They  are standing firm against onslaught after onslaught, including the  relentless targeting of now-civilian populations.   Outmanned and outgunned, the Ukrainian Army is making Putin pay pints  of blood for every inch his army advances. The truth is, Putin didn't  expect to encounter much resistance. He looked back on his experience  in the Donbas, where he took big swaths of territory with a few dozen  bullets, and he was convinced that the Ukrainian people would fold in  the face of his giant army. He has been caught off guard, and his plans  have been set back.   He didn't anticipate the bravery. He didn't anticipate the passion.  He didn't  [[Page S830]]  anticipate the heroism. He didn't anticipate the Ukrainian people. He  didn't anticipate the way ordinary villagers would stand and rise up  against their occupiers, like the one small woman who approached a  group of Russian soldiers and began handing them handfuls of sunflower  seeds. Why? She told them it was so that flowers--something beautiful-- could grow on the places where their bodies rot after they were killed  in the Ukraine.   She spoke for all Ukrainians. She spoke for the Kyiv grandmas arming  up with AK-47s. She spoke for the grandpas who are having to reenlist  in their late years. She spoke for the students now learning how to  make Molotov cocktails. She spoke for fathers who have to kiss their  children goodbye as they head back to the frontlines of battle. And she  is speaking prophetically in advance for the mothers who are going to  bury their sons.   The truth is, Putin has been embarrassed over the last 5 or 6 days by  the Ukrainians.   Modern tyrants have developed a few strategies to fight truth- telling. The Chinese Communist Party's version is trying to suppress  all information--to choke it off, to make sure no one says anything  that is true. Others, like in Russia, decide to blast a billion lies  through state-run media, hoping that they can just blot out the truth  and sow so much confusion and nonsense that people can't find the  needle in the haystack that is the truth.   But in the middle of this crisis, these strategies are failing  because people are hungry for stories. People need stories. We need  stories. The best and the most powerful stories are almost always the  true stories. And, right now, Ukraine is retelling an age-old story of  good and evil. And the reason their story is so powerful is because  they are telling the true story. If we were to stand here tonight--and  Senator Portman and I and many others have been in the SCIF today for  many, many hours. I have been there four or five times, and most of us  have been there the last hour and a half, 2 hours. And if we were to  tell every story of Ukrainian bravery, the Senate wouldn't have time to  get anything else done this week.   But there is one store that stands out over the course of this last  week, since Putin began his unjust invasion. It has given rise for the  courageous Ukrainian resistance to find for themselves a new motto, and  this is the story of Snake Island.   There is this little island in the Black Sea, near the mouth at the  bottom of the Danube Delta. It is called Snake Island, and it is really  small, but it is both strategically and symbolically important because  it marks the boundary of Ukraine's territorial waters. Ukraine has  always stationed a small number of border guards on this island to keep  watch.    In 2019, the current President, Zelenskyy, went to this tiny little  piece of rock and he declared: ``This island, like the rest of our  territory, is Ukrainian land, and we will defend it with all our  might.''   Nobody in 2019 knew he was speaking prophecy. But, right now, over  the course of the last week, the world has seen and the world has heard  the story. The world has heard the recording of what those 13 Ukrainian  heroes did last Thursday as they sought to defend that little piece of  rock because it was symbolically important, as all of Ukraine was, that  it is not Russia.   Shortly after Putin ordered his troops to attack Ukraine, two Russian  naval vessels approached Snake Island and their intent was to seize it.  The Russian commander ordered the Ukrainian border guards that they  must surrender. He thought he could intimidate them. But like their  commander in chief, the dictator--the liar Putin--he was wrong. They  couldn't intimidate these men. So he announced that they needed to  surrender or they would be fired upon. The Snake Island guards refused  to give an inch. One Ukrainian, after conversing with some of his  colleagues a little bit--on a recording many of you may have now  heard--decided to turn up the volume and he announced: ``Russian  warship, idi nahui''--``idi nahui.''   Russians decided to open fire on the island, pounding it with heavy  ordnance and, eventually, troops would storm the beach and capture the  garrison. But that one sentence--``Russian warship, idi nahui''--that  is now the rallying cry of the Ukrainian resistance. It was heard this  morning when a Georgian gas station on the sea decided that it wouldn't  refuel the Russian ship. And when the Russian ship said, ``What are you  talking about?'' they said: No, you are the bad guys.   The Russians said: Why can't we put politics aside? Just let us buy  some gas.   These Georgians decided to repeat the new Ukrainian motto back to the  gas station and said: Get the hell out of here.   And the gas station pulled away and said: Russian warship, you guys  look strong enough. Why don't you row?   That sentence sums up the spirit of countless courageous, brave  Ukrainians and what they are doing as they stand in the face of the  much larger invading forces.   Snake Island is incomprehensible to a man like Vladimir Putin. He  doesn't understand human dignity. He doesn't understand courage. He  doesn't understand principle. He is too small. He doesn't understand  why people would fight for freedom. This is a man who spent the last 30  years--20 of them now--as the ruler fighting to return Russia to  tyranny, fighting to take away the freedom of his people, fighting to  take away the liberty and freedom of those on Russia's borders. He  doesn't want any of his near neighbors to know freedom. He thinks  tyranny is the order of things. And, again, he is wrong.   Unlike Putin, though, our people--the reason so many Americans have  been rallying to the Ukrainian cause over the course of the last week-- our people fully understand the spirit of Snake Island. We may not know  Snake Island geographically, but we understand what is beating in the  hearts of the people who now wanted to echo that motto.   We breathe freedom. We believe in the ideas of the Declaration of  Independence. We strive to create a more perfect Union here, where  everyone is recognized as having been created equal. We often fail in  our execution, but it is our aspiration to affirm universal human  dignity and the destiny of people to be free, for we believe that every  human is created in the image of God, and there is nothing government  can do to erase that.   We have no love for strong men and tyrants. We understand the men of  Snake Island in a way that Vladimir Putin cannot, for we believe in  human dignity. We believe in universal rights. We believe in freedom  from oppression. What we love, Vladimir Putin hates.   Today, Ukraine is standing against a dictator who rejects each and  every one of the principles that we have affirmed in our credo founding  documents. The defenders of Snake Island and, indeed, all the members  of the Ukrainian resistance now are looking to add their names to the  list of heroes, from the warriors of Thermopylae to the activists who  brought down the Iron Curtain. This heroism is timeless.   Loving freedom didn't make Snake Island's defenders weak. Though they  were outgunned, they were strong. The Ukrainians are fighting for a  reason: love of country, hatred of oppression, and the aim they have to  pass on a free Ukraine to their children for generations to come.   This national resistance, expressed so eloquently by these guards of  Snake Island, has also come to find itself embodied in another one of  the great new heroes on the global stage, and that is President  Zelenskyy. Just a few years ago, this man was an actor and a comedian.  Now, though, he has shown such bravery that we see his name listed  alongside heroes and great statesmen like Winston Churchill and Charles  de Gaulle.   As Russian troops bore down on Kyiv, Zelenskyy could have chosen to  flee his country. You might have read some reports that the U.S. State  Department allegedly offered to evacuate him and his family. But,  instead, Zelenskyy chose that he would stay on the frontlines and lead  his people. ``The fight is here,'' he said. ``I need ammunition, not a  ride.''   Putin, meanwhile, is off hiding in a bunker, trembling in fear of his  own people. People are marching in the streets to oppose his pointless  war, and his only response is to try to choke off their speech and to  imprison them.   Zelenskyy, on the other hand, fights shoulder to shoulder with the  men and  [[Page S831]]  women who are trying to defend his country. You may have seen him  breaking bread with some guys this morning. He has put his life on the  line for his country, and he is not backing down, and his bravery has  changed the world this week.   We don't know how things are going to unfold over the course of the  next weeks and months, but Zelenskyy has changed the trajectory this  week of Germany, of Finland, of Sweden, of Switzerland, and of kids all  over the 7.8 billion-person planet. Zelenskyy is a symbol, and as a  courageous man, he has already changed the world. He is a bigger man  than Putin. The whole world knows that. Putin's own army knows that.  Even Putin's cronies now know that.   But it is not just the Ukrainians who are going to be burying their  dead. Russians are going to be burying many of their sons, as well.  Thousands of Russians--many of whom are conscripts--will have died  needlessly for Vladimir Putin's lies and his vanity.   Putin told Russian parents that their sons were off on training  exercise and that they would be welcomed as heroes at the end of these  exercises. He didn't tell them they would be shot, lit on fire, blown  to bits. He didn't say these things because he is a liar.   While we applaud the bravery of Ukrainians, we should not overlook  the humanity of these Russians who will also die, for the West's  battle--freedom's battle--is not with Russian moms who didn't even know  their boys were being deployed, women who would not desire to have the  dictator Putin send their sons to ruin. Human beings are made in the  image of God and are dying, and Vladimir Putin alone bears  responsibility.   His evil ambitions are destroying not just Ukrainian bodies and souls  but also Russian bodies and souls, and this conflict, this chosen war  of aggression by Vladimir Putin, is disgusting, and if he actually  cared for anything bigger than his ego, if he actually cared for his  people, if he actually cared for his nation, the generations of  Russians whom this war is going to impoverish, then he would find an  off-ramp now. That is what a bigger man would do.   Ukraine, on the other hand, is not the aggressor here. We are seeing  a people fighting for their survival because Putin has given them no  other choice, and his thugs will keep on killing innocents until they  are expelled from Ukraine's borders.   We obviously don't know how history will unfold here, but we do know  that truth is on the Ukrainians' side, and the truth is this: that the  boys of Snake Island and President Zelenskyy and the broader Ukrainian  national resistance are mounting a defense of freedom unlike anything  the West has seen since the end of the Cold War.   And that is why this story of Snake Island matters. It is why  Zelenskyy's bravery is so important, not just for Ukraine but for the  whole world. And it is why that little woman's sunflower seeds are so  inspired--for ordinary Ukrainians are responding to Putin's aggression  with extraordinary heroism.   We should be in awe of what our friends are accomplishing. Make no  mistake though, war is not an abstraction. Our 21st century jargon  about kinetic action and lethal force tries to paper over a reality as  old as Cain and Abel. War is young men and young women struggling for a  last gasp of air while their blood soaks into the mud.   War is started by the old but usually waged by the young, and no one  in their right mind would ever wish for war, for it is ugly. But the  cause can be necessary, and, in this case, the Ukrainian cause is just.  Their war for their country, for their freedom, and for their kids'  futures is just. The Ukrainians are willing to shed their blood for  their cause, but, as importantly, they are willing to soak the streets  with the blood of Russians, who have been sent by the comfortable  tyrant Putin, who sends his people to die pointlessly far from home  while he consumes the billions that he has stolen from those same  people.   Let's be steely-eyed about the coming days and weeks, because things  tonight, at 4:30 in the morning, in Ukraine, are ugly, and they are  going to get much, much worse. But Ukraine's heroes, despite of the  dark nights that are ahead--their heroes--deserve our reverence. While  it is ugly in Ukraine, their stories need to be told around the world  by free people who believe in human dignity, for there is a great  pantheon of freedom fighters across time, men and women who have died  fighting tyrants, and we should tell their story. We must celebrate  their cause, and we should arm them with as many Javelins and Stingers  and rifles as they can possibly use.   We should ship them rations and ammo, and we should share actionable  intelligence in realtime with them so they can try to repel the  invading force, for as long as they are fighting tyrants, America  stands with them and America will arm them, and I am convinced that  this Senate will rise to the call to arm these Ukrainian freedom  fighters in memory of those boys from Snake Island and all those who  are joining their throng.   Glory to Ukraine. Glory to her heroes. America stands with you.                            ____________________
