 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a group of  women in my district for their hard work that led to a historic game at  Carver-Hawkeye Arena.   On Sunday, the Iowa Women's Basketball team earned an impressive 88- 61 win in their Big Ten Conference opener against Michigan State.   With almost 7,000 people in attendance at Carver-Hawkeye Arena, Lisa  Bluder and her Hawkeyes showcased their court dominance with Caitlin  Clark adding 24 points, 12 assists, and 10 rebounds, making her second  triple-double in the six games since our season opener against New  Hampshire.   And the icing on top? All those watching got to see Coach Lisa Bluder  earn her 800th career win, a monumental achievement, to be sure.   Congratulations, Lady Hawkeyes, and give yourselves a pat on the back  for all the hard work you put in during the off season. I look forward  to seeing what else this team has in store in the coming months.                            ____________________
