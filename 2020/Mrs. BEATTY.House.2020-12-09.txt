 Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute and salute a person  who has dedicated 20 years of her life to this institution, coming here  in 2000 as a young, brilliant regulatory attorney to work in the Senate  as a senior LA, then to the House as a legislative director, then to be  the staff attorney for the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, and,  finally, to my office as chief of staff and counsel, the only chief of  staff I have had since 2013.   She is one of the most loyal, hardest working, dedicated, and  intelligent individuals I have worked with. I consider it an honor to  have worked with her.   Her footprints are deep. They leave an impression to guide others.  Her words of wisdom, generosity, historical knowledge, quickness to  speak, analytical thoughts, late night conversations, and early morning  pickups to work make her my national treasure.   This woman is Kimberly Ross, Esquire, Chief of Staff, who serves  faithfully to this institution and to me.   Kimberly, you have climbed every mountain, now enjoy the view. Happy  retirement. And to you and your wonderful husband, Bernard, good luck  and congratulations on your next venture.                            ____________________
