 Madam Speaker, I thank the Representative from  Pennsylvania for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield  myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, we are here today to debate the rule governing the  consideration of the Fairness in Orphan Drug Exclusivity Act and the  resolution to condemn the horrific shootings in Atlanta this past  March.   I want to say right away that it is not the substance of these two  bills to which I take exception; it is the process the majority is  following or not following to move legislation forward.   The first bill in this rule is H. Res. 275, a resolution condemning  the horrific shootings in Atlanta, Georgia, this past March. As Members  of the House of Representatives, we unequivocally condemn violence and  hate against any person or group of people. What happened in Atlanta is  an unimaginable tragedy that must be denounced in no uncertain terms. I  support the idea of the resolution, but not the way my colleagues in  the majority are handling it.   The majority chose to circumvent the prescribed process for a  resolution of this nature, bypassing the usual committee markup  altogether and sidestepping an opportunity for the majority to address  concerns from the minority and allow the House to speak with one  unified voice.    That is not the way the people's House was intended to work, and it  negatively affects both Members of this body and our constituents when  we can't have the kind of discussion required on important pieces of  legislation like this.   The other underlying bill, H.R. 1629, the Fairness in Orphan Drug  Exclusivity Act, came before the House last week and failed to garner  the two-thirds majority needed to pass on suspension after one of our  Republican colleagues was left off the bill that he had long  championed, left off the bill for an issue unrelated to the bill.   Again, I support H.R. 1629 and hope you will, too. But not only did  the Democrats ignore the spirit of bipartisanship by which they claim  to abide and block Republican Members from signing on to this bill,  they did so by continuing to ram through bills without any respect for  process, rules, or courtesy, which brings me to the extension of rule  changes included in the resolution.   It has been 1 year since this body instituted martial law, as my  friend and colleague Ranking Member Cole said during the Rules  Committee hearing yesterday. While at the time there was certainly a  need for changes to the rules to rapidly move legislation at the onset  of the pandemic, the landscape has dramatically shifted, and we are  more than ready to get back to normal.   Instead, more than 1 year later, we are still being governed by  martial law in what has become the least transparent Congress ever.  Democrats in the majority continue to chip away at the rights of the  minority. Before we know it, those in the minority will have no rights  left at all.   The majority of us in this body are fully vaccinated. The science  says that fully vaccinated individuals can and should resume  prepandemic behavior. So why won't the Democratic majority follow the  science and resume regular order in this body?   It is the American people who are losing out, and it would behoove  the Democratic majority to bring the time-tested processes and  transparency back to this institution.   Madam Speaker, I do support the underlying bills. However, I have  serious concerns over the continuance of measures in this rule that  limit transparency and strip the minority's rights in this body. It is  for this reason that I oppose the rule, and I urge my colleagues to do  the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, if the issue that the majority has with reopening is  related to vaccinations, I understand the majority claims that their  side is 100 percent vaccinated. I would just say that if that is the  case, science says they have nothing to worry about coming to the House  floor or being in public. But that is not what this is all about. This  is about the Speaker holding on to her slim and tenuous majority by any  means necessary, even weaponizing the House rules to do so.   If we do defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to  the rule to provide for consideration of Representative Mast's H.R.  261, the Palestinian International Terrorism Support Prevention Act of  2021.   I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the  Record, along with the extraneous materials, immediately prior to the  vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, the Israelis are among our greatest  allies and a critical strategic partner in the international fight  against terrorism. Congressman Mast understands this better than most.   H.R. 261 sanctions foreign governments and persons who provide  support for Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.   Madam Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Mast), who represents the 18th Congressional District.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Gimenez).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I just want to reiterate  that while I do support the idea of the underlying bills, I do not  support the way the Democrats are running the House.   The Democratic majority continues to move on bills with virtually no  input from Republicans and continues to prioritize partisanship over  the American people. We are making great progress with the pandemic and  do not need to consider legislation in this manner. We have got this  rule without a semblance of traditional process, and one of the  resolutions contained in this rule was moved to the Rules Committee  without any sort of markup, leaving the Members of this body without  the means to make amendments or lodge their objections.   That is not the way this body should function. I urge the majority to  make the necessary changes to restore regular order to the House of  Representatives. I do not believe that it is a healthy nor respectful  way to govern.   For this reason, I oppose this rule and urge my colleagues to oppose  it as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
