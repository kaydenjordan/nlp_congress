 Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge passage of my amendment to  increase funding for the Passenger Rail Improvement, Modernization, and  Expansion program.   The coalition that supports the PRIME program spans ideology and  geography. We are united in this belief: America can still do big  things.   Ten of our colleagues joined me by cosponsoring this amendment and,  today, 80 Representatives and Senators joined Representatives Costa,  Ocasio-Cortez, and me, calling for investments in high-speed rail.   In our country today, transportation is the leading driver of carbon  emissions. Americans have fewer options for inner-city travel than  citizens of China and France. And families are unable to afford homes  where they work, and they can't go to where they work from where they  can afford homes.   On top of that, trains are slower in America today than they were in  the 1930s, a century ago.   The PRIME program is a great first step to fixing these problems.  Regions like the Pacific Northwest can create an economic mega-region  and see a 10:1 return by investing in the Cascadia High-Speed Rail  Corridor, at less than half the cost of another lane of highway in  either direction.   Americans across the Midwest would have access to new jobs and  housing opportunities. You could live in Chattanooga and get to work in  Atlanta in a little more than a half hour.   We can build a system that is faster than driving and more convenient  than flying, and we can power it on low-power emissions.   Mr. Speaker, there is no reason we shouldn't adopt this.
