 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor the life of Mrs. Laura Randolph Stevens Devendorf.   Born in Savannah in Georgia's First Congressional District, Laura was  a fearless advocate, a talented artist, and dedicated writer who used  her gifts for the betterment of others.   Laura was an extraordinarily gifted designer. In fact, during the  Atlanta Olympic Games, she served as assistant course designer, the  first women in Olympic history to be so honored.   She was also a dedicated environmentalist and preservationist. In her  late sixties, she became a certified Master Tree Farmer and Master  Wildlifer and was an instructor for the University of Georgia's Master  Naturalist Program in forestry and salt marsh ecology.   She served on numerous boards, including the Georgia Forestry  Association. In fact, in 2000, she was named Georgia's Tree Farmer of  the Year.   I was blessed to meet Miss Laura, so I can attest to her empathy, her  intellect, creativity, courage, and compassion. She was a pillar in  Savannah, and her legacy will live on.   Laura's family and friends will be in my thoughts and prayers during  this most difficult time.                            ____________________
