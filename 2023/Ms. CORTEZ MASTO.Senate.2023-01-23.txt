 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the  life and legacy of my dear friend, James  [[Page S52]]  ``Jimmy'' Deal. Jimmy devoted his life to protecting others and  remained fiercely loyal to his friends and family to his last breath.  While I am incredibly sad to lose my friend, I am so grateful to the  Deal family for sharing him with the rest of us and allowing him to  devote so much of his time and energy toward keeping others safe.   Jimmy was born and raised in San Francisco, CA. After graduating from  San Jose State, Jimmy was determined to protect others from crime and  violence, and so he took an assignment as a special agent at the Las  Vegas office of the newly formed Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  Firearms.   Though moving to Las Vegas was a significant milestone in Jimmy's  career, the most important moment was a chance meeting with another  Federal employee, Cathy Liance, who was also working in his building.  Cathy and Jimmy were married after Jimmy started work at the Secret  Service. Soon, the Deals filled their household with children Jennifer,  Jessica, and David. Jimmy's career with the Secret Service would take  the Deals all over the country, but they eventually made Reno, NV,  their home.   Jimmy served with the Secret Service for nearly 30 years, including  several years when he was assigned to President Gerald Ford's  protective division after Ford faced multiple assassination attempts.  After 9/11, Jimmy shifted his focus and became an early leader within  another new Federal Agency, the Transportation Security Administration.  Having spent nearly his entire adult life in Federal law enforcement,  Jimmy saw how his experience and knowledge would be valuable for the  new Agency. Jimmy took the role of Assistant Federal Security Director  and provided a guiding hand in the Reno-Tahoe International Airport's  safety and security protocols. At the airport, Jimmy was a leader in  raising awareness about human trafficking, and he worked with agencies  in Nevada to assist victims of human trafficking to escape. He  continued this important work until his sudden passing.   My husband Paul and I will truly miss Jimmy and will remain grateful  for his friendship and his lifelong commitment to serving people and  protecting the public. To Jimmy's mother Urania and to Cathy, Jennifer,  Jessica, David, and the grandkids Dylan and Casey, I hope you all keep  Jimmy's boundless love and spirit with you always and take pride in  what he accomplished.                            ____________________
