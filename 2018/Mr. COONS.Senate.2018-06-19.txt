 Mr. President, as we await a 12:15 p.m. vote, I want to  urge my colleagues to support the first amendment that we will be  voting on today--the Gardner-Coons sense-of-the-Senate resolution, a  resolution that focuses on the importance of federally sponsored  research for the advancement of scientific innovation.   There are many great things to like about the program that is funded  in this Energy and Water appropriations bill that is about to be before  us, especially the work funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. Our  bipartisan resolution reinforces that message by acknowledging that the  United States has long been a leader in innovation, in large part  because of a critical role played by Federal funding for both basic and  applied research.   For decades, we have made investments that have led to incredible  breakthroughs instrumental to our current prosperity, economy, and  jobs. The Department of Energy National Labs--the 17 labs across 11  States--have been at the forefront through that process since their  founding. It is the creative, generative, innovative partnership among  these federally funded national labs, our network of universities and  colleges that conduct federally funded and privately funded research,  and the entrepreneurs and companies that take, through applied  research, their innovations and inventions to the marketplace that in  combination have created one of the most innovative, most competitive  economies in global history.   I am grateful for the leadership of Senators Alexander and Feinstein,  the chair and ranking member of the Energy and Water Subcommittee of  Appropriations, for having brought forward this balanced and thoughtful  bill. I will remind my colleagues that for several years now, budgets  presented by the executive branch have proposed deep and harmful cuts  to the foundational, federally funded scientific research upon which  the success of our innovation economy rests. I am thrilled that once  again this year, on a bipartisan basis, we are rejecting those cuts  and, instead, investing significantly more in Federal scientific  research.   I am grateful for the opportunity to partner with my colleague, the  Senator from Colorado, in moving the sense of the Senate. I am hopeful  that it begins to clarify on a bipartisan basis that this Chamber is  committed to innovation, science, competitiveness, and research. With  that, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.                          Pancreatic Cancer Research    Mr. President, while we are waiting for floor action, I will briefly  share with my colleagues that my day began with my speaking to the  Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, which is made up of more than 500  Americans who have come from all 50 States and who are all across  Capitol Hill right now, meeting with those in offices of the House and  the Senate. They are folks who have lost loved ones--family members,  relatives, neighbors--to one of the deadliest cancers, pancreatic  cancer. They are here to urge that we invest more in medical research.  This is a cancer that has affected families all over our country, but  without greater investment in research, we cannot bend the trajectory  of this dread disease.   It was just last February that I lost my own father to pancreatic  cancer, and this year was my first Father's Day without him. I am  grateful for the opportunity to have joined this morning with these  Americans from every State. I join with them in urging my colleagues to  consider investing more this year in research to end this scourge of  pancreatic cancer.   I thank the Presiding Officer.
