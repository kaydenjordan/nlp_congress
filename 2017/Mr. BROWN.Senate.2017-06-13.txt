Amendment No. 232, as Modified     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                        Amendment No. 232, as Modified     Mr. President, Russia remains a hostile, recalcitrant  power that deploys its military, its cyber espionage activities, and  its economic tactics to harm the United States of America--to drive a  wedge between us and our allies.   President Obama began to impose tough sanctions for Russia's cyber  attacks, its cyber intrusion, its illegal annexation of Crimea, and its  continuing aggression in Ukraine and Syria. Congress joined in that  effort by enacting two measures to tighten and broaden those sanctions.  Lifting and relaxing those sanctions now would only reward Russia's  attempts to undermine our democracy.   The administration continues to exercise a policy of strategic  ambiguity when it comes to Russia, and the President, putting it  mildly, has sent mixed signals. Just last month, Gary Cohn, the  President's senior economic adviser, seemed to suggest that the United  States could relax sanctions on Russia, and, as press reports confirmed  2 weeks ago, in its early days, the Trump administration considered  removing all measures against Russia, according to former  administration officials. Think of that.   We all hear the discussion--maybe collusion, maybe not--about the  Russians' friendship with the administration, whether the Trump family  or the Trump businesses or the Trump White House has had some kind of  relationships--almost everybody here thinks--with the oilmen, with the  oligarchs, with the Kremlin, maybe even Putin himself. And to think  that soon after taking office, before the public and the rest of us  began to start learning more about Trump's ties with Russia, the  administration considered the removal of any kind of measures punishing  Russia.  [[Page S3442]]    This amendment, written by Senators Crapo, Corker, Cardin, me, and  our offices and our staffs, sends an unambiguous message that the  United States will not accept Russia's continued aggression, will adopt  tough measures to both punish its past actions and deter future  aggression against our country and our allies.   Over the last week, the chairs and ranking members of key Senate  committees conducted intense negotiations over a package of tough and  meaningful reforms and expansions to our current Russia sanctions  regime. We have had good, positive, productive, bipartisan  conversations. Last night we reached agreement on this broad package of  new measures that substantially expands sanctions on Russia in response  to its malicious cyber attacks, efforts to undermine democracy, and  continuing aggression in Syria and in eastern Ukraine. This package  assures Congress and the people we represent that we have more of a say  in this critical national security debate.   The amendment would do a number of things. It would codify and  strengthen six existing Obama administration Executive orders on Russia  and Ukraine and on Russian cyber activities and the sanctions flowing  from them.   It would provide for strict congressional review of any effort by the  President to relax and suspend and terminate or waive Russian sanctions  patterned after the Iran Review Act.   It would require mandatory imposition of sanctions on malicious cyber  activity against the United States, on corrupt Russian actors around  the world, on foreign sanctions evaders violating the Russia, Ukraine,  and cyber-related sanctions controls, on those involved in serious  human rights abuses in territories forcibly controlled by Russia, and  on special Russian crude oil projects around the world.   It would authorize broad new sanctions on key sectors of Russia's  economy, including mining, metals, shipping, and railways, as well as  new investments in energy pipelines.   It would crack down on anyone investing in corrupt privatization  efforts in Russia--something we have seen a lot of over 20 years.   It would broaden the Treasury Department's authority to impose  geographic targeting orders, allowing investigators to obtain ATM and  wire transfer records so Treasury can better target illicit activity of  Russian oligarchs in the United States.   It would require Treasury to provide Congress with a study on the  tangled web of senior government officials from Russia and their family  members and any current U.S. economic exposures to Russian oligarchs  and their investments, and that includes real estate.   It would require the administration to assess and report to Congress  on extending secondary sanctions to additional Russian oligarchs and  state-owned and related enterprises.   Since 2014, Congress has worked together--Republicans and Democrats-- to craft increasingly tougher sanctions to hold Russia accountable for  a long line of misdeeds. It is a long line indeed, from Russia's  violations of international law and of the sovereignty and territorial  integrity of Ukraine, to its role in the brutal repression in the war  in Syria, to the cyber attacks that we are learning more and more about  on Americans.   The Ukrainian community in my State--vibrant, successful,  progressive--and around the world knows firsthand the dangers of  unchecked Russian aggression. We should strengthen--not weaken, not  relax, not peel back--Russian sanctions.   I urge my colleagues here and in the House to support this amendment,  and I will urge the President to sign it into law. We must continue to  vigorously enforce and strengthen sanctions against Russia to send a  message to its leaders and the world that the United States of America  will not tolerate efforts to undermine democracy around the world.                             Freedom of the Press    Mr. President, our democracy is founded on checks and balances--and  not just among the branches of government. Our Founders enshrined the  freedom of the press in the Bill of Rights for a reason. We can't have  a functioning democracy without freedom of the press. That is why last  week the Newseum marked its annual Day Without News to remind Americans  what our country would be--what we would be like, what we would look  like, how we would act--without a free press.   Journalists' entire job is to ask tough questions and to challenge  powerful interests. While in church, we comfort the afflicted,  journalists afflict the comfortable. Reporters put their safety and far  too often their lives on the line, whether it is covering floods and  hurricanes at home or traversing the globe to bring us the stories of  our troops. We depend on reporters in Ohio and around the world to both  bring us the stories that impact our day-to-day lives and to tell the  stories that simply otherwise might not be told.   Supporting a vibrant, independent, proactive press corps has rarely  been more important in our country. Yet, too often we see reporters  restricted, vilified, attacked, and even physically threatened, all for  doing the jobs for which they were hired.   Today brought news in this body that some people in this building-- some Members of the Senate--are trying to bar reporters from asking  Senators questions. This is outrageous. If Senators can't handle tough  questions from reporters about their plans to take healthcare away from  millions of Americans, maybe they should change the bill, not restrict  the reporters.   We remember that Oval Office meeting with Russian officials. We have  seen the pictures of the President of the United States with the  Russian Foreign Minister, with the Russian Ambassador. We have seen  those pictures, but what we need to remember about those pictures-- those photos that ran on front pages around this country and all over  the world--those photos weren't taken by American journalists. The  President of the United States threw them out of the Oval Office. Those  pictures were taken by the Russian state media.   The Russian state media was allowed to be in the room with the  President of the United States in the Oval Office--hallowed ground in  our democracy--while the American press was thrown out. The Russian  state media, the old Soviet news agency, TASS, the remnants of the old  Soviet propaganda machine, was allowed in, while the American press was  barred. When you hide from the press, you hide from the American  people.   On November 16, a group representing more than a dozen journalist  organizations sent a letter to the President-elect. They wrote: ``This  isn't about access for the press itself, it's about access for  Americans in diverse communities around the country.''   Having a strong, independent White House and congressional press  corps isn't just important for those reporters' stories. Think about  the signal it sends to mayors and city council members and State  legislators. If the Members of Congress--the President, by throwing  press out of the Oval Office and bringing in the old Soviet news agency  TASS, or the Senate, by throwing reporters out of the Senate--if they  don't have to be accountable, why should a mayor, why should a city  council person, why should a Governor think they should be accountable?   It is not just Washington reporters who are vital to democracy. It is  reporters in Ohio telling us the stories, bringing us the faces of the  opioid epidemic that devastates families and communities. It is Ohio's  editorial pages highlighting how important the Great Lakes Restoration  Initiative is to our drinking water and our State's economy. It has  enabled Senator Portman and me and bipartisan Senators all over the  Great Lakes, from New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,  Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota--Senators from both parties fighting  back and stopping the cuts that would have destroyed so much of the  progress in cleaning up the Great Lakes. It is journalists in every  corner of my State highlighting the devastation that the proposed  budget would have on our schools and our housing and rural communities.  It is emphasizing again that 200,000 Ohioans right now are getting  opioid treatment because they have insurance from the Affordable Care  Act. It is reminding politicians in Ohio of both parties that those  people need insurance. That is what a free press does.   Parenthetically, I would add, my wife is a journalist. She is a  Pulitzer Prize  [[Page S3443]]  winner. She is a columnist. She is soon to be a novelist. She clearly  has outspoken views about this, as I do. She is a member of the press.  I am a Member of this body. We both believe in a free press. We both  believe in a free democracy.   We answer to journalists in this body because they are the eyes and  ears of the people we serve. If you can't understand--if none of us are  strong enough and articulate enough and gutsy enough to stand before  reporters who ask tough questions about your positions, then maybe you  ought to rethink your positions.   We need diligent, courageous reporters to dig up their stories. We  need independent editors to put them on front pages. We need media  organizations willing to hold the powerful accountable.   The American people have a right to know what is going on in their  own government, from the White House down to the city council office.   The behavior today of the Rules Committee--the Rules Committee  decision to ban reporters--television reporters specifically--from this  body is just reprehensible. Thomas Jefferson said, ``Our liberty  depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without  being lost.'' That is as true today as it was more than 200 years ago  at the time of our country's founding.   To all of the reporters out there, thank you.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
