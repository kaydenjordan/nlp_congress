 Mr. Chairman, in a nutshell, here is the Republican and  the President's case. They want you to believe that if you cut  corporate taxes, if you cut taxes on the investor class, that this is  going to raise wages. That is the President's argument.   Here is what I don't understand. If you want to raise wages, why not  just raise wages? Why not just give the tax credits to working  families?   The President's Wall Street bankers have a different theory that only  gets credence in the beltway. This is not about economics. This is  about common sense. Think about it. You don't have to be a Ph.D.  economist to know that the better way to raise wages is not to cut  taxes for corporations, but to actually give the tax relief to people  making under $75,000.   You don't have to be a Ph.D. economist to know that if you cut taxes  for shareholders and corporate CEOs, they are probably going to invest  it overseas. If you cut the taxes or give the tax relief to people  making 50 grand in Michigan or Ohio, they are going to spend it and  create jobs in the United States.   This is just common sense. You don't have to be a Ph.D. economist to  know that if you really want to create jobs, invest in technical  training for the million skills gap we have, instead of putting hopes  on corporate CEOs who already have record profits, that somehow they  are going to create more jobs.   Mr. Chair, it used to be that there were serious thinkers on the  Republican side, people like Jack Kemp. I disagreed with him, but at  least he had innovative ideas of enterprise zones and how to really  create jobs. But for the past 20 years, the Republican party has been  devoid of ideas.   It is a mantra: tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts.   Oh, we are changing into a digital economy. How do we solve it? Tax  cuts. That is not a constructive solution.
