 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we do have a culture of human violence. Recently, a 16- year-old young man with three felony arrests in the past 4 months  violently attacked and attempted to choke a New York subway police  officer. He was released without bail. That is what is happening where  you have the left in charge of criminal justice systems.   Why do I bring that up? Because that individual punched that police  officer more than 20 times in his attempts to basically kill that  officer. Personal weapons such as hands, fists, or feet accounted for  600 homicides in 2019, according to official reports. Mr. Speaker,  1,476 murders were committed with knives or cutting instruments, and  364 homicides were committed with rifles.   Do you see the distinction here? But what the Democrats are going for  is they want to take away someone's constitutional right instead of  enforcing the law for people who are criminally violent. They are going  to release those people back into your streets.   The Supreme Court has held the Second Amendment protects arms in  common use. But at markup, Chairman  [[Page H7514]]  Nadler admitted that the purpose of the bill is to ban firearms that  are in common use. Think about that. That does violence to the  Constitution. They simply want to ban guns, and this is just another  step along that path.   At markup, it became very clear that Democrats don't even understand  the guns that they are trying to ban, but they don't care because when  they say they want to put politics above people, or that we shouldn't,  what they really mean is they are going to.
