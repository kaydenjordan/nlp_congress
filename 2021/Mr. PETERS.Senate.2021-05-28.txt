 Mr. President, the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol  remains a dark stain on our Nation's history. Americans deserve to have  all of the facts about that day, and a fair, balanced, and independent  Commission will give us those answers.   This Commission would complement the current investigations into this  deadly attack, including my Homeland Security Committee's own  investigations in conjunction with the Rules Committee.   After the devastating September 11 terrorist attacks, Congress came  together to create a bipartisan independent Commission. January 6 marks  a singular event in our Nation's history, similar to what we  experienced on 9/11, and there is simply no logical reason to oppose  its creation.   The brave law enforcement officers who stopped this attack and every  American who watched in realtime as our free and fair democratic  process was attacked deserve answers and accountability for the actions  that occurred on January 6.   I urge my colleagues to support this Commission and get the American  people the answers that they deserve.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
