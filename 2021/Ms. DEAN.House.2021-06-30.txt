 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, what are they afraid of? The truth?   On January 6, I came to this Chamber to try to understand why some of  my colleagues were engaged in a lie that the 2020 election was stolen  from their candidate. I never expected to finish that day forever  shaken and changed by what happened in this Chamber.   Madam Speaker, I was up in the Gallery, right up here. I remember the  terrifying banging on those doors as we were exited and wearing gas  masks--my fear for my colleagues, the staff, the press, the custodial  staff, the Capitol Police, and the anxiety that my family suffered with  their mom inside as they watched an insurrection on television,  wondering if we would make it out alive.   To be clear, this was a domestic terrorist attack on everyone who  works in this Capitol complex. It was an attack on democracy. It was an  attack on the peaceful transfer of power. It was an attack on our  Nation.   We need a select subcommittee to understand what happened on January  6, where many of our lives were at risk. We need to know the facts and  circumstances. We need to know the truth so that it never happens  again.
