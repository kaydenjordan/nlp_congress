 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Foxx and  Subcommittee Chairman Byrne for bringing forth this important  legislation, the Save Local Business Act.   Construction is a major employer in the U.S. economy, with over 6  million employees, 650,000 employers, creating over $1 trillion worth  of construction every year.   Building a project involves a complex web of subcontractors, vendors,  and consultants all working together in a spirit of teamwork to  accomplish a difficult task.   I have been in this business for 40 years. The general contractor has  to put control terms in its subcontracts and purchase orders to make  sure that the subcontractors and vendors execute the work safely, on  schedule, and in coordination with the other trades on the project.  Lastly, they have to follow all the fitness-for-duty provisions to make  sure that they pass drug tests and deal with smoking and health safety  issues like that.   These requirements run right into this Browning-Ferris standard.  There is no way that you could follow the literal words of those court  cases and this horrible Obama rule and not have the argument made to  you that all these subs and vendors are part of a common enterprise.   Now employers, including myself and my employees, are left in a big  quandary as to their status under Browning-Ferris, under the Obama  rule. I can see a scenario where a batch plant located clear across  town from a construction project could have a hazardous waste problem.  Because of this ridiculous rule, my job or someone else's job using  that batch plant to supply concrete could be linked to them. How  perverse is that?   So the Save Local Business Act will fix this abuse and be beneficial  not only to the American economy, but to the safety and well-being of  American workers. I urge my colleagues to support this practical fix to  this egregious action, and I thank Chairman Byrne for introducing this  legislation.
