 Mr. Speaker, justice that is not blind is  not truly justice. Our courts, our law enforcement, and our laws have  always strived to uphold that ideal. That is why it is so disturbing to  see the whistleblower testimony that has been given this week.   As we continue to investigate the business dealings of the Biden  administration, his family, and associates, it continues to become  clear that the President has pressured the agencies he is entrusted  with overseeing into providing his family with special treatment and  special favors to avoid the consequences of their unlawful acts.   This isn't justice. It is time to put a stop to a two-tiered justice  system that has flourished during Joe Biden's Presidency. We must stand  for the rule of law and condemn anyone who deliberately uses their  position as a public servant for personal gain.                            ____________________
