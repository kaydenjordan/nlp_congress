 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 397. You can  call it, Madam Speaker, whatever you want to call it, but the taxpayers  are going to bail out an underwater multiemployer pension plan. It is  just that simple, based on this legislation.   Since my time in Congress, my colleagues and I on the House Education  and Labor Committee have held numerous hearings on multiemployer  pension plans. I have learned a few things. These plans currently are  underfunded by $638 billion.   How in the world did that happen? The Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation, PBGC, multiemployer insurance program has a $54 billion  deficit and is expected to become insolvent by the end of fiscal year  2025. According to the PBGC data, 75 percent of multiemployer  participants are in plans that are less than 50 percent funded.   I think we can all agree that the system has failed, and these  retirees, I agree, deserve better.   How were they so misled to believe their contributions would cover  their retirement? In fact, this is just another example of unions  overpromising and underdelivering. The union says, hey, if you pay  this, you are going to get this retirement.   As the owner of a small business, I like to think of myself as coming  to the table, negotiating, and solving the problem. However, both  parties must be willing to find a reasonable solution that works for  everyone.   The Democratic solution on the multiemployer pension program is  shortsighted and partisan. In the business world, we don't call that  problem-solving. We call that another massive taxpayer giveaway.   Taxpayers are not going to stand for this. Not to my surprise, the  Democratic solution is Big Government and billions of dollars in new  costs. Again, this bailout is an unserious policy. It has a zero chance  in the Senate, and I recommend a ``no'' vote.
