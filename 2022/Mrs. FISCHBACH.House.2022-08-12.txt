 Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to comment that I do talk  to farmers, and what farmers are talking to me about is the incredible  costs of their inputs this year. That is what they are talking about.   They are not coming to me about climate change. They are coming to me  about the cost it is for them to do business and the inflation they are  facing.   Last year, my Democrat colleagues sling-shotted us into record  inflation with trillions in reckless spending. Now, they have the  audacity to use that very crisis to justify doing it again.   They call this bill the Inflation Reduction Act. In reality, this is  just another installation of their tax-and-spend agenda that got us  here in the first place.   This time, they are spending $80 billion in funding to send 87,000  new IRS agents to shake loose change from Americans to pay for their  spending spree. With this new staff, the IRS will be bigger than the  Pentagon, State Department, FBI, and Border Patrol.   This new IRS army will increase audits on individuals by more than  1.2 million, nearly half of which will be on Americans making $75,000  per year or less. You don't have to take my word for it. This is  according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.   What do Americans get in return? $3 billion in grants to promote  climate justice; $7.5 billion for wealthy families to purchase their  next Tesla; $1.3 billion for those same families to boost the sale  value of their old Tesla; and $1 billion for electric garbage trucks.   This bill is riddled with provisions that carry the Green New Deal  stamp of approval.   This bill is not designed to help the country recover. It is not  going to help American families pay for groceries. It is not designed  to help American families. It is designed to send an army of IRS agents  after low- and middle-income Americans so Democrats can pay for their  Green New Deal.
