 Madam Speaker, why were we brought back to  Washington, D.C., this week?   Was it to provide much-needed relief and assistance to American  families and small businesses because of the pandemic? No.   Instead, we continue to spend time on another set of mostly partisan  messaging bills with little or no input from Republicans. My Democratic  colleagues rely on grandstanding and talk more about the bills they  have passed than the bills, Madam Speaker, they have actually gotten  signed into law.   It is time for Democrats to get serious and stop trying to score  political points and come back to the negotiating table. Let's serve  the American people by actually getting much-needed bipartisan  legislation signed into law to fight this virus and get our economy  back.   We have already proven how much good we can accomplish for American  families and the American people when we work together.                            ____________________
