 Mr. President, I would like this morning to give an  update to my colleagues, given the challenges associated with the  weather--and also as we move toward a conclusion of the omnibus.   I have spoken to the Democratic leader. It is my expectation that we  will move forward with votes today. We are hoping to move them forward  on the sex trafficking bill, moving them up in the day, hopefully, to  accommodate safe travel. So we will notify everyone when votes are  scheduled.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1:45  p.m., today, Senator Wyden be recognized for up to 60 minutes to offer  and debate concurrently his amendments Nos. 2213 and 2212; that those  be the only amendments in order; and that following the use or yielding  back of that time, the Senate vote in relation to the amendments in the  order listed with a 60-vote affirmative threshold required for adoption  of each amendment; finally, that following disposition of those  amendments, the bill be read a third time and the Senate vote on  passage of the bill, as amended, if amended, without debate.    Madam President, I am pleased to report that the  appropriations package is currently being finalized. I will have more  to say once the bill has been filed, but I am proud to announce it will  meet a number of vitally important objectives. This includes the  largest year-on-year increase in funding for our servicemembers in 15  years, along with major steps forward for law enforcement and border  security, for the fight against opioid addiction, for our veterans, and  for a number of other priorities.   Madam President, before we take up that measure, the Senate has a  very important piece of business to tackle. This afternoon we will vote  on the anti-sex trafficking legislation we have been considering this  week. I want to thank Senator Portman, who has worked hard to advance  this reform, and Chairman Thune, for shepherding it through the  Commerce Committee.   Many of us have paid careful attention to the scourge of child  trafficking over the years. It has been a high-priority issue for me,  for example, since before I arrived in the Senate. But as traffickers  move their crimes from the street corner to the smartphone, the data  tell us unambiguously that more action is required.   The legislation before us reforms a misused provision in a 1996  telecommunications act, which currently shields companies that  facilitate and profit from the disgusting exploitation of women and  children.   Later today, my colleagues will have the opportunity to implement  commonsense reform with the potential to change vulnerable children's  lives for the better.   I urge every one of us to vote to pass it.                                  Tax Reform    Now, Madam President, on a final matter, we have been talking for  months about the ways tax reform is helping to jump-start the economy,  bolster family budgets, and make life better for millions of Americans.  Just a few months in, many such stories have already made front-page  news--the tax reform bonuses, raises, and benefits for 4 million  workers and counting; the new investments and new hiring from  businesses large and small; the bigger paychecks for middle-class  Americans as the IRS withholds less of their money.   Other exciting parts of this once-in-a-generation reform aren't  receiving the attention they deserve. Today, for example, is an initial  deadline for States to nominate areas they would like to be designated  as ``opportunity zones.'' This is thanks to a provision incorporated  into tax reform through the unflagging dedication of our colleague,  Senator Scott.   The premise here is simple. The best way to breathe new life into  struggling communities is not to invent some new Federal program; it  isn't to throw government money into one more top-down, tax-and-spend  scheme. No. The best way to help rural areas, small cities, and suburbs  left behind by the Obama-era policies is to get the government's foot  off the brake and let the free enterprise system flourish. It is to  make those communities attractive places to do business, open new  facilities, and create good-paying jobs. This is exactly what tax  reform does by deferring capital gains taxes on income that is invested  in distressed areas that receive this ``opportunity zone'' designation.   As one estimate has it, three-quarters of all the jobs created from  2010 to 2016 went to major metropolitan areas. Only 3 percent went to  rural America. This provision could help change that.   I know there is a lot of excitement in my State of Kentucky. From  coal country to farming communities and everywhere in between, Obama- era overregulation was holding our economy short of its full potential.  These opportunity zones offer a shot at real relief. According to the  Cabinet for Economic Development, Kentucky may designate as many as 144  new zones, prioritizing growth in areas that need it most.   Or take West Virginia. As my friend Senator Capito recently noted,  her State understands the problem all too well. One recent study  suggested that West Virginia has the third highest proportion of its  population living in economically distressed communities. Opportunity  zones will make a difference to her State. Of course, so will the rest  of tax reform.   A few weeks back, Senator Capito reported that Worldwide Equipment in  West Sulphur Springs plans to reinvest $8 million in its operations,  including more than 1,000 employee bonuses--all thanks to tax reform.   I imagine West Virginians are quite glad that Senator Capito used her  vote to make tax reform a reality. It is a shame their senior Senator  didn't follow suit. It is a shame that he and every other Democrat  tried to block it from taking effect. Fortunately, this President and  this Congress didn't let that stop us. We accomplished tax reform  anyway because we are committed to fighting for all Americans.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  the budget point of order and the motion to waive, there be 2 minutes,  equally divided, prior to the vote.    Mr. President, the pending amendment No. 2213 offered  by  [[Page S1871]]  Senator Wyden would violate the Senate pay-go rule by increasing the  on-budget deficit. Therefore, I raise a point of order against this  measure pursuant to section 4106(a) of H. Con. Res. 71, the concurrent  resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for the en bloc consideration of the  following nominations: Executive Calendar Nos. 596 and 671.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on the  nominations en bloc with no intervening action or debate; that if  confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table en bloc; that the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action; that no further motions be in order; and that any  statements relating to the nominations be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res.  438 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that  the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10:30 a.m.,  Thursday, March 22; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use  later in the day. Finally, I ask that following leader remarks, the  Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senators Grassley,  Durbin, Lee, and Sasse.
