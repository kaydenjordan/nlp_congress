 Madam Speaker, this weekend I will join hundreds of  activists and supporters for the Women's March in Seneca Falls, New  York, home of the historic 1848 Women's Rights Convention that sparked  the suffrage movement.   We will celebrate the incredible strides we have made in the fight  for women's rights and the many strong, courageous women who have  shattered glass ceilings to achieve progress.   The year 2020 marks the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th  Amendment, guaranteeing and protecting women's constitutional right to  vote. Now more than ever as we face new barriers threatening to roll  back the rights of women, we must take up the mantle of Susan B.  Anthony and the suffragists who came before us to continue to fight for  the full equality that all women deserve. Together we will keep  persisting.                            ____________________
