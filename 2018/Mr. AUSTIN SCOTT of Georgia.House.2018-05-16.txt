 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge  support for H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, also  known as the farm bill.   Rural America needs our support. Farm income has fallen approximately  50 percent since 2013. That is one of the steepest drops since the  Great Depression. The costs of production have steadily declined, while  commodity prices have fallen. Unfair trade practices, like the dumping  of specialty crops into our markets from Mexico, are hurting our U.S.  producers. The digital divide caused by inadequate or a lack of  broadband services has held back innovation, job growth, and education  in rural America. Crises like the opioid epidemic have stricken rural  communities across America, just as it has our cities.   Mr. Chairman, the farm bill addresses all of these challenges while  also taking the first major step in this Congress toward the  President's vision of meaningful welfare reform. This is our  opportunity to provide the needed certainty and support for our farmers  and producers, while also providing commonsense reforms that will  support the President's agenda of achieving prosperity in our rural  communities. Passing a strong farm bill on time is key to this goal.   I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting this important piece  of legislation and oppose those amendments that will hamper its ability  to aid rural America and keep our producers feeding not only America,  but the world. This bill provides certainty to one of America's largest  job sectors, while also standing for our conservative principles.   Mr. Chair, I ask that my colleagues join me in support of H.R. 2, the  Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, the farm bill.
