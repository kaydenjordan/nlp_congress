 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand against the push for  TikTok to infiltrate our White House. My colleagues and I have sent a  letter expressing our deep concern that the President is considering  inviting TikTok influencers into the White House to promote his agenda  and give them their own briefing room.   This action poses a serious national security threat. It is  tantamount to the rooster inviting the fox into the henhouse.   CCP is spying on millions of American citizens. By allowing these  influencers access to the White House, we could be facilitating  espionage efforts.   TikTok has access to your pictures, your text messages, your  keystrokes, your microphone, your camera, your search history, and so  much more.   Mr. Speaker, I am sad to say it has come to this, but we are  literally begging the President of the United States not to use a spy  tool developed and created by the CCP.   This administration owes the American people a response to our  letter.                            ____________________
