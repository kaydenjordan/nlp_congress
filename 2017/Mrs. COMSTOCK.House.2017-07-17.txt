 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my resolution, H.J.  Res. 92, which lends congressional approval to an amendment made to the  WMATA interstate compact.   As was mentioned, the last iteration of the highway bill, the FAST  Act, contained a provision that directed Virginia, Maryland, and D.C.  to amend the compact to change appointment authority for the Federal  directors on the WMATA board from the administrator of the GSA to the  more appropriate Secretary of Transportation.   This was a very commonsense change that was made in light of recent  incidents and accidents and the real need to have a top priority for  safety.   The Secretary of Transportation, I believe, is in a much better  position to appoint directors to the Metro board than the administrator  of the GSA. The States of Virginia and Maryland as well as D.C.  complied with this directive and amended the compact, and we are all in  agreement here.   The previous Secretary of Transportation last year appointed two very  well-qualified candidates to serve as the Federal directors on the  WMATA board.   The final legal step that we are taking today here in this equation  is for Congress to lend its approval to the change, and that is what  this resolution does.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Chairman Goodlatte,  for his work on this matter and for yielding the time. I appreciate his  leadership in bringing this forward.   I rise in support, Mr. Speaker, of this resolution, HJ. Res. 76,  offered by the gentleman from Maryland, the minority whip, Mr. Hoyer.  We have very much a regional partnership that is essential for Metro,  and this resolution today reflects that. It lends congressional  approval to the new interstate compact between Virginia, Maryland, and  the District of Columbia to establish an independent State safety  oversight program, in this case known as the Metro Safety Commission.   The previous iteration of the Metro safety oversight body was known  as the Tri-State Oversight Commission, and in response to various  accidents, inadequacies, and outright failures, the previous Secretary  of Transportation, Anthony Foxx, used the authority that we in  Congress, together, working with our regional delegation together, gave  him to temporarily take over the safety oversight role of Metro through  the Federal Transit Administration. But it was only meant to be  temporary control. We still need a permanent body to provide this  invaluable safety oversight for WMATA, and the passage of this  legislation in the House today brings us one important step closer to  that goal.   I also would like to mention that, because we had not done this in  the timeframe initially allowed, the FTA did give notice to the Metro  Safety Commission it had to be in place on or before February 9, and  when it wasn't,  [[Page H5898]]  they suspended some of our Federal funds.   Now, with this today, we hope this initial withholding, which equated  to $8.9 million and is expected could total $15 million, that now that  can move forward.   I have a letter that I include in the Record, which is signed by our  regional delegation in support of now releasing those funds                                     Washington, DC, June 30, 2017.      Hon. Elaine Chao,      Secretary, U.S. Department of Transportation,      Washington, DC.        Dear Secretary Chao, As representatives of public transit       customers in the Commonwealth of Virginia, we write to       express our concerns regarding the Federal Transit       Administration's (FTA) February 10, 2017 decision to withhold       federal transit grant money in response to incomplete efforts       to establish a new State Safety Oversight Program (SSOP) for       the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA).        On February 8, 2016, the FTA gave notice that the       Metropolitan Safety Commission (MSC), a new SSOP to succeed       WMATA's Tri-State Oversight Commission, must be in place and       certified by the FTA on or before February 9, 2017. On       February 10, 2017, with no new SSOP certified, the FTA       announced it would exercise its authority to withhold five       percent of federal funds authorized in fiscal year 2017 under       the Urbanized Area Apportionments Program (49 U.S.C. 5307).       The initial withholding equated to $8.9 million, and is       expected to total $15 million if he withholding continues to       the end of the current fiscal year. This withholding will not       just impact funding for WMATA, but for broader infrastructure       maintenance throughout Virginia, Maryland, and Washington,       D.C.        The decision to withhold these federal funds has created       significant uncertainty amongst state and local governments       in terms of budget planning and stability. Should the       withholding of funds continue throughout the remainder of the       fiscal year, the governments and their transit systems will       be faced with a number of difficult decisions about the       manner in which they allocate their limited resources. Under       a worst-case scenario, they would be forced to make cuts to       state of good repair efforts or reduce service to their       respective communities, either of which would be harmful to       our constituents. We agree safety must be a top priority, but       eliminating funding for infrastructure repair would directly       contradict a SSOP's stated goal.        Given the FTA must engage in this process with 29 other       transit agencies nationwide by 2019, we appreciate the       complexity of the issues that were considered in making the       decision to withhold these funds. However, we must       emphasize--as many of us have expressed previously either       directly to you, your predecessor, or the FTA--that the       timing of both the notice and the deadline set by FTA were       arbitrary in that there seemed to be little or no       consideration of the legislative calendars of the Virginia       General Assembly or the General Assembly of Maryland.        The FTA timetable effectively gave Virginia and Maryland       less than one full legislative session to negotiate amongst       each other and the District, draft the proposal, navigate it       through the respective lawmaking bodies, and sign it into       law. The unreasonable requirements FTA put forth were not       simply for the SSOP to have a legal foundation by the       February 2017 deadline, but to have the program fully       certified by FTA, which necessitates months of work after       passing legislation, including, but not limited to,       appointing commissioners, hiring staff, and leasing office       space. We are therefore led to believe that FTA either set       their requirements without providing fair consideration to       the unique institutional challenges that exist within the       jurisdictions, or the FTA set them with a deadline so       unrealistic that failure was unavoidable.        Given the concerns we have raised in this letter regarding       FTA's shortsighted approach to this matter, and in light of       the demonstrated progress which has been made, we       respectfully request that your office work with the FTA to       explore a compromise in which part of these withheld funds       can be released as a show of good faith, as the jurisdictions       continue their work to construct a stable SSOP.        Lending further justification for this request is the real       progress that has been made with respect to organizing the       MSC. At the time this is written:        Virginia, Maryland, and the District (the jurisdictions)       have each enacted legislation to enter into an interstate       compact to form the MSC;        The jurisdictions have submitted a detailed draft       certification plan to FTA for review (though FTA has not yet       provided formal feedback on the plan);        Joint resolutions have been introduced in both the House of       Representatives and the Senate to grant Congressional       approval to the MSC compact;        The Senate has passed its version of the joint resolution;        The House Judiciary Committee, which has sole jurisdiction       over the joint resolution, has ordered the House's parallel       version of the resolution to be reported favorably to the       full House; and        We are requesting that the measure be taken up for       consideration as soon as possible.        We appreciate the FTA's important safety work, especially       its temporary safety oversight role with respect to WMATA.       Without FTA's diligence, more harm may have come to WMATA's       customers. But we must find an equitable solution to this       matter.        We look forward to partnering with you, Madam Secretary, as       well as the FTA to ensure safety remains the top priority in       all transit systems and that reforms are made to accomplish a       transit agency that provides safe, reliable service to our       constituents. We appreciate your thoughtful consideration of       this request.            Sincerely,      Barbara Comstock,        Member of Congress.      Bob Goodlatte,        Member of Congress.      Robert J. Wittman,        Member of Congress.      Tim Kaine,        United States Senator.      Mark R. Warner,        United States Senator.      Scott Taylor,        United States Senator.     Mr. Speaker, we in the region have worked together on  these issues and, with this congressional approval and with the help of  my colleague, Chairman Goodlatte, took this to the Judiciary Committee,  who will now be able to begin the process of improving Metro in  connection with our State and regional partners.
