 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding,  and also for organizing us here tonight and every week on the issues  that are so important to this country. Her leadership,  specifically, for the Virgin Islands, is truly commendable, and just  know that we are doing everything we can do under her leadership to  help her recover and rebuild.    Mr. Speaker, I just have to say to our chair of the Congressional  Black Caucus, Congressman Richmond, I have to thank him for his bold  and his visionary leadership of the CBC.   First, let me just take a moment to offer my deepest condolences to  the family, friends, and community of those who lost loved ones in the  senseless act of gun violence in Texas, my home State. We mourn their  loss, we pray for the recovery of those injured, and we say once again  that this House needs action on gun safety measures to save lives. Our  thoughts and prayers are with them tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the urgent need to preserve temporary  protective status for immigrants fleeing famine, war, and violent  conditions around the world, especially those countries from within the  African diaspora who account for 10 percent of all TPS beneficiaries.   Today, 440,000 individuals from 10 countries reside in the United  States under temporary protective status because, as a nation, we have  kept our commitment to being a beacon of hope and security for those in  need.   The TPS program grants immigrants the right to lawfully remain in the  United States for 6 to 18 months. This longstanding practice has been  honored for decades through Democratic and Republican administrations  because, regardless of political affiliations as Americans, we have  always stood for protecting the value of human life.   Sadly, the Trump administration fails to grasp the lifesaving impact  of this program.                                time  1945    Just last month, the administration announced that it would terminate  the TPS designation for Sudan, despite the ongoing humanitarian crisis  in the region.   In the coming days and weeks, Mr. Speaker, the Trump administration,  unfortunately, will decide the fate of TPS holders from vulnerable  countries including Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Haiti. Let me  be clear: failure to renew TPS status would mean  [[Page H8515]]  deportation for over 300,000 individuals who are working and living in  the United States.   We also know that this issue disproportionately impacts immigrants  from countries within the African diaspora. Take Haiti for example.  After a devastating earthquake and horrific hurricane, there is an  active cholera outbreak and protracted food security crisis. Letting  TPS expire for this country would send 50,000 people back to uncertain  fates. An influx of people of this size would further destabilize a  fragile recovery. That is why I joined my colleagues in sending a  letter to the Department of Homeland Security calling for a full 18- month extension of Haiti's TPS designation.   In El Salvador and Honduras, the return of over 250,000 people would  strain government services and lead to job displacement in countries  besieged by violence, narcotics trafficking, and weak institutions.   Unfortunately, this week, Secretary Tillerson falsely claimed that  conditions on the ground no longer warrant TPS designation for these  countries. How he came up with that, I have no idea. This is really a  shame and a disgrace. That is why members of the Congressional Black  Caucus are here tonight fighting for temporary protected status because  we cannot turn our backs on our brothers and sisters in their time of  need. TPS holders have families, they own businesses, and they  contribute to this country in countless ways.   At a time when devastating hurricanes and flooding ravages our  neighbors in the Caribbean, the last thing that our government should  be doing is turning its back on TPS holders. It is not only TPS holders  that we are fighting for. We are also now recognizing, understanding,  knowing, and making public--as everyone knows--that millions of  undocumented youth are living in fear of deportation because this  President and Republicans in Congress can't muster the courage to do  what is right.   Our Nation has been and should continue to be a nation of immigrants.  From TPS to DACA, deporting innocent young people who came to the  United States to escape devastation and violence, or as a child, is not  only wrong, it is really cruel, and it is heartless. So that is why we  will continue to fight to protect undocumented youth as we work towards  comprehensive immigration reform once and for all.   Now we are going to say we are going to continue to fight to make  sure temporary protective status is granted for the 300,000 immigrants.  I want to thank Delegate Plaskett for helping us to, once again, raise  our voices, educate the public, and stay woke.
