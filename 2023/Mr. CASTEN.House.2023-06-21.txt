 Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, on Father's Day, 23  people were shot and 1 person was killed at a Juneteenth celebration in  Willowbrook, Illinois.   Law enforcement has not yet identified a suspect or a motive, but  preliminary reports have indicated there were multiple guns and  multiple shooters.   In 2 weeks, Highland Park, Illinois, will recognize the 1-year  anniversary of its July Fourth parade that killed 7 people and wounded  48 others. In that case, the parade route was lined with armed police  officers.   Here is what we know. Having lots of guns around, whether at a  parade, a Juneteenth party, a temple, or a school, does not make anyone  safer. It just makes it more likely that yet another family is going to  get a call to come down and identify yet another bullet-ridden corpse.   Yet, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to walk  through this Chamber with AR-15 lapel pins, proudly announcing their  service as foot soldiers in the NRA's war on the living.   I don't want a moment of silence. I don't want thoughts. I don't want  prayers. They are all far too quiet, and they don't do a damn thing.   Mr. Speaker, I need my colleagues to be brave. I need them to be  loud. I need them to stand up and act like saving lives matters.                            ____________________
