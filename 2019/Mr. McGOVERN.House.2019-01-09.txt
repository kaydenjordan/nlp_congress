 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 28 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 28         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House any bill specified in       section 2 of this resolution. All points of order against       consideration of each such bill are waived. Each such bill       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in each such bill are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on each such bill and       on any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Appropriations or their respective designees;       and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  The bills referred to in the first section of this       resolution are as follows:         (a) The bill (H.R. 264) making appropriations for       financial services and general government for the fiscal year       ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes.        (b) The bill (H.R. 265) making appropriations for       Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration,       and Related Agencies programs for the fiscal year ending       September 30, 2019, and for other purposes.        (c) The bill (H.R. 266) making appropriations for the       Department of the Interior, environment, and related agencies       for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other       purposes.        (d) The bill (H.R. 267) making appropriations for the       Department of Transportation, and Housing and Urban       Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending       September 30, 2019, and for other purposes.        Sec. 3.  The requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII for a       two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee on       Rules on the same day it is presented to the House is waived       with respect to any resolution reported through the       legislative day of January 15, 2019, relating to a measure       making or continuing appropriations for the fiscal year       ending September 30, 2019    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), my  good friend, the ranking member, pending which I yield myself such time  as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time  yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 28, providing for consideration of  H.R. 264, making appropriations for financial services and general  government; H.R. 265, making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural  Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  programs; H.R. 266, making appropriations for the Department of the  Interior, environment, and related agencies; and H.R. 267, making  appropriations for the Department of Transportation, and Housing and  Urban Development, and related agencies, each for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2019. The rule provides for consideration of each  bill under a closed rule.   Mr. Speaker, we need to pass these bills, because we need to reopen  government.   Let me just say to my colleagues, quite frankly, this is not the way  I had hoped we would start the new Congress, essentially cleaning up  the mess that my Republican friends left us from the last Congress, but  we are where we are, and this is an emergency. It is time to reopen the  government.   Mr. Speaker, what we saw last night from the President, in my  opinion, was a disgrace. He used the Oval Office to fearmonger and  smear immigrants. There was nothing new, no plan to get us out of this  shutdown, no solutions, just more of the same offensive rhetoric we  have heard time and time again from this President.   But this Democratic majority is moving quickly to end the Trump  shutdown. On day one of this new Congress, we passed a complete funding  package using bipartisan language to reopen government, and now, today,  we are taking further action to help the American people while  responsibly protecting our borders.   This rule will allow us to pass individual appropriations bills to  reopen key government agencies. That includes the Department of the  Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service, to prevent Americans' tax  refunds from being withheld during the shutdown; the Department of  Agriculture, to prevent hungry families from losing the lifeline of  SNAP benefits and assure that our farmers get the services that they  need; the Department of the Interior, to prevent our national parks and  monuments from being further degraded and allow EPA to resume its work  protecting public health and our environment; and the Department of  Housing and Urban Development, to help hardworking families in the  process of realizing the dream of homeownership. These bills offer us a  way out of the President's shutdown, an embarrassing spectacle that  never should have happened in the first place.   Nineteen days ago, the President of the United States threw a temper  tantrum. He went back on his word, breaking his promise to sign  bipartisan appropriations bills that would have prevented a quarter of  our government from shutting down.   He turned on FOX News or some rightwing radio show somewhere and  changed his mind. Suddenly, the President demanded $5 billion in  funding for his offensive border wall just to keep the lights on-- billions of dollars, by the way, that would just have been a  downpayment on an unnecessary project that would cost tens of billions  of dollars, and not at Mexico's expense like President Trump promised  over and over and over and over again.   Now the costs have been shifted to the American taxpayer, when,  according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, only 25 percent of the public says  they support Trump shutting down the government over the wall--25  percent. This is crazy, but this doesn't have to continue.   At his press conference the other day, the President boasted he could  keep our government closed for years. Now, he may not know how to get  us out of this mess, but this Democratic majority does, and there are  many responsible Republicans on the other side of the aisle who are  with us on reopening the government.   Last week, our funding package passed with bipartisan support. Seven  Republicans voted with us, including Republican Congressman Will Hurd,  whose district includes much of the U.S.-Mexico border.   In addition, a growing number of Senate Republicans have encouraged  the majority leader to bring those bills to the floor, including  Senator Collins of Maine and Senator Gardner of Colorado. Senator  Gardner said, recently: ``The Senate has done it last Congress; we  should do it again today,'' and I agree.   So let's send these bills to the Senate so they can once again pass  Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support.   The Senate Majority Leader already supported these bills once. Why  not support them again to finally reopen this government?   Because we can't wait for the President to publicly promise to sign  these bills before we act--we already know his word isn't worth much;  his broken promise is what got us here--it has fallen to Congress to  get us out of this shutdown.   Congressman Hurd said after voting for the Democratic appropriations  package last week: ``Ultimately, Congress is a coequal branch of  government, and it should operate that way.'' He is absolutely right.  And these bills are this majority's latest attempt to fulfill our  responsibility.   There are 40 million Americans who rely on SNAP to put food on the  table. Their benefits will lapse shortly if this shutdown is allowed to  continue.   Mr. Speaker, why should Americans go hungry just because the  President wants to appease someone like Rush Limbaugh? Why in the world  would Congress sit idly by as thousands of people trying to buy a new  home or refinance FHA-insured mortgages are left in limbo?   We are now in tax season. If we don't end this shutdown, more than 2  million Americans who every month turn to tax assistance centers will  find them closed as they try to complete their annual returns.   This is madness, and it is completely unnecessary. Tax returns  delayed, home purchases in limbo, food assistance in jeopardy for the  hungry, trash piling up in our national parks, it is an embarrassment-- not to mention the 800,000 Federal workers who aren't getting paid, and  countless more contractors.   It can be over in a heartbeat if we pass these bills and the Senate  takes yes for an answer. These bills honor our responsibility to turn  the lights back on. They don't waste even a dollar of taxpayer money on  the President's immoral border wall, nor should they. People  overwhelmingly object to building it.   I hope this President comes to his senses, that he stops holding our  Nation hostage as he plays to the fringes of his base. But none of us  can control that. We do have the ability, though, to do our jobs and to  end the shutdown. That is what this Congress will do again today, and I  urge all of my colleagues to join with us.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Oklahoma's comments. I  just want to make a couple of quick points before yielding to my next  speaker.   We, as Democrats, are struggling in support of border security, and  we have supported initiative after initiative to basically make our  borders more secure. We believe in investing in infrastructure and more  personnel. We believe in providing more judges to be able to adjudicate  asylum claims so we can process people more expeditiously. We believe  in technology. It is 2019, yet the President insists on this medieval  approach to border security, which most experts say is just  ineffective.   On top of all of that, our objection is that it is going to cost tens  of billions of dollars. The President said that Mexico is going to pay  for it, but now he is saying that the American taxpayers are going to  pay for it. I mean, give me a break.   As far as why we are doing the strategy of taking up these Senate- passed bills, let me remind my colleagues: They passed the Senate 92-6  back in August.   I would have liked a different process. My friends were in charge of  everything up to a week ago. They controlled the House; they controlled  the Senate; and they controlled the White House. Yet they sent people  home during the holidays and just kicked the can down the road, and we  have inherited this mess from the last Congress. So we are doing the  best we can.   If the Senate would vote, like they did in August, again for these  bills--92-6--we won't need the President. We could override his veto;  we could reopen the government; and we could stop all of this nonsense  right now. That is my hope.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my friend from Washington  State, a former member of the Rules Committee. I should just tell him-- and I am a little bit surprised, since he was on the Rules Committee-- two of his amendments that he offered didn't even comply with the House  rules, so that is why they wouldn't be made in order.   But let me just say to him, as I began my remarks, it is unfortunate  that we had to start this Congress cleaning up after the last Congress,  but that is where we are. That is what you have given us. And I am  eager to return to regular order as soon as we reopen this government.   What we are witnessing is extraordinary. In fact, it is  unprecedented. For the first time in history, we have begun a new  Congress in the middle of a government shutdown.    I tried last month to bring up appropriations bills, bills that Mr.  Hoyer offered on the floor to reopen this government, but you shut me  down every single time, so here we are.   We meant it when we said that we would do everything we can to reopen  this government, because this is a real emergency. 800,000 hardworking  civil servants are either furloughed or working without pay. That is  what an emergency looks like. This is an emergency.   I appreciate the kind of laid-back attitude of some of my friends on  the other side of the aisle who are like: Well, let's start all over  again. Let's reopen the process. Let's have endless debate from now  until whenever.   But do you know what? It is not us who are not being paid; it is our  constituents. So this is an emergency. It is time that all of us come  together and end this ridiculous shutdown and then get on to the  business of the future. That is what I am committed to.   I hope that the Rules Committee will be much more accommodating to my  friends on the other side of the aisle than my friends were to us, by  the way, overseeing the most closed Congress in the history of the  United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Perlmutter), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Judy Chu).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am sorry the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell)  left the floor, but I know Mr. Newhouse is still here, and I am  complimented by the fact that they quote me so much. But I want to  quote me, too, because I am going through what I have said about open  rules and about the way this House should be run.   On November 14 on the floor I said:         And I am not suggesting that every rule needs to be an open       rule or that there is never a time for a closed rule, but       there is never a time for more than 100 closed rules. There       is no justification for that.    That is me. And on April 24, I said:         I am under no illusion that every bill has to be an open       rule; although it would be nice to have at least one symbolic       open rule before the year is out.    On April 13, I said:         I can't promise that every rule is going to be an open       rule, but I can say that there would be a greater attempt to       try to accommodate Members.    On September 2, I said:         Now, Mr. Speaker, I am not suggesting that everything that       the House considers should be under an open rule. There are       times when a closed rule might be necessary. But more than       100 closed rules? There is no justification for that.    So I think I am being pretty consistent here, because I have actually  voted for closed rules on this floor that have been suggested in times  of emergency. I voted for one to actually bring a continuing resolution  to the floor so that we wouldn't have to deal with the mess that we are  in right now.   So in times of emergency, in times of life or death, yes, there are  justifications for a closed rule, and this is one of them because this  is last year's work. This is what my friends on the other side left us  with, unfinished business from last year. Not only unfinished business,  but they allowed the President to shut the government down.   So hundreds of thousands of American workers are in a panic right now  because last year's majority, my Republican friends, did not do their  job.   This is ridiculous. We ought to figure out a way to have our  discussions without shutting the government down. This is not the way  you are supposed to run government. And so we are offering a solution  here so that we can reopen the government and continue our  conversations about whatever you want.   The gentleman from Oklahoma said we should split the difference on  the border wall.                                time  1315    Mexico was supposed to pay for it.   Why are we splitting the difference? Why are we assuming the cost of  a border wall when the President said that Mexico was going to pay for  it, a border wall that most experts say is useless and ridiculous and  that that money could be better spent on other ways of enforcing border  security?   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me say to my friend from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) that I  think he is one of the best Members of this Chamber. I admire him, and  I think that he is absolutely right when he says that the  Appropriations Committee did its work, and that goes for Republicans  and Democrats. People worked together, and they moved appropriations  bills forward. So I find no fault with and I have no blame for the  appropriators.   What I do blame is his leadership that, at the last minute, when the  President decided to have a temper tantrum and threatened to shut the  government down, the Republican leadership was complicit, basically,  and said: We will go along with this. And here we are.   By the way, I can't wait to get this over with so we can get on to  other business. By the way, we are going to bring up the disaster  appropriations bill next week. We have a notice out asking for  amendments. I think the deadline is on Friday at noon. I can't recall  the last time a disaster appropriations bill ever solicited amendments.  We are going to do that. But I appreciate his words.   Mr. Speaker, this is an emergency. We are now dealing with a major  crisis in this country, and it is not just Federal workers. USA Today  reported last week: ``Government shutdown 2019: Homebuyers with USDA  mortgages can't close on house sales.''   Mr. Speaker, I include this article in the Record.  Government Shutdown 2019: Homebuyers With USDA Mortgages Can't Close on                                House Sales                       [From USA Today, Jan. 3, 2019]                             (By Janna Herron)         Jordan and Tracey Smith of Madison, Maine, were scheduled       to close on their first home on Friday. But the government       shutdown has gotten in the way.        The couple needs the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help       finalize their mortgage that is guaranteed by the agency. But       the USDA's operations have been closed for 13 days, so the       couple and their five children remain in limbo.        ``We're living out of boxes. We're paying our landlord on a       week-to-week basis, but he has people waiting to move in,''       says Jordan Smith, 32. ``We just want to move and get this       process over with.''        It's the same for other borrowers who depend on the USDA.       The department provides--through private lenders--mortgages       with no down payment requirements and low interest rates and       fees to rural and suburban homebuyers. It's a small program,       helping just over 140,000 people to buy a home in 2017, but       is considered one of the best options around if you're       eligible.        ``We just can't close a USDA loan without a commitment       letter from them. ``Your loan  [[Page H309]]       is at a standstill,'' says Pava Leyrer, the chief operating       office of Northern Mortgage Services in Grandville, Michigan.       Leyrer's company is an approved USDA lender.        Leyrer is telling her affected clients to call their       representatives. Otherwise, they may ultimately need to       switch into a different loan. ``How long will the seller       wait, especially if the sales contract expires?'' she says.                           Waiting for repair money         In other cases, those who already have a USDA mortgage are       running into trouble. Jenneffer Azcuy, a homeowner in Lynn       Haven, Florida, with a USDA mortgage, is waiting to get the       insurance money she needs to repair her house after it was       damaged by Hurricane Michael in October.        ``Since my insurance repair check is over $7,500, the USDA       controls the disbursement of funds,'' Azcuy says ``But the       money is tied up.''        On mortgages it guarantees, the USDA requires that it       oversees how insurance claims funds are used to make sure       they are spent properly. When insured losses exceed $7,500,       the agency requires the funds to be deposited into an escrow       account it controls.        Azcuy has a contractor lined up to repair her leaky roof,       replace a fence, and fix the gutters and outside doors. She       has called the USDA for help but can't leave messages because       the voicemail is full.        ``It's ridiculous. This town is devastated as it is from       the hurricane,'' she says.                         What about other mortgages?         The other mortgages backed by the government are unaffected       so far by the shutdown. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the       Veterans Administration--which all back home loans--are       running as normal.        The Federal Housing Administration, which guarantees       mortgages popular among first-time homebuyers, is operating       with a smaller staff because of the shutdown but is still       approving loans.        ``You can get some answers,'' Leyrer says, but adds: ``They       are slower to respond, and it takes longer to get through on       the phone because of limited staff.''        Lenders are also working around other shutdown-induced       hiccups.        For instance, they can't verify a person's tax information       with the Internal Revenue Service, which has limited       services. As a result, many lenders are still approving those       loans conditionally and will confirm the information later       when the IRS reopens, says John Stearns, a loan originator       with American Fidelity Mortgage Services in Mequon,       Wisconsin.        ``If there is a problem, then I have to figure it out       then,'' Stearns says.                               On Capitol Hill         Azcuy and the Smiths hope the new House of Representatives       convening on Thursday can end the shutdown. Democratic House       leaders have scheduled votes on a package of bills to reopen       the federal government and provide more time for Congress to       negotiate a border funding deal with the White House.        Until then, they wait.        ``My wife and I support Donald Trump. We agree with border       security,'' Jordan Smith says. ``But he has to look and see       that this is affecting other people's lives.''     Mr. Speaker, the article reports on the situation of  Jordan and Tracey Smith of Madison, Maine, and their five children.  They were scheduled to close on their very first home last Friday, but  this ridiculous Trump shutdown ruined that. They need the Department of  Agriculture to finalize their mortgage, but USDA has been closed for  weeks.   Here is what Mr. Smith said: ``We're living out of boxes. ``We're  paying our landlord on a week-to-week basis, but he has people waiting  to move in.''   So lives are being thrown into turmoil, and we don't have a lot of  time to just carry on these conversations and endless debates. This is  a time for action.   This is the first time a prior Congress ended in a government  shutdown. It is fitting. It is almost like an exclamation point to the  President's first 2 years in office.   But it is a new Congress, and we are ready to responsibly clean up  this mess and do what the last Congress could not do. We are offering  an extremely reasonable solution to this unnecessary government  shutdown. The underlying legislation is virtually identical to the four  appropriations bills that already passed the Senate, 92-6.   Compare that to what the prior Republican majority put forward in the  waning days of last Congress. They passed a partisan funding bill with  billions of dollars for the President's wall, legislation they knew  Democrats would never support and that the Senate would never pass.  Then they left town. They refused to even recognize me when I tried  again and again to bring up a bipartisan bill to end the shutdown.   800,000 workers stopped receiving paychecks. That includes, by the  way, thousands of border and law enforcement officers, more than 41,000  Federal law enforcement officers, people like FBI agents and DEA  agents, nearly 54,000 Customs and Border Patrol agents and Customs  officers, and almost 90 percent of the Department of Homeland Security  employees.   This Trump shutdown is an embarrassment. We owe our Federal employees  and all Americans better than this. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my  colleagues to vote for this rule and the previous question and join  with us in supporting these underlying bipartisan funding bills. This  is another chance for us to do the right thing. Let's take it and bring  an end to this unnecessary and painful Trump shutdown.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:         Strike sections 1 and 2 and insert the following (and       redesignate the subsequent section accordingly):        That immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       264) making appropriations for financial services and general       government for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and       for other purposes.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida  (Ms. Shalala) for yielding me the time.   It is an honor to serve with her on the House Rules Committee. As the  longest serving HHS Secretary in U.S. history, she spent much of her  life leading on the issue of healthcare.   Madam Speaker, the American people have been living in fear for  years, worried that Washington Republicans would make good on their  promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and that the President and  his allies in Congress would take away their ability to see a doctor or  afford care, including for preexisting conditions from asthma to  domestic abuse.   Who can blame them?   When the minority controlled this institution, they voted 69 times to  undermine the Affordable Care Act. Sixty-nine times they tried to take  away healthcare from more than 23 million Americans. Thankfully, the  Senate thwarted these efforts, and Republicans weren't successful.   Now the Trump administration is using the legal system to try to do  what the Republican Congress could not: strike down the Affordable Care  Act. Its Justice Department has asked in a legal filing for the courts  to invalidate this law and, in doing so, erase protections for  preexisting conditions.   Now, I have heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle try to  pretend that they are somehow champions of this provision, despite  working relentlessly to abolish it and voting nearly 70 times to  undermine the ACA.   Madam Speaker, who are they kidding?   This Democratic majority doesn't deal in alternative facts. The  American people are smarter than that.   Thankfully, it is a new Congress, and this majority isn't trying to  abolish preexisting condition coverage. Instead, we are moving swiftly  to protect it on the opening days of this Congress.                                time  1530    This measure will allow this House to legally intervene to protect  preexisting condition coverage in the Affordable Care Act. If you  support coverage for preexisting conditions, then you will support this  measure to try and protect it. It is that simple.   Enough with the sound bites. It is time to vote. I urge all my  colleagues to vote for this measure.
