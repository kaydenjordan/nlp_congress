 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 612, the United States-Israel  Cybersecurity Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking Chairman Ratcliffe for his  leadership on the subcommittee and, in particular, on the issue of  cybersecurity. I have greatly enjoyed our partnership on this and many  issues. I appreciate his due diligence and his hard work on many  national security issues.   Let me also start by expressing my deep gratitude to Chairman McCaul  and Ranking Member Thompson in acting so quickly to bring this bill to  the floor. Both the chairman and ranking member led a very productive  committee last Congress, and I am very pleased that their commitment to  protect our national security has extended to swift action this year as  well. That urgency is particularly relevant to this bill, the United  States-Israel Cybersecurity Cooperation Enhancement Act.   As Chairman Ratcliffe mentioned, last May, he and I traveled to  Israel to meet with public and private cybersecurity officials. I think  I can speak for my friend when I say that we were very impressed by the  Israeli's efforts in this space. Israel was one of the first countries  to recognize the potential threat posed by interconnected computer  systems, and they have been leaders in cybersecurity now for decades.   For instance, the first stateful firewall technology was first  developed by an Israeli firm. Today, these firewalls are ubiquitous  across the information security landscape. In fact, despite its size,  Israel is the second largest exporter of cybersecurity goods and  services, behind only the United States. U.S. companies have certainly  taken notice. Mr. Ratcliffe and I, as he mentioned, met with some of  their representatives during our trip.   Just last week, Reuters reported that one of the components of  Microsoft's $1 billion per year cybersecurity strategy is acquisition  of three Israeli corporations.   Collaboration with our closest Middle East ally only makes sense from  a national security perspective. Preserving Israeli security is  essential to stability in the region.    We clearly have a lot to learn from each other as well, which is why  I have championed government-to-government interaction on  cybersecurity, such as the recent letter of intent for more  information-sharing between DHS and Israel that was championed by  former Deputy Secretary Mayorkas.   Beyond our governments working together, Chairman Ratcliffe and I  also believe the government can do more to encourage collaboration  between our private sector and nonprofit entities on issues directly  relevant to homeland security. That is why, upon our return, we worked  in close collaboration to develop two bills to enhance these  cooperative relationships.   I could not have asked for a better partnership in this effort. I was  thrilled that our first bill, the United States-Israel Advanced  Research Partnership Act, was signed into law last month. It is our  second bill, which passed the House in November, but failed to make  [[Page H800]]  it through the Senate before Congress adjourned last year, that we are  discussing today.   Specifically, this bill creates a cybersecurity grant program for  joint research and development ventures between Israeli and American  entities. Projects would be selected after a merit review process and  would have to address requirements in cybersecurity determined by the  Secretary of Homeland Security. The grants would also be subject to a  cost-sharing requirement, with at least 50 percent of project funds  coming from a non-Federal source.   Importantly, H.R. 612 leverages existing United States-Israel R&D  infrastructure, specifically the Binational Industrial Research and  Development, or BIRD Foundation, and the Binational Science Foundation,  or BSF. Both organizations have a proven track record of encouraging  joint research ventures.                                time  1645    BIRD, for instance, has financed R&D and commercialization projects  that have led to a cumulative $8 billion in commercial sales since its  founding, while BSF regularly funds collaborations between the top  scientists in our respective countries as 45 Nobel laureates have  received support from the Foundation.   Now, using the existing infrastructure, as was done in 2007 when  Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act that led to  the creation of BIRD Energy, also allows us to capitalize on both  foundations' robust networks of United States and Israeli entities to  help seed these joint ventures. All of these factors are particularly  critical in the fast-moving cybersecurity domain where offensive and  defensive tactics and techniques change on a monthly or even weekly  basis.   As such, advances in the discipline require a near constant  reexamining of assumptions, and having people from different  backgrounds and security cultures working together engenders an  environment where such reexamination is encouraged. While both the U.S.  and Israel have robust cybersecurity communities, further collaboration  will spur more advances to combat the threats that we face.   Although some of these advances are technological in nature, basic  cybersecurity research, such as investigations into the psychology of  secure interface design and social engineering, is also supported by  the bill. All told, the programs authorized in H.R. 612 will both  address urgent homeland security needs and build capacity for further  transnational collaboration on cybersecurity, all while matching  Federal investment with private sector dollars and funds from the  Israeli Government.   Mr. Speaker, I normally preface my remarks on cybersecurity with an  explanation of the threat our country faces. I would hope that, given  recent events, I don't have to remind my colleagues of the dangers that  we face in this sphere which, as I see it, is one of the key national  security challenges of the 21st century.   I would hope that incidents like the recent attack on the Ukrainian  power grid demonstrate the power of a computer keyboard to affect our  critical infrastructure. I would hope that the breach of hundreds of  millions of accounts at Yahoo, which affected around 10 percent of the  world's population, demonstrates how pervasive data collection is and  its vulnerabilities. I would certainly hope that the Russian  information warfare operations targeting the very foundations of our  democracy, our elections, demonstrate the stakes that we face.   In the face of these threats, we must join together with our allies  to protect a free and open internet and ensure that the amazing  benefits of technology are not overshadowed by the new vulnerabilities  that they open up. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 612 is an important step to  driving the innovation we need in the security space to meet these two  goals.   As with any bills that make it to the floor, this bill owes much to  the dedicated staff on both sides of the aisle who spent countless  hours behind the scenes reviewing this legislation. I thank them for  their extraordinary and exceptional work.   I am also very grateful, again, to Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member  Thompson, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Richmond for their continued  leadership on cybersecurity and, in particular, Chairman Ratcliffe for  his work and for their assistance in quickly actualizing the lessons  that we have learned on our trip to Israel.   Finally, in closing, I owe, once again, a debt of gratitude to my  friend across the aisle, Chairman Ratcliffe, who, in his first term,  immediately had a substantial impact on our Nation's cybersecurity and  with whom it has been a great pleasure to work. I look forward to our  continued work in this Congress and beyond.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 612 does three things: it encourages innovative  approaches to address top priorities in homeland security R&D it  strengthens ties with Israel, one of our closest allies; and it does so  in a public-private partnership that matches Federal investment.   Mr. Speaker, if you indulge me for a moment, I would like to read  something the Saudi Arabian Computer Emergency Response Team put out  last week: ``Following a recent cyberattack which targeted several  national organizations, this is an urgent call for your cybersecurity  team to be on the alert for Shamoon 2 and ransomware attacks that could  possibly cripple your organization's systems.''   For those of my colleagues who are not aware, the Shamoon attacks of  2012 took down tens of thousands of computers at the Saudi state oil  company, Saudi Aramco. The Shamoon 2 variant has been targeting Saudi  Government agencies and private industry since November.   I bring this up, Mr. Speaker, because open source intelligence  reports point to Iran as being responsible for the original Shamoon  attack. I believe there is a good chance that Iranian-aligned actors  are behind the recent incidents as well. Our Israeli partners live  under this threat every day, and, to be frank, so do we.   Last year, the Justice Department indicted seven Iranian hackers for  attacks on the U.S. financial sector and for probing the networks of a  New York dam. The same threats that leave me unable to sleep keep my  friend Dr. Matania, head of the Israel National Cyber Bureau, up at  night as well.   Closing our aperture of vulnerability will be difficult, Mr. Speaker,  but it is possible if we work together to bring our countries' unique  perspectives to bear on the problem. I know my colleagues in the Senate  share these sentiments, and I hope they will move quickly to take this  bill up and start fostering further collaboration as soon as possible.   Let me again thank Chairman Ratcliffe for his leadership and his  outstanding work on this bill. I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  612.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
