 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, this month marks the Fort  Jackson Centennial, a celebration of 100 years of military service and  opportunity at that extraordinary post.   As the largest initial entry training facility for the Army, Fort  Jackson has been a leader in training in military readiness. Indeed,  Fort Jackson recently achieved a remarkable milestone, having trained  an estimated five million soldiers.   I know firsthand of the dedication and capability of Fort Jackson. As  a member of the Army Reserve and the South Carolina Army National Guard  and a graduate of the Adjutant General School, I trained at Fort  Jackson. Additionally, three of my four sons have served in the South  Carolina National Guard, receiving world class training at Fort  Jackson.   I have also seen how Fort Jackson supports the Midlands community,  promoting civilian and military jobs, providing strong leaders and  volunteers for our community, drawing millions of visitors. This is why  the Midlands has worked hard to become the most military-friendly  community in America.   Congratulations to General Pete Johnson for a strong command at Fort  Jackson. I look forward to continued success for American families.  Victory starts here.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may we never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
