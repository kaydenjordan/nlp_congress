 Mr. Speaker, earlier today, I was unavoidably  detained in my congressional district and was not present for Roll Call  Vote 144. Had I been present, I would have voted as follows: On Roll  Call 144, I would have voted aye.       MEMBERS RECORDED PURSUANT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 8, 117TH CONGRESS       Allred (Wexton)      Beatty (Kelly (IL))      Buchanan (Dunn)      Carter (TX) (Calvert)      Crenshaw (Pfluger)      DesJarlais (Fleischmann)      Dingell (Kuster)      Fallon (Nehls)      Garbarino (Joyce (OH))      Gomez (Garcia (IL))      Green (TX) (Perlmutter)      Grijalva (Garcia (IL))      Horsford (Jeffries)      Keating (Clark (MA))      Kind (Connolly)      Kirkpatrick (Stanton)      Lawson (FL) (Evans)      Letlow (Cammack)      Levin (MI) (Raskin)      Lieu (Beyer)      Lowenthal (Beyer)      Maloney, Carolyn B.

Madam Speaker, it is my honor to now continue the discussion on  behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus and my cochair of the Special  Order hour, the Honorable Congressman Torres of New York.   Let me, first of all, thank our chair, Chairwoman Beatty, for  matching her members with this process of ensuring that the history,  the unbiased history of a people in all of our variations is told  truthfully.                                time  2015    We, too, are Americans. The Tulsan residents of that time were  Americans as well.   I am reminded of the early stages of my education. When Congressman  [[Page H2411]]  Torres' history was the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria, I could  almost repeat that in my sleep, the three ships that came with  Christopher Columbus. He was the founder of America--over and over  again.   I'm not sure during the period of our early childhood and those of  recent vintage learned anything of Native American history, Korean- American history, Japanese-American, Chinese-American, African- American, slavery. I don't know if our children in periods of the 20th  century and now in the 21st century knew there was more history.   I do know that the past President wanted the Smithsonian, the  African-American culture, to stop teaching about African history. I  know that there was a challenge to the U.S. Department of Education by  Minority Leader McConnell, to stop teaching the 1619 Project. It  baffles me because I believe that, if a country or a people know its  history, we will not be doomed to repeat the past.   When I say ``a people,'' America is represented by many people. If we  knew each other's history, if we understood each other's history, could  we not--even if not those who are already past understanding, but could  our children grow up with empathy and understanding?   That is why we are here on the floor of the House. We are not here to  castigate and to throw untruthful hits. We are here to tell the truth.   Madam Speaker, tears come to my eyes as a series--and I only get to  look at television late in the night, after all the day's work is done,  and there is a series called ``The Underground Railroad.'' You cannot  look at that without shaking in your boots, shaking in the chair you  are sitting in, tears coming to your eyes.   That is the empathy that America can understand for all the journeys  that so many of us have taken. We have taken it, and we are here in  this place. The greatest experiment that the world watches.   Can they make it?   They were watching it from Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation  Proclamation, 1863, and then General Granger in 1865.   They watched us through the 1800s. We failed. Reconstruction did not  work. Even with all the Governors and Congress people that had been  elected are freed slaves. That ugly head of racism, white supremacy,  lynching, the tearing asunder of Black communities, the still tearing  apart of families, the lynching of men and women who went off to the  grocery store--when I say that, the local store, whatever it was down  the road--and never came back.   In 1921--boy, I am just so proud of this picture--this is bustling  Tulsa, Oklahoma. This is the example of the excitement. I am reading  where it says the McGowan Variety Store. There are some McGowans in  Houston. They might be related. These are the prancing people with  their cowboy hats on. It looks as if students, just like we would see  in our neighborhoods today or in our high schools today, dancers, they  had a full holistic community. There is some cars on the street.   Can you imagine 1921?   Oh, I wish I could just take a trip back, just stand on the sidewalk,  and just look with pride of history I did not know. I never imagined  there were cities like Tulsa, Oklahoma, as I was growing up as a child.  I never imagined we had anything, we were worth anything, except for  what my mother and father and grandparents poured into me.   My big mother, which was my great-grandmother, owned property  obviously destroyed by the highways and freeways that came in and took  it away in St. Petersburg, Florida. I just thought that was our way of  life. Just like I thought riding in the back of a train going south to  visit her, sitting by my lonely with a bag of fried chicken--that is  right, I am not embarrassed--to carry me through to visit my  grandmother in St. Petersburg, Florida. Thank God, I got there safely.  I was just about 8 or 9 or 10, and I was sitting in the colored car,  and I wasn't supposed to move except for necessary purposes.   I didn't know--I didn't know I could come here and see this. And our  children don't know it. That is why we are on the floor today. We are  on the floor today because we have to begin to embrace each other's  story.   So I am very delighted that I am leading on H. Res. 398, embraced by  the Congressional Black Caucus. This will be on the floor of the House  this coming Wednesday. And my counterpart in the United States Senate  is a very dear friend, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who believes in this  resolution, that is the recognizing of the forthcoming centennial, the  1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. And it doesn't say ``riot.'' It says  ``massacre.'' It was a massacre.   I Thank the House leadership. I thank them for their understanding  the value and importance of this as we lead into June and begin to move  on H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals.  It is nothing harmful. There is nothing that will undermine anyone. It  is to accept what happened.   So I am so grateful we have almost 100 cosponsors, and maybe more to  come into the next 24 hours, for a story that was never told.   Oh, yes, as a little Black girl, I could tell you about Columbus,  tell you about Abraham Lincoln, tell you about George Washington. And  most of them today in the 21st century, they are not hearing about the  wide diversity of our history, Madam Speaker--yours and mine and the  many people that are on this side of the aisle or that side of the  aisle.   So let me just recount very briefly again. A century ago, White  rioters, local law enforcement, and self-appointed vigilantes claim to  be acting reasonably and in self-defense against what they feared was  an upcoming Black uprising.   Same as January 6, where there are people who had the audacity to say  it looked like tourists on any normal day, when we were laying flat on  the floor in this building while banging and screams and guns drawn on  this side of that door. We didn't know whether we would live. And a  lifesaving shot for that person who did not know what was happening,  attempting to save lives. Sadly, someone lost their life.    Members in near panic--rightly so--leaving these Chambers and walking  down and seeing AK-47s in the hands of individuals laying flat on the  ground, that our brave officers had under their watch.   Yes, rioters. But in Greenwood, I want this picture to be embedded in  your DNA, because you will see economic prosperity, self-sufficiency.  Yes, it was known as the Black Wall Street. They viewed, however, black  males as fearsome, physical threats to their personal safety, and the  rivals of White women. I don't know what happened in an elevator,  allegedly. The story, you know, it is always a mystery, but some claim  of some insult that occurred.   And all of a sudden the word went out enraging leaders of the White  community, fine citizens, probably in some church over the weekend.  When I say in their church in that time, because they were always using  the Bible wrongly and incorrectly. And I will say that because I  believe in a merciful redemptive Jesus, as a Christian. There are many  other faiths, Torah and Koran and others.   But I know in the redemptive faith of Christianity, we believe in  redemption. We don't go out because we know that we have had one to  sacrifice for us on the cross so that we might be redeemed. We sing  that song in our community, ``Let the Redeemed Say So.'' But apparently  they didn't have that memory.   100,000 Black people lived in that area, sold luxury items. Twenty- one restaurants, 30 grocery stores, a hospital, savings and loan, a  post office, three hotels, jewelry and clothing, two movie theaters, a  library, pool halls, bus and cab service, a nationally recognized  school system. A nationally recognized school system, when all of us  are fighting for our children to be educated.   Today, I left Houston. And guess what? We have a new resident of  Texas: Curtis Jackson, known as 50 Cent.   We were standing together because he was producing with Mayor Turner  and Al Kashani and the School Superintendent Grenita Lathan, and all  elected officials to announce an entrepreneurial program.   Can you imagine, to be able to build up our children?   They had two Black newspapers, six private planes. And I want to say  it again, a recognized school system.   On May 31 of that year, 35 city blocks went up in flames and 300  persons were  [[Page H2412]]  murdered and, to my knowledge, buried in an unmarked grave; 800 were  injured and 9,000 were left homeless.   Yes, one cannot ignore this history, but it has been ignored, it has  been snuffed out, it has been put under.   I never knew about it until people like Dr. Crutcher, from this great  city, and various leaders that have brought to our attention even more.  But over the years, obviously, in my study of reparations, I have seen  the insults that have happened when no one bothered to respond.   Brutality that we are now trying to correct by acknowledging in H.  Res. 398, and I hope my colleagues will come to the floor of the House  to be able to address it.   Let me show you what that massacre generated, and you will  understand.   Madam Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Madam Speaker, you saw the bustling town. You saw  the bustling town. This is a charred Negro who suffered in the Tulsa  riots.   Yes, I am like Emmett Till's mother, Let the world see it. This is  what happened to an innocent Black person.   By the way, the dead included children. Tulsa Historical Society.  This is America. And this is a story that we failed to tell. This is  what happened.   We have more stories to tell. We believe that a picture is worth a  thousands words. We can never, never overcome that burned, charred  body.   I showed you what Tulsa looked like, the Black Wall Street, and the  burned-out ruins of Greenwood. Tulsa, Oklahoma library--they even got  it in the library. I don't know how many people have seen it. It is a  wasteland, a literal wasteland. Smoke is coming up. People's homes are  gone. Wealth is gone. People were never to be presented with any  relief. None. I don't even think they got a thank-you--not even a  thank-you.   So our resolution condemns violence and destruction perpetrated  against the African-American community of Greenwood. Our resolution has  a rejection and active opposition to the false ideology of white  supremacy and condemnation of all groups. Our resolution believes in  promoting tolerance and unity, and taking action to ensure governmental  policies and action to promote tolerance and unity.   Our resolution is calling for all Americans to celebrate the ethnic,  racial, and religious diversity that has made the United States great.  Our resolution encourages all persons of the United States to reflect  upon the history of the United States as an imperfect but committed  journey to establish a more perfect union. Our resolution is recognized  as a commitment of Congress to acknowledge and learn from the history  of racism and racial violence in the United States.   Our resolution lays the groundwork for moving to H.R. 40, the  Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals, because we can  see it in real life.                                time  2030    So this is part of the Tulsa that never got acknowledged.   Madam Speaker, let me show you additional fires so you can see the  buildings going up in smoke. We are not making it up. All of these  buildings--brick buildings--were burned to the ground.   Can you imagine someone who survived the post-traumatic stress, the  horrors of their life, the willingness not to live anymore, and the  giving up of hope?   People wonder, oh, those lazy Negroes and colored people who worked  for over 250 years in bondage.   Finally, I am going to put the picture of the slaves, the  individuals. So this is the story we tell tonight. We don't even tell  it with a sense of vengeance. We tell it with a sense of dignity,  respect, and honor. The courage of those people, and the genius of  those people--they weren't even freed slaves for 100 years and look  what they created.   There is a story on CNN: ``My great-grandmother survived the 1921  Tulsa massacre. We are not heeding her history.'' For what was once the  wealthiest Black neighborhood in America became charred ash in a matter  of hours. But we have not come to a conclusion to end this kind of  White supremacy and racism.   Madam Speaker, I include this in the Record.                          [From CNN, May 14, 2021]   Opinion: My Great-Grandmother Survived the 1921 Tulsa Massacre. We're                          Not Heeding Her History         A century ago, my Black brothers and sisters were decimated       by one of the worst occurrences of racial violence in our       nation's history. On May 31 and June 1, 1921, White gangs       flooded into the thriving Greenwood neighborhood and murdered       up to 300 Black men, women and children. According to the       Tulsa Historical Society, 1,500 Black homes were burned,       along with over 600 businesses, and places of worship,       healing, learning and gathering.        My great-grandmother, Rebecca Brown Crutcher--a woman who       was the picture of Black excellence--lived and worked in the       Greenwood community. But in 1921, she fled in fear of her       life as White Tulsans burned her neighborhood to the ground.        What was once the wealthiest Black neighborhood in America       became charred ash in a matter of hours. 10,000 Black       residents were left homeless--and an entire generation of       Black Tulsans were robbed of their wealth and prosperity they       had built. To this day, not one person has ever been held       accountable and not a single cent of reparations has been       paid to the survivors or the victims' descendants.        Without this necessary reckoning with the past, we're       already repeating it. As Oklahoma and many around the world       are preparing to mark the centennial of the 1921 Tulsa Race       Massacre, last month, Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt signed a       law criminalizing peaceful protesters and giving immunity to       drivers who ``unintentionally'' kill or injure protesters.       This law is, according to the count kept by the International       Center for Not-For-Profit Law, just one of 81 anti-protest       bills introduced in 34 states during the 2021 legislative       session alone--most of them framed as a response to last       summer's Black Lives Matter protests. But instead of tackling       the root causes of these nationwide protests against police       brutality, racism and anti-Blackness, many lawmakers are       attempting to intimidate, malign and criminalize peaceful       protesters.        Laws like this one will undoubtedly have painful and long-      lasting consequences in Oklahoma and the rest of the nation.       Black, brown and Indigenous people will surely be locked up,       ripped apart from their families, and may lose their jobs for       exercising their First Amendment right to peacefully assemble       in a protest. They will surely receive harsher punishments       for protesting police brutality and racial injustice than,       for instance, White protesters demonstrating for gun rights       or for their desire to control a woman's body.        This isn't the only bill introduced in Oklahoma this       session that's followed the Tulsa Race Massacre's sinister       legacy of suppression and erasure of Black Oklahomans. Half a       dozen bills have already been introduced to restrict absentee       voting and require identification to vote, echoing the       growing trend of voting restrictions around the country.       Historically in our state as elsewhere, these tactics have       been used to disenfranchise Black and brown, poor and older       communities and people with disabilities, with the precedent       being set in one state and spreading like wildfire to the       rest of the country.        On May 7, Governor Stitt signed HB 1775 into law, which       will prohibit Oklahoma schools from teaching critical race       theory--or in other words important lessons about systemic       racism and diversity. The measure is meant to essentially       stifle important discussions about, among other things, the       1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, the Trail of Tears and the Osage       murders in classrooms and beyond. Erasing our history, yet       again, will have devastating consequences. And Oklahoma isn't       alone--bills banning or restricting the teaching of critical       race theory have been drafted in Iowa, Louisiana, Missouri,       New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and West Virginia and       already passed in Utah, Arkansas, Idaho and Tennessee.        Bills like HB 1775 attempt to obscure the fact that heinous       instances of racial violence, from slavery to Jim Crow laws       to the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, are not blemishes on our       history but consequences of discriminatory systems that       continue to harm Black people today.        Such laws are designed to prevent a full and honest       accounting of how systemic racism works. The bill says it       will prohibit the teaching that ``an individual, by virtue of       his or her race or sex, bears responsibility for actions       committed in the past by other members of the same race or       sex,'' thereby upholding White supremacy and helping absolve       the city of Tulsa and the state of the moral obligation of       paying reparations to the survivors and descendants of the       Tulsa Race Massacre. HB 1775 also flies in the face of       reality--as if the wealth and security stripped from Black       Tulsans a century ago doesn't have a direct relationship to       the widening gaps in home ownership, education, life       expectancy and arrest rates today.        Each of us should learn the hard lessons of the 1921 Tulsa       Race Massacre and the continued harm shouldered by the       survivors, the descendants and the neighborhood of Greenwood.       We should learn that race, racism and discrimination have       very real, concrete effects on our history, our culture, our       politics and our current lives. But we can't learn the truth       or grow from it if it's hidden from us--and that's precisely       what HB 1775 attempts  [[Page H2413]]       to do. In so doing, this measure continues the harm of the       1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, because a century later, Stitt and       our elected officials are still trying to bury the lessons       that our ancestors would want us to carry forward.        As a descendant of a Tulsa Race Massacre survivor, it's       painful to see Oklahoma's governor refuse to learn from our       history and acknowledge its continuing impact today. Instead,       he's chosen to saddle our teachers and educators with even       more baggage, and potentially penalize them for doing what's       right.        My hope is that our teachers will look this evil in the eye       and refuse to give in or back down. I hope they will continue       teaching the truth about topics like the 1921 Tulsa Race       Massacre--including that it was borne from White supremacy, a       mortal threat to our democracy that remains with us today.       Our students deserve the unbridled truth, not a polished       facade that makes us feel good about ourselves.     Madam Speaker, I include the KJRH article in the  Record.                                [From KJRH]     Gov. Stitt Responds to Letter From Tulsa Race Massacre Commission         Tulsa, OK, May 14, 2021.--Gov. Kevin Stitt has officially       been removed from the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial       Commission.        This comes after Stitt signed a bill limiting race and       gender curriculums in Oklahoma schools earlier in May. House       Bill 1775 prohibits state public schools, colleges, and       universities from incorporating certain messages about sex       and race into any course instruction.        This also comes on the 100th anniversary of the 1921 Tulsa       race massacre, where a white mob attacked Black residents and       businesses in the Greenwood District of Tulsa, also known as       Black Wall Street.        The governor's office released the following statement       Friday afternoon:        ``Governor Stitt's role as a member of the 1921 Tulsa Race       Massacre Centennial Commission has been purely ceremonial and       he had not been invited to attend a meeting until this week.       It is disappointing to see an organization of such importance       spend so much effort to sow division based on falsehoods and       political rhetoric two weeks before the centennial and a       month before the commission is scheduled to sunset. The       governor and first lady will continue to support the       revitalization of the Greenwood District, honest       conversations about racial reconciliation and pathways of       hope in Oklahoma.''        The commission sent 2 News the following statement:        ``The 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commissioners met       Tuesday and agreed through consensus to part ways with       Governor Stitt. No elected officials, nor representatives of       elected officials, were involved in this decision. While the       Commission is disheartened to part ways with Governor Stitt,       we are thankful for the things accomplished together. The       Commission remains focused on lifting up the story of Black       Wall Street and commemorating the Centennial. With just weeks       before the Centennial of one of the worst Race massacres in       the history of the U.S., Commissioners stand united in       focusing time, energy and efforts on descendants, survivors,       education, economic development and progress this year and       beyond. We hope to see many of you in person or virtually at       some of our events that we hope will drive change for years       to come.''        The commission previously issued Stitt a letter after he       did not join a special meeting Monday night to discuss the       signing of HB 1775 into law.        Phil Armstrong, the project director of the 1921 Tulsa Race       Massacre Centennial Commission, said HB 1775 ``chills the       ability of educators to teach students, of any age, and will       only serve to intimidate educators who seek to reveal and       process our hidden history. You know that. We delivered this       message to you before you signed the measure. We were joined       by educators, school boards, universities, faith, and       community leaders, all of whom vigorously objected to HB       1775. You seemingly disregarded and dismissed this chorus of       voices aligned against HB 1775.''        The governor responded by saying, in part, ``it is       disappointing that some commission members feel that a       common-sense law preventing students from being taught that       one race or sex is superior to another is contrary to the       mission of reconciliation and restoration.''        C.J. Webber-Neal, president of the Greenwood Arts &       Cultural Society, INC., also called for the governor's       resignation as a commission member. In a statement, Webber-      Neal said he was satisfied with having Stitt removed from the       commission.        ``The Greenwood Arts & Cultural Society, INC. is very       pleased that the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial       Commission has with one concise voice taken action to remove       Kevin Stitt, Governor of Oklahoma, from it body.        Based upon the stated mission of this body, we stand in       solidarity with their action regarding Governor Stitt's role       as a member of this Commission, based upon his signing of HB       1775 into law. The truth of the horrific story of 1921's Race       Massacre (as well as other history of the experiences of       minorities in America) must be taught honestly and       unequivocally, so that future generations will learn of the       demons of our past so we as a society will not be doomed to       repeat this evil act.        At this time, we also encourage this body to add in the       Governor's place survivors and descendants of the massacre,       so that representation of this painful period in our history       can be reflected thru the experiences of those who were       directly impacted by this tragic event.        Furthermore, we encourage any available monetary relief be       given by this organization to the three survivors of the 1921       Tulsa Race Massacre. This should be done as both a sign of       reconciliation and the rising of the eternal spirit of       Greenwood. This we believe is long overdue.''     Madam Speaker, I include a detailed account of the  Tulsa Race Massacre in the Congressional Record.              Detailed Account of Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921   ACCOUNT BASED ON FACTS AND DOCUMENTS REPORTED IN ``FINAL REPORT OF THE        OKLAHOMA COMMISSSION TO STUDY THE TULSA RACE RIOT OF 1921''         Starting late on the evening on May 31 and continuing into       the day of June 1, 1921, a White mob attacked the Greenwood       district of Tulsa, Oklahoma, razing it to the ground. The       attackers looted and intentionally burned an estimated 1,256       homes in Greenwood--known as America's ``Black Wall       Street''--along with nearly all the district's churches,       schools, and businesses.        The number of persons killed in the riot may never be       known, but a 2001 report by African Americans during this era       lived under the ever-present threat of mass racial violence--      which often took the form of White mobs invading Black       communities. It was also during this period that thousands of       African Americans accused of crimes against White people--but       particularly Black men accused of sexual assaulting White       women--were summarily executed by White lynch mobs. Local       authorities at the time often condoned or even participated       in these extrajudicial killings or otherwise did little to       nothing to stop them.        Yet despite this national atmosphere, Tulsa's Greenwood       district thrived. Black workers were mostly shut out of the       booming oil industry driving Tulsa's meteoric turn-of-the-      century growth, so many working-class residents had to find       work doing menial or domestic labor. Greenwood's vibrant       economy instead was driven mainly by residents'       entrepreneurial skills previously developed in the many all-      Black towns that dotted the Oklahoma landscape. The range of       Black-owned businesses located in Greenwood included grand       hotels, restaurants, theaters, pharmacies, diners,       barbershops, and small mom-and-pop shops. Greenwood was also       home to hundreds of professionals, including doctors,       lawyers, and real estate agents. Many residents lived under       conditions typical of the working-class in that era and       subsisted without running water or electricity. The       district's more prosperous residents lived in modern houses       befitting their middle and upper-class economic status.       Simply put, by the time of the Massacre, the residents of       Greenwood had created a thriving, and, in many ways       economically self-sufficient, Black enclave.        No African American had been lynched in Tulsa at the time       of the Massacre. The threat of racially motivated violence,       however, cast an everpresent shadow over the Greenwood       district. Incidents of lynching occurring across the country       were heavily reported in the local Black press. Editorials in       local Black-owned newspapers in Tulsa published the year or       so leading up to the Massacre decried instances of ``mob       law'' and prominent Greenwood residents advocated for armed       African Americans to protect Black prisoners from White lynch       mobs. Most saliently, the lynching of a White man in Tulsa       and of a young African American man in Oklahoma City within       the same week in the year proceeding the Massacre convinced       many Black Tulsans that local authorities could not be       counted on to protect a Black person accused of a serious       crime against a White person.        Notably--but unsurprisingly in segregated Tulsa--none of       these Black viewpoints on lynching were reflected in the       local White press, and likely few, if any White Tulsans       regularly read Black-owned newspapers. Instead, the White-      owned press focused at that time on crime and allegations of       local corruption. An oil boomtown at the beginning of the       Prohibition Era, Tulsa's crime rate in the early 1920's       appeared to residents to be increasing. In particular, the       city had gained a seedy reputation for illegal liquor and       prostitution.        For the most part during the period leading up to the       Massacre, White-owned papers had not blamed African Americans       for the apparent rise in crime, and crimes in Greenwood did       not receive a disproportionate amount of coverage. But only       10 days prior to the Massacre, a story focused White Tulsans'       attention on the then-racially inflammatory subject of       relations between Black men and White women. On May 21, 1921,       a local story regarding a police investigation into the       city's prostitution quoted a former local judge blaming the       problem on the hotels and ``Negro pimps,'' and recounted the       testimony of a local clergyman that led a group of White men       undercover who claimed that African American porters       routinely offered them the services of White  [[Page H2414]]       prostitutes, and to have witnessed carousing between Black       men and White women at a roadhouse just outside the city       limits.        To be clear, as this contemporary newspaper story implies,       the racism and prejudices of many White Tulsans tainted their       perceptions of the Black community and the later events that       set off the Massacre. Despite the fact that racial       segregation laws were gaining ground statewide in       Oklahoma, many White Tulsans appeared to fear that the       color line was blurring and grew angry at instances where       Black Tulsans challenged or ignored segregationist laws       and practices. Further contributing to some White Tulsans'       racial grievances was resentment of Greenwood's most       prosperous residents, a feeling that appears to have been       exacerbated by a drop in oil prices and subsequent oil       field layoffs that preceded the Massacre. In a deeply       segregated city where Black residents could not work, live       near, or socialize with their fellow residents as equals,       many White Tulsans filled the vacuum created by the lack       of racial equality and understanding with racism and       prejudice.        This local newspaper story, and another on a breakout at       the jail printed a few days later (though containing no       racial overtones) appeared to provide White Tulsans fed up       with crime--and inflamed by racial prejudice--a convenient       racial scapegoat for their frustrations, and contributed to       longstanding local conditions that had turned Tulsa into a       powder keg waiting for a spark to ignite.        The night of May 31, 1921, the spark was struck as Black       Tulsans' fear of a lynching appeared on the cusp of       realization. That day police took into custody nineteen-year-      old Dick Rowland, a Black man accused of sexually assaulting       Sarah Page, a seventeen-year-old White elevator operator.       After word of the allegations spread through Tulsa's       newspapers. One White-owned Tulsa paper ran an article       entitled ``Nab Negro for Attacking Girl in Elevator'' and a       number of eyewitnesses recall seeing a newspaper editorial       entitled ``To Lynch Negro--that evening a large White crowd       began to gather around the courthouse jail where Rowland was       being held. At the same time, several groups of Black       Tulsans--many of whom were World War I veterans--resolved to       protect the Black prisoner threatened by the mob.        As the mob jeered the handful of deputy sheriffs guarding       the courthouse, a group of 25 Black Tulsans approached the       beleaguered officers to offer their assistance. The local       authorities quickly declined their offer, but the sight of       armed Black men insistent on protecting Rowland from ``mob       law'' proved too much for the thousand-strong White crowd. As       the Black Tulsans returned to Greenwood assured of Rowland's       safety for the moment, some members of the White crowd left       to obtain firearms from their homes.        The Massacre began after a second group of around 75 armed       Black Tulsans returned to the courthouse later that evening       following reports that the White mob continued to grow even       larger (later estimated at 2,000 individuals) and more       agitated. They again offered their assistance to local       authorities guarding Rowland and were again rebuffed. This       time, however, as they departed, elements of the White crowd       accosted a Black World War I veteran with a racial slur and a       demand for his weapon. When the veteran refused, a scuffle       broke out over the gun and shots were fired.        While these shots could have been unintentional, members of       the White mob--and possibly some members of law enforcement       present at the courthouse--immediately opened fire on all the       Black men present. The Black Tulsans returned fire. While the       initial shooting at the courthouse lasted only a few seconds,       several street battles erupted among groups of Black and       White Tulsans. The Black Tulsans--significantly outnumbered       by the mob and fighting now for their own lives--engaged in a       fighting retreated, exchanging gunfire with their White       pursuers as they sought to return to the relative safety of       the Greenwood district.   In the immediate aftermath of the events at the courthouse, some  Whites began making brief armed forays into Greenwood by car or  committing indiscriminate acts of looting, murder, and mayhem. Around  1:00 a.m. on June 1 there began the first reports of fires being set.  When the fire brigade answered the call, armed Whites prevented them  from putting out the fires. By 4:00 a.m. more than two dozen Black- owned businesses had been destroyed by flames. The worst destruction,  however, had yet to come.        As many of these events were occurring simultaneous and       across a relative wide area of the city, confusion reigned as       the night of May 31 became the early morning hours of June 1,       1921. Some Black residents resolved to defend their homes and       businesses, taking up armed positions to defend Greenwood.       Skirmishes broke out between armed Blacks and Whites at       various points in the district in the early overnight hours.       Other Black residents, rightly fearing the worst had yet to       occur, began to leave the city--many escaped but some were       killed.        Still other Black residents thought the worst had already       happened; that as far as they knew Dick Rowland had not been       lynched, and--with the most intense skirmishing having abated       by 2:00 a.m. according to one Black eyewitness--some of       Greenwood's defenders even concluded that they had       successfully fended off the attackers.        Whites engaged in the attack also committed numerous other       atrocities. According to one Black eyewitness, White looters       murdered a Black elderly disabled man who, despite having       expressed a willingness to do so, could not comply with their       order to leave his home. According to one White eyewitness,       prominent Black surgeon Dr. A.C. Jackson was gunned down on       his front lawn with his hands up after attempting to comply       with the White rioters. Another Black eyewitness recounted       how he and 30 or 40 other men who had surrendered to the       rioters were lined up and forced to run with hands over their       heads to an interment center located at Convention Hall, all       while some of their White captors shot at their heels with       guns. A group of White men even ran a car into the group,       knocking over two or three of their number. In another       horrifying display of brutality, a Black disabled homeless       man was tied by his leg to a car and dragged by ``white       thugs'' through the streets of the downtown business district       where he panhandled.        Many Black residents--including women with children or       elderly family members in tow--were shot at in the streets as       they attempted to flee. Despite the ferocity of the       attackers, many Black residents continued their armed       resistance. Eventually, however, these defenders were       overwhelmed by the sheer force of numbers and firepower of       the White invaders.        Of course, not all Tulsans shared the racism of the White       rioters. There are several accounts of Whites hiding Black       Tulsans fleeing the violence at farms or homes outside the       city or standing up to White rioters who threatened them for       sheltering Black acquaintances at their workplace. According       to one account, a recent young Mexican immigrant named Maria       Morales Gutierrez saved two Black children from being strafed       by an airplane. She then later refused White rioters' demands       to hand the children over to them. She and the children       survived.        The assault and destruction of Greenwood lasted roughly       until midday June 1, 1921, when martial law was declared.       Around 9:00 a.m., a National Guard unit based in Oklahoma       City--which was entirely White--finally arrived by train       after having been requested hours earlier by local       authorities. By the time these ``State Troops''--as both       Blacks and Whites later referred to them to differentiate       them from the local ``Home Guard'' unit discussed further       below--arrived in Tulsa, the violence had been occurring for       nearly 11 hours. Many Blacks and Whites were dead, and while       some looting continued, the Greenwood district was mostly in       fiery ruin. Most of the city's Black residents had either       fled or had been interned against their will at several       locations, including at the Convention Hall, a fairground,       and a baseball park.        Local authorities later claimed that this was for the       protection of Black lives, but without a doubt they were also       motivated by lingering fear of a supposed ``Negro uprising.''        A number of these ``Special Deputies''--identified by       ribbons and other ``badges of office'' supplied to them--were       witnessed engaging in arson, likely engaged in other acts of       violence and mayhem during the Massacre and aided in rounding       up Black residents for internment.        Immediately following the shooting near the courthouse,       Whites had begun breaking into sporting good stores,       pawnshops, and hardware stores to steal firearms with which       to arm themselves--some later claiming that they were       ``borrowing'' the weapons.        One business owner--whose sporting goods store was       literally across the street from police headquarters--later       testified that a police officer helped distribute the guns       that were taken from his store.        The local guard unit also worked with the Tulsa Police       Department to round up, disarm, and take into custody Black       residents, with guardsmen offering the promise that if they       came peacefully their homes and businesses would be       protected.        This action, however, effectively left Black lives and       property defenseless to a White Mob aided by local police       officers and their ``Special Deputies'', leading to further       destruction of property and helping contribute to the near       total internment of the Black population in the days       immediately following the riot.        In the eyes of the grand jury, a group of armed Black       residents standing up for equal rights understandably       provoked the White crowd, and therefore, the entire Black       community in Greenwood essentially deserved what happened.       Adding to this injustice, the grand jury indicted 85 people--      the majority of whom were African Americans--with Massacre-      related offenses.        While most of these charges were ultimately dismissed or       not pursued no Whites were ever sent to prison for any of the       murders or arson committed on May 31 and June 1, 1921.        Due to their decades-long efforts, the story of the       Massacre slowly resurfaced in the national consciousness,       leading to greater demands for the justice long denied to       aging survivors and their next of kin.        At the state and local level, in 1997 the Oklahoma State       Legislature created the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Race       Riot of 1921. In 2001, the commission issued a final report       and recommendations. In a letter to officials for the State       of Oklahoma  [[Page H2415]]       and the City of Tulsa accompanying the report, the commission       noted that in February 2000, the commission had already       declared:        that reparations to the historic Greenwood community in       real and tangible form would be good public policy and do       much to repair the emotional and physical scars of this       terrible incident in our shared past. We listed several       recommended courses of action including direct payments to       riot survivors and descendants; a scholarship fund available       to students affected by the riot; establishment of an       economic development enterprise zone in the historic       Greenwood district; a memorial for the riot victims.        The commission reiterated its support for reparations and       emphasized that these recommendations were a starting point       and not exhaustive. Twenty years later, however, neither the       State of Oklahoma nor the City of Tulsa has provided direct       compensation to survivors and their descendants.        In recent years, the City of Tulsa has made some token       gestures to acknowledge the Massacre. In 2010, the City of       Tulsa dedicated the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park to       commemorate the Massacre's victims. In 2018, the City of       Tulsa finally announced that it would reexamine the potential       mass graves noted in the 2001 commission report. In October       2020, archeologists discovered a mass grave at Oaklawn       Cemetery, one of the possible mass grave sites identified in       the 2001 report, and the City plans to exhume the bodies for       further identification in June 2021. While the City of Tulsa       has, in effect, capitalized on its public campaign to       acknowledge the Massacre, pointedly, it appears to have made       no plan to use the resources generated to directly compensate       survivors and their descendants nor address the racial and       economic disparities that can be traced back to the Massacre.       In May 2020, Human Rights Watch issued a report recommending       several actions to be taken at the federal, state, and local       level to address the Massacre, including providing       compensation directly to survivors and their descendants, and       reparations to the Black community in Tulsa for racial       discrimination exacerbated by the Massacre. According to the       report, Greenwood had begun to thrive again by the 1940s. Yet       rather than preserve what it once allowed to be destroyed,       the State of Oklahoma and the City of Tulsa took several       subsequent actions that disproportionately burdened Black       residents--including the building of several highways through       Greenwood starting in the 1960s and through the 1970s--that       ultimately led to Greenwood's long term decline.        These actions also forced the majority of residents to move       out of historic Greenwood into North Tulsa, which to this day       is significantly poorer compared to other areas of the city.        Additionally, survivors and their descendants have filed       legal claims against the City of Tulsa and the State of       Oklahoma seeking compensation for Massacre-related harms.       Unfortunately, time and distance from the events have in the       past worked to thwart these claims. In 2004, the Tenth       Circuit, upholding the lower court's decision to grant the       State and City's motion for summary judgment, held that the       plaintiffs' claims were barred by the applicable statute of       limitations, and that no equitable tolling to the statute of       limitations period applied. The Supreme Court denied the       plaintiff's petition for writ of certiorari in 2005. Despite       these adverse legal rulings, a lawsuit for Massacre-related       claims was filed in state court last year alleging that the       Massacre is an ongoing injustice to the residents of       Greenwood because contemporary racial and economic       disparities existing in Tulsa can be traced back to the       attack.     Then I want to salute those who will be honoring 100  years in the next couple of weeks. I want to very quickly say that  remember what I said, I knew the history of Christopher Columbus. I  didn't know the history of my Native American brothers. I didn't know  the history of my own self, slavery. I know Big Mother, which is what  we called her. She owned land, and then I knew it disappeared. I knew I  rode in the back of a train to visit her as a little girl.   Guess what, Madam Speaker?   Governor Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma was on the commission on the Tulsa  race massacre, but he signed the bill limiting race and gender  curriculums in Oklahoma schools earlier in May.   Madam Speaker, can you believe it?   It was House bill 1775. As well, he goes on to not stand for what  this commission is all about: truth.   So tonight we come to the floor. Remember what I said: I am not in  any way throwing darts or stones at anyone. I am here to raise up the  dignity of this man, this person, this body, burned because he was  Black, prosperous, and ready to serve America.   No one can tell me how many in that 1921 massacre had been in World  War I, had worn the uniform and come home and made a new life.   How many can tell us out of those who would have lived, would have  been ready to go serve in World War II and then on, and their progeny  continue to build this wonderful economic engine?   Today those who remain are three living descendants of those who were  there. They tell me as I will go to Tulsa, there is one door left.   It is a crying shame. So I lift this story up, and I let you know,  Madam Speaker, that the Congressional Black Caucus, yes, the conscience  of this Nation, has a vital purpose to be able to tell the story.  Someone I hope is listening. Someone I hope is listening. Someone I  hope heard Brother Torres. I hope they heard Hank Johnson and Barbara  Lee. I hope they have heard all of us. Because if we do not know our  history, we are doomed to repeat it. We must take the reins, lift up  the dignity, honor these courageous saints, and we must fight on.   Pass this resolution on the centennial. Pass H.R. 40 to establish a  commission to study reparations. Pass the American Jobs Plan, pass the  American Rescue Plan, and lift all boats. For as we do so, God will be  the witness for what we have done and the journey we have made.   Madam Speaker, I am honored to have been here today. I am honored to  be part of the Congressional Black Caucus. I am honored to be part of  this House of Representatives. I am honored to be an American, and I  will not have my history denied or my children failing to know that  history. That is why we are here today. Let us march on until victory  is won.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.    Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Congressional Black  Caucus, I rise to anchor this most important Special Order remembering  one of the darkest moments in American history, the Tulsa-Greenwood  Race Massacre, that occurred in the African American Greenwood  community of Tulsa, Oklahoma, on May 31-June 1, 1921.   I am pleased to be joined by Congressman Torres of New York, who will  co-anchor this Special Order and my several members of the  Congressional Black Caucus, which under the leadership of our Chair,  Congresswoman Beatty of Ohio, was unified and determined that the reign  of racial terror, carried out under color of law, that was visited on  the black citizens of Greenwood not be forgotten and that the injuries  they suffered be redressed.   Madam Speaker, earlier this year, I introduced a resolution (H. Res.  215 later modified as H. Res. 398), joined by 84 cosponsors,  recognizing the centennial of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre.   As the great southern writer William Faulkner reminded us: ``The past  is never dead. It's not even past.''   Madam Speaker, as I and other Members will elucidate this evening,  the hatreds, prejudices, resentments, and white supremacy that Black  Americans witnessed and suffered in Greenwood a century ago are not  dead; they are not even past.   A century ago, White rioters, local law enforcement, and self- appointed vigilantes claimed to be acting reasonably and in self- defense against what they feared was an upcoming Black uprising.   They resented the economic prosperity and self-sufficiency of the  Greenwood community, which was known nationally as ``Black Wall  Street.''   They viewed Black males as fearsome physical threats to their  personal safety and as rivals to white women.   These baseless, irrational concerns are not a relic of the past, they  are with us today and are what resulted in the deaths of George Floyd,  Tamir Rice, Deonte Wright, Stephon Clark, Amidou Diallo, and hundreds  of others too numerous to list.   In 1921, Tulsa, Oklahoma's Greenwood District, known as ``Black Wall  Street,'' was one of the most documented prosperous African American  communities in the United States.   The Greenwood community with a population of over 100,000 Black  people had stores that sold luxury items, 21 restaurants, 30 grocery  stores, a hospital, a savings and loan bank, a post office, three  hotels, jewelry and clothing stores, two movie theaters, a library,  pool halls, a bus and cab service, a nationally recognized school  system, six private airplanes, and two black newspapers.   On May 31st of that year, the 35 city blocks of Greenwood went up in  flames, at least 300 Black persons were murdered and more than 800 were  injured; it is estimated that not less than 9,000 were left homeless  and destitute.   These rioters reenacted the brutality of the mob from a hundred years  ago in the hallowed halls of the Citadel of Democracy.   It should not be overlooked that the source of their irrational  anger, hatred, and violent reaction was that Black Americans voted in  overwhelming numbers in Atlanta, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, and Detroit  to oust the most negative, divisive, racially hostile, and incompetent  president's history, the 45th President,  [[Page H2416]]  who presided over the deaths of more than 500,000 Americans,  disproportionately Black and Brown.   The legacy of white mob violence inflicted upon the Black community  of Greenwood has scarred the descendants of the victims of this  American pogrom.   Madam Speaker, the events of January 6th have given us insight into  what the people of Greenwood, Oklahoma, faced when they were attacked  by a similar murderous mob.   H.R. 398 is a reminder to the nation of the ultimate cruelty  inflicted upon a people for dare believing that the promise of America  was attainable by them and their achievements would be respected and  protected by law.   But it does more than that, it puts the House of Representatives on  record that the United States can achieve a more perfect union:   1. by condemning the violence and destruction perpetrated against the  African-American community of Greenwood, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the scene  of the then-largest single instance of domestic terror against American  citizens;   2. through the rejection and active opposition to the false ideology  of White supremacy and condemnation of all groups and organizations  that ascribe to this false system of belief and seek to perpetuate  their views through violence and unlawful conduct;   3. by promoting tolerance and unity and taking actions to ensure that  governmental policies and actions do not foster division, disharmony,  or intolerance;   4. by calling upon all Americans to celebrate the ethnic, racial, and  religious diversity that has made the United States the leader of the  community of nations and the beacon of hope and inspiration to  oppressed persons everywhere;   5. encouraging all persons in the United States to reflect upon the  history of the United States as an imperfect but committed journey to  establish a more perfect union and to cherish and exercise the rights,  privileges, and responsibilities guaranteed by the Constitution; and   6. recognizing the commitment of Congress to acknowledge and learn  from the history of racism and racial violence in the United States,  including the Tulsa Race Massacre, to reverse the legacy of White  supremacy and fight for racial justice.   Madam Speaker, I will now briefly recount the horrific events cited  in H. Res. 398 that were experienced by the law-abiding Black community  of Greenwood on those terrible days.   In 1921, White supremacy and racist violence were common throughout  the United States and went largely unchecked by the justice system.   In Tulsa, Oklahoma, reports of an alleged and disputed incident on  the morning of May 30, 1921, between two teenagers, a Black man and a  White woman, caused the White community of Tulsa, including the Tulsa  Tribune, to call for a lynching amidst a climate of White racial  hostility and White resentment over Black economic success.   On May 31, 1921, a mob of armed White men descended upon Tulsa's  Greenwood District and launched what is now known as the ``Tulsa Race  Massacre.''   Tulsa municipal and county authorities failed to take actions to calm  or contain the violence, and civil and law enforcement officials  deputized many White men who were participants in the violence as their  agents, directly contributing to the violence through overt and often  illegal acts.   Over a period of 24 hours, the White mob's violence led to the death  of an estimated 300 Black residents, as well as over 800 reports of  injuries.   The White mob looted, damaged, burned, or otherwise destroyed  approximately 40 square blocks of the Greenwood district, including an  estimated 1,256 homes of Black residents, as well as virtually every  other structure, including churches, schools, businesses, a hospital,  and a library, leaving nearly 9,000 Black residents of the Greenwood  community homeless and effectively wiping out tens of millions of  dollars in Black prosperity and wealth.   In the wake of the Tulsa Race Massacre, the Governor of Oklahoma  declared martial law, and units of the Oklahoma National Guard  participated in the mass arrests of all or nearly all of Greenwood's  surviving residents, removing them from Greenwood to other parts of  Tulsa and unlawfully detaining them in holding centers.   Oklahoma local and state governments dismissed claims arising from  the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre for decades, and the event was effectively  erased from collective memory and history until, in 1997, the Oklahoma  State Legislature finally created a commission to study the event.   On February 28, 2001, the commission issued a report that detailed,  for the first time, the extent of the Massacre and decades-long efforts  to suppress its recollection.   None of the law enforcement officials nor any of the hundreds of  other White mob members who participated in the violence were ever  prosecuted or held accountable for the hundreds of lives lost and tens  of millions of dollars of Black wealth destroyed, despite the Tulsa  Race Massacre Commission confirming their roles in the Massacre, nor  was any compensation ever provided to the Massacre's victims or their  descendants.   Government and city officials not only abdicated their responsibility  to rebuild and repair the Greenwood community in the wake of the  violence, but actively blocked efforts to do so, contributing to  continued racial disparities in Tulsa akin to those that Black people  still face today across the United States.   Madam Speaker, the pattern of violence against Black people in the  United States, often at the hands of law enforcement, shows that the  fight to end State-sanctioned violence against Black people continues.   As the American Historical Association stated, ``What happened in  Tulsa was extreme, but not unusual. It is part of our nation's  heritage. We must acknowledge that heritage, learn from it, and do  whatever each of us can do to ensure that it is just that--heritage,  rather than a continuing practice.''   Madam Speaker, I will include in the Record a more detailed account  of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre that is based on the ``Final Report of  the Oklahoma Commission to Study The Tulsa Race Riot of 1921,'' issued  February 28, 2001.   Madam Speaker, I also ask the House to observe a moment of silence in  memory of the victims and survivors of the Tulsa Race Massacre, and  their descendants to carry the terrible memories of that horrific day  and still grieve over the loss of so many loved ones and of faith in  the American system of justice.    Madam Speaker, I was unavoidably detained in my  congressional district due to COVID responsibilities, and I was not  present for rollcall vote 144.   I ask the Record to reflect that had I been present, I would have  voted ``aye'' on rollcall 144, the motion to suspend the rules and pass  H.R. 2911, VA Transparency and Trust Act of 2021.                            ____________________
