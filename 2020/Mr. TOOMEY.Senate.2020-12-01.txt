 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise this afternoon because while we  were away for our Thanksgiving break, there were some very important  developments on an important piece of legislation that we passed  earlier this year, the CARES Act. Specifically, what I am referring to  is the decision that was made by the Treasury Secretary, Secretary  Mnuchin, to not extend the 13(3) lending facilities that we  dramatically expanded in the CARES Act.   By way of reminder, let me summarize these facilities. When the  economy first began to close down back in March-April, one of the  things that started to happen was a collapse of our credit markets. I  will get into that in a little bit.  [[Page S7125]]    In response to that, we in Congress passed the CARES Act, which,  among other things, appropriated just under half a trillion dollars-- $500 billion--for the Treasury to use to capitalize special purpose  vehicles, which would be set up as entities from which the Federal  Reserve would lend money, buy securities, and provide liquidity to the  marketplace. Those facilities were scheduled to end by the end of the  year.   In keeping with the written statute and certainly the intent of  Congress, Secretary Mnuchin announced that these programs will, in  fact, end as they are supposed to. I commend him for making the right  decision, and I commend Chairman Powell for agreeing to a subsequent  request from the Treasury Secretary to return the unused money.   As it happened, the program, the concept, worked so well that the  mere announcement and the mere creation of the capability on the part  of the Fed to provide this liquidity was enough to restore functioning  capital markets.   It was an extraordinary amount of trust that we put in both Treasury  Secretary Mnuchin and Chairman Powell, giving them extremely powerful,  unprecedented emergency and temporary tools. I commend them both for  working together with those tools, for achieving the intended purpose,  and for putting them away once the purpose had been achieved.   Some of our Democratic colleagues have been extremely critical of  this decision on the part of Secretary Mnuchin not to extend these  programs. I want to address some of the arguments and why Secretary  Mnuchin, in fact, did exactly the right thing.   Let's go back and take a hard look at what we were facing in March of  2020. Unprecedented turmoil in the credit markets were threatening the  ability of virtually every business, State, and municipality in America  to obtain credit--a real threat to the financial plumbing, so to speak,  of our entire economy. Credit markets were on the verge of shutting  down. There was a mass flight of investors out of any kind of financial  instrument and into cash. People were trying to sell everything they  had. Prices were dropping in a free fall. In many instances, there was  no buyer; there was no price at which one could sell an investment Of  course, that meant that a borrower couldn't sell a bond or couldn't  issue a commercial paper. This was the freeze-up in our financial  markets that we were right on the verge of, and we were very  desperately afraid that, if this happened--if our financial markets  came to a grinding halt and you could neither borrow nor lend either in  the capital markets or in the private lending markets of banks--then  that would almost assuredly accelerate the downward spiral of our  economy and could even lead to a severe depression that could last,  potentially, a very long time.    You don't have to take my word for it. A very well-stated summary of  what was happening comes from Kent Hiteshew, who was the Deputy  Assistant Director for Financial Stability at the Federal Reserve. He  was a senior executive at the Federal Reserve, who, in his testimony  before the congressional oversight committee, had this to say:         The conditions that prevailed during March were       unprecedented--far worse than during the onset of the       financial crisis in late 2008 or even in the days after 9/11,       when the municipal market was briefly closed. Interest rates       soared . . . mutual fund investors pulled over $41 billion of       assets out of the market in less than three weeks, and market       functioning deteriorated to the point that buyers and sellers       had difficulty determining prices. Ultimately, this meant       that state and local governments were effectively unable to       borrow, with most new issues canceled for lack of investor       demand.    That was the problem that Congress was seeking to address--a complete  freezing up of our capital markets, the inability to borrow or lend.  That is the lifeblood of business, which is the source of employment in  this country. If we had not done anything at that moment, who knows how  many more millions of Americans would have lost their jobs or how many  more millions of businesses would have gone under. The economic  devastation would have been very, very hard to imagine had we not done  anything. Fortunately, we did do something.   Congress decided that this problem could be fixed by providing enough  liquidity until the crisis had passed. We would make sure that  operations of this liquidity exercise would extend no later than  through the end of 2020, and that is what we did in the CARES Act. Just  last week, every Republican member of the Senate Committee on Banking,  Housing, and Urban Affairs sent a letter to Secretary Mnuchin and  Secretary Powell that reaffirmed that this was Congress's intent--a  short-term, temporary facility to restore functioning private markets.   I am pleased to report that these emergency facilities absolutely  achieved the intended purpose--again, the purpose to stabilize our  credit markets, restore the normal flow of credit to borrowers, and  allow private capital to continue to resume funding our economy. It  worked even better than we had hoped. Markets didn't just improve, and  we didn't just see liquidity return; we saw record volumes of new debt  issuance, new investor interest, municipal bonds, investment grade  corporate bonds, high-yield corporate bonds--volumes that were off the  chart in response to these facilities. The credit spreads at which  these instruments were issued were very tight, and interest rates were  near a record low.   On the banking side, regional banks reported that their commercial  borrowers drew down lines of credit so that they had the cash they  would need to get through a very difficult period. In fact, many of  them have been able to start paying that cash back. According to  various surveys of businesses across America, unmet demand for credit  among creditworthy borrowers is almost nonexistent. In other words, as  to the creditworthy corporate borrowers--businesses large and small in  America--if their credit is strong, they are able to access the  facilities they need, the credit they need. That is exactly what we had  hoped would happen by virtue of setting up these facilities.   Despite that, some have said that we can't end these facilities that  are called the 13(3) facilities because that is a section of existing  law under which the Fed is authorized to conduct these activities.  People have suggested: Well, you can't end these because the markets  depend on them for their normal, smooth functioning. The markets now  depend on these facilities. That was what we were told as a reason the  Treasury had to extend these, presumably indefinitely, but, in fact,  what we saw proved that the naysayers were completely wrong.   In fact, it was on November 19 that Treasury Secretary Mnuchin  announced that he would not be extending these programs. How did these  financial markets respond? With a yawn. There were no adverse  developments whatsoever. They continued their smooth, liquid  functioning because, by November 19--in fact, many months prior to  November 19--the markets had recovered on their own. They were  functioning on their own. They were no longer in need of this fallback  facility that we had created. Yet we did need it back in March. Equity  markets have hit all-time record highs. Municipal debt and corporate  debt volume is very high, and yields are low. The market is functioning  very, very smoothly. Clearly, those of us who were advocating for  actually following the law and ending these programs were right in that  the markets were not actually depending on them anymore.   Other people have said: You shouldn't end the 13(3) facilities for  other reasons, one of which was, Who knows what risks may be out there  or what bad things might be on the horizon for our economy that would  cause us to want to have these facilities? That is a very bad reason  for giving indefinite lending authority to the Fed to make direct loans  to businesses in America.   First of all, there has never been a day in the history of the  Republic that you couldn't imagine some bad thing that could possibly  happen on the horizon. That is no reason to create a taxpayer-sponsored  backstop for all financial activity--none whatsoever. Sure, a bad thing  could happen. Nobody knows. If it does, there is an answer. If such a  disaster were to occur in the future and our financial markets were in  danger once again of freezing up, then the Fed and Treasury should come  back to Congress and ask for whatever authority they think is  appropriate for those circumstances. Based on what we did in  [[Page S7126]]  March, Congress is quite likely to respond by granting the tools  necessary to deal with whatever hypothetical crisis may emerge down the  road.   Others of our friends say: You can't get rid of these facilities, and  you can't terminate these facilities because there are industries that  are failing in America. Let me be clear. It is true that there are  industries that are in a world of hurt. We know what they are. The  travel industry--much of the tourism and hospitality, which is  generally the hotels and restaurants--and a lot of the entertainment  venues have been devastated like we have never seen them before. That  is a true fact   I think you can make a strong argument that Congress ought to do  something to respond to the circumstances that these folks find  themselves in through no fault of their own, but they are in the  situation they are in because, in many cases, their Governors closed  their States. In other cases, it is because people are just prudently  concerned about being in a crowded setting. So there is a problem  there--there is a challenge--and we may very well decide we want to  address it. Yet having the Federal Reserve lending money to  fundamentally insolvent companies is not the role of these facilities.  It never was. It is not contemplated in the underlying 13(3) statute,  and it is not in the CARES Act. That is not what this program, what  these facilities were meant to address.   Let's be clear about what the advocates for continuing these 13(3)  facilities are really all about. What is going on here with regard to  these programs--this massive, massive amount of money that is at the  discretion of the Fed and the Treasury to lend--is they want to use  political pressure on the Fed and the Treasury to lend these facilities  to favored political constituencies at terms they find appealing or  attractive depending on their circumstances. This is exactly the  opposite of what a central bank should be doing--capitulating to  political pressure to lend to preferred constituents at whatever terms  the politics dictate. That could not be anything further from the role  the central bank ought to be playing.   To my colleagues who are advocating that we do exactly that with  these 13(3) facilities, I couldn't disagree more. If we want to be in  the business of picking industries or sectors and subsidizing them or  giving them money or treating them in some unusual way, we can have  that discussion, but that is fiscal policy. That is a decision that,  ultimately, needs to be made by the politically accountable branches of  government--the Congress and the President--not by the central bank,  which is supposed to be independent and apolitical.   The fact is that I think we deserve congratulations. Even more so, I  think the Treasury Secretary and the Chairman of the Fed deserve  congratulations for setting up the facilities that have made it  possible for our economy to begin a record recovery from a very, very  deep trough that we hit in the late spring of last year.   We all know that we are not at the end goal in that we are not back  to full employment yet. We have, as I said before, many companies that  are in deep trouble and many that have gone out of business altogether.  We have a lot of problems, and we need to deal with them, but we do  know this recovery has been occurring at a faster pace than anyone  projected. Most economists, including at the Fed, thought that we would  be lucky if the unemployment rate dipped below 10 percent by the end of  this year, but it was at 6.9 percent at the end of October. We have a  long way to go before we get back to the barely above 3 percent  unemployment rate that we were enjoying before this pandemic hit, and  by all means, we need to stay at it until we get there, but we won't do  that by turning the Fed into the allocator of credit based on political  demands. That would be a very, very bad idea. It would lead to worse  economic outcomes and all kinds of distortions, and it would erode the  independence of the Fed.   As I say, I congratulate and commend the Treasury Secretary for  making the right decision and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve for  returning the unspent money. These programs have been remarkably  successful. They have served their purpose. Their purpose is now behind  us, and we need to continue the policies that will allow us to have the  economic recovery we need without these programs continuing.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Brett Doyle,  a member of my staff and the Congressional Oversight Commission, be  granted floor privileges for the remainder of the Congress.
