 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, America's example and the threats posed  by Russia and China are leading major allies and partners in Europe and  Asia to step up their commitments to collective security and  dramatically increase investments in their own defense.   It is worth pointing out once again that the United States is not--I  repeat ``not''--shouldering the burden for European free riders. In  fact, when it comes to security assistance to Ukraine as a share of  GDP, 14 of our European allies are actually giving more.   Lithuania--a small nation by any measure--has sent tens of thousands  of rifles, handguns, and grenade launchers and millions of rounds of  ammunition. Denmark and Estonia have sent their entire inventory of  certain critical artillery. Larger allies, like the United Kingdom and  France, are making remarkable contributions themselves, including  longer range systems than the United States has provided. Even Germany,  despite slow and sometimes agonizing decision making, has provided  historic support to Ukraine and is the continent's largest provider of  security assistance to Ukraine. Europe has more than doubled American  economic and humanitarian assistance, not to  [[Page S4503]]  mention the massive cost of hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees.   But, like America, our allies are not in the business of  philanthropy. As far away as Tokyo and Seoul, leaders are making a  sober calculation about their interests. Our friends are making  historic new investments in growing their arsenals and modernizing  their militaries.   More than half of our NATO allies are now on track to hit the  alliance's 2 percent spending target by the end of next year. Sweden,  not yet a full-fledged NATO member, is increasing its defense spending  next year by nearly 30 percent to invest in modern capabilities and  meet its 2 percent of the GDP target. Lithuania, which spent less than  1 percent of its GDP on defense back in 2014, is set to spend over 2.5  percent next year.   To bolster their security, many of our allies are buying American.  Since Russia's escalation began last February, our allies and partners  across the globe have purchased over $120 billion in advanced,  American-made weapons systems.   Germany, Switzerland, Finland, and the Czech Republic have all moved  quickly to sign contracts to purchase F-35s. Indonesia has signed up  for nearly $14 billion in F-15 fighter aircraft made in St. Louis, MO.  Bulgaria--an economy roughly the size of the State of Maine--has spent  $1.5 billion on Stryker combat vehicles that are produced in Lima, OH,  and Anniston, AL. Poland has ordered $12 billion worth of Apache  helicopters produced in Mesa, AZ, and is planning to buy 486 HIMARS  launchers. They will have the biggest HIMARS inventory in the world.   Here is the most important part: When our friends and allies ``Buy  American,'' they are buying into a closer security relationship with  the United States. They are building more interoperable militaries to  strengthen deterrence. They are also lowering costs for the American  taxpayer as we rebuild our own capabilities. They are sharing the  burden of collective defense.   These investments are not a coincidence; they are a demonstration of  the confidence our allies have in American leadership. But make no  mistake, that confidence is perishable. As we saw with the disastrous  retreat from Afghanistan, America can lose trust far more quickly than  we can earn it.   If we pull the plug on our commitment to stand with Europe, our  largest trading partner, I can guarantee it will shred our credibility  as a security partner worldwide. It will make it harder to convince our  allies to stand together against Chinese aggression--the single biggest  threat to our own security and prosperity.                            Tribute to Mike Duncan    Mr. President, today, I join folks in my home State in thanking Mike  Duncan for his decades-long service to the Kentucky Republican Party as  he steps down as our national committeeman.   In Washington, it is rare to find an individual equally skilled at  navigating the worlds of business and politics, but my good friend Mike  is just that rare hybrid. Despite his success in standing up a chain of  community banks, Mike chose to commit his considerable talents to  public service. He would serve terms as Governor of the U.S. Postal  Service, chairman of the Republican National Committee, and chairman of  the Tennessee Valley Authority, on top of a number of impressive  positions under five Republican Presidents. In my home State, Mike has  served as a national committeeman for the Kentucky GOP since 1992,  advising the Republican leaders at the local, State, and national  levels his entire career.    Early on, Mike had a gift for giving that he shared generously with  the people of my home State. When Mike and his wife Joanne first moved  to East Kentucky, they committed to spending at least 1 day a week  doing something to benefit their community.   Since then, Mike has devoted decades to student mentorship, training  young people in Appalachia, and sponsoring their continued education.  His lifetime of civic service has been recognized by a number of  prestigious organizations.   Somehow, between raising a family and serving his country, Mike found  time to develop a close circle of friends, which I am grateful to be a  part of. Mike has been a trusted source of counsel, and I am thankful  to always have him in my corner.   So as Mike steps away from his national role, I am grateful he will  continue to be a leader in our State party and in his own community.   Thank you, Mike. Thank you for your decades of friendship and your  service to our country. Elaine and I wish you and Joanne all the best.
