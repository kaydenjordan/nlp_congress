 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, Ross No. 70.    Mr. Chairman, the bill we are considering today does not  protect U.S. consumers, and, instead, it is a giveaway to Big Oil. The  fossil fuel industry already controls large swaths of our public lands  and our waters. Offshore, the industry already has over 2,000 active  leases covering 12 million acres of Federal waters--75 percent of which  are not even being used to produce oil and gas.   North Carolinians cherish our pristine coastline and rely upon a  clean and healthy marine ecosystem to support robust tourism,  recreation, and fishing which are vital to our economy. They are the  economic lifelines of many of our coastal communities.                                time  1945    Elected officials of both parties in North Carolina, up and down the  Atlantic Coast as well, ranging from county commissioners to Governors,  have expressed staunch opposition to opening our waters to offshore  drilling.   Putting our coastal economy and environment at risk is the last thing  that North Carolinians need, and our neighbors to the north and south  agree. Congresswoman Mace, my neighbor to the south, made this same  point today.   My amendment would take the simple step of preventing the plan  required by this bill from including oil and gas leasing in the mid- Atlantic, including my home State of North Carolina. This protects our  constituents, our economy, and our environment.   I hope that my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, just like  people from both sides of the aisle in my State, will listen to their  constituents and support this commonsense amendment rather than putting  both our environment and our economy at risk.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
