 Mr. President, a new report released last night from  the Department of Health and Human Services reveals startling new  numbers showing just how substantial premium increases have been under  ObamaCare. According to that report, average annual ObamaCare premiums  have increased by nearly $3,000 since 2013, the year that most of the  healthcare law's mandates and regulations actually went into effect. In  other words, it is now clear that average ObamaCare plans on the  exchanges more than doubled from 2013 until now. That is an increase of  105 percent, or nearly $3,000. These figures are based on the Obama  administration's own data, but these exorbitant costs are just one part  of the problem, to say nothing of the shrinking choices of insurers  offering plans on the ObamaCare exchanges across the country.   Last week, our colleague from Iowa, Chairman Grassley, came to the  floor and shared with us the story of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, a  bridge in Washington State that was, as he put it, ``set to fail from  the very beginning.'' He told us how the bridge was built on a ``flawed  design,'' how it ``self-destructed,'' and how it eventually  ``collapsed.'' Much like that bridge, he said, ObamaCare is becoming  ``its own bridge to nowhere with no insurance plan on its exchanges.''  Boy, he is right about that.   As time goes on, more Americans are finding themselves with fewer  ObamaCare insurance options to choose from on the exchanges. Take a  look at the map behind me, and you will see what I mean. On this map:  Fewer choices: Number of insurers on the ObamaCare exchanges in 2017.  What does it reflect?   In more than 1,000 counties across 26 States, families have only 1-- just 1--ObamaCare option to choose from in the marketplace. ObamaCare  customers in five States have only one insurer left on the exchanges.  As a recent article predicted, ``insurer choice in the ACA marketplace  could hit an all-time low'' next year in 2018.   Let that sink in for a minute. Families across the country could  experience ``an all-time low'' when it comes to their choices for  ObamaCare plans next year. In other words, things are likely to only  get worse. Still, despite all the news reports and the studies and the  personal stories shared by constituents, some of our colleagues simply  refuse to face the realities of this failed law.   Consider what we saw just yesterday, when a group of Democratic  Senators held a press conference, essentially advocating for the  ObamaCare status quo in rural America. But in case our friends missed  it, I want to share a recent headline that reveals what ObamaCare's  status quo has actually meant for families in these regions of the  country. Here is what it read: ``Rural Shoppers Face Slim Choices,  Steep Premiums On Exchanges.''   The article went on to cite a study showing that ObamaCare customers  living in less populous areas of the country in 2017 ``frequently had  just  [[Page S3104]]  one or two insurers from which to pick, and often faced significantly  higher premiums than did people in more urban areas.''   Much like that dilapidated bridge Chairman Grassley described,  ObamaCare is self-destructing all around us. We know things are likely  to get worse unless we move beyond the failures of ObamaCare. In his  home State of Iowa, more than 70,000 people are facing the harsh  reality that they may be left with absolutely no options--none--on the  ObamaCare individual market--zero.   Many Virginians recently learned they could also have fewer choices  on the ObamaCare exchanges next year. In fact, people in 27 of the  State's 95 counties could have just one option for coverage through the  ObamaCare marketplace in 2018. Tennesseans in 16 counties are in a  similarly distressing situation, as they, too, are likely to have just  one choice when it comes to signing up for insurance through the  ObamaCare exchanges next year.   So these are just the latest developments in ObamaCare's dwindling  options, which over the years have continuously pushed too many people  off their plan and left them with fewer choices. Take one Knoxville,  TN, woman who recounted her experience in a recent news article. In  2015, she signed up for an ObamaCare plan with one major insurer, but  by the end of the year, that company pulled out of the marketplace,  leaving her to find a new plan. In 2016, she was forced to sign up for  an ObamaCare plan with another insurer. Again, at the end of the year,  that company left the marketplace, as well. Now in 2017, she signed up  with yet another ObamaCare plan with yet another insurer, and--you  guessed it--at the end of this year, that insurance company will also  exit the ObamaCare marketplace, leaving the Tennessee mom to find an  alternative option one more time. Unfortunately, her story is not  unique. As insurers on the exchanges continue to propose premium  increases and announce their intentions for participation next year, we  can expect even more troubling news to roll in.   These families deserve relief from ObamaCare--a failing law with  limited, even nonexistent, choices that continue to shrink on the  collapsing marketplace.   These families deserve relief from ObamaCare--a failing law with  skyrocketing premiums that have risen by double-digit rate increases  all across our country.   These families deserve relief from ObamaCare--a failing law with  mandates that require people to buy plans that aren't right for their  families, even if there are no suitable choices to pick from, even if  they are too expensive to actually use.   How much more will it take for our Democratic colleagues to realize  that we have to move beyond the failures of ObamaCare? The only way  these families are going to get the help they need--and that so many  have called for--is if we actually take action. The Republican Senate  has been clear what we aren't OK with standing by and allowing this  system to crash completely, dragging down even more families along with  it.   We know that--just like that collapsing bridge--ObamaCare wasn't  built on a sturdy foundation, nor were its policies truly built to  last. Just like the bridge, it may have looked really good from the  outside. We all remember the lofty claims our Democratic colleagues  made about the law, but it never lived up to the fanfare. I know it is  a disappointing reality for our friends across the aisle who championed  the failed healthcare law. We know it is not the outcome they had hoped  for, but the status quo is simply unacceptable.   We expect the Congressional Budget Office to release an updated score  of the bill the House passed later today. It is a technical procedural  step. Beyond likely reiterating things we already know--like that fewer  people will buy a product they don't want when the government stops  forcing them to--the updated report will allow the Senate procedurally  to move forward in working to draft its own healthcare legislation.   So whatever CBO says about the House bill today, this much is  absolutely clear: The status quo under ObamaCare is completely  unacceptable and totally unsustainable. The prices are skyrocketing.  Choice is plummeting. The marketplace is collapsing, and countless more  Americans will get hurt if we don't act. No one should be comfortable  with that. I know I am not, and I certainly hope our Democratic  colleagues aren't either.   So instead of continuing to hold press conferences in what ultimately  can only be described as a defense of the ObamaCare status quo, I would  ask our Democratic colleagues to come to terms with the situation  Americans are facing, to stop the empty rhetoric, to join us in finally  helping those who have been hurt by this failing law.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, as the Senate  continues to process nominations, I would like to take a moment to say  a few words about one for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth  Circuit whom we will confirm this week.   Judge Amul Thapar served with distinction on the U.S. District Court  for the Eastern District of Kentucky for close to a decade, having  previously served as U.S. attorney for that same district and as  assistant U.S. attorney for several years before that.   He was the first South Asian American to become a Federal judge, and  once he is confirmed to the Sixth Circuit, Judge Thapar will be only  the second South Asian American to serve on a Federal circuit court.   The American Bar Association has given him its highest rating-- unanimously ``well qualified.'' That meant that in the group that rated  him there was no one who didn't give him a ``well qualified'' rating,  which is the best they could give any nominee. I certainly couldn't  agree more with that characterization.   Judge Thapar is an excellent jurist. I know he will make a great  addition to the Sixth Circuit, and I am proud to support his  nomination. I would encourage all Members of the Senate to support him  as we advance his nomination today.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all  postcloture time on the Sullivan nomination expire at 3 p.m. today and  that, if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the  distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a  resolution authorizing the production of testimony and  [[Page S3149]]  documents, and representation by the Senate Legal Counsel, and ask for  its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for  testimony and documents in a criminal action pending in North Dakota  federal district court. In this action, the defendant is charged with  sending to Senator Heitkamp an e-mail threatening to kill or injure  her. A trial is scheduled for June 6, 2017.   The prosecution is seeking for introduction into evidence at trial  documentary evidence from the Senator's office, including the e-mail at  issue, as well as testimony from the Senator's correspondence manager.  Senator Heitkamp would like to cooperate by providing such relevant  evidence. The enclosed resolution would authorize that staffer, and any  other current or former employee of the Senator's office from whom  relevant evidence may be necessary, to testify and produce documents in  this action, with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel.                                S. Res. 178         Whereas, in the case of United States v. Kevin Lee Olson,       Cr. No. 17-26, pending in the United States District Court       for the District of North Dakota, the prosecution has       requested the production of testimony and documents from       Kobye Noel, an employee in the Washington, D.C. office of       Senator Heidi Heitkamp;        Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the       Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a)       and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may direct its counsel to       represent current or former employees of the Senate with       respect to any subpoena, order, or request for testimony       relating to their official responsibilities;        Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United       States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no       evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate       may, by the judicial or administrative process, be taken from       such control or possession but by permission of the Senate;       and        Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or       in the possession of the Senate may promote the       administration of justice, the Senate will take such action       as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the       privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That Kobye Noel, an employee in the Office of       Senator Heidi Heitkamp, and any other current or former       employee of the Senator's office from whom relevant evidence       may be necessary, are authorized to testify and produce       documents in the case of United States v. Kevin Lee Olson,       except concerning matters for which a privilege should be       asserted.        Sec. 2.  The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to       represent current and former employees of Senator Heitkamp's       office in connection with the production of evidence       authorized in section one of this resolution.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the vote on confirmation  of Judge Thapar occur at 1:30 p.m. on Thursday, May 25; that if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 177, submitted  earlier today.    Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that  the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 178, submitted  earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to and the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10:30 a.m.,  Thursday, May 25; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that following  leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Thapar nomination; finally, that all time during  morning business, recess, adjournment, and leader remarks count  postcloture on the Thapar nomination.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senators Manchin,  Sullivan, and Merkley.
