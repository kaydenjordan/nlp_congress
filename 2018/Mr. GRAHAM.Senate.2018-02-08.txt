 Mr. President, please inform me when 10 minutes has  expired.   I rise tonight to let the military know that we may have a short  night in the Senate, but you are going have better days ahead. This  whole exercise, for me, is about you. It is about those who have been  fighting this war for the last 17 years. It is about stopping the  madness created by the Congress in 2011.   What we did in 2011 was we came up with a budget proposal called  sequestration. If we could not find a bipartisan path forward to cut  $1.2 trillion in the Federal budget over a decade, we would punish the  military by taking $600 billion out of the military and $600 billion  out of nondefense spending and leave entitlements alone. Nobody thought  it would happen. There was a penalty clause in the Budget Control Act  to make sure that the supercommittee would act responsibly. Guess what.  They didn't. There is no use blaming them over everybody else. The  bottom line is, we couldn't reach a budget agreement. We spent $47  trillion over the next 10 years, which is how much we will spend. We  couldn't save $1.2 trillion, so sequestration kicked in.   What has it done to our military? This is what General Mattis, the  Secretary of Defense, said:         Let me be clear: As hard as the last 16 years of war have       been on our military, no enemy in the field has done as much       harm to the readiness of U.S. military than the combined       impact of the Budget Control Act's defense spending caps,       worsened by operating for 10 of the last 11 years under       continuing resolutions of varied and unpredictable duration.    This is the Secretary of Defense telling the Congress that no enemy  on the battlefield has done more damage to our military than the budget  agreement that we reached in 2011.   I want to congratulate President Trump for keeping his campaign  promise to rebuild the military.   In case you couldn't understand what I said, here it is in writing.  Spend some time looking at it. This is one of the most respected  warriors of his generation, who is now Secretary of Defense, telling  the Congress to end the madness. Tonight we are going to end the  madness. If we have to lose some sleep, we are going to end the  madness.   We are going to spend $160 billion over the next 2 years rebuilding a  military that has been in decline since 2011. How bad is it? It is  terrible. If you don't believe me, just listen to what our commanders  say. About 60 percent of the F-18s in the Navy aren't able to fly. We  have lost more people in training accidents than we have lost on the  battlefield. If you ask every military commander, they will tell you  that sequestration has done a lot of damage when it comes to our  military readiness. This $160 billion infusion of cash is much needed.   When you talk about deficits, here is what I can tell you. We are  spending, GDP-wise, at the lowest level on defense really since World  War II, when you look at GDP spending on defense. It has been above 4,  close to 5 percent of GDP; we are in the 3.5-percent range. When I hear  Senator Paul say we have doubled the defense budget, compared to GDP  spending on defense, we are at the low end.   What has happened since 2011? This is the way the world has turned  out since we passed sequestration through the Budget Control Act. The  Syrian civil war came about, the collapse of Libya, the rise of ISIL,  the invasion of the Ukraine, and the annexation of Crimea by Russia.  China is building islands over land claimed by others. Yemen is falling  apart. North Korea is pressing toward the capability to hit the  homeland with a nuclear-tip missile. We have had cyber attacks come  from North Korea.  [[Page S826]]    The bottom line is, since 2011, all hell has broken loose, and we  have been standing around here looking at each other instead of  listening to our commanders. President Trump has listened. President  Trump is behind this budget agreement--2 years of funding to rebuild  the military at a time they need every dollar they can get.   As to the deficits, yes, they bother me, but here is what I can tell  the public without any hesitation: You can eliminate the Department of  Defense, and you are not going to change the debt situation long term  for the country. Two-thirds of the debt is driven by mandatory spending  in interest on the debt itself. Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security  are entitlement programs that are growing in a tremendous fashion  because the baby boomers are retiring en masse. We have fewer workers,  and all these trust funds are failing. That is what drives the debt,  not military spending. One-third of the Federal budget is discretionary  spending. Out of that one-third comes the military, and it is about 50  percent of the one-third.   All I can say is that I want to applaud Senator McConnell and Senator  Schumer for reaching an agreement. The nondefense spending is about  $160-something billion. What does that mean? That helps the FBI.  Without this infusion of cash, the FBI will have fewer agents in 2018  than they did in 2013. They are on the frontline of defending the  Nation as much as anybody else. The Department of Homeland Security,  the CIA, the National Security Administration--all of these nondefense  agencies have a defense role, and they will benefit from this budget  agreement.   Sequestration did not get us out of debt. Fixing sequestration is not  going to add to the debt in any serious way.   Every Republican voted for the tax cuts because we believe the $1.5  trillion and then some will be made up by economic growth. I think we  are more right than wrong about that.   When it comes to defense spending, Republicans and Democrats have  finally listened to this statement by General Mattis, and all of us  came together behind our President to increase defense spending in a  fashion relevant to the need.   To those who believe that the military is well-funded, you are not  listening to anybody in the military. You haven't spent any time in the  field. I have been to Iraq and Afghanistan 42 times in the last decade.  I can tell you the pressure that has been placed upon our military. You  have to put all of the money in deploying people--robbing Peter to pay  Paul--so training suffers and readiness suffers.   It has been a miserable experience to be in the military the last 4,  5 years. Families go lacking. People are deployed more than they should  be because we are not big enough. This $160 billion is going to allow  us to grow the Navy. We are moving toward a 350-ship Navy, not 278. We  have the smallest Navy since 1915, the smallest Army since 1940--that  is where we are headed under sequestration. This turns it around.   President Trump, thank you for keeping your promise to rebuild our  military.   To Senator Schumer and Senator McConnell, thank you for working  together in getting us on track to rebuild the military and help some  accounts that need help outside the military.   To the Members of the body, there are a million reasons to vote no on  any bill. While I respect how you vote, I don't know how you go to the  military and explain your vote if you vote no. How do you tell those in  uniform, who are getting by under incredibly difficult conditions  because they don't have the money to train and be ready--they are in a  hot war. What do you tell them--well, I voted no because this and that?   The deficit and debt are a problem. Senator Paul, to his great  credit, is willing to reform entitlements. I have worked with him and  Senator Lee to reform Medicare and do something about Social Security  to keep these programs from going broke. I will compliment Senator  Paul. He is a man of great political courage when it comes to taking on  hard issues like entitlement reform. But when it comes to military, I  could not be more different. He is holding us up. He has every right to  do so.   I just want to let our soldiers know, and all their families, that we  are going to wait him out and that you are not the reason we are in  debt. The money we are giving you, you take gladly. There will be a  smaller pay raise in here. But Senator Paul's solution to raising pay  for the military is to withdraw from Afghanistan.   I have not heard one general tell me we can leave Afghanistan safely.  That day will come, but we are nowhere near that day. All I can tell  the public is, the last time we took our eye off Afghanistan, we got 9/ 11. I don't know how much money we spent after 9/11, but we lost almost  3,000 Americans. Based on 19 people who were willing to kill  themselves, they took almost 3,000 of us with them. Just think what  would have happened if we had left too soon. We are not going to do  that again--never again.   I trust those in our military leadership. I am proud of my Commander  in Chief, President Trump, for giving them the ability to fight the  war. The gloves are now off. They just need the resources to take the  fight to the enemy and turn it around because what happens over there  matters here. If you don't believe me, remember 9/11.   Whatever it takes and as long as it takes, we are going to increase  defense spending in the next 24 hours. Then we are going to start  marching to fix other problems. The Dreamers have waited a very long  time to bring certainty to their lives. Next week, we will take up  their problems, their plight. The one thing I can tell you today is, in  the next 24 hours, we are going to end the nightmare for the military.  Next week, we will take up solutions to help the Dream Act population  and secure our borders. We can do two things at once.   If you want to get the country out of debt, count me in. If you want  to tell younger people they have to work longer and cannot retire at 65  because we live so much longer, count me in. If you want people at my  income level to take less from Social Security because I can afford to  give some up, count me in. If you want people in my income level to pay  more into Medicare because we should, count me in.   The one thing for which you cannot count on me is to use the military  as a punching bag and blame it on them that we are in debt. We are not  in debt because of them. What General Mattis said is we can always  afford freedom, and we can afford survival.   If you don't believe the people we are fighting would kill us all if  they could, then you have a short memory. The only reason 3,000 died on  9/11 and not 3 million is they couldn't get the weapons with which to  kill more of us. If North Korea keeps going the way it is going, God  help us all. If the Iranians ever go nuclear, God help us all. We live  in dangerous times.   If radical Islam could get its hands on a chemical or a biological  weapon, it would use it. The best way to keep them from hurting us here  is to stay over there and partner with our Afghan partners, our Iraqi  partners, and others. More Muslims have died in this fight than anybody  else. They have seen the face of the enemy, and I have certainly seen  it. The best way to keep it off our shores is to have a strong military  that creates lines of defenses over there so we can be safe here.   I am very happy tonight. I had to miss my flight, and I am not going  to get much sleep, but what we are doing pales in comparison to what  the military has done for the last 5 or 6 years--a lot with less. They  have taken on too much danger and too much risk because the Congress  has sat on the sidelines and watched Rome burn. Those days are over.   Whenever we vote, we are going to vote. I will make a prediction that  we are going to get more than 60 votes to fund the military. When it  gets to the House, to my fiscal conservative friends, I understand  there are things in the nondefense spending aspect of this they will  not like--I get that--but there are Democrats in this body, and there  are Democrats in the House, and they have a say. That is just the way  it is.   So I will sleep well tonight. I may not sleep long, but I will sleep  well in knowing that the men and women in uniform, who have suffered so  much for so long, will be better off in the morning. A short night for  me will mean better days ahead for them.  [[Page S827]]    All I can say to my colleagues is not to let these groups mislead  them about what their job is. Their job as Members of the U.S.  Congress, in my opinion, is to defend this Nation above all else.  Without national security, Social Security really doesn't matter.  Without national security, everything we enjoy could be lost.   The primary role of the Federal Government, in my view, is to give  the men and women in uniform, who are all volunteers, what they need to  keep us safe. Come tomorrow, they are going to have more. If it means  we stay up late tonight, so be it.   To the congressional leadership, thank you. To the President, thank  you for being a Commander in Chief we have desperately needed for the  last 8-plus years. To my colleagues, vote yes. You may get some  criticism from people who run blogs, but the next time you see a  soldier, you will know you voted right.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.    Thank you, Mr. President.   I will be making a unanimous consent request in just a second. The  reason I am doing this is that every hour we go without funding the  military, every day that we wait, and the longer we continue this  madness, the worse it is for those who fight in a war we can't afford  to lose.   I think that Congress, in the words of General Mattis, has done more  damage to the military than any enemy on the battlefield. So tonight I  am speaking for you. We are going to end this madness as soon as we  possibly can.   I respect Senator Paul, who is a fiscal conservative--every bit of  it--but when it comes to national security, not so much. He wants to do  entitlement reform. God bless him. That is where the money is at.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule  XXII, at 8 p.m. today, the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture  on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment  to H.R. 1892 with a further amendment; further, that if cloture is  invoked, all postcloture time be yielded back and the Senate vote on  the motion to concur.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   The Senator from Kentucky.    I know what is in it--$160 billion over the next 2 years  that is absolutely necessary to rebuild a military that is in decline.  If you don't believe me, ask the Secretary of Defense.   There are other things in this bill, some of which I like and some of  which I don't. I know this: If the President of the United States, who  is our Commander in Chief, says he will sign it if we will send it to  him, and the reason that we are not going to send it to him right now  is because Senator Paul has every right to object, this is a debate  worth having.   What is the most important thing for our country?   The deficit and debt are real, and, to his credit, Senator Paul is  willing to do the hard things, such as to change the age of retirement  and to means test those benefits. That is how you get out of debt.   What we are doing tonight is putting money into the pipeline of a  military that has suffered mightily since Senator Paul and others voted  for sequestration in 2011.   Enough is enough. The day of reckoning is upon us. Every hour, every  minute matters to me. So this is what I am trying to tell people back  in South Carolina: If you are worried about the debt and deficit, count  me in. But to go there, you have to do something that very few people  will do, and Senator Paul is not in the category of the very few.   On the debt and deficit, I give him high marks--on national security,  not so much.   He said tonight on television that the best way to give the military  a pay raise is to withdraw from Afghanistan. Go over to Afghanistan  before you say that. Name one military commander that believes that is  a rational approach to increasing military pay. You had better pay them  a lot more because they are going to be fighting for a lot longer if we  leave now.   How much has 9/11 cost us? It is this kind of thinking that led to 9/ 11. The only people I know who like that idea are the Taliban. They  wish we would leave tomorrow.   ISIL is now present in Afghanistan. I wish the world were not so  dangerous, and I wish it wasn't so complicated, but it is. Have we  learned nothing from radical Islam? ``Leave them alone, and they will  leave you alone'' does not work. Their goal is to destroy their faith  and rebuild it in the image of their view of Islam, to destroy our  friends in Israel, and to come after Christians, vegetarians,  Libertarians. They are coming after you, and the only thing between  them and us are the men and women in the military--the 1 percent who  have suffered mightily.   In the words of General Mattis: No enemy has done more damage to our  readiness than budget cuts plus continuing resolutions.   He is a nice man. Let me say it more directly: Congress has shot down  more planes through budget cuts then any enemy could hope to. Congress  has crippled the Navy more than the Chinese or the Russians could have  ever hoped to. Congress has made it harder for people to be with their  families because our military is too small for the times in which we  live.   The times in which we live are the most dangerous since the 1930s. I  will repeat that again. The only reason 3,000 of us died on 9/11 is  that they couldn't find a way to kill more of us. If they could ever  find that way, they will do it. As long as we have some soldiers in  Afghanistan, Afghanistan is not likely to be the platform for the  second 9/11.   If you think this is over the top, talk to the people fighting the  war. Go there yourself. I spent a lot of time in Afghan prisons and  detention centers, looking at the enemy, as a reservist and as a  Senator. I know exactly what they have in mind for us.   Here is my pledge to those who are doing the fighting. We are going  to end this insanity. We are going to rebuild the military.   President Trump, thank you so much. Thank you for understanding that  debt and deficits are no excuse to leave the warfighter hanging out.   What do you tell somebody who doesn't have the equipment they need to  go to the fight? Well, the debt and deficit are the reasons you don't  get any more. If we have to raise taxes--whatever it is--to make sure  that we can keep our military going, I will do it.  [[Page S828]]    I have come to conclude, like Ronald Reagan, that the best way to  help the economy is to cut taxes. Ronald Reagan cut taxes, he rebuilt  the military, and he engaged in entitlement reform. We should follow  his lead. Ronald Reagan did not believe in this isolationist approach.  He believed that on the other side of that wall is an evil empire, and  he stared it down.   I went to the military in 1981. The first thing I got was a 25- percent increase in pay by Ronald Reagan. I liked that guy from that  day until now. The morale was low after the Carter years, and readiness  was in decline. Reagan changed everything.   President Trump, I think you are on course to change everything. We  are taking the gloves off. We are changing the rules of engagement. We  are going to provide the equipment and training that our men and women  desperately need. We are going to set aside these budget cuts.   To Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer, thank you for coming  together. To those who object to some things in this bill, I get it.  But what is more important--the debt or deficit or the war in which we  are in? There is nothing in this bill, if it went away tomorrow, that  would get us out of debt. The debt that we are adding to defend the  Nation can be fixed in 5 minutes if we did some entitlement reform.   When I was 21, my mom died. When I was 22, my dad died. My sister was  13. We moved in with an aunt and uncle who never made more than $25,000  in their life working in the cotton mills. If it wasn't for survivor  benefits and social security going to my sister, we would have had a  hard time making it. If it weren't for Pell grants, she probably  wouldn't have gone to college.   I am 62, and I am not married. I don't have any kids. I make $175,000  a year. I will gladly give up some of my Social Security so people who  need it more than I can have it. I will gladly pay more into Medicare  to keep it from falling apart. I think a lot of people like me would do  that if they were asked. So I don't need any lectures about the debt  and the deficit.   We are in a shooting war. We had more people die in training  accidents than we had in combat because we made them do too much for  too long without enough. That is going to end.   So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule  XXII, at 8 p.m. today, the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture  on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment  to H.R. 1892 with a further amendment; further, that if cloture is  invoked, all postcloture time be yielded back and the Senate vote on  the motion to concur.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   The Senator from Kentucky.    Regular order.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    Regular order.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    Regular order.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    Regular order.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    Regular order.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
