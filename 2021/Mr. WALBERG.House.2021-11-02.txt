 Madam Speaker, with Veterans Day approaching, I am  pleased to join my good friend from Michigan, General Jack Bergman, and  all of my colleagues tonight in paying tribute to those who served.  What we say tonight will be totally inadequate to express what needs to  be expressed, but we must say it anyway.   Veterans Day is a moment to pause and say thank you to the men and  women who chose to defend American's freedoms and the families who  supported them from home. We have an obligation to display our deepest  gratitude and make sure we care for the physical and mental health of  those who served.   In Congress, we have advanced a number of bipartisan initiatives.  Last year, the Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act was signed  into law to help ensure no veteran slips through the cracks. More  support will be available through the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of- Living Adjustment Act, which helps veterans and their families keep up  with ever-increasing inflation.   These laws, and many others like them, are important steps forward,  taken by a grateful Nation. But the work must carry on so that we  continue to keep our promises to those who have heroically served.   That is why this week I will be introducing a bipartisan piece of  legislation, Prisoner of War Priority Care Act, that will assign the  highest priority status for hospital care and medical services provided  through the Department of Veterans Affairs to veterans who are former  prisoners of war.   For the wounds both seen and unseen, we owe an eternal debt of  gratitude to our veterans. We say it with profound sincerity. We can't  make up for the cost, but we can support, as the days go by.   Today, just like every day, we thank you.   God bless our Nation's veterans.
