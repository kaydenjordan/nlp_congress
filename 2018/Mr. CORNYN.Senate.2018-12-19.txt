 The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Montana (Mr. Blunt) and the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr.  Johnson).    Mr. President, today I rise to speak for the last time on  the Senate floor as majority whip. With the swearing in of our  colleagues in January, will come the changing of the guard in our  elected leadership in which I have been proud to serve since 2006.   As we all know, the whip is also known as the assistant majority  leader, and I have been proud to assist our majority leader in all we  have worked on together to accomplish in the Senate. I often tell  people that ``whip'' sounds a lot more coercive than it really is  because in the Senate, you can't really make somebody do something they  don't want to do.   I understand the term comes from the old country. It referred to the  person in fox hunting who was responsible for keeping the dogs from  straying during the chase--something I have never done and, no doubt,  will never do.   One of the fathers of modern conservatism, Edmund Burke, in the  middle of a contentious debate in the British House of Commons, used  the term as far back as 1769. When he used it, he was talking about  enforcing discipline, not as a way to punish disobedience but as a way  to stay focused on your goal. I think that meaning still holds because  the overarching goal of anyone who serves in this position is to keep  the team together.   The first Republican whip was James Wadsworth, elected in 1915. He  served in the Spanish-American War. He opposed Prohibition, and he was  chairman of what was then known as the Committee on Military Affairs.   In more recent times, the whips have been great Senators and friends,  such as Don Nickles, Trent Lott, Jon Kyl, and of course, the current  majority  [[Page S7833]]  leader, Mitch McConnell. All of these men have provided good examples  and sound counsel to me at one time or another.   What we have tried to do together is to build consensus, to make  progress, little by little, for the American people, to seek to inform  and gently persuade. Mainly, you listen, and then, one by one, you  address your colleagues' concerns. Then it is the job of the whip to  count the votes, as the Senate leader passes or defeats legislation,  and provide advice and consent on nominees.   It is the job of the whip operation to keep its finger on the pulse  of the conference, to help the leader find a way to get from point A, a  bill introduced, to point B, getting it to the floor, and then to point  C, when the bill passes and becomes law. That road can be awfully bumpy  at times. Sometimes, it is just like riding a roller coaster.   As with any job, there are parts of the job you love more and those  parts you love less. There has been a lot of handshaking after big  victories, such as the Criminal Justice Reform bill we passed with a  huge bipartisan majority last night, and then there is the headshaking  after disappointments.   It is true that occasionally in this job you come up short, but you  learn from your mistakes, you course correct, and that failure can help  you succeed later on down the road. That is what happened to us in tax  reform. We learned from our disappointing outcome on healthcare and  applied it to our next major objective. With tax reform, we laid the  groundwork by going through the Finance Committee--regular order. We  helped inform. We corrected misinformation, and we responded to  feedback. We incorporated input from all Senators who wanted to be  constructive and get to yes, and the final bill changed a lot along the  way.   Another victory I can think of is the passage of the Comprehensive  Addiction and Recovery Act in 2016, which I think helped lay the  groundwork for what we were able to achieve this Congress with the  passage of landmark opioid legislation.   Of course, there were a historic number of judges we were able to  confirm during the first 2 years of the Trump administration,  culminating in not one, but two outstanding additions to the U.S.  Supreme Court: Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.   But the biggest challenge we faced this last year was the nomination  of now-Justice Kavanaugh--hands down. Never in my experience has there  been a bill or a nomination for which every single vote mattered more,  and never have I seen the dynamics change so rapidly. The trajectory of  the nomination fluctuated day by day, hour by hour, and sometimes it  seemed minute by minute. As new press reports or rumors circulated, the  whip operation worked overtime to make sure our colleagues had the most  up-to-date information and knew what was and what was not accurate. To  refute one rumor or accusation, my whip staff even had to find copies  of 30-year-old high school yearbooks and go to the Library of Congress  to research drinking games. I know it sounds silly, but sometimes truth  is stranger than fiction. The research our whip staff put together made  the difference for some of our colleagues in the homestretch.   Eventually, as we now know, after a lot of hard work and long hours  by an awful lot of people, Judge Kavanaugh was confirmed. But near- death experiences can make life all that much more sweet. So the  difficulties we faced together on the Kavanaugh nomination made his  eventual confirmation all the more satisfying.   Other highlights--the things I will remember the most and am most  proud of--include the landmark bill we passed to combat human  trafficking. The Justice for Victims of Human Trafficking Act--after 4  weeks on the Senate floor, thanks to Leader McConnell and his  perseverance, that bill ultimately passed 99 to 0, and we should be  very proud of that.   Following the horrific shooting at Sutherland Springs, TX, I  introduced legislation to strengthen the gaps in the background check  system for purchasing firearms. Those gaps had allowed a crazed shooter  to cruelly take innocent lives one Sunday morning at a small Baptist  Church outside of San Antonio.   After we came together in a bipartisan way to pass this bill, I  returned to Sutherland Springs. Being with those families, the  community, and Pastor Frank Pomeroy--he and his wife lost their  daughter--and letting them know we not only shared in their grieving  but we had acted together to save lives by preventing future tragedies  was one of the most gratifying moments I have experienced in the  Senate. We couldn't wipe away their tears, but we could show the  families that their loss had not been in vain.   We have done a lot of other things that--while they didn't make the  front-page news--will greatly impact the lives of Texans and all  Americans. We helped America become the energy powerhouse we knew it  could be--creating jobs along the way--by facilitating liquefied  natural gas exports, and we ended the export ban on crude oil all  together. These will have geopolitical consequences that will benefit  the entire planet.   We passed big bills, like the farm bill, and smaller but impactful  bills, like occupational licensing reform, and legislation that  improved trade between Mexico and Canada.   Then came Hurricane Harvey, the most extreme rain event in our  Nation's history. It hit the Texas gulf coast, and then after recovery  was undertaken, we had the monumental task of putting together  significant disaster relief for Texas as part of a larger disaster  relief package that benefited many parts of the Nation.   Our job still isn't over, but by linking arms together, the Texas  delegation, which we call ``Team Texas,'' worked with Governor Abbott  and other State and local leaders to get them what was needed from the  Federal Government so that people could begin to put their lives back  together.   As whip, one of the best parts of my job was getting to know my  colleagues better. I learned to listen to them more carefully. I  learned that each of them has personal goals, political needs, regional  interests, and philosophical principles that influence their decision  making.   We share a lot in common, but each of us is unique in mostly  fascinating but sometimes infuriating ways. Even when you can't  convince someone your position is the right one, you always can learn  from that interaction, and that is valuable information that can be  used on the next tough vote.   I also learned a lot about the Senate as an institution. What makes  this institution so interesting are the men and women who work here. We  have doctors, business men and women, and farmers. Heaven knows, we  have more than enough lawyers. We have spouses, parents, grandparents,  great-grandparents. We come from different political parties and  different parts of the country, but we share a common goal: to do right  for the people we are privileged to represent and to make our country a  little bit better than when we came.   We have very public arguments, but we also get a lot accomplished in  quieter moments--over lunch, in the Senate well, in the cloakroom, or  sometimes in the Senate gym. During those moments, what shines through  is my overwhelming impression of the intelligence, the seriousness of  purpose, and the goodwill of the people who work here. That instills in  me confidence that despite the swirling controversies that seem to  engulf us, the Senate, as an institution, is strong. It is durable and  will continue long after we are gone.   The late great Bob Bullock, who served for many years as our State's  Lieutenant Governor, participating in Texas politics for most or about  half of the 20th century, used to say that there are two types of  politicians: those who want to be someone and those who want to do  something. I will say that in my experience, most people I interact  with here are of the latter persuasion. They want to do something good  for the American people.   I want to express my best wishes to my friend, Senator Thune, the  senior Senator from South Dakota, who is taking over the whip job in  January. I have every confidence in his ability to do the job, but I  also confessed to him it is not all sunshine and lollipops. There will  be long days and tough votes. We have all heard the expression that  being the whip is like trying to keep the bullfrogs in the wheelbarrow;  as soon as you get one in, another one jumps out.  [[Page S7834]]    But I look forward to continuing to help Senator Thune, the next  whip, and the conference and the Senate in any way I can. He has my  telephone number.   Of course, when you are whip--like any job--you rely on your team  members. I couldn't have gotten through these 6 years without a lot of  help. First and foremost, I owe a tremendous amount of gratitude to my  mentor and friend, Leader McConnell. There is no one in the country who  has done more to advance the conservative cause in recent times than  Senator McConnell--no one. Robert Caro called LBJ the Master of the  Senate. I would like to nominate another one: Mitch McConnell.   Under Mitch's leadership in the last 2 years alone, we have bolstered  our Nation's economy, fixed our Tax Code, and achieved real regulatory  reform. We have transformed our Judiciary, improved veterans'  healthcare, and addressed critical public health needs like the opioid  crisis. And that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface.   We have certainly had our fair share of nail-biters--I seem to  remember a certain debt ceiling vote, for example--and those  accomplishments I mentioned were not easy, given the slim margins. But  with Senator McConnell's leadership and more than a few prayers along  the way, we did it together. I am proud of our record, and I am  grateful for his trust and confidence.   Of course, we couldn't have been successful without a strong and  reliable team of deputy whips led by Senator Mike Crapo. I leaned on my  deputy whip team regularly, and time and again, they delivered. So to  Senators Blunt, Capito, Crapo, Fischer, Gardner, Lankford, Portman,  Scott, Tillis, and Young, thank you.   I also want to thank my whip staff, both current and former. This  includes John Chapuis, Sam Beaver, Noah McCullough, Jody Hernandez,  Emily Kirlin, Jonny Slemrod, and my first chief of staff, Russ  Thomasson.   What has been so amazing to me is how seamlessly my whip staff also  worked with my Texas official staff as well. We all worked, literally,  as one team. I thank all of my Texas staff for their contributions to  our successes.   We all rely on our staffs around here a great deal, and that is  doubly true of my entire staff over the last 6 years. I have come to  think of the whip operation as really an intelligence operation. These  outstanding men and women have been my eyes and ears. They are all  incredibly smart. They are devoted and hard-working.   I say to all of them: Thank you for everything you have done to serve  the conference and the Senate as a whole.   As whip, you are provided with a security detail comprised of Capitol  Police officers. These men and women are extraordinary professionals  who have become like family. Their work often takes them away from  their own families and friends as they travel around the country and  sometimes miss holidays and special occasions. They, like all of the  Capitol Police, keep the people who work here and visit here safe. We  all appreciate what they do for us each and every day.   Finally, I want to say a few words about my chief of staff, Monica  Popp, who is the chief of staff of my whip office.   Monica is often the first person and the last person on my staff I  talk to each day. If Beth Jafari, who is my chief of staff in my Texas  office, is the glue that keeps our operation together and operating at  maximum efficiency, Monica is the spark plug of the operation.   As impressive as her knowledge of the Senate is and of how the U.S.  Government functions, that is not what sets her apart. She often, in  her own gentle but determined way, has pressed me to make just one more  call, to meet just one more time with a colleague, or to try just a  little harder to nail down the winning votes. She is exactly the type  of person you need to have in your corner, but it is her sunny  disposition--her optimism--that is infectious. In addition to her  extraordinary competence, that makes her indispensable.   Monica is known for cultivating and maintaining strong relationships  not only in the Senate but in the House and in the executive branch. It  is not just limited to my party; some of her closest colleagues work in  the leadership offices of our Democratic colleagues. The big bipartisan  achievements I mentioned earlier could not have happened without Monica  and her ability to lead a team and work across the aisle. Part of the  reason she is so effective is she wants to know everything. She even  wants to know what Members have for breakfast because she knows how  circumstances and small events can sometimes provide insight in  unexpected ways.   Here is how our staff describes her:   ``She is a problem solver.''   ``When you think you're stuck, she'll find creative ways to get a  solution.''   The most instructive, I think, is this: ``You want to be around her  just to learn.''   I couldn't agree more.   To Monica, I say thank you. We couldn't have done it without you.   Even though I will no longer be serving as the majority whip, I am  not going anywhere. Believe me--serving 28 million Texans here in the  Senate is a big enough job for anyone. To borrow a phrase from a great  American leader, our late President George Herbert Walker Bush--he  said: I am a Texan and an American. What more can a man ask for?   Indeed, it is an honor and a privilege to represent the great people  of Texas, and I believe my time as whip has only taught me to be a  better representative of my fellow Texans. As an elected leader, I have  learned that sometimes you have to do things nobody else wants to do  because they are controversial or they are risky, but I stand ready to  continue to take risks and accept controversy in the pursuit of worthy  causes.   I close simply by saying it has been a privilege to serve as the whip  for Texas, for the Republican conference, and for the Senate.   Often, when I am introduced to audiences here and at home, the  introducers will refer to me as the No. 2 person in the Senate.  Occasionally, they will call me the second most powerful person in the  Senate--obviously an exaggeration. Yet I have never been quite able to  bring myself to correct them in public if only to save them the  embarrassment. Let me just say I will now return to my previous life as  the second most powerful person in my household and to my continued  service to Texas and the world's greatest deliberative body.   I yield the floor.   (Applause, Senators rising.)
