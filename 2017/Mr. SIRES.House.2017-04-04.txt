 Mr. Speaker, as the ranking member of the Western  Hemisphere Subcommittee, I am very concerned about these cuts. This  undermines our leadership around the world and makes Americans less  safe. When you consider that foreign aid is only 1 percent of our  entire budget and helps keep Americans safe, it is an investment in our  security.   Fully funding our State Department and ensuring our diplomats have  the resources they need prevents conflicts, diffuses crises, and works  to keep American soldiers out of harm's way.   U.S. foreign aid helps protect some of the world's poorest people  from disease, starvation, and death. President Trump's own Secretary of  Defense, General James Mattis, said: ``If you don't fund the State  Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition. . . .''   I signed onto a letter led by Ranking Member Engel, along with my  Democratic colleagues on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, urging  the Speaker to oppose these draconian cuts.   We are already hearing from our allies all over the Western  Hemisphere how dangerous these cuts could be to the stability of the  region. Countries like Colombia fought a 52-year-long war with the FARC  guerrillas, and now, when they need us the most to implement the peace  deal, the Trump administration has signaled it is ready to abandon one  of our strongest partners in the world. The President claims to care  about protecting our sovereign border, but this budget says otherwise.   Both Republican and Democrat administrations have pushed for a strong  security, economic, and trade relationship with Mexico. Pushing our  neighbors away could cost billions of dollars to our U.S. businesses.                                time  1830    Instead of working with our partners in the Western Hemisphere,  President Trump is preventing us from maintaining a robust relationship  with our neighbors to pay for this unrealistic and ineffective wall.   In Central America, we risk seeing a repeat of the 2014 crisis when  nearly 70,000 children made the dangerous journeys from Guatemala,  Honduras, and El Salvador after being threatened with violence,  assault, and forced gang recruitment. Our engagement in Central America  is helping to bring calm to the region, and abandoning our friends in  their time of need puts America at risk. Retreating from the world will  allow other countries like China and Russia to take our place as a  global leader.   Instead of building a wall, the President should continue working  with our neighbors to enhance cooperation instead of alienating friends  who have stood by us for decades.    Mr. Speaker, I couldn't agree more. Already we are  starting to see the influence of China in most of the countries in  South America.   You know, I had a conversation with one of the presidents of the  colleges in Colombia on one of my trips. He was telling me how the  influence of China in Colombia is so strong. He was telling me that the  second most studied language in Colombia today is Mandarin. When you  think of that, that is a frightening thought.   You talk about the influence in Nicaragua of the Chinese. They even  think of building a canal, which many people think will never happen.  But to have China so close to our borders is not good for America. To  push away our neighbors is not good for America. We must work with our  neighbors. People don't realize the amount of economic activity between  the United States and the rest of Central America and Mexico.   I read something very funny the other day. Well, it is not funny, but  it is really sad. They were discussing this wall that the President  proposes. Some people say: Where are we going to put it? In the middle  of the river? Or are we going to put it on the American side and give  the river to Mexico? Or are we going to go invade Mexico and put the  wall on the Mexican side and keep the river to ourselves?   So I thought that was telling of the difficulty.    If I might, I couldn't agree with the gentleman more. Just  to bring it even closer to home, we recently met with the attorneys  general from the Northern Triangle. These attorneys general have been  fighting corruption, have been fighting the cartel. We have assisted  them with a small amount of money. These people put their lives every  day in peril fighting the cartel, fighting this corruption.   In our conversation, they said to me: We need America's support to  continue our work. If we stop now, all that we have accomplished until  now is going to go for naught.   When you are talking about a small amount of money, the strong impact  that it has on countries that, for decades, have experienced a great  deal of corruption, and we finally have people that have stepped  forward and want to fight this corruption and put their lives in peril  every single day, I think we should support those people. Cutting and  running away from these people can only hurt us.   This is just one small example of the impact that this 30 percent cut  would have on this region.    Well, before we finish, I just want to compliment Chairman  Royce and Ranking Member Engel on the recent resolution that we worked  on together in encouraging Argentina to continue on the path under new  President Macri. Former President de Kirchner decided that she was  going to be an isolationist.   Argentina is too big. It is a country that could be a player in  assisting us in any crisis that we have in South America. So this  resolution did not cost any money, but it shows our friendship, it  shows our support, and it shows that they are moving in the right  direction.   So my compliments to the gentleman, my compliments to the people that  signed this resolution.
