 Madam Speaker, I am honored to take part in this Special  Order hour tonight in which we honor the Nation's HBCUs and highlight  our support for the FUTURE Act.   My district, Pennsylvania's fifth, is home to the oldest HBCU in the  United States, Cheyney University. Founded in 1837, Cheyney is also a  charter member of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education.  Cheyney is a historical, cultural, and academic beacon in our  community, where it has long provided academic and professional  opportunities for students in Pennsylvania and beyond. The university  boasts tens of thousands of loyal and accomplished alumni who share  their diverse talents with the Nation.   Unfortunately, in recent years, Cheyney has faced financial  instability, and 3 years ago nearly lost its accreditation. But last  week there was good news. Based on strong leadership from Cheyney's new  president, Aaron Walton, increased community and alumni engagement and  strong enrollment numbers, Cheyney learned that its accreditation had  been renewed.   Moving forward, Cheyney is increasing academic offerings and  developing innovative public-private partnerships that will help  students to graduate and be ready to compete in the 21st century.   I am extremely proud to represent Cheyney and to testify to the  importance of HBCUs across the United States.   Lastly, I am also proud to be a new member of the Congressional HBCU  Caucus led by my colleague, a fierce supporter of these institutions,  Representative Alma Adams.
