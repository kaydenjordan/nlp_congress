 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill, which  basically says companies should be protected, not workers.   Imagine, when a firm is jointly owned and operated by the Chinese or  the Mexicans or the El Salvadorans, where workers' rights are never  protected.   Worker protections in America have long accounted for the reality  that the company who writes the check isn't always the company that  controls workplace conditions, but if they share control over workplace  conditions, they should be held jointly responsible for violations.   I include in the Record a letter from the United Auto Workers talking  about the parts industry.           International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &             Agricultural Implement Workers of America--UAW,                                  Washington, DC, November 7, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the more than one million       active and retired members of the International Union, United       Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of       America (UAW), I strongly urge you to oppose H.R. 3441, the       ``Save Local Business Act.'' This ill-conceived bill would       make it more difficult for workers to join together and       collectively bargain to improve working conditions and raise       living standards. This is a bad bill for working people       because it would make it even easier for businesses to       replace full time jobs with precarious temporary employment.        H.R. 3441 overturns long established case law and joint       employer standards found in labor and employment law. It does       this by redefining the term `employer' in a way that would       make it nearly impossible for workers to hold their employers       accountable when their rights are violated.        Disturbingly, businesses and large corporations throughout       our economy have avoided responsibility to their employees by       hiding behind staffing agencies to claim they are not       technically their employer. The net result for working people       has been lower wages and fewer job protections. For example,       within the auto parts manufacturing sector, the National       Employment Law Project (NELP) estimates that temporary       workers earn, on average, 29% less than direct employees of       manufacturers. We have seen how, in the automotive sector,       multinational corporations often hire temporary workers, who       work side by side, doing the same job, for years, with full       time workers and earning significantly less.        H.R. 3441 would also overturn the National Labor Relations       Board's (NLRB) in Browning-Ferris. The Browning-Ferris       decision was good for working families because it established       that workers could negotiate with their true employer under       fact specific circumstances. In that case, a subcontractor       for Browning-Ferris Industries (BFI), Leadpoint, was unable       to negotiate several basic employment terms without       permission from BFI. The NLRB sensibly found that BFI must be       at the bargaining table along with its subcontractor       Leadpoint. Under the terms of this bill, that would not be       the case when similar disputes arise in the future.        Economic inequality and a shortage of good paying jobs has       hurt working people and our economy for decades.       Unfortunately, H.R. 3441 would make a bad situation worse.       Congress should reject this bill and instead work to create       more jobs you can sustain a family on.            Sincerely,                                                       Josh Nassar,                                              Legislative Director.     Mr. Speaker, there couldn't be a more dangerous industry  to work in. Do you want to put some of these foreign companies in  charge of worker safety in those places? Not I. I have seen too many  mangled bodies in places around the world that tell me no.   I am for workers being protected as well as the interests of  corporations. Today's action eliminates 80 years of safeguards,  safeguards on joint employer responsibility.   What does that mean? It means that a company that subcontracts or  franchises work to save a buck can shield  [[Page H8576]]  itself when workers aren't paid fair wages or are denied basic  employment rights.    Small businesses and workers suffer while large corporate  interests escape accountability.   Mr. Speaker, it is time we pass laws that help American workers.  Wouldn't that be a sea change in this country?   I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of Veterans Day, which we  will observe this Saturday, November 11.   Each Veterans Day, we celebrate America's veterans for their  unwavering patriotism and willingness to serve and sacrifice above  self. How noble for liberty's cause, yet too many veterans, upon their  return from service, endure long wait-times at VA health facilities.   That is why I have developed a bill that would reduce the VA  physician shortage, which is estimated to be about 5,000.   Our VET MD Act would address this by allowing pre-med students to  participate in organized clinical observations at VA medical centers.  Future physicians will have exposure to the VA healthcare system, and  the VA will create potential medical professionals.   This is just one solution Congress should implement to address the VA  physician shortage. It will help lead to decreased wait-times, better  care, and healthier outcomes.   Our veterans dedicated their lives for our country. We owe these  honorable men and women better basic healthcare.   Mr. Speaker, on this Veterans Day, I urge my colleagues to please  join me. Let us affirm a commitment to action for the men and women who  have defended our liberty and have lived the words duty, honor, and  country.                            ____________________
