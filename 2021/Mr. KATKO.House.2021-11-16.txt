 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the celebrated career  of Wayne Mahar as he prepares to retire after 36 years of weather  forecasting in central New York.   Wayne is one of the most recognizable and trusted weather forecasters  in central New York. When planning a hike, barbecue, tailgate, or  family outing, central New Yorkers have relied on Wayne to share the  weather for nearly four decades.   Originally from Brunswick, Maine, Wayne Mahar began his career  working for the National Weather Service. From there, he founded  Precision Weather Service, a private weather consulting firm that  builds forecasts for major events like the Major League Baseball All- Star Game, the Super Bowl, and red carpet events.   In 1985 Wayne joined the CNY, Central New York, broadcast team in  Syracuse, becoming the first full-time meteorologist in central New  York. Here he brought a new level of seriousness to the profession by  utilizing computer models and hard science to make his forecasts.  Through this approach Wayne became known for accuracy, reliability, and  his outdoor broadcasts from the CNY Central Weather Deck.   An expert on severe weather events, Wayne was also there to deliver  critical, lifesaving information to families during some of the most  historic weather events in central New York, including the great  blizzard of 1993 and the 1998 Labor Day storm.   Outside of forecasting, Wayne has been a prominent fixture in our  community. He is an avid hockey player, hosts regular workshops for  young, aspiring meteorologists, and in 2008 he founded the Priscilla  Mahar Animal Welfare Foundation. The nonprofit organization was named  after his late mother and champions animal welfare causes, raising over  a quarter of a million dollars for local animal rescues.   For nearly four decades, families like mine have turned to Wayne  Mahar when we want to know if there will be sun, rain, sleet, or just  another day of lake-effect snow. While he will be dearly missed on our  televisions, central New Yorkers can rest assured they will continue to  see him.   When he is not spending time with his children and grandchildren,  Wayne has promised he will remain an active part of our community.  Personally, I am glad to hear that because I still have not had the  opportunity yet to putter a few pucks at him while he stands in the  hockey goal, but I am going to do that before too long.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House join me in  honoring Wayne Mahar for an incredible career in weather forecasting  and wishing him the best in his well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
