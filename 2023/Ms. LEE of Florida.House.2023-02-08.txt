 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.J.  Res. 26, Disapproving the Action of the District of Columbia Council in  approving the Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022.   As a former Federal prosecutor and circuit court judge, I know  firsthand how important it is for criminal penalties to reflect the  seriousness of a crime and to ensure the safety of our communities.   Despite surging crime rates, the D.C. Council seeks to reduce the  maximum sentences for violent crimes such as carjackings and robberies  and enact procedural changes that will overburden the courts.   This will undermine law enforcement, and it is contrary to the actual  needs of the residents and visitors to our Nation's Capital.   Republicans are committed to data-driven criminal justice policies  that will strengthen our courts and law enforcement, combat rising  crime rates, and protect our communities.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  important measure to put an end to these policies and make Washington  safe for all Americans.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Chairman  Comer's resolution disapproving of the D.C. Council's recent action to  allow noncitizens, including illegal immigrants, to vote in local  elections. The council's actions undermine voter confidence, faith in  our elections, and, ultimately, the sovereignty of the United States.   Voting is a sacred right reserved only for American citizens. That is  why Federal law and the Constitution prohibit noncitizens from voting  in Federal elections.   In order to further promote integrity in our elections, many States  have also prohibited noncitizens from voting in their State and local  elections. Our Nation's Capital should be a model for the rest of the  country, but for years, the District has run poor elections. Now, the  council wants to take it even further by allowing noncitizens to vote.   At a time when communities across our Nation are dealing with the  consequences of an unprecedented number of criminals, human smugglers,  and deadly fentanyl pouring across our borders, it is unthinkable that  the D.C. Council wants to reward those who have broken the law.   Further, this would let diplomats vote in D.C. elections, some of  whom can be agents of our adversaries, like China and Russia. That is  why several of my colleagues on the House Administration and Oversight  and Accountability Committees last Congress, including Chairman Steil  and Mr. Comer, sent a letter to D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, criticizing  the measure and calling on her to reject it.    Congress can and should exercise its constitutional responsibility  over D.C. and stop this law with this joint resolution of disapproval.   I commend Chairman Comer for leading this commonsense measure and  taking steps to restore voter confidence.   We have seen that in States like Georgia and Florida, when you  implement key election integrity tools that make it easier to vote and  harder to cheat, we can boost voter confidence, which in turn boosts  voter turnout.    Mr. Speaker, we need more election integrity, not  less. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
