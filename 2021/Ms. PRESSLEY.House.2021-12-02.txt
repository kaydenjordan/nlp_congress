 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Bowman for yielding.  There is nothing freshman about him. He has hit the ground running  since he has been here, and he has been a leader and partner on many  issues, including this issue of student debt. I thank the gentleman for  his partnership on our congressional resolution calling for President  Biden to provide broad-based student debt cancellation.    Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of more than 45 million people  in America crushed by the growing weight of the $1.7 trillion student  debt crisis. The grandmother--you heard me right, the grandmother--I  have a 76-year-old constituent in the Massachusetts Seventh still  paying student loans, all while on Social Security and a fixed income.   I rise on behalf of the new parents struggling to manage the  skyrocketing costs of childcare for which Massachusetts is the second  highest in the country, $21,000 per child for center-based care; new  parents struggling to manage the skyrocketing cost of childcare, rent,  and their student loan payments; the teacher who fears losing their  teaching license because they have gone into default and can't come up  with that monthly student loan payment, not even the minimum.  [[Page H6899]]    The irony of it is that this is debt that they incurred in order to  be an educator, in order to be a nation builder, to pour into our  children, the next generation.   I rise on behalf of an entire generation of young people, young  people I met with a couple of weeks ago who, when I asked them about  their future, were despondent and expressed great hopelessness: Well, I  don't know that I am going to go to college because I don't want to be  in debt for the rest of my life, and I fear if there will even be a  planet for me to grow up on.   I rise today on behalf of a whole generation of young people  grappling with that sense of foreboding and despair, a generation of  young folk who have been forced to hold off on pursuing education,  starting higher education, starting a small business, purchasing a home  because of record levels of student loan debt.   I rise on behalf of Black and Brown folk who, due to generations of  precise and intentional what I would characterize as policy violence,  have been forced to take on higher rates of student debt for just a  chance at the same degree as our White peers.                                time  1915    Madam Speaker, the student debt crisis is one that disproportionately  impacts our Black community. For too long, the narrative has excluded  us and the unique ways in which this debt is exacerbating racial and  economic inequities, compounding our gender and racial wealth gap. We  have to borrow at higher rates just for a shot at the same degree as  our White peers.   Black women, in particular, bear the largest burden, as they are  forced to take on higher student debt loads, all while navigating a  persisting wage gap that allows Black women to earn just 61 cents to  every dollar earned by a White man. These are systemic barriers that  make it significantly more challenging to repay this debt.   There are some who have questioned if this is regressive in impact,  to cancel student debt of $50,000. They have questioned the merit as to  whether or not this is a racial justice issue. Well, ask the presidents  of the historically Black colleges and universities who have been using  ARPA funds to cancel student debt. Not regressive in impact. Important,  necessary, and long overdue.   These are systemic barriers that have existed long before this  pandemic and unjust pre-COVID status quo.   In this moment, as we work to build back better and do so equitably,  President Biden has an opportunity and a responsibility and the  authority to address the hurt and harm these communities are feeling by  using his executive authority to cancel $50,000 in Federal student loan  debt.   Doing so is one of most effective ways he can provide sweeping relief  to millions of families while helping to reduce the racial wealth gap  to lay the groundwork for an equitable and just long-term recovery.   This is a crisis created through policy decisions, and we have a  responsibility to address it head on. In this moment of ongoing crisis,  our families need every bit of help that they can get.   In just under 2 months, student debt payments are scheduled to resume  for millions of families across this country. Families who have been  struggling to make ends meet throughout this pandemic, through no fault  of their own in this pandemic-induced recession, will have an  additional bill to cover.   I have parents in my district in their fifties still paying on their  student loans and now helping their children pay for their student  loans. This is an intergenerational crisis.   This summer, we applauded the Biden administration for heeding the  calls of many of us here tonight, heeding the calls of this movement,  the movement that elected him, when they extended the pause on student  loan payments. We fought hard for that.   This welcome action gave another layer of protection to the millions  of borrowers facing a disastrous financial cliff. But our work here is  unfinished.   This isn't a question as to whether or not he has the authority,  because that authority has already been exercised. The same authority  should be used to extend the payment pause. President Biden must now  cancel at least $50,000 in student debt to boost the economy and to  close the racial wealth gap.   In this moment of a so-called reckoning on racial injustice, the only  receipts that matter are policies and budgets.   The truth, Madam Speaker, is that this economic crisis is far from  over. Families in the Seventh District of Massachusetts and all across  the country are continuing to struggle to make ends meet. Failure to  act would be unconscionable, so we must move with urgency.   As we continue the work of building a just and equitable recovery  from the current economic crisis, broad-based, across-the-board, and  permanent student debt cancellation must remain front and center.   The people, including the broad and diverse coalition that elected  President Biden, demand, deserve, and require nothing less.
