 Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle).   Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R.  3441, cripples the right to bargain for better wages and conditions  when workers have joint employers. By narrowing the definition of a  joint employer, this bill deprives thousands of workers of their right  to negotiate with the parties that really exercise control over their  wages and conditions; and by undermining collective bargaining, this  bill suppresses wages.   One of the biggest problems, if not the biggest problem in the  economy today, has been the lack of wage growth over the last decade to  two decades. This bill will not improve that problem. It will take an  existing problem and make it worse.   Today, workers are under a direct threat from reckless, misleading  legislation like this; and that, ultimately, will do nothing to improve  their wages, improve their benefits, or improve their working  conditions.   Let's reject this bill and, instead, discuss and debate and craft  legislation that can improve workers' wages.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    I yield the gentlewoman from Ohio an additional  30 seconds.    I yield the gentlewoman from Ohio an additional  30 seconds.
