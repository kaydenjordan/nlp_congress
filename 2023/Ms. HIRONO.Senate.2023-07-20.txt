 Mr. President, earlier this year, the U.S. Mint  launched the Edith Kanaka`ole quarter, the seventh coin in the American  Women Quarters Program, which is intended to celebrate pioneering women  who were accomplished leaders in different fields and who came from  various backgrounds. She joins other notable women such as Maya  Angelou, Anna May Wong, and, starting next year, Patsy Takemoto Mink.   Shortly after the bill creating the program was signed into law, I  was proud to recommend to the Mint that Mrs. Kanaka`ole be selected for  the program. Now, people in the State of Hawaii and throughout our  Nation can find her likeness on circulating U.S. quarters.   Mrs. Kanaka`ole's story is truly remarkable. Her impact is  widespread. Born on October 30, 1913, Edith Kanaka`ole, or ``Aunty  Edith'' as she was commonly known, was an indigenous Hawaiian composer,  chanter, kumu hula--traditional dance teacher--and a custodian of  Native culture, traditions, and the natural land. She has been  recognized within her local community, throughout the State of Hawaii,  and now nationwide as being a preeminent practitioner of modern  Hawaiian culture, language, and practices.   One of Aunty Edith's many accomplishments was her direct influence in  Hawaii's education system. Aunty Edith was instrumental in the creation  of Hawaiian language curriculum for public school students at the  Keaukaha School in Hilo, as well as in the development of courses and  seminars at the college and university levels on subjects including  ethnobotany, Polynesian history, genealogy, and Hawaiian chant and  mythology.   Aunty Edith was also a renowned kumu hula. She believed that oli-- Hawaiian literary chants--formed the basis of Hawaiian values and  history. She started composing oli and choreographing hula, and, in the  1950s, she toured the contiguous United States, western Canada, and  much of Asia with a hula group named after her daughter Nalani. She  went on to found her own halau--hula school--Halau O Kekuhi, which is  still in operation today.   In 1979, Aunty Edith received the Distinction of Cultural Leadership  Award, the State of Hawaii's highest honor. It is given to individuals  who have made significant outstanding lifetime contributions to Hawaii  in areas of culture, arts, and humanities. Aunty Edith passed away on  October 3, 1979, but her legacy lives on through her family, community,  and the Edith Kanaka`ole Foundation, a Hawaiian culture-based,  nonprofit organization dedicated to maintaining and perpetuating  cultural education and traditional practices.   A line from one of her most famous oli, ``E ho mai ka ike,'' is  inscribed on the reverse side of the Edith Kanaka`ole quarter and  translated as ``granting the wisdom.'' I cannot think of a better  phrase to encapsulate Aunty Edith's legacy.   Mahalo, Aunty Edith, for all your contributions to our State and this  Nation.                            ____________________
