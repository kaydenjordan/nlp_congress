 Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate a milestone  for Rhode Island's oldest Black church. In August, the Congdon Street  Baptist Church on the East Side of Providence celebrated its  bicentennial. From its inception at the nearby African Union  meetinghouse and schoolhouse in 1819, Congdon Street Baptist Church has  been a centerpiece of spiritual and community life for generations of  African Americans in Providence.   The Congdon Street Baptist Church has weathered racial injustices to  flourish as a place for worship and education. Its founding members  left the First Baptist Church in America, where they were made to  worship in a segregated space. They formed their own congregation in  Providence so that people of color could worship in dignity and secure  a fitting education for their children.   Fulfilling that mission did not come without adversity. The original  church was demolished in the 1860s at the behest of White neighbors.  Unbowed, the congregation rebuilt. The new church, completed in 1875,  is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In the 1960s,  the church served as a sanctuary for Rhode Islanders involved in the  civil rights movement. Today, education and empowerment remain  hallmarks of the church community.   Rhode Island was founded on the principles of religious freedom and  tolerance. I am proud to have Congdon Street Baptist Church as a  cornerstone of that tradition, and I wish the congregation centuries of  peaceful worship to come.                            ____________________
