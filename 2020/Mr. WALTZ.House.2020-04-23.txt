 Madam Speaker, we are hearing a lot today about Democrats  support this; Republicans support that. I don't think this is the time  for that. Americans don't care. They don't care about party. This virus  doesn't care. They care about this Congress getting things done and  about America pulling through.   This is a good day for our businesses, for our hospitals, but I think  a silver lining in all of this will be all of us seeing America pull  together.   And I think the other silver lining will be us drastically changing  how we view our relationship with China, and understanding the Chinese  Communist Party is not our friend, they are manipulating international  organizations, they are hoarding supplies, have brought manufacturing  away from a place where we, as America, can benefit. We must bring that  manufacturing home. We will do that on the other side of this.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to introduce legislation today to not only  bring our pharmaceuticals home, but our technology and our business  that China is preying on right now, as we speak. Wake up America. We  are in a cold war, and we have to do better.
