 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and  the Foreign Affairs Committee for helping move this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, being the former chairman of the Western Hemisphere  Subcommittee on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I rise to  encourage the passage of H. Res. 357 to reaffirm the strategic  partnership between the United States and Canada.   As my good friend and former United States Ambassador to Canada,  David Wilkins taught me that Canada is one of our strongest allies and  one of our largest and best trading partners, and we are dependent on  cooperation between the nations to promote trade, security, and energy  issues.   It is imperative that we protect the close partnership with Canada  and the interdependent North American energy market. Enforcing the  strength of our relationship with Canada would expand the size of our  energy market, create more jobs, reduce energy cost for consumers, and  enhance North American energy security and interdependence. I remind  the administration that energy issues should be a top priority in any  NAFTA negotiation, as Canada is the largest supplier of energy to the  United States. Now, this includes oil, uranium, natural gas, and  electricity.   We share the longest undefended border, the largest bilateral trading  relationship, and one of the deepest security and energy partnerships  in the world. Today, 32 States consider Canada their primary trading  partner. The comprehensive trade and investment relationship, which the  United States has with Canada, supports millions of jobs in goods and  services on both sides of the border. The importance of this bilateral  relationship is critical for both countries.   Let me conclude by saying it is vital that we continue to look for  ways to strengthen our relationship with Canada, and I hope that my  colleagues will support this resolution to reaffirm the importance of  U.S.-Canada relations.
