 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me  time.   Mr. Speaker, Kate's Law, the bill that this rule brings to the floor,  is very personal to the people of my district because of two other  names that we will never forget.                                time  1245    On October 24, 2014, Sacramento County Sheriff's Deputy Danny Oliver  and Placer County Detective Michael Davis were brutally gunned down in  one of the most cold-blooded rampages in the history of either county.   It began when Deputy Oliver approached a car in a parking lot to ask  if he could help a couple who seemed to be lost. He was shot dead.   A bystander who was too slow turning over his car keys became the  next victim. Miraculously, he survived a gunshot wound to the head but  vividly remembers the smile on the gunman's face as he pulled the  trigger.   The next victim was Detective Michael Davis. His father, a Riverside  County Sheriff's deputy, had lost his life in the line of duty on the  very same day 26 years earlier.   These crimes should never have happened. Their assailant had  repeatedly entered this country illegally. While here, he had been  apprehended for committing other crimes and repeatedly deported, only  to easily recross the border without being challenged.   I have heard it said there is no evidence that illegal immigrants  commit crimes at any higher rate than the general population. Well,  that is just not true. It is true that crime statistics don't aggregate  by legal status. Some States, like California, no longer even report  the legal status of inmates. They can tell us by race, gender, age,  background, and jurisdiction who stole a car last year, but they won't  tell us how many illegal immigrants did.   By painstakingly piecing together all of the available fragmented  data in 2015, FOX News concluded that illegal immigrants are three  times more likely to be convicted of murder than the legal population.   According to this report, illegals account for 3.7 percent of the  population but are convicted of 13.6 percent of all crimes, including  12 percent of all murders, 20 percent of all kidnappings, and 16  percent of drug trafficking. Each year, 900,000 illegal immigrants are  arrested for crimes.   Citing the GAO, FOX reported that 55,000 illegal immigrants were in  Federal prison and 296,000 in State and local jails in 2011. The real  tragedy is that there should be zero crimes committed by illegal  immigrants because there should be zero illegal immigrants in this  country.   For 16 years, two Presidents--one Republican and one Democrat-- ignored their constitutional responsibility to take care that the laws  be faithfully executed. Well, thank God, we finally have a President  who takes that responsibility seriously.   This rule brings a bill to the floor that increases penalties for  those who return to our country after they have been deported. The  other to be debated today adds long-overdue sanctions to local  jurisdictions that refuse to protect their own citizens, and I rise in  strong support of that bill as well.   It is too late for Officers Davis and Oliver. It is too late for Kate  Steinle. It is too late for thousands of other Americans killed by  illegal immigrants. But perhaps it is just in time for your neighbor,  your family member, or yourself.
