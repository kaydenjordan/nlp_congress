 Mr. President, I confess, it was great to be back home  last week for Thanksgiving in Texas. Like so many other families, I got  together with my family and enjoyed that time together. But now we are  back here in the Nation's Capital with a lot of work to do.   The end of the year is always a busy time here in Congress, and this  year is no exception even though the usual appropriations process has  been kicked over to January 19. Because the majority leader has not  scheduled earlier votes either on the Israel aid, which was passed by  the House some weeks ago and has been sitting here in the Senate with  no action--the majority leader has announced his intention to put a  $106 billion package benefiting Ukraine, Israel, and also the Indo- Pacific.   For the record, I support the efforts to make sure the brave  Ukrainians can continue to fight and defend their country against the  invasion of Putin's Russia. I certainly support Israel's right to  defend itself against Hamas terrorists, a proxy for the No. 1  international state sponsor of terrorism--Iran. Of course I support our  efforts to deter President Xi from doing what he said he intends to do,  which is to take Taiwan one way or the other at a time of his choosing.   Well, fortunately, we aren't staring down the barrel of a spending  deadline, so there are no threats of a government shutdown, but we do  have these very important issues to attend to.   First, Congress needs to do something that we have done for 62  consecutive years, and that is, finally pass the National Defense  Authorization Act.   Just before Thanksgiving, the Senate finally voted to begin that  formal conference process to work out the differences between the House  and the Senate. Our colleagues on both sides of the Capitol are now  hard at work trying to iron out that agreement so we can pass a strong  National Defense Authorization Act and send it to the President for his  signature.   I started off my remarks talking about the challenges we face and our  allies face around the world. Nothing would be more disappointing to us  but more emboldening to our adversaries than our failure to deal with  this necessary task, which, as I said, we have done for 62 years  previous.   The second thing we need to do is to address the supplemental funding  bill the President has proposed.   Again, I am a little mystified why the majority leader decided not to  take up the Israel funding that was passed several weeks ago. I  understand he doesn't like the pay-for the House has proposed, but I  think one logical thing to do would be to propose a different pay-for  and to put it on the Senate floor so we can talk about it, vote on  [[Page S5591]]  it, and get it done, because obviously that situation--although there  seems to be a temporary lull in the conflict between Hamas and Israel,  we know that once this temporary period passes, Israel will have no  choice but to destroy Hamas's ability to commit future terrorist  attacks.   Well, as I said, this supplemental funding will include assistance to  Israel, Ukraine, and the Indo-Pacific, but the part that I think our  Democratic leadership is in denial about is that the price of getting  this done will also include major policy changes at the border.   We have been talking about immigration reform for the entire time I  have been here in the Senate, and that is all it has been, is talk and  no action. But my State is on the frontline of the Biden border crisis,  and it is getting worse by the day because all of the signals that are  being sent by the administration are that if you make it to the border  by any means necessary, you are going to be released into the interior  of the United States. So it is like a big, flashing green light or a  big welcome mat saying ``Come to the United States.''   Obviously, we know it has not only been a huge burden on States like  mine, which has a 1,200-mile common border; we have had people like  Mayor Adams, the mayor of New York City, saying that unless something  is done about this, it will destroy New York City. Those are some  rather stark and jarring words. But it has finally come to the  attention of even some Democratic leadership that this is something  that is unsustainable and must be addressed, and we are going to do  that in the context of these funding bills.   Well, these are some of the most consequential security challenges we  are facing today. It is critical that we actually get to work on them  and not just talk about them, and hopefully that will happen soon. But  one issue I wanted to highlight was that Congress needs to reauthorize  perhaps one of the most important laws that no one has ever heard of-- or at least not many people have heard of outside of Washington, DC-- and that is, we need to reauthorize section 702 of the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act before it expires at the end of the year.   When you think about America's national security, this probably is  not the first thing that comes to mind. We typically talk about our  brave servicemembers and our weapons or air platforms and the  deterrence that is so important to keep the peace. We think of threats  all around the world, like the ones I mentioned--those in the Middle  East, those in Asia, and those in Europe and elsewhere.   But one of the most important tools available to our national  security and our national defense is our ability to understand those  threats and use section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Act.   This is a unique tool, but it is absolutely essential, according to  the FBI Director and other members of the intelligence community. And,  most importantly, it is what it says it is. It is a foreign  intelligence surveillance tool. In other words, it is only used to gain  information and intelligence on foreigners--not located here in the  United States, but those located outside of the United States.   That is an important distinction, because we don't allow those sorts  of investigations to take place here in the United States. We have a  constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures--a  requirement that if you are going to get a search warrant or you are  going to get a warrant for somebody's arrest, that you have to go in  front of an impartial judge and show probable cause why a crime was  committed by this person.   That is critical to our authorities to protect ourselves as laid out  in the Bill of Rights for American citizens but not for foreigners who  are spying on the United States. That is something entirely different.   So this is not authority used to target U.S. citizens, whether on  American soil or elsewhere. It is specifically aimed at foreigners or  non-Americans overseas who could pose a threat to our national  security.   Congress enacted section 702 in 2008 in response to threats by  various terrorist groups in the wake of 9/11. It tore down some of the  walls that prevented government Agencies from sharing information among  themselves, and there is no question that it has been a success.   When talking about section 702 several years ago, the FBI Director  said:         The fact that we have not suffered another 9/11-scale       attack is not just luck.    He noted it is a product of intelligence, teamwork, diligence, and  ``dot-connecting.'' And that is much of what section 702 does: It  allows collection of the dots so the dots can then be connected to  facilitate investigations into foreign terrorist threats and other  actions by foreign adversaries.   This authority has been vital to detecting potential terrorist  attacks, but the application reaches far beyond counterterrorism  missions.   Earlier this year, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco testified  before the Senate Judiciary Committee and said that this law allowed  the United States to uncover what she called ``vitally important''  intelligence about the war in Ukraine.   So it is not just a counterterrorism tool; it has much broader  application. She told the Judiciary Committee that section 702 has  helped uncover gruesome atrocities, war crimes, in Ukraine. That  includes the murder of civilians, the forced relocation of Ukrainian  children into Russia, and the detention of refugees.   It is also important at a time when 71,000 Americans died of  synthetic opioid poisoning last year alone--fentanyl being the most  common variety--that 702 has helped the United States combat fentanyl  trafficking here in the United States.   Fentanyl poisoning is the No. 1 cause of death for Americans between  the ages of 18 and 45. This is a terrible scourge, and we have got to  use all the tools in our toolbox, including section 702, to fight it.   Information acquired because of this authority has informed our  understanding of China's role, for example, in providing the precursor  chemicals that are necessary to produce the finished product. And it  has also helped expose smuggling techniques by the drug cartels that  smuggle the synthetic opioids, the fentanyl, into the United States  across--yes--across our southern border.   So for virtually every national security threat that the United  States faces, section 702 is an essential asset. Earlier this year,  Attorney General Merrick Garland and Director of National Intelligence  Avril Haines sent a letter to Congressional leaders highlighting even  more examples that show why this authority is so important.   Information acquired through section 702 has allowed the United  States to identify multiple foreign ransomware attacks on U.S. critical  infrastructure, like the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack a year or  so ago. It has enabled the United States to stop components for weapons  of mass destruction from reaching foreign actors, and it has identified  threats to U.S. troops and thwarted planned terrorist attacks both at  home and abroad.   It has helped disrupt our adversary's efforts to recruit spies on  American soil and send their operatives to the United States.   Section 702 is a critical tool in America's national security  toolbox, but its future is uncertain, because unless Congress takes  action before the end of this year, that authority will expire.   This is as if we would intentionally blind ourselves to these threats  that I have described for Congress to fail to take action and  reauthorize section 702.   If that happens, it will deprive America's dedicated intelligence  professionals of the laws that they need, the authorities they need in  order to keep our country safe.   Director Wray, I think, said it best when he said that allowing  section 702 to expire would be ``an act of unilateral disarmament in  the face of the Chinese Communist Party''--``an act of unilateral  disarmament in the face of the Chinese Communist Party.''   Given the threat that China poses to the United States, especially in  the Indo-Pacific, an unforced error by failing to reauthorize this  necessary legislation would be the last thing we need. Allowing section  702 to expire would only benefit our most dangerous and capable  adversaries. It would embolden China and Russia while hamstringing our  ability to understand the threats we are facing, until it is too late.   General Paul Nakasone, who leads both the National Security Agency  and  [[Page S5592]]  the U.S. Cyber Command, has been very clear about the need to preserve  section 702.   Earlier this year, he summed up its importance rather succinctly when  he said that ``702 saves lives and protects the homeland.''   That is what we are focused on at the moment when it comes to funding  the vast national security threats we do face: saving lives and  protecting the homeland. That is true, I believe, of the war in  Ukraine. It is in our Nation's national interest, I believe. It is true  in the war being fought by Israel for its survival in the Middle East.  It is true for China's saber-rattling in the Indo-Pacific. And it is  true for the crisis we face at the border.   Achieving our definition of success in each of these situations will  require far more than just money. It will require reliable and timely  information or intelligence, and we simply will not have access to that  if 702 were to expire.   It is absolutely imperative that Congress reauthorize section 702  before the end of the year. And I know we have the time, if we only  have the will to get it done.   This is a priority for members on both sides of the aisle and both  sides of the Capitol. This is not a partisan issue. It is the ultimate  nonpartisan issue. And we have seen a number of constructive proposals  to preserve and modernize this authority while enhancing privacy  protections.   I understand concerns about abusing these various authorities against  Americans, something that is illegal, something that should be  investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.   But just because a few rogue actors have misbehaved is no reason to  relinquish this necessary tool when it comes to foreign actors who wish  us ill.   As Congress continues working to address the range of national  security threats that our country faces, reauthorizing section 702 must  be a top priority.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
