 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Eddie Hughes on  60 years of service at UPS.   Eddie Hughes was born in Mt. Pleasant, MS, and moved to Indianapolis  to take a job with UPS in 1963. His only hiatus came from 1965-1966,  when Eddie served his country in the U.S. Army. Originally a package  handler, Eddie became a UPS driver in 1968, a position he still holds  to this day. During his 55 years in his current role, Eddie has driven  an estimated 4.62 million miles making deliveries to Hoosiers. He has  joined the company's ``Circle of Honor,'' a distinction given to  drivers who have amassed more than 25 years of safe driving.   Eddie and Mary, his wife of 42 years, live in Indianapolis. They have  two adult children, William and Mary Elizabeth.   It is my honor to congratulate Mr. Hughes and his family on this  remarkable milestone.                            ____________________
