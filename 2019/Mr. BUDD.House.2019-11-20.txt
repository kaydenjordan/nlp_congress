 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the 7-year  anniversary of Christian human rights lawyer Khalil Maatouk's  unconscionable disappearance at the hands of Syrian dictator Bashar al- Assad.   The regime abducted Maatouk because he had been relentlessly  defending Syrian democratic activists. He was last seen on October 2 of  2012.   Khalil Maatouk's ordeal serves as a stark reminder of the Assad  regime's barbaric assault on religious and Christian heritage,  blatantly violating international humanitarian law. According to a  September report from the Syrian Network for Human Rights, the regime  is responsible for targeting 61 percent of churches throughout the  country.   The United States demands the immediate release of Khalil Maatouk,  and I urge the administration to prioritize this case. We must stand up  for those who fight for freedom, especially freedom of religion.                            ____________________
