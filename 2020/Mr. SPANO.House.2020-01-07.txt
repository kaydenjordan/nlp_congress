 Mr. Speaker, I rise to bring attention to a distinguished  veteran from my district.   At the age of 17, Private Oliver Green enlisted in the Army just  before the Korean war; and on his 18th birthday, Private Green landed  at Wonsan, North Korea, in a tank landing ship.   As a machine gunner assigned to the Third Infantry Division, Seventh  Regiment, First Battalion, D Company, Oliver Green was quickly put into  the fight, experiencing a number of combat engagements with the enemy.  After being seriously wounded, Private Green was awarded the Bronze  Star, the Silver Star, and the Purple Heart for his combat heroism.   Oliver Green went on to attend the University of Alabama and Stetson  School of Law. He later became a Polk County judge, rising to become  chief judge of the tenth judicial circuit in 1979.   Oliver Green is a patriot. His commitment and service to our Nation  and our community have been outstanding.   I am grateful for brave individuals like Oliver Green who go, and  have gone, above and beyond the call of duty to serve their fellow man  and to serve our Nation.                            ____________________
