 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, with a heavy  heart, to honor the memories of the 11 victims of the Pittsburgh  synagogue shooting, an attack on three Jewish congregations during  Shabbat service on the morning of October 27, 2018.   Back in Pittsburgh, the trial for the deadliest anti-Semitic attack  in our Nation's history is proceeding. The jury convicted the gunman on  all 63 counts. Though this is a step toward justice, this trial  reopened unimaginably painful wounds that have barely begun to heal.   Congregation Dor Hadash, New Light Congregation, and the Tree of Life  Congregation all had members taken from them. Their names were: Joyce  Fienberg, Richard Gottfried, Rose Mallinger, Jerry Rabinowitz, Cecil  Rosenthal, David Rosenthal, Bernice Simon, Sylvan Simon, Daniel Stein,  Melvin Wax, and Irving Younger.   They were fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, friends, and  colleagues. They were members of a vibrant community who sought solace,  peace, and unity within the walls of their synagogue.   May their memories be forever a blessing. And may the strength and  resilience shown by the survivors, the victims' family members, and the  entire Jewish community throughout this heartbreaking trial forever be  an inspiration to us all.   They inspire me to work even harder to confront the root causes of  hatred, racism, and bigotry so that no community has to live in fear of  such senseless gun violence ever again.   They were murdered by a white supremacist gunman who targeted them  because of their faith and because their faith called them to welcome  immigrants and refugees.   The shooter was motivated by the ``great replacement theory.'' This  was the same white supremacist theory that motivated the shooter in  Buffalo to take the lives of 10 community members; the shooter in El  Paso to take the lives of 23 Hispanic community members; and the  shooter in Christchurch to take the lives of 51 Muslim worshippers.   The best prediction of violence against our communities is violent  language. That holds in each of the four mass shooting examples I just  mentioned. We must uphold the right of free speech while also working  to stem the proliferation of violent rhetoric.                                time  1030    When I visited the synagogue this past February, I met with the Tree  of Life congregation leadership and several family members of those  murdered. I was profoundly moved, both by the unimaginable pain of what  I saw, but also the beautiful conversations we had.   Together, we discussed what can be done to help the community heal  from the trauma, and we discussed their vision for transforming the  site into a center to educate against anti-Semitism and hate, a vision  I support.   The attack on the three Pittsburgh Jewish congregations is part of a  larger pattern of hate-fueled violence that plagues our Nation. The  Black community is all too familiar with the rising tide of white  supremacy in our country.   The Federal Government has the responsibility to act. We all have the  responsibility to use our platforms and condemn the rhetoric and  dismantle the systems of white supremacy that enable this and other  kinds of violence against our communities.   We must strengthen our gun laws to make sure weapons of war never  enter the hands of someone capable of such violence. We must invest in  resources to identify and dismantle extremist networks. We must work  hand in hand  [[Page H2999]]  with communities, engaging in dialogue and support, to address the root  causes of hatred and prevent future acts of violence.   If we don't, these things will only get worse. It is for this reason  that I make a commitment--a commitment made by Reverend Eric Manning,  senior pastor of Mother Emanuel Church AME, when he visited Pittsburgh.  Mother Emanuel was the site of a 2015 shooting, where a self-avowed  white supremacist entered the Charleston, South Carolina, church during  a Bible study and killed nine Black congregants.   When Reverend Manning spoke at the funeral of Rose Mallinger, the  last of the 11 victims to be laid to rest, he said: ``You are not  alone. We mourn with you. We are here for you and that will never  change.''   I commit myself to building bridges between marginalized communities  and fighting back. I want our Jewish siblings to know that we are in  this fight together every day for as long as it takes.   I end with an excerpt from the Jewish prayer for peace that Rose  Mallinger led every Saturday service:         May it be Your will . . .        that You erase war and bloodshed from the world and        in its place draw down a great and glorious peace so        that nation shall not lift up sword against nation,        neither shall they learn war anymore. . . .        Let justice come in waves like water and        righteousness flow like river, for the Earth shall        be full of the knowledge of the Holy One as the        waters covered the sea.        So may it be.        And we say:        Amen.                            ____________________
