 Madam Speaker, Congresswoman Jackie Walorski was a  friend, and I send my deepest condolences to her family and the  families of Zackery Potts and Emma Thomson.   Madam Speaker, the Inflation Reduction Act is nothing less than  historic and shows our constituents that governance can still work for  them.   The bill extends the Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies that  have saved 13 million Americans an average of $800 a year on health  coverage.   It will enable the U.S. to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent  by 2030 through investments like my clean hydrogen provision and make  it more affordable for families to purchase energy and cost-saving  products like electric vehicles and solar panels.   These are provisions that the New Democrat Coalition and I have been  calling for from the beginning. For our seniors, the bill will lower  the costs of prescription drugs by allowing Medicare to negotiate lower  prices and will cap out-of-pocket drug spending at $2,000 annually.  These are tangible benefits for Americans.   The legislation is fully paid for by ensuring corporations pay their  fair share and providing the IRS with the resources it needs after  decades of Republican-driven budget cuts.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I remind my  colleagues that there are 533,775 Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes  in North Carolina, but the gentleman remains against this bill capping  insulin costs and Medicare at $35 per month.
