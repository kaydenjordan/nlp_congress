 Madam President, today, I join my fellow members of the  Idaho congressional delegation, Senator Mike Crapo and Representatives   Mike Simpson and Russ Fulcher, in honoring the fight that so many waged  for women's suffrage by recognizing Idaho's role in securing the vote  for women in Idaho 24 years before the passage of national women's  suffrage legislation and by acknowledging the installation of the Idaho  Women's Suffrage Commemorative Sculpture on Idaho's capitol grounds.   Notably, 126 years ago, on December 11, 1896, the Idaho State Supreme  Court ruled in favor of the women's suffrage cause when it unanimously  upheld the Idaho Equal Suffrage Amendment. According to historic Idaho  publications, Idaho became the fourth State in the Union to enfranchise  women with the right to vote and the first to do so via a State  constitutional amendment. Remarkably, Idaho cemented the value and  importance of women in the Gem State through a highly visible action  prior to the Equal Suffrage Amendment--the adoption of the Idaho state  seal--designed by a young woman named Emma Edwards. According to the  Journal of the State senate of the Idaho Legislature, on March 14,  1891, the first Idaho State Legislature and Governor Norman B. Willey  approved, for official use, Edwards' rendering of the Idaho State  Seal--the only woman-designed State seal in the country. Idaho's all- male legislature approved Edwards' design, thus enshrining the  importance of women in Idaho's past, present, and future and further  validating the important role art continues to have in commemorating  significant historical moments in time.   Edwards' design reflects Idaho's unlimited potential, and her  depiction implies that women represent an equal half of that potential.  Edwards assigned women's influence as symbolic of the ideals of justice  and liberty. A woman's placement within the State seal suggests that  women are integral to the protection of those ideals in Idaho. The  inclusion of women in relation to Idaho's strongest and most prominent  1890s-era industries, mining, timber, and agriculture, position women  not only as recipients of Idaho's bounties, but also as essential for  the successful stewardship of these valuable resources.   Inspired in part by the Idaho State seal and the long-fought efforts  of Idaho suffragists to enfranchise women of the Gem State and to serve  as leaders in the fight to secure the vote for women nationally, the  Idaho State Historical Society, in partnership with the Idaho  Commission on the Arts and the Foundation for Idaho History,  commissioned local sculptor Irene Deely to develop the Idaho Women's  Suffrage Commemorative Sculpture. This sculpture, privately funded by  the Idaho State Historical Society and the Foundation for Idaho  History, embodies the spirit and legacy of the women's suffrage  movement, universally represents Idaho women through time, and pays  tribute to the Idaho Women 100 initiative. The sculpture's nameless  woman walks metaphorically in the footsteps of those who came before  her and then hands off her shoe to the future generations who will come  after her. Deely noted, ``Fourteen unique styles of shoes spanning ten  decades represent women through history, with a single shoe being  handed off for subsequent generations to fill.'' The 14 shoes include a  pair of contemporary moccasins made by Donzia, traditional Shoshone  Bannock artisans, to represent the women of Idaho's five federally  recognized Tribes. Variations of boots represent women's role in  Idaho's agriculture and ranching industries and the military.   On December 12, 2022, the Idaho State Historical Society will proudly  unveil the Idaho Women's Suffrage Commemorative Sculpture that  celebrates the story of Idaho women past, present, and future and their  impacts in the Gem State. This new symbol of the strength and  significance of Idaho women will be the only female figure featured on  the exterior State capitol grounds. The sculpture's placement on the  grounds of the Idaho State Capitol is a statement of the importance of  women to our State, especially in reference to their place in making  decisions that impact us all. We commend all those involved in this  important project that will serve as one more opportunity to  commemorate several moments in time that speak to women's suffrage  history and the resiliency, perseverance, and determination of many in  the fight for a singular, focused goal.                            ____________________
