 Mr. Speaker, recently I traveled to Lordstown, Ohio, in  Ashtabula County, Ohio; Johnstown, Pennsylvania; and Farrell,  Pennsylvania. I saw steel mill after steel mill shut down, including in  Cleveland, in Detroit, and in Downriver, Michigan.   Of the world's top 15 steel companies, China has 9 and the United  States of America doesn't have a single one. How did we let this happen  as a country? How did we decimate American steel, costing community  after community so many good jobs, hurting urban centers with large  African-American working populations, and hurting factory towns across  America? This was a colossal mistake.   In the 1950s, we used to make over 50 percent of the world's steel.  That is down to 2 or 3 percent. Today, China makes nearly 50 percent of  the world's steel.   This is a national security issue if we ever have to mobilize for our  military. This is a climate issue. China's steel puts three times the  emissions into the atmosphere than American steel does because we use  electric arc furnaces and recycled material, unlike the blast furnaces  that China uses.   It is time for America to have a strategy to bring modern steel  production back home. We can make steel that is cleaner and of higher  quality; and we can revitalize towns like Johnstown, Pennsylvania;  Lordstown, Ohio; Akron, Ohio; and Downriver, Michigan, if we build  these modern steel plants.   I am going to be working with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to  introduce a modern steel act to say that the government should partner  with our steel unions and with our steel companies to build modern  steel in the United States of America.   This will be clean steel with either hydrogen or electric arc  furnaces. This will create good-paying jobs. This will be good for  national security, and this will ensure that America leads in steel in  the 21st century, not China.   Mr. Speaker, we made a big, big error in the United States of  America, losing our lead in domestic production. It is time for our  country to become a manufacturing superpower again. It is time to begin  that with modern steel.                            ____________________
