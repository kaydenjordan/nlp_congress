 Madam Speaker, this is a great day for  American workers.   The nameplate on my desk says, ``Jobs, Jobs, Jobs,'' and that is  exactly what this new trade agreement will bring.   You see, for too long, America was willing to accept trade agreements  that were tilted against American workers because we were so far ahead  of the rest of the world, but we are not so far ahead anymore.   Ross Perot was right all those years ago when he said the old NAFTA  would bring a giant sucking sound of American jobs going to Mexico, and  that is precisely what happened in my district.   Unfair trade agreements are one of the primary reasons that the  American middle class has stagnated for decades--until the election of  Donald Trump.   The new USMCA corrects much of this imbalance:   It will prevent the departure of many more Americans jobs;   It will bring hundreds of thousands of new jobs to America;   It will raise the wages of workers throughout North America; and   It will accelerate the growth of our American economy.   I am thankful for the talent and effort of Ambassador Lighthizer in  successfully reaching this incredibly complicated trilateral agreement.  [[Page H12256]]    I am also thankful that we finally have a President with the backbone  and determination to do what is necessary to bring our trading partners  to the table, many of whom have taken advantage of us for far too long,  and despite the criticism of many here in our own country. Our  President is doing what is right and fair for America and American  workers.   Finally, Madam Speaker, I am thankful that Speaker Pelosi has finally  found a moment of sufficient political expedience that she would allow  this vote to lift American workers.    Madam Speaker, today, I rise in strong  opposition to this partisan bill that would give millionaires and  billionaires a tax cut and do nothing to help the middle class.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act brought prosperity throughout the Nation  and to people of every demographic and every income level.   Unemployment is at 50-year lows, all-time lows for African Americans  and Hispanics. American economic growth remains the envy of the world.   After years of stagnation under the Obama administration, middle- class wages are growing at rates not seen in over a decade. Opportunity  has been restored in this land of opportunity.   How did the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act accomplish all this? Primarily, it  cut tax rates for businesses to make them more competitive in the  world, especially small businesses that employ two-thirds of American  workers.   H.R. 5377 eliminates the $10,000 cap on the deductibility of State  and local taxes, referred to as the SALT deduction, and pays for it by  raising the top rate from 37 percent to 39.6 percent. This, however, is  the rate paid by many of the small business owners that employ all of  those Americans and restored our prosperity. This would absolutely make  those businesses less competitive in the world and would dampen  America's renewed prosperity.   Madam Speaker, even worse, the $10,000 cap on deductibility of the  SALT deduction is more than sufficient for over 90 percent of  Americans. Lifting this $10,000 cap is a plain tax cut for the rich.   The Democrats' constant complaint about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is  that it was a tax cut for the rich, which is simply untrue. But today,  they propose to fix it by giving an even bigger, massive tax cut to the  rich. That is correct, and let me repeat it. They complain that the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act was a tax cut for the rich, and they want to fix it  by giving an even bigger tax cut to the rich.   Fifty-two percent of the benefit of repealing the SALT cap goes to  income earners making more than $1 million a year, 52 percent. Ninety- four percent of the benefit goes to income earners in the top 10  percent of wage earners.   Madam Speaker, the Democrats should stop trying to convince America  that they care about the middle class. There is an old proverb: I can't  hear what you are saying because your actions speak so loudly.   This legislation would be particularly bad for poor and rural areas  in States with low taxes, like Florida and Texas, which have no State  income taxes. The average SALT deduction in my home county is $1,800,  well below the $10,000 cap.   We had a hearing where we invited mayors of affluent townships around  D.C. and in New York State. Their complaint was that, without the SALT  deduction, they would have difficulty in raising taxes on their  residents.   Madam Speaker, the D.C. suburbs have the highest household income in  the country. The median household income is over $100,000. I represent  Marion County, South Carolina, one of the poorest in the State. Fifty- seven percent of its residents are African American. The median  household income is around $30,000, less than a third of that in the  Washington suburbs.   If this SALT cap is lifted, the income taxes that the poor residents  of Marion County pay, a portion of those will go to subsidize the  housing and the services of the well-paid bureaucrats in the suburbs of  D.C.   Their taxes are already used to pay the salaries of these folks, but  now you would have the poor rural residents across America, not just  Marion County, subsidize their taxes, as well.   Madam Speaker, yesterday, those across the aisle voted to impeach  President Trump, who has done more to rebuild the middle class than  anyone since Ronald Reagan. The figures don't lie. Today, they  introduce a bill that would give a massive tax break to the highest  wage earners.   This bill would make our tax code more regressive. It would provide a  huge tax benefit to the 1 percent. This benefit would increase income  inequality. The Democrats' actions, Madam  [[Page H12275]]  Speaker, betray their loyalties, and those loyalties are not to the  American middle class.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to think of American  workers and vote ``no'' on this legislation that will hurt the middle  class.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion at the  desk.    I am in its present form.    Madam Speaker, my motion to recommit is  very simple.  [[Page H12282]]    Despite the terms of the underlying bill, it would retain the $10,000  cap on the SALT deduction only for tax returns where the people earn  more than $100 million a year.   This would produce about $7 billion in savings, and we would apply  the $7 billion to doubling the deduction for firefighters and teachers'  supplies from $500, which is provided in the underlying bill, to  $1,000.   Madam Speaker, my friends across the aisle love to say that they are  the party of the downtrodden and the middle class, but their actions  certainly speak a lot louder than their words. The underlying bill here  is a plain giveaway to the rich. Let me say that again: It is a plain  giveaway to the rich.   In excess of 50 percent of the benefit of restoring or taking away  the SALT cap goes to the top 1 percent of wage earners. Madam Speaker,  94 percent--94 percent--of the benefit of doing away with the SALT cap  goes to wage earners that are in the top 10 percent of American wage  earners.   Please, Madam Speaker, my friends across the aisle should stop saying  that they are for the middle class.   I represent an area in South Carolina. I live in Horry County, South  Carolina. The average SALT deduction is $1,800. The SALT cap of $10,000  is five times higher than what is needed to cover the average SALT  deduction in Horry County.   But I represent poor counties as well. Marion County, South Carolina,  57 percent African American, has an average wage of $30,000 a year. If  we do away with this SALT deduction cap, these people would be  subsidizing, with their Federal income taxes, mansions in high-tax  States.   That is simply not fair, and it doesn't just apply in South Carolina.  It applies to rural areas all over our country, including rural areas  in California and rural areas in New York.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into effect 2 years ago has restored  opportunity in this land of opportunity. We have historic lows in  unemployment. Record numbers of people are working in this country, in  every demographic category. It cuts taxes for people at every income  level.   The opportunity has been restored in this land of opportunity, but my  friends across the aisle dig at this. Their big opposition to this bill  is that it was a tax cut for the wealthy. They say 80 percent went to  the wealthiest 1 percent. That is not true. That only focuses on the  time after the individual tax cuts expire.   Their proposal to fix the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, their proposal to  fix this bill that they say is a tax cut for the wealthy, is to put  back an even greater tax cut for the wealthy. Again, 94 percent of the  benefit of this bill goes to people who earn in the top 10 percent of  wage earners in this country.   Madam Speaker, there is an old proverb: I can't hear what you are  saying because your actions scream so loudly.   Madam Speaker, if we truly are for the middle class, if we truly are  for the downtrodden, if we want to support our firefighters and our  teachers, vote for this motion to recommit.   Keep the SALT deduction in place for the wealthiest of the wealthy,  only those who are earning $100 million a year or more. Surely, they  can afford to pay for their property taxes on their mansions without  subsidies from rural people like the people in Marion, South Carolina.   If we really believe that we want to back the middle class, let's  back up our words with actions.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
