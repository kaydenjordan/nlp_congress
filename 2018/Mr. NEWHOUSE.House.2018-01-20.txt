 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the good gentleman from  the Rules Committee for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, in this most interesting debate on the rule that I have  ever seen, I rise in support of restoring a fully functioning Federal  Government.   I, along with most all of my colleagues, supported the continuing  resolution keeping the Federal Government open, keeping funding for our  military, reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program.   Senate Democrats rejected that solution. They voted against keeping  the Federal Government open, fully funding CHIP, against giving  certainty to the more than 60,000 low-income children in my own State  of Washington.   Now, our military professionals are working to reduce the impacts to  national security due to the government shutdown. Secretary Mattis  himself is giving shutdown guidance to the men and women in uniform,  saying: ``Steady as she goes. Hold the line. I know the Nation can  count on you. Stay alert.''   His message speaks to the admirable professionalism of our troops.  These men and women deserve their pay, and their families should not  have to worry about their paychecks. In no way does shutting down the  Federal Government serve them or us.    Mr. Speaker, in my district, important work like the  Hanford cleanup and our national laboratory must continue.   Today, I find myself, as well as many, frustrated. As a supporter of  the President's call for Congress to act to work on a bipartisan  solution on DACA, let's reopen the government and continue our  negotiations.
