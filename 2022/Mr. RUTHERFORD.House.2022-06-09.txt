 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Gohmert), my good friend, for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about a major problem facing our  communities, and that is human violence. I have four children and four  beautiful grandchildren who are school-aged.   Madam Speaker, I have to tell you, when I turned on the television  set and saw what was going on in Uvalde, Texas, my heart sank. I saw my  grandchildren in the faces of those children that I saw fleeing from  that horrible violence that was being conducted that afternoon. It is  too often that we turn on our TV sets and see images of schools locked  down and grieving communities. Unfortunately, as I mentioned, we saw  that unfold in Uvalde, Texas. Yet, every time tragedy strikes, we hear  the same conversation, calls for bans on firearms, universal background  checks, and red flag laws. That is how we spent the last two days in  this Chamber, talking about partisan bills that are, number one,  redundant--a lot of these laws already exist--or number two, they are  laws that will infringe on the rights of law-abiding  [[Page H5434]]  American citizens. Ultimately, they won't fix the problem.   Madam Speaker, the problem is not guns. It is not gun violence. The  problem is human violence. When I was sheriff, I used to explain to my  community occasionally, when gun violence--as they would call it--would  erupt, and they would ask me to talk about it.   Madam Speaker, I would tell the gentleman, Mr. Gohmert, I would  always make the point to them that I could take that weapon off my hip,  put it on that podium, and it would never, ever become violent. Now,  some human may come along and pick it up and use it violently, but that  is a human violence problem. It is not a gun violence problem.   I carried a gun for 41 years. It never became violent. Yet, we see it  over and over again. Humans are the cause of this violence. It is a  cause of the grief that we are seeing today and feeling in Uvalde and  Buffalo and so many other cities across America.   We see it over and over again. A tragedy happens, a gunman is  identified, and what do we learn? Then we learn that they showed all  sorts of dangerous behavior and telltale signs of violence long before  becoming a mass shooter, a murderer, killing animals, making threats,  threatening words, self-harm, cutting themselves--the list goes on and  on; mental health issues that should have been addressed long before  they became an active shooter.   Madam Speaker, but people don't want to talk about that in the wake  of a tragedy. The fact is, we already have the tools to deal with these  individuals once they are identified. We have the tools to stop these  horrific events before they happen. One of the things, as sheriff, I  used to tell my officers all the time is I don't want to be the best  first responder to a mass casualty event. I want to prevent it before  it occurs.   Madam Speaker, I saw firsthand, countless times, when people were a  danger, we stopped them before they could hurt others. We put them in  jail. We arrested them for making threats. We identified them and we  identified the threats that they were making, and we stopped them from  acting on those threats.   The challenge here, we must focus on identifying those who are a  human threat to themselves and others and then intervene. Too many  times after all of these events, we hear that conversation: Oh, I knew  this guy. I am not surprised.    Those are the conversations that we hear afterwards. We must identify  those suffering from severe mental illness and formally adjudicate them  so they cannot buy a firearm. That law already exists. We need to start  adjudicating those who are mentally ill and a danger.   And let me say this: Everyone that has a mental illness is not a  danger. Many people suffer mental illness and are not a danger. But  those that are, we need to adjudicate them as such so that they can't  go down and buy a firearm. Those laws are already on the books, but our  community must do a better job of identifying those who need help and  then get them the services and treatment that they need and deserve.   We could do this while also upholding basic due process rights. Our  whole judicial process system is based on the assumption that people  are innocent until proven guilty. But the ex-parte order issued through  these red flag laws throws these fundamental rights out the window.   Red flag laws take away a person's Second Amendment rights and a  lower evidentiary standard without the opportunity to even defend  themselves in court. Ex-parte is almost a secretive process. It is  going on without the accused's knowledge. And we see how well the ex- parte process worked in the FISA courts, didn't we?   The reason our judicial system works is because it is adversarial. We  have people on both sides of the issue who are fighting it out in  court, discussing the facts. Ex-parte, you hear one side of the story.  That is all. And they want to use that to take away your Second  Amendment rights. Then once deprived of those rights, now we have to  prove that we are innocent.   This is backwards and ineffective at solving our violence problem.  Before we quickly jump to pass bad legislation--like we just passed  this afternoon--let's do a better job of enforcing the laws that are  already on our books.   Before we rehash the same talking points and debate partisan  messaging bills, let's work together on the areas where we need change.  Let's work together to bolster our mental health system so we can  better identify people suffering from mental illness and adjudicate  them if they are a danger and provide them the treatment they need and  deserve.                                time  1200    Let's work together to strengthen penalties for those who steal and  traffic in firearms. Let's work together to secure our schools and make  sure that our kids have a safe place to learn.   The STOP School Violence Act of 2018, which was signed into law by  President Trump, when we drafted the language for that bill, the first  concern that I had was identification of those who are a threat, and  that is the first part of that law.   The second part of that law now is CPTED, crime prevention through  environmental design, how we can stop those who may be coming to our  schools to commit violence.   Let's work together to identify the signs of dangerous behavior and  prevent these acts of violence before they even happen.
