 Mr. President, I want the record to reflect my  concerns about the nominations of Jackie Wolcott to be the U.S.  Representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, and the  U.S. Representative to the Vienna office of the United Nations. For  family health reasons, I was unable to cast a vote in relation to her  nomination. However, while Ambassador Wolcott is well-regarded for her  recent work at the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom,  the U.S. Representative to the IAEA must bring impartiality and a focus  on the technical aspects of the job. In the past, Ambassador Wolcott  has spoken publicly and forcefully on IAEA compliance issues, and I  have concerns that reconciling those past statements with the current  demands of the IAEA will be difficult. For that reason, had I been able  to cast a vote, I would have voted against the nominations.                            ____________________
