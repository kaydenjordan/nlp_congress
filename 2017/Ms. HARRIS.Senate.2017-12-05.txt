 Mr. President, I would like to thank the senior Senator  from Illinois. Senator Durbin has been a longstanding leader in this  Chamber and in our country on this issue, and I can't thank him enough  for all he does so tirelessly. I see his work behind closed doors, and  I know his passion and personal commitment to this issue. I thank the  Senator from Illinois.   Mr. President, on February 16 of this year, which was 292 days ago, I  offered my maiden speech as a new Member of the U.S. Senate. The  subject of the speech was immigration--in particular, an emphasis on  DACA and the Dreamers. Here we are 292 days later, and we have failed  to move forward in any substantial or substantive way in bringing  relief to these Dreamers who have qualified for DACA status. So we  stand here, these 292 days later, talking about an issue that we must  ultimately, and before the end of this year, resolve.   Let's also be clear that 3 months ago today, on September 5 of this  year, the administration arbitrarily, recklessly, and cruelly ended  DACA--the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program. DACA allowed  young immigrants who were brought here by their parents to live and  work in this country without fear that they would be deported. Later  this week, on Friday, December 8, funding for the government runs out.  I have been clear, along with my friend from Illinois and several other  colleagues, that any bill that funds the government must also include a  fix for DACA.   I want to talk with you about why I believe it is important that we  resolve this issue. I do believe there is a lot of misinformation out  there. I think it is important that we as policymakers, as leaders in  our country, craft and create public policy based on facts, not on  misinformation and certainly not fear.   Let's begin by being very clear. The decision to rescind DACA is part  of a much broader and troubling attempt to remake the demographics of  the country by cracking down on immigrants. We have an administration  that has ignited anti-immigrant sentiment, characterizing immigrants as  rapists and murderers and people who are going to steal your jobs. We  have an administration that has implemented an aggressive anti- immigrant agenda. This administration has called for a border wall that  could cost up to $70 billion. They have implemented Muslim bans which  severely restrict immigration from six Muslim-majority countries. They  have requested 10,000 new ICE agents and 5,000 new Border Patrol agents  when they have not given the resources to be able to fill all the  vacant positions they now have. They have ended the protected  immigration status, known as TPS, for Haitians and Nicaraguans who fled  disasters and may crack down on the protective status on Salvadorans as  well. They are seeking to lower the refugee cap from 110,000 to 45,000  at a time when we have seen an increase in the worldwide number of  refugees who are in crisis. This is the lowest number ever in the  history of this country--actually, since 1980. Gen. John Kelly, the  President's Chief of Staff and former Homeland Security Secretary, said  that he wishes the number of refugees we would admit into our country  were between zero and one.    I want to be clear. I have an incredible amount of respect for the  men and women of the Department of Homeland Security, who each day  leave their homes, committed to doing the work of keeping our homeland  secure. It is noble and important work, and their mission is critical.  I believe the vast majority of those frontline agents are doing their  jobs honorably and effectively, but it is troubling when the White  House has encouraged frontline agents to ``take the shackles off.'' In  fact, the Acting ICE Director has said:         If you're an immigrant in this country illegally . . . you       should be uncomfortable. You should look over your shoulder.    When you look at these independent acts, there is a clear  constellation that has formed. This enforcement surge is a barely  disguised purge. This is not leadership. Leaders should not be in the  business of inciting fear and sowing hate and division. Instead,  leaders should be about creating smart public policy based on facts. So  here are some of the facts.   It is a fact that there are 700,000 DACA recipients, 200,000 of whom  are in California alone.   It is a fact that the Dreamers have been extensively vetted before  they have qualified for DACA. They have gone through a process. They  have turned over copious amounts of paperwork with incredible detail.  They have gone through background checks. They have given personal  information about the circumstances of their arrivals. They have  answered questions that seek to figure out whether they have committed  crimes. If they applied and they received DACA status, we determined  that they were not threats in that regard to our public safety. We  asked questions that sought to figure out if they have graduated high  school. Are they living lawful and productive lives? It is only when  they cleared that extensive vetting that they qualified for DACA status  and received DACA status.   Let's be clear. These Dreamers who receive DACA status study in our  colleges, serve in our military, and work in Fortune 100 companies.  They are contributing to our economy in a way that we all are  benefiting. If DACA recipients were to be deported, it is estimated  that California would lose $11 billion a year. The U.S. economy as a  whole would lose an estimated $460 billion over a decade.   It is also a fact that these young people have stood in classrooms  and stood in line in many places and have placed their hands over their  hearts, pledging allegiance to the flag of the United States--a flag  that many of us wear on our lapels, a flag that represents the best of  what we are in terms of the ideals upon which we were founded. We must  be true to those ideals and consistent in the way that we approach so  many issues as applied to this issue about what we do with these DACA  kids. We must keep our word and our promise to them and guarantee what  we promised, which is that we would not share their personal  information with ICE and that they would not be deported if they  continued to follow the rules.   In my experience, it is also true that many who have opinions or who  have expressed opinions or who have the opportunity to make decisions  about this issue have never met a Dreamer. We cannot fault them, but  what we can ask is that those who have the power to make a decision on  this issue make it their business and make an effort to really  understand who we are talking about. Senator Durbin talked about it,  and Senator Carper talked about it. My colleagues will be talking about  who these Dreamers are, who these young people are.   I have to say that I have been a bit troubled when I have had this  conversation. I remember when I had a conversation many months ago with  the then-nominee to head up the Department of Homeland Security, Gen.  John Kelly. I asked him if he had ever  [[Page S7855]]  met a Dreamer, and he said that he had not. When I asked him if I could  arrange a meeting, he then went on to say: How about if I could take a  meeting, instead, with their representatives? That is disheartening.   Before our colleagues make a decision about where they stand on this  policy, I believe that it is only fair--it is only the right thing to  do--that they make an effort to sit down and talk with Dreamers and get  to understand who they are, the circumstances of their arrivals, and  how they are contributing to our country.   There are going to be hundreds of Dreamers here tomorrow on Capitol  Hill. I want to thank them for their leadership and their tireless  advocacy because their stories will change hearts and minds. Let me  just speak of a few. My colleagues have shared some; I will share some  others.   I met Yuriana Aguilar, whom I took to the President's joint session  address this February. Her parents brought her here from Mexico when  she was just 5 years old. She grew up in Fresno, CA. She attended  public schools, and she attended UC Merced. She was the first DACA  recipient to earn a Ph.D. and now is a biomedical researcher in Chicago  who is focused on the human heart. She is doing everything that she can  to improve the condition and the lives of the people in our country  because of the work she has done and the research she has done.   I met Eric Yang, who came from South Korea. He grew up in Irvine, CA,  and is now studying business economics at UC Irvine, where he works to  help other students.   My husband and I recently attended a play in Los Angeles. It is a  great program at which there is free entertainment in the community  park, and families show up and have a wonderful evening outdoors with  each other in fellowship. I met a young woman who came up to me. She  was with a group of friends.   Her friends said: Tell her. Tell her.   I looked at this young woman. She looked as if she was about maybe 19  years old.   I said: Tell me what? Tell me what is going on.   She looked at me, and she spoke so quietly that I didn't hear what  she had said, so I asked her to repeat herself. She looked at me, and  she started crying.   She said: I am DACA.   She was trembling as she cried, absolutely in fear of what her future  may hold.   I suggest that before we take a position on this issue, we take a  moment, each one of us as colleagues and each one of us as individuals,  to see these young people, to truly see them--to see them not through a  lens that is about partisanship or politics, not through a lens that is  ideological, but based on who they really are and the practical  realities of the lives they lived that brought them to this country,  the circumstances that brought them to this country, and the lives they  are living every day now.   These are incredible young people who are doing everything that we  hope and pray will epitomize the American dream--work hard, be  respectful, play by the rules, contribute to your community, have  dreams and aspirations about how you can be productive. That is who  these young people are.   Let's reject the fearmongering. Let's also understand that this is an  imminent issue and that this is something we must address immediately.  Let's agree that each day in the lives of these young people is a very  long time. Each day that they go to sleep at night and are worried  about a knock on the door at midnight that might tear them away from  their families is a very long time. Let's not wait. Let's not wait to  help them.   Let's reject those folks who say that there is no crisis, the folks  who say that this is not an emergency. Let's understand that for these  700,000 Dreamers who cannot concentrate at school or at work and who  are terrified of that midnight knock, this is an emergency. Let's think  about the classmates and the coworkers and our neighbors and family  members who have these children who are terrified that this protected  status will be stripped and taken away. For them, this is an emergency.   Let's think about the 122 Dreamers who are losing their DACA status  every single day, 851 of them every week, over 11,000 of them since  September. Let's agree that this is a crisis, that this is an  emergency. It has been 91 days since this administration ended DACA,  and we cannot wait a single day longer.   Let's reject the fearmongering. Let's find a bipartisan consensus to  act in the way that we know we should and can. Let's put the Dream Act  to a vote today. I believe it could pass and would pass if everyone  looked in their hearts and looked at the facts.   Today, 35 House Republicans signed a letter, writing that they want a  DACA fix before the end of the year. It included Members from  California and Texas and Florida and Utah and Pennsylvania and New  York. Earlier today, my colleague, the junior Senator from Arizona,  said:         We don't need to make a statement. We need to make a law.    I could not agree more. Let's give these Dreamers a future.   I yield the floor.
