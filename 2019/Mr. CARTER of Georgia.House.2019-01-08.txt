 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the  life of Mr. Johnny Murphy, who passed away on December 19 at the age of  63.   When Mr. Murphy passed, he was serving as the mayor pro tem of  Richmond Hill in Georgia's First Congressional District. However, this  is far from the only way that he served his community. Without his  effort and dedication to the area, Richmond Hill likely wouldn't be  where it is today.   In 1984, Mr. Murphy started a real estate company called the Richmond  Hill Land Company, when the town was much smaller and didn't yet have a  red light. Since then, he started the Richmond Hill-Bryan County  Chamber of Commerce, Richmond Hill Reflections magazine, and served on  the city council and as mayor pro tem. Now the city has grown to have  multiple neighborhoods and something for everyone to do, including one  of the largest festivals in the area, the Richmond Hill Seafood  Festival.   I am proud to have had someone in our district who can make an impact  like that of Mr. Murphy. His family will be in my thoughts and prayers  during this difficult time.                            ____________________
