 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Pride Month  for the good people of west Michigan.   Even as we celebrate this month as a time of joy, allowing  individuals to be their authentic selves, it has been marked by  communications from back home about the challenges and direct harm  individuals face just for being a member of the LGBTQ community. Far,  far too often, this harm is inflicted directly and intentionally in the  name of God.   West Michigan has not had a countervoice in Congress, but they do  now. I rise today as a lawmaker to express my commitment to championing  freedom and justice for all in this country. I also rise today as a  woman of deep and unwavering faith to reaffirm the equality that we all  experience as precious human beings created with love, with joy, in the  image and likeness of God. No scheme of man can change that.   To all of you in west Michigan who have felt unseen, unheard, or,  even worse, bullied, this statement in the Congressional Record is for  you. My votes are for you. My presence here on the House floor is for  you.    We are bending the arc toward justice, toward inclusion, toward  equality. Happy Pride.                            ____________________
