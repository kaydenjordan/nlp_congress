 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Chairman McGovern) for yielding me the customary 30  minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we are here on a bill that represents one of the most  fundamental roles of the United States Congress, and that is to fund  the government, and to keep it open.   This continuing resolution ensures critical government funding will  remain in place through December 20. While short-term measures are  never ideal, this extension of funding is necessary to ensure that the  House and the Senate can continue to negotiate and reach agreement on a  full-year appropriation for fiscal year 2020.   As Members of Congress, we are obligated each year to pass  legislation that funds the government and keeps it open so that it can  continue to provide services that many of our constituents are counting  on. With today's bill, we ensure that the government remains open until  December 20, which will give Congress time to reach an agreement  funding the entire government for the rest of the fiscal year.    This continuing resolution not only maintains government funding, but  it also rightly extends authorizations for some key programs that  otherwise would expire, programs like community health centers, a  special diabetes program, and the special diabetes program for Native  Americans. And we are also adding an adjustment to raise pay for our  members of the armed services by 3.1 percent.   Even though it is good news that we are preventing a government  shutdown with this continuing resolution--as my friend knows, I  certainly plan to support it when it comes to the floor--today's  measure sadly represents a missed opportunity for the House of  Representatives. The fact that we are here today on our second  continuing resolution of this fiscal year is a reminder that Congress  is not getting its work done, at least when it comes to appropriations.   Last year, despite the fact that we were in the midst of an election  cycle, Congress still managed to get appropriations bills covering 80  percent of full-year spending passed into law by the start of the  fiscal year. Today, by contrast, we have passed exactly zero  appropriations bills into law, despite being almost 2 months into the  fiscal year.   This state of affairs is disappointing, and while I recognize that  this is certainly not entirely the fault of the House of  Representatives, we still have yet to pass all 12 bills out of our own  House. The job won't get any closer to completion until we pass all 12  appropriations bills for this fiscal year. The American people deserve  no less from us and our full attention on this pressing matter.   Again, I share my friend's frustration at this process, but I am  actually somewhat optimistic that in the next 30 days we can get that  job done and get out of this cycle of continuing resolutions and  actually have a fully functional government with 12 appropriations  bills. Certainly, I intend to work to achieve that aim. I know my  friend and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on the  Appropriations Committee will do that, and I sincerely hope we can be  successful.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, but support for the  underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I urge opposition to the rule. And while I am encouraged that we are  considering a continuing resolution to keep the government open and  operating until December 20, our work for this fiscal year is not done.  It is not going to be done until we pass all 12 appropriations bills  into law.   While the House is focused on other areas, we have neglected some of  our key responsibilities in both Chambers, quite frankly, for funding  the government for fiscal year 2020. Our constituents demand that we  get our job done.   So, Mr. Speaker, again, I reiterate my commitment. I know the  commitment of my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, on both  sides of the aisle, to work diligently to come to an agreement so we  can we can bring before this body compromised legislation between a  Republican Senate and  [[Page H8969]]  a Democratic House, legislation that we can all, frankly, send to the  President with a great deal of pride. This underlying legislation gives  us the time to do that.   I thank my friend for cooperating, and I look forward to working with  him on that measure, as well as the eventual completion of the  appropriations process.   So, Mr. Speaker, while I oppose the rule, I support the underlying  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
