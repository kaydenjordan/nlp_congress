 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the ongoing baby  formula crisis and urge my colleagues to support the Formula Act.   I raised two kids, and I know the first months of parenthood are  tiring and stressful, even in the best of situations.   Now, families across the country are in a dire position as they try  to find the formula that they need to feed their babies.   Around the country, 74 percent of formula shelves are empty. In my  home State of Washington, we are one of 10 States where over 90 percent  of shelves are empty.   Severely stretched supply chains and a major formula plant going  offline have left shelves barren. Unreliable formula supply is a  critical problem for families. Parents are driving hours to multiple  different stores just to find any formula, and that is time that  parents don't have.   Changing formulas constantly is also disruptive to babies. It causes  digestive problems and excessive crying.   Jessie, a mom in my district, has been struggling to find formula for  her infant daughter, Amara. She is not one to ask for help, but when  she was running low on her last can, Jessie joined a local social media  group where other parents would post where they saw formula on shelves,  and she downloaded an app that would notify her when more cans were  available. Jessie was able to find formula, but she realizes that she  is one of the lucky parents who had the means, the time, and the  network to support Amara.   By removing tariffs on foreign formula that meets FDA's safety  standards, the Formula Act will make it easier and more affordable for  parents to feed their babies so fewer are finding themselves in this  difficult situation. This is a commonsense solution, so let's make it  happen.
