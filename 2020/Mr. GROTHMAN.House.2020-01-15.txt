 Mr. Speaker, as I understand it, some of my friends up  here should have more interesting things to say, so I yield to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), who is my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Wilson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Biggs), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Davidson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I will address a few topics tonight, but  before I start on these other topics, I, as well, will address the  March for Life.   As has been mentioned, we are dealing with the 47th anniversary of  Roe v. Wade. Hopefully, over 200,000 people will be here in Washington  next week, and I feel bad it is a week where we are doing our work back  in the district so I won't be able to be here for it.   It is still kind of amazing that, in 1973, I think it was seven out  of nine judges, which is kind of a bad testimony to the law schools of  this Nation, felt that when our forefathers put together the  Constitution, they felt that it, of necessity, made abortion legal in  this country. I am sure they were not talking about it at all at the  time, and throughout much of our history, abortion has been legal in  the vast majority of States.   At the time that Roe v. Wade came down, I believe abortion was  illegal in 48 of the 50 States. If not, it was almost 48 States, and it  was just an outlandish decision.   Since the decision has come down, we have had over 45 million lives  cut short because of abortion in this country. When you think about 45  million, think how large that is. If they were alive today, it would be  something on the order of about one-seventh of the current population  of this country. But our people have voluntarily snuffed out that many  lives.   I remember when ultrasounds came out and became common. I had assumed  that when people began to look at ultrasounds, they would see what they  were dealing with here and abortion would have quickly become illegal.                                time  1930    It says something about the callousness of our country and the  ineffectiveness of our clergy that, despite the gift of ultrasound--so,  unlike 60 years ago, we all know exactly what is going on--our country  continues to allow this slaughter to continue.   Even worse, America, which I do believe should be a shining light on  the hill, is one of only seven countries which allow late-term  abortions: ourselves, Singapore, Canada, Holland, Red China, Vietnam,  and North Korea--largely, a pretty embarrassing set of countries to be  with.   I hope all Americans stop and ponder how America still winds up on  such a ridiculous list, particularly such a wealthy country and a  country in which so many people have access to see exactly what is  going on.   As a matter of fact, recently, things have even gotten worse. I am  sure my colleagues have talked about the bill recently signed into law  in New York, which, in essence, a goal appears to be to allow you to  snuff out the life of a newborn baby right before it is born. There is  danger that a similar law is soon going to pass in Virginia.   I challenge the clergy in this country. And I know some of them don't  like to say uncomfortable truths, apparently, but I challenge them to  do something here.   Somebody just mentioned the movie ``Gosnell,'' and there is another  movie, ``Unplanned.'' I think these are movies that would be wise for  the clergy in this country to make sure people were aware of so they  saw exactly what was going on.   Obviously, what we have here is kind of a silent ending of millions  of lives. Most people do not know it is going on. It doesn't affect  them on a daily basis. But it is time for the clergy and churches of  this country to step up to the plate.   I wish well for all the people who are going to come from all over  the country and attend the March for Life.                             Knights of Columbus     Mr. Speaker, there are other things I am going to  address right now, one a little bit related. I  [[Page H290]]  would like to talk a little bit about the Knights of Columbus.   We live in a society that claims to value diversity and tolerance;  however, sometimes things bubble up in this town. It is apparent that  some people are hated and the intolerance applies to them.   I am speaking, of course, of the fact that, about 2 years ago, a  little over 2 years ago now, a U.S. Senator from California, in part of  a confirmation hearing on a Federal judge, decided to weigh in and felt  that, if you were a member of the Knights of Columbus, perhaps you  shouldn't become a Federal judge.   Recently, rereading the statements made there and the lack of outrage  at what, apparently, was a religious test, or close to a religious  test, to become a Federal judge, I thought I would like to talk a  little bit about the Knights of Columbus, which is very active in my  district.   The Knights were founded as a Catholic group in 1882, in Connecticut,  and, currently, there are about 2 million Knights, almost exclusive to  the United States, but there are also some in Canada, New Zealand,  England--or Britain--and a few other countries.   They have been active during that time, and they do a lot to help  people. They seem almost ubiquitous in my district with all the  fundraisers they have.   A few weeks ago, I attended a meat raffle for the Princeton Knights  of Columbus in which they were helping out a Vietnam veteran who had  cancer.   I want to point out that the Knights will help out not just Catholic  people, but people who aren't Catholic as well.   The Princeton Knights were also doing a chili fundraiser to help a  gentleman with prostate cancer.   Other groups I see around, can be seen: the Cedarburg Knights selling  Tootsie Rolls for Special Olympics or pregnancy health centers; the  Fond du Lac Knights having fish fries for youth hockey and handicapped  children.   You see the Neenah Knights running concession stands at the Packers  games, the Mayville Knights doing a calendar fundraiser for the local  food pantry, the Oshkosh Knights doing a bowling fundraiser for coats  for kids, or Men for Christ. I mean, you see the good works that the  Knights are doing everywhere.   I wish I had time to go through all the other organizations and list  exactly the fundraisers they have. The Two Rivers, Manitowoc,  Sheboygan, Fredonia, Horicon, wherever I go, I see the Knights are  active helping people out.   I always kind of consider the Knights of Columbus kind of like mom  and apple pie. You know, you could stand here in Congress, and  Congressmen would go out of their way to praise groups like the Knights  of Columbus and be seen with the Knights of Columbus.   But, apparently, they are not so much like mom and apple pie anymore.  We have had Members of this body, and not from small, insignificant  States, Members of this body apparently now feeling that that is  something to be attacked for. And, of course, it is not.   They are helping out at the Special Olympics or helping out at youth  hockey that has caused them to be hated or feel that they shouldn't be  part of the public square. It is, of course, that they are active in  the Catholic church, a church that is pro-life, that apparently some  Members around here feel that the Knights of Columbus, therefore,  should step aside and can't be trusted to make decisions as far as  where we are going in the United States of America.   Recently, Joe Biden came out, actually, and even said that the  Senator from California would make a great Vice President. I mean, can  you imagine that?   Can you imagine, 40 years ago, in this country, somebody saying that  the Knights of Columbus, that a member of the Knights maybe shouldn't  be a Federal judge?   That is a great thing she says. Let's make her a Vice President. I  think that is a great thing.   In any event, speaking on behalf of myself, I would like to thank the  Knights for all they do around the Sixth Congressional District. I hope  they continue to speak out on Christian issues, on Catholic issues.    I hope the other clergy, clergy who may not be Catholic themselves,  realize that they could be next to be targeted by these Members of  Congress. But, again, I thank the Knights of Columbus for all they do.   Mr. Speaker, I guess I have a few minutes more here. I have, what, 5  more minutes?    Mr. Speaker, we spent a lot of time up here, too much  time on this impeachment thing. I think the reason people want to talk  about impeachment is they don't like to talk about all the things that  ought to be getting done that Congress isn't doing when they are  talking about impeachment.   I want to, one more time, talk about what I think is the number one  issue that is going to destroy America, and that is the immigration  situation. We continue to have people come across the border.   President Trump, on his own, has dropped the number of people coming  in this country from over 50,000 allowed in this country and placed in  this country last May to under 1,000 by the Border Patrol in December.   Nevertheless, laws should be changed quickly to make sure that this  does not continue, or should be changed quickly before some of these  Federal judges decide to stop President Trump from trying to do what he  is doing.   The Congress should be brought in to change the credible fear  standard to make sure everybody under the Sun can't say that they  should be a refugee.   We want to change the laws with regard to the Traffic Victim  Protection Reparations Act. Right now, so people understand, if we get  somebody under age 18 from Canada or Mexico--from Canada or Mexico--we  can send them back; from other countries, we are forced to keep  families apart.   I know President Trump would desperately like to return a minor from  Honduras or Venezuela or Cuba back to their parents, but right now he  is forbidden from doing that because Congress refuses to act.   We should be cracking down on welfare for illegal immigrants right  now, which serves as an inducement for the most irresponsible of people  to come to the United States, but Congress doesn't act.   We have built, or we are soon going to build, 100 miles toward the  wall, but we still need more money. We hope we have enough money to get  to 450 miles by the end of the year. But that is not going to be  enough, particularly when you consider that, right now, the DEA thinks  that 95 percent of the fentanyl, cocaine, heroin, or meth in this  country is coming across our borders.   I will guarantee you there are people who are going back to their  districts next week and, at their townhalls, are claiming that they  care about the over 60,000 people who died last year from these drugs,  but they aren't doing anything to enforce that border where 95 percent  of these drugs--fentanyl, cocaine, heroin, and meth--are coming are  cross.   It is time we act there, as well. We need more money for what we call  nonintrusive technology so we can determine when these drugs are coming  across in cars or otherwise, as well as it would be a good thing to get  more dogs.   I have been down at the border myself and seen how effective they are  at preventing these drugs from coming across that are killing so many  people.   In any event, I hope the rest of the public and our mainstream media,  as well as our conservative media, don't fall apart and don't fall into  the trap of being all impeachment all the time over the next 3 or 4  months.   Remember all the people who are dying because of the drugs coming  across the border. Remember the huge burden on the United States as  more people come across the border for things such as welfare-type  benefits, and imagine what type of future America has if we don't begin  to enforce our laws.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
