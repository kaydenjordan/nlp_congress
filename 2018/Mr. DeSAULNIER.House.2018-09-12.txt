 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   First, I would like to thank the Contra Costa Water District and the  Bureau of Reclamation for their support and guidance in putting this  bill together. I would also like to thank Senators Feinstein and Harris  for carrying this bill in the Senate.   The bill transfers ownership of the Contra Costa Canal from the  Bureau of Reclamation to the Contra Costa Water District.                                time  1930    The Contra Costa Water District currently operates and maintains the  canal system as part of its infrastructure for providing water to half  a million people. However, the Bureau of Reclamation still owns the  canal, which it began building in 1937.   The transfer of the canal to local ownership will allow Contra Costa  Water District to invest in much-needed upgrades, repairs, and to  provide safety and environmental benefits to its customers.   Contra Costa Water District intends to invest an estimated $650  million to enclose the pipe, which will mitigate flood risk to the  surrounding community, extend the useful life of this infrastructure  for another 80 years, and prevent drownings, which currently average  about one per year.   I appreciate that the Contra Costa Water District has conducted  extensive outreach for the local communities and has broad support in  the district.   This bill also acknowledges an agreement with the East Bay Regional  Park District, which will continue to maintain important recreational  opportunities along the canal.   In closing, I would like to thank Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member  Grijalva for their support in moving this legislation forward that will  have enormous benefits for our community.
