 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 409, I call  up the bill (H.R. 3237) making emergency supplemental appropriations  for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2021, and for other purposes,  and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Emergency Security  Supplemental to Respond to January 6th Appropriations Act.   Like many of us in the Capitol community, I am still shaken by the  violence and terror of that day and the tragedies in its aftermath: the  death of Officer Brian Sicknick, the Good Friday attack that killed  Officer Billy Evans, and the emotional trauma that has led to the  deaths of Officer Howie Liebengood and Metropolitan Police Department  Officer Jeffrey Smith by suicide.   Congress owes it to every single person who works in or visits the  United States Capitol to provide funding to recover, rebuild, and keep  all who serve in the legislative branch safe, healthy, and secure.   The Appropriations Committee has acted very carefully to construct  this package. We conducted a bipartisan briefing in January, discussed  the issue at 12 subcommittee hearings, and closely reviewed the  recommendations of Task Force 1-6 Capitol Security Review, led by  Lieutenant General Russel Honore and comprised of senior, retired law  enforcement officials and military leaders. We have also heard from  inspectors general and consulted security experts in and out of  government.   This bill is narrowly tailored to respond to January 6 and to protect  the Capitol going forward. It contains $1.9 billion in emergency  funding to reimburse the National Guard and District of Columbia for  their response; provide the Capitol Police with overtime pay, retention  bonuses, equipment replacement, and wellness and trauma support;  ensures the Department of Justice can prosecute every person who  attacked law enforcement and ransacked this building; provides bonuses  and help to custodial staff; and it renames the Capitol Police Wellness  Center in the memory of Officer Howie Liebengood.   As recommended by the Capitol Security Review, this legislation  protects the Capitol by providing resources to harden windows and  doors; construct security screening vestibules; install new cameras;  and provide specialized training, riot control equipment, and body  cameras for the Capitol Police.   To augment the Capitol Police, the legislation establishes and funds  a dedicated quick reaction force of National Guard personnel, another  recommendation of the Capitol Security Review.   This legislation also bolsters security for Members of Congress, with  dedicated funding for enhanced security and threat assessments,  coordinated Member travel security, and upgrades to security in  district offices.   It has, most importantly, won the endorsement of the Capitol Police,  to meet its evolving mission, and Lieutenant General Honore urged  Congress to pass this funding.   We all sit in this Chamber, and we lived with the violent assault on  our democracy and our lives. We must act now to fulfill our obligations  and also our oath of office.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Roybal-Allard), the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on  Homeland Security.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I respectfully say to the gentlewoman from Washington State that the  situation we face is dire. The Capitol Police do not have the equipment  they need to secure the Capitol, and other security vulnerabilities  have not been resolved.  [[Page H2623]]    Also, the Capitol Police force is reeling as January 6, the deaths of  Officers Liebengood and Evans, overtime, and other issues continue to  take a toll on officers' mental health. We cannot wait until the report  of a commission.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Ryan), the chairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Ohio.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Ohio.    Madam Speaker, I am happy to respond to the gentlewoman  from Washington State, but, quite frankly, that is an issue that falls  within the jurisdiction of the House Administration Committee. The  chair is Zoe Lofgren. It is my understanding that Chairman Lofgren is,  in fact, addressing that issue.   I concur that we have to deal with the issue of the Capitol board,  but it does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Appropriations  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I just want to remind the gentleman that the last time a supplemental  bill was brought before the Appropriations Committee was in 2009, under  the direction of Chairman David Obey.   I also want to make a point that it did take an inordinate amount of  time for reinforcements to come and assist the overrun Capitol Police.  To have that not happen again, the Capitol security review, General  Honore recommended a dedicated force ready to respond to any incident,  just as we have the D.C. Air National Guard, which has a mission to  protect the region's airspace.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms.  Pingree), the chair of the Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and  Related Agencies.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  [[Page H2625]]  Illinois (Mr. Quigley), the chairman of the Financial Services and  General Government Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), the chairperson of the Committee on House  Administration.    I yield the gentlewoman from California an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I would hope the gentlewoman from  Washington State would put her frustration aside--we all get frustrated  in this body by so many things--and vote to support the folks who took  care of us that day to deal with their backpay and a variety of other  issues that were important.    I yield to the gentlewoman from California.    Madam Speaker, the point is, we are reimbursing the  costs that were incurred that day.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Stanton).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me just try to address a couple of issues that have been raised  here during this debate.   Madam Speaker, I want to recount the Committee on Appropriations has  worked for months to gather information to inform this bill. There were  12 subcommittee hearings. Actually, legislative branch, as the  gentlewoman from Washington State knows, had at least eight hearings,  and every subcommittee held more than one committee hearing.   In addition to that, other committees, House Administration,  Committee on Oversight Reform, all had hearings with regard to this  issue and the path forward. Beginning in April, Committee on  Appropriations engaged in intense good-faith negotiations with our  Republican counterparts. And unfortunately, it appears, I believe, that  the leadership has prevented them from reaching an agreement in a  timely manner.   Madam Speaker, I would just mention that the minority leader, he  looked to sufficient time included in an end-of-the-year funding bill  to strengthen the security of the Capitol complex. So in truth, the  view was not to do it, not to continue in negotiation, but in fact, to  delay a decision on this until the end of the year. We cannot wait in  order to be able to effectuate security of this Capitol for all who  work here and all who visit here.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Wexton), a member of the Committee on Appropriations.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House of Representatives.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Espaillat), a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I am disappointed that the gentlewoman from Washington State will not  find her way to vote for the bill. We have worked on many issues  together on the Appropriations Committee, yes, in fact, in meetings  about the Capitol Police Board and other efforts. As it has been  stated, we worked for months on the Appropriations Committee with  numerous hearings in order to be able to engage on a bipartisan basis.   Unfortunately, the leadership of the minority leader, I believe, saw  that the direction that this bill should go in is in the end of the  year. In that case, we cannot begin to fix the problems that occurred.   Madam Speaker, I remember January 6, as we all do. I sat in the  Gallery. I sat right up there as we counted the electoral votes, which  was our constitutional duty, in order to certify the election of the  President of the United States.   I was here, at the podium, when the Capitol policeman said, The  rioters have breached the Capitol. They are in the rotunda. They are on  their way to the House Chamber, to those doors right there, those doors  that were shattered and smashed that day, and where there were  barricades that were put up against it.                                time  1030    We were told to grab a gas mask. I didn't know we had gas masks here.  We did that, and no sooner than that, we were told we have to evacuate,  you make your way.   I can still trace my steps around the perimeter of this gallery, all  the way around, going underneath these barriers here. All of us,  Democrats, Republicans, and members of the press who were there that  day, and young people who came here to work, we were together. We were  holding on to one another because we knew there was imminent danger.   I won't ever forget us getting around to that side of the gallery  when the Capitol Police said to hit the floor because of gunshots-- gunshots. We all hit the floor, Democrats and Republicans, at the order  of the Capitol Police, to protect us from what was going on that day.   As I lay on the floor with very little juice in my cell phone, I  called my husband. I didn't want to say to him, ``I love you,'' because  it brought back to me the remembrance of 9/11 and those last words that  people uttered. I just said: ``I am fine. I am going to be evacuated.  Call the kids and let them know it is okay.''   This bill is not about politics. It is not about settling scores. It  is about ensuring that every person who comes onto the Capitol Grounds  is safe and is protected.   The funding is not optional. This vote is not a show vote. It is  about protecting the seat of democracy and the men, the women, and the  young people who work here.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and pass  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
