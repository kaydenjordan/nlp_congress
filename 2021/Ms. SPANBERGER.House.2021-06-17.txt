 Madam Speaker, on October 16, 2002, the United States  Congress voted to authorize military action against Saddam Hussein's  Iraq. The text of the authorization was clear. That was its purpose.  Years later, Saddam Hussein is long dead, and our military action has  ended.   The 2002 AUMF is separate and distinct from the 2001 AUMF, which  authorized our counterterrorism efforts after 9/11 and which remains in  use today.   The 2002 AUMF is not in use. It is long overdue for repeal, which is  why we have voted multiple times to repeal the 2002 AUMF with  bipartisan support.   Since coming to Congress, I have been very clear, Congress must  reassert congressional authority in decisions of war and peace. The  authority is required by our Constitution, and it is fundamental to our  representation of our constituents, especially our servicemembers.   Our men and women in uniform deserve to see a new era of  congressional accountability, one where Members of Congress do not  shirk their accountability when it comes to issues of war and peace.
