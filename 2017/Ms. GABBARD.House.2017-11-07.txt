 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my fellow veteran and  friend and colleague from Minnesota for being such a strong advocate on  this issue. I also thank our friends on the other side of the aisle who  have been pushing this issue forward constantly year after year, as we  will continue to do so until this issue is resolved.   So many of our servicemembers have selflessly put their lives on the  line to protect and defend our country. Our country owes them a debt of  gratitude, something we are often reminded of every year around this  time as we head into Veterans Day.   Unfortunately, too often, our fellow servicemembers are coming home  and they are being prevented from receiving the care that they have  earned through their service. They bear the brunt of the human cost of  war with an average of 20 veterans committing suicide every single day.  Their families carry this sacrifice and this cost throughout their  lives.   The rate of mental health and substance use disorders has been  steadily rising since 2001. This legislation is bipartisan and would  require the VA to provide urgent mental healthcare services, including  an initial mental health assessment to veterans who have participated  in combat operations or who have survived sexual assault or harassment.   It would also expand those services to those who received a discharge  under certain other than honorable conditions who haven't received the  character of service or discharge determination yet.   We have heard already about the high numbers of veterans who fall  into this category and about how negatively this discharge has affected  their lives. When they come home, they are working on their transition  to a successful civilian life. This discharge takes away their access  to healthcare. It takes away their access to services and benefits that  they have earned through, many times, multiple deployments, services  that are in place to help set our veterans up for success upon their  return home.   In addition, this bill would require the VA to provide services at  non-VA facilities for veterans who live in rural or underserved  communities.                                time  1500    I can't state enough how important this is because it affects those  veterans in my district, and on different islands in the State of  Hawaii, who are separated literally by a body of water from the VA  clinic.   The Veteran Urgent Access to Mental Healthcare Act would also mandate  the VA to provide additional information for mental health services for  veterans and to ensure that they provide annual reports to Congress on  those services that they have been providing to our veterans.   This is such an important piece of legislation. I urge all of our  colleagues to stand up and support its passage and see it through to  its enactment. We cannot afford to leave our men and women in uniform  behind.
