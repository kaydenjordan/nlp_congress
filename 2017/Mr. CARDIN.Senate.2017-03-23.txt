 Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a bill that I  have introduced. I have introduced it in prior Congresses. But I think  it is particularly important in this Congress. It is the End Racial and  Religious Profiling Act of 2017. I am proud to have many of my  colleagues as cosponsors of this legislation, including Senators  Baldwin, Blumenthal, Booker, Brown, Cantwell, Coons, Duckworth, Durbin,  Feinstein, Franken, Gillibrand, Harris, Heinrich, Hirono, Kaine,  Markey, Menendez, Merkley, Murphy, Murray, Sanders, Stabenow, Udall,  Van Hollen, Wyden, and Warren.   In the House of Representatives, the bill's principal sponsor is  Congressman Conyers. It is needed now more than ever before. I say that  for many reasons, one of which is that we have seen a large increase in  hate crimes in our community. Yesterday I was on the phone with a  father from Harford County, MD, whose son was the victim of a hate  episode related to that person's religion and ethnic background.   We have seen in our community a large increase in hate crimes against  the Jewish community. There have been a lot of bomb threats that have  been called into Jewish schools and to the Jewish Community Centers. We  have seen physical attacks and the desecration of cemeteries. So the  minority community feels threatened.   That has been escalating as a result of the actions of our President  and his Executive orders. The Executive orders--he has issued two now  that are dealing with the immigrant community--do raise the temperature  in our community and the concern in our community that people are being  threatened because of their religion, threatened because of their  ethnic background, threatened because of their status as part of an  immigrant community.   All of that has added to the concerns in America today. The  legislation that I have introduced would make it illegal for  discriminatory policing--for police to use as an indicator for their  actions a person's race, religion, or ethnic background.   Discriminatory policing is against our values. Quite frankly, it is  not what we stand for as a nation. We don't target people because of  their religion. I will always remember that shortly after the Trayvon  episode, I met with community activists in Baltimore. Many told me  examples of how they were with their parents when the police stopped  them randomly, for no reason at all, but solely because of the person's  race and how communities felt threatened as a result of it.   It is not what we stand for as a nation. It turns communities against  police, rather than working with the police. It is a waste of  resources. It does not work. It can be deadly as we have seen in too  many communities in our Nation. In my own city of Baltimore, we had the  episode concerning Freddie Gray, who died in police custody.   I went to Sandtown, where Freddie Gray came from, shortly after that  episode and met with the community, and I heard comparable stories  about how good community activists felt like they were betraying their  community if they worked with the local police, because they said the  system was just stacked against their community and their race.   So let me, if I might, quote from the Department of Justice report on  the Freddie Gray case. Our congressional delegation asked for a pattern  or practice investigation. In part of that investigation, they came out  with this finding:         There is overwhelming statistical evidence of racial       disparities in Baltimore Police Department's (BPD's) stops,       searches, and arrests. . . . BPD officers subject African-      Americans to a disproportionate number of pedestrian and       vehicles stops on Baltimore streets and search African-      Americans disproportionately during these stops. . . . The       policing practices that cause the racial disparities in BPD's       stops, searches, and arrests, along with evidence suggesting       intentional discrimination against African-Americans,       undermine the community trust that is central to effective       policing. . . . Indeed, we heard from many community members       who were reluctant to engage with the officers because of       their belief that the Department treats African-Americans       unfairly. . . . These concerns were acknowledged by BPD       leadership and officers, who explained that lack of trust--      particularly in many of Baltimore's African-American       communities--inhibit officers' efforts to build relationships       that are a key component of effective policing. . . .    I say that because racial profiling--discriminatory profiling--is  ineffective and is counterproductive. It actually makes communities  less safe. I have the honor of being the Special Representative for  Anti-Semitism, Racism and Intolerance in the OSCE, or the Organization  for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Parliamentary Assembly.   In that capacity, I have identified four major areas of concern  within the 57 countries that represent the OSCE, including the United  States. Those priorities are discriminatory actions against the Muslim  community, the rise of anti-Semitism, the concerns of discrimination  against the immigrant community, and also the concerns on  discriminatory policing.   Discriminatory policing is very much engaged in our concerns about  the rise of anti-Semitism, racism, and intolerance. Now, I want to make  it clear: The overwhelming majority of people in law enforcement are  good people. They are professionals. They are trying to do their job.  They are against racial profiling. But we need to protect the  professionalism within the police departments and establish a national  policy against racial profiling.   My legislation is supported by over 1,150 organizations. Let me just,  if I might, mention a couple of those, by quoting their leaders. Wade  Henderson, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and  Human Rights, who supports this legislation said:         Discriminatory profiling is wrong, fosters distrust between       law enforcement and the communities they serve and puts       public safety at risk. Racial profiling infringes on civil       liberties and squanders resources that should be used instead       to catch criminal perpetrators. We urge his colleagues to       join Senator Cardin and stand for effective law enforcement       by supporting [this legislation].    Jennifer Bellamy, the ACLU legislative counsel, who also supports  this legislation, said:         For centuries, discriminatory profiling practices have       harmed communities of color. It is not enough to be `against'       racism and racial profiling, we need national leaders to end       discriminatory practices. We know that profiling of any kind       is ineffective and diverts law enforcement's time, money, and       energy away from actual threats. The time is now to end       racial profiling once and for all.    Then, lastly, Hilary Shelton, the director of the NAACP Washington  Bureau and the senior vice president for policy and advocacy said:         This important legislation takes concrete steps to put an       end to the insidious practice of profiling individuals by       federal, state and local levels based on physical attributes       or an individual's religion. It is difficult for our faith in       the American criminal justice system not to be challenged       when we cannot walk down the street, drive down an       interstate, go through an airport, or even enter into our own       homes without being stopped merely because of the color of       our skin, who we are perceived to be, or what we choose to       wear.    I could mention many of the other groups and many other quotes. This  legislation is pretty straightforward. It establishes a national  uniform standard against discriminatory profiling at all levels of law  enforcement--State, local Federal.   For example, it tells us that we can't use as descriptors a person's  race. We can do so when we are using it to describe a particular crime,  but not as a predictor of future crimes. Let me close by quoting from  Ron Davis, the former police chief of East Palo Alto, CA, where he  said:         [T]here exists no national, standardized definition for       racial profiling that prohibits all uses of race, national       origin, and religion, except when describing a person.       Consequently, many state and local policies define racial       profiling as using race as the ``sole'' basis for a stop or       any police action. This definition is misleading in that it       suggests using race as a factor for anything other than a       description is justified, which it is not. Simply put,       race is a descriptor not a predictor. To use race along       with other salient descriptors when describing someone who       just committed a crime is appropriate.    That is what this legislation does. It establishes a national  definition. It prohibits it in any form of policing in our country. It  provides for training. It provides Federal grants for best practices.  It requires the Attorney General  [[Page S1944]]  to issue reports. It is legislation that is needed in our country.   Former Attorney General Eric Holder adopted it at the national level,  and he said:         In this Nation, security and liberty are--at their best--      partners, not enemies, in ensuring safety and opportunity for       all. . . . In this Nation, the document that sets forth the       supreme law of the land--the Constitution--is meant to       empower, not exclude. . . . Racial profiling is wrong. It can       leave a lasting scar on communities and individuals. And it       is, quite simply, bad policing--whatever city, whatever       state.    The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees ``equal  protection of the laws'' to all Americans. Racial and discriminatory  profiling is abhorrent to those principles, and it should be ended once  and for all.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise as the ranking Democrat on the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee to comment on the nomination of Mr.  Friedman to be the U.S. Ambassador to Israel. Shortly, we will be  having that vote.   I consider the U.S.-Israel relationship to be a strategic anchor for  the United States in the Middle East and one of our most important  relationships with any country. Since the creation of the State of  Israel, support for this relationship has been bipartisan, bicameral,  and supported by successive U.S. administrations. This bilateral  relationship is also sustained by the deep bonds of friendship between  the people of our two countries. This relationship has benefited Israel  and has benefited the United States.   Given the range of strategic challenges across the globe that our  country faces and the unprecedented instability and violence embroiled  in the Middle East today, it is critical that we take steps to unify  support for the U.S.-Israel relationship across the political spectrum.  Thus, I believe it is vital that the U.S. Ambassador to Israel be seen  as a unifying figure in this enduring relationship.   I really do believe that there is broad understanding and support in  the Senate and the House for the special relationship between the  United States and Israel--Israel, the only true democracy in the Middle  East, a country that we can rely on for important intelligence  information and that has an economy which is similar to ours. It is a  country that has enjoyed a special relationship with the United States  since 1948, when Harry Truman recognized Israel after the historic vote  at the United Nations.   Following extensive consideration of Mr. Friedman's record and taking  into account his statements during his nomination hearing, I have  concluded that his past record would make it very difficult for him to  serve as that unifying force. For that reason, I am unable to support  his nomination as America's top diplomat in Israel.   I appreciate Mr. Friedman's efforts before the committee to express  regret for his substantial record of divisive, inflammatory, and  offensive statements. Unfortunately, I believe the body of Mr.  Friedman's published works, not to mention his public statements, will  compromise his effectiveness in representing the United States and all  Americans, as well as the Government of Israel and all Israelis.   Taken together, Mr. Friedman's statements and affiliations make it  clear that he does not believe a two-state solution is necessary for a  just and lasting peace. I am concerned that Mr. Friedman's history on  this issue, in which he calls the two-state solution a scam, will  undermine his ability to represent the United States as a credible  facilitator of the peace process. There is simply no realistic,  sustainable prospect for lasting peace between the Israelis and the  Palestinians other than as two states, living side by side, with  security.   I thank Chairman Corker for the manner in which this nomination was  handled before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I think we had  ample opportunity, and I thank Chairman Corker for that, but I do urge  my colleagues to reject this nominee.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the productive  partnership between the United States and Costa Rica. I recently had  the chance to meet with President Guillermo Solis, and I can attest  that this is a bilateral relationship strengthened by Costa Rica's  unwavering support for democracy and human rights, comprehensive  economic relations, and a deep-rooted commitment to security and the  environment. Since 1851, the United States has enjoyed formal  diplomatic relations with Costa Rica, one of Latin America's most  enduring democracies, and the close cooperation between our two  countries is an example of how international engagement consistently  advances U.S. national interests and national security.   In recent years, Costa Rica has become one of the United States' most  strategic security partners in Central America. In 2016, in response to  the challenges of increasing cocaine trafficking in the region,  President Solis's administration developed a security strategy that  sets aggressive goals to expand its capacity to control Costa Rica's  sovereign airspace and maritime territory. Last year, Costa Rica seized  more than 24,000 kilos of cocaine that were ultimately bound to the  United  [[Page S1968]]  States. Despite a difficult fiscal situation, Costa Rica is projected  to increase its investment in security by 20 percent in 2017. I commend  the Obama administration's decision to donate two Island-class cutters  to the Costa Rican Coast Guard, which will greatly boost Costa Rica's  capacity to combat the narcotics trade. This also serves as a reminder  of the strategic value of the State Department's security cooperation  at a time when the Trump administration is proposing shortsighted cuts  to our foreign assistance budget.   Additionally, I want to call attention to Costa Rica's collaboration  with the United States in addressing the humanitarian challenges  related to individuals fleeing violence in Guatemala, El Salvador, and  Honduras. Between 2013 and 2016, the number of migrants from these  three countries who have requested asylum in Costa Rica more than  quadrupled, a dramatic increase that reflects the urgency of the  situation in Central America. In a clear demonstration of President  Solis's leadership on these issues, Costa Rica and the United States  signed an agreement with the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees, UNHCR, to establish a relocation and processing facility in  Costa Rica for up to 200 at-risk migrants at a time from Guatemala, El  Salvador, and Honduras. This critical screening provides immediate  protection for those most vulnerable and opens opportunities for these  individuals to be relocated to third countries.   Our joint agreement with UNHCR is but one example of U.S. and Costa  Rican collaboration at multilateral fora. Costa Rica has consistently  voted with the United States at the United Nations on critical issues  related to Syria, North Korea, and Ukraine. In the past year, Costa  Rica has also used its voice and vote at the Organization of American  States to express concern about the growing challenges to democracy and  human rights in Venezuela.   Furthermore, in August 2016, Costa Rica's commitment to human rights  was on display when it became the first country to ratify the Inter- American Convention against Racism, Racial Discrimination and Related  Forms of Intolerance--an important step toward a more just and  egalitarian society within the Americas. The convention reinforces  international standards on all forms of discrimination, reaffirms the  commitment of member states of the OAS to the complete and  unconditional eradication of racism, and takes a step forward in the  legal definition of contemporary forms of racism.   As a champion of environmental stewardship, Costa Rica has made great  strides to develop renewable energy. Costa Rica recently set an  ambitious carbon neutrality goal for 2021 and is well positioned to  achieve this important objective. The country recently ran 75 days  straight on renewable power, and, with continued foreign investment and  U.S. diplomatic assistance, Costa Rica is on its way to becoming a  carbon-neutral nation. I am hopeful that our diplomatic mission to  Costa Rica will continue to support the country's interest in being a  leader in the fight against climate change. Helping Costa Rica realize  innovations in its power sector helps foster a broader strategic  partnership with an important neighbor in our hemisphere.   At a moment characterized by the Trump administration's isolationist  rhetoric, it is critically important to recognize that the United  States is safer when we cooperate with other countries in the region to  fight the battle against organized crime and illegal drug-trafficking.  At the same time, Costa Rica's cooperation with the United Nations to  support orderly and lawful migration, its collaboration with its  neighbors in the region, and its efforts to promote human rights  regionally are worthy of our commendation. Costa Rica is a true partner  of the United States, and it is imperative that we continue to  strengthen and expand the cooperation between our two countries to  promote more security, prosperity, and stability in Central America and  across the hemisphere.                            ____________________
