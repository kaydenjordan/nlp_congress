 Mr. Speaker, while House Democrats are focused on  delivering better jobs, better wages, and a better future for the  American people, House Republicans have once again presented a budget  that is reckless, regressive, and reprehensible.   It is a ``billionaire-first, middle class-last tax plan.'' It will  not help the middle class. The House Republican budget and tax proposal  will hurt the middle  [[Page H8247]]  class by raising taxes on working families and middle-income Americans.   The House Republican budget and tax plan is nothing more than a wolf  in sheep's clothing. It will benefit the wealthiest and the well-off  here in this country. Eighty percent of the tax cuts proposed in the  Ryan-McConnell plan will go to the wealthiest 1 percent in America, to  millionaires and billionaires, to the privileged few, to special  interest corporations. It will not lead to economic growth. It will  saddle this country with trillions of dollars in additional debt and  deficit.   It is based on a phony, fraudulent, and failed theory of trickle-down  economics, which I finally figured out what it relates to in terms of  the middle class. You may get a trickle, but you are guaranteed to stay  down. Stay down because they are going to undermine your Medicare, stay  down because they are going to undermine Social Security, and stay down  because they are going to saddle your children with trillions of  dollars of additional debt.   Mr. Speaker, reject this plan. It is a bad deal for the American  people. They deserve a better deal.
