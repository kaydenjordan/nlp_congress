 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks before the scheduled recess.    Mr. President, last year ended with the best  Christmas present that this Congress could have given to the American  people--the Democrats' failing to pass President Biden's reckless tax- and-spending spree. But, sadly, the Democrats' failure doesn't seem to  have made them realize the reality they are operating in: a 50-50  Senate, where they have to actually work with both sides of the aisle  to deliver bipartisan wins for the American people.   They have now pivoted from a reckless tax-and-spend spree that would  break the piggy banks of Americans to wanting to break the longstanding  rules of the U.S. Senate. They have set their sights on changing the  very core of this institution by eliminating the legislative  filibuster.   Some Americans may not even know what the filibuster is. The Senate  follows many rules and procedures to pass legislation, and the  filibuster is an important tool that gives the minority party the  ability to voice concerns and help shape any bill the majority party  may bring up.   The filibuster serves as a check against the majority party wishing  to act without input from the minority. Basically, with the filibuster,  the majority has to work with the minority. That is the bottom line.   Voting to end debate on a bill is commonly referred to as ``ending a  filibuster.'' It simply means that the Senate agrees that there has  been enough debate, including amendments, and it is now time to take a  vote. And as one of the Senate rules, it requires 60 votes to end  debate and move to passing the bill.   Even if you aren't familiar with complicated Senate procedures, just  know that the filibuster is important because it protects the  deliberative nature of the Senate.   It ensures we function as an institution rooted in compromise, common  [[Page S131]]  ground, and a sense of unity. We represent all Americans, not just a  few.   Looking back on the history, you will see it has been utilized as a  standard Senate practice by Republicans, Democrats, and Independents  alike.   It is so important that in 2005, Senator Schumer, whom you just heard  speak, said: ``The ideologues in the Senate want to turn what the  Founding Fathers called `the cooling saucer of Democracy' into the  rubber stamp of dictatorship.''   Yes, he said that doing away with the filibuster would effectively  create a dictatorship.   More recently, in 2017, Senator Schumer doubled down on the need to  keep the filibuster in a letter to Leader McConnell. In his letter,  Senator Schumer argued for the protection of ``existing rules,  practices and traditions as they pertain to the right of members to  engage in extended debate on legislation before the United States  Senate.''   To sum that up, he said no way should we cancel the filibuster.   That letter was signed by 33 Democrats, many of whom are still  serving in this Senate as we speak. One of the signers who served at  that time who signed this document is now the Vice President of the  United States.   And it is not just the Vice President who has warned against ending  the filibuster. In 2005, on this very floor, Senator Joe Biden warned  that if the ability to filibuster were abolished, done away with, the  Senate would become the House of Representatives.   I recognize that both sides of the aisle have, at some point,  diminished the filibuster on nomination votes. In 2013, then-Senator  Harry Reid lowered the vote threshold for Presidential appointments,  other than Supreme Court nominees, to 51. In 2017, the Republicans  turned around and lowered the standard to 51 for Supreme Court  nominees.   Based on that, the left may call our opposition now hypocritical. But  there is a big difference between legislation and nominations,  including policy and our budget and nominees.   Debating legislation should include input from all Senators and be  subject to compromise through the amendment process in order to be made  better.   A nominee's qualifications are not subject to input or change. Voting  on a nominee is a take-it-or-leave-it vote. You can't change their  background or qualifications with more debate or more amendments. That  is why they moved the vote to 50.   But the filibuster on legislation forces the majority to take into  account the minority's position and to make the changes necessary to  earn their support.   So now that the Democrats seem to be changing their tune on the  legislative filibuster, it might be worth asking what has caused the  Democrats to flip-flop and why now?   Well, there is one notable reason. Between 2017 and 2022, who is in  control of the White House and Congress now?   Back in 2017, when the Democrats were in the minority, they  understood the value of the minority's vote. But now they are in the  majority, and all bets are off. They want to race through their party's  Big Government socialist agenda with as little or no debate or  opposition as possible. And Senate Democrats have embraced a radical,  win-at-all-cost game plan for passing their progressive agenda, and  they intend to and will break the Senate if they do it.   Democrats say their war on the filibuster has to do with  strengthening voting rights, and they want to make it easier to vote  and harder to cheat. If that were true, Democrats wouldn't have any  problem passing this on a bipartisan level.   We all want to safeguard our elections so that all Americans have  confidence in the integrity of our country's election process. But if  access to the ballot box were an issue, it might come as a surprise  that the 2020 election saw the largest voter turnout in over a century.   The Democrats are simply operating under a false idea. The States  should run our election system, not the Federal Government.   What is more is, they will tell you they are embarking on this  crusade to ``save our democracy.'' But the problem is, they want to do  it by blowing up our democracy, blowing up this room.   Ending the filibuster means we would govern only by majority rule,  stifling the voice of all minority and millions and millions of people  who voted for the people who are in here in the minority.   Instead of saving it, this one-party rule would be the end of our  democracy as we know it.   Instead of including the minority's voice in legislation that should  serve all Americans, we would have radical swings back and forth every  time the majority changed hands in this room.   Right now, there are few Democratic Senators who have stood up for  the filibuster. They understand the important role of the minority's  voice. This is not the House of Representatives. They understand the  importance of making sure we listen to the voices of the millions of  Americans who voted for the minority party, whoever it is. They know  what even a small ``exemption,'' or what they call a ``carve-out,''  could lead to--devastation to this room.   So I ask the rest of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle:  Why not join us and save the filibuster? That is what makes us the  voice of all Americans. Why not focus on what you can do to lead in the  face of many crises actually facing the American people?   In a recent poll, nearly 50 percent of Americans disapproved of  President Biden's handling of COVID. The disapproval ratings were even  higher when it came to the economy, taxes, crime, government spending,  and immigration. It is clear that, right now, Americans need more  adults in this room and more leadership, and I can guarantee that the  American people do not want leadership that resorts to changing the  rules to get their way, to notch a win. The American people want  leaders who actually address the problems they face, like COVID and  inflation.   We cannot allow the failed leadership of Big Government socialists to  be a scapegoat for eliminating the filibuster and fundamentally  changing our country for the worse.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
