 Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, this amendment is corrosive to the budget  resolution's privilege. So it falls outside the scope of what is  appropriate for inclusion. Adoption of corrosive amendments could be  fatal to the resolution's privilege, and loss of privilege could  compromise our ability to pass tax reform and enforce the budget  spending limits. Further, this amendment is also nongermane. The  Congressional Budget Act requires that amendments to a budget  resolution be germane, which is a statutory requirement we can't  ignore. So I raise a point of order against this amendment under the  Budget Act, section 305(b)(2).    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  amendments be called up en bloc and reported by number: Flake No. 1178,  Baldwin No. 1139, Rubio No. 1205, Heitkamp No. 1228, Portman No. 1422,  Donnelly No. 1234, and Kaine No. 1249.   I further ask consent that at 3 p.m., all time on the resolution be  yielded back and the Senate vote in relation to the amendments in the  order listed; that there be no second-degree amendments in order to  these seven amendments prior to the votes; finally, that there be 2  minutes equally divided between the managers or their designees prior  to each vote and that all votes after the first in this series be 10  minutes in length.    For the information of all Senators, these are the first  seven amendments we will consider during vote-arama, and we will work  to get an agreement on a final list of amendments during these votes.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment, which would create an uneven playing field for the upcoming  congressional reconciliation. If adopted, this amendment would  reinstate a point of order from the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution,  which Congress repealed 2 years ago. It was repealed to ensure equal  treatment of all reconciliation bills by restoring the level playing  field that had existed prior to the adoption of the point of order in  2008. That was used under the Byrd rule.   The Byrd rule specifically does not require such budget neutrality  inside the budget window. Why? Because reconciliation was designed to  be neutral in its orientation. The Budget Act states that  reconciliation instructions must enumerate changes in spending and  revenue amounts. It does not stipulate those changes must be increases  or decreases.   The fiscal year 2016 budget resolution restored the longstanding  neutrality principle of the Byrd rule. It was the right thing to do  then, and we should reaffirm that position today. I urge my colleagues  to oppose this amendment.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, again, this is another attempt to do the  Finance Committee's work as part of the budget. I urge my colleagues to  oppose this amendment. The amendment would inappropriately bind the  Finance Committee's work on any tax legislation it writes.   This point of order is meant to be a poison pill in the process and  would set a 60-vote threshold on tax reform, effectively killing its  efforts through reconciliation. This resolution's instructions to  Finance do not specify the policy or the provisions that are going to  be reported out of the committee, but the framework, as stated, will be  just as progressive as the current Tax Code. The chairman of the  Finance Committee and members can assure you of that result.   This amendment is unnecessary, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.   I raise a point of order against this amendment under the Budget Act,  section 305(b)(2).    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Donnelly  amendment be modified with the text of his amendment No. 1423, which is  at the desk.    Mr. President, I further ask that the pending Kaine  amendment be temporarily laid aside and that the Brown amendment No.  1378 be made pending and be the next vote in the series, with 2 minutes  of debate prior to the vote.    Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment. The budget resolution's reconciliation instruction to the  Finance Committee does not and should not specify the policies or  provisions that are being reported out of the Budget Committee  resolution. The Finance framework includes international tax reform  that will incentivize companies to invest domestically and create jobs  in the United States. But this amendment defines ``patriot employers''  with a long list of criteria and pinpoints tax breaks for these  companies. ``Patriot employers'' should not be defined by the budget  process or by politics but by those that allow our constituents to join  and remain in the workforce so as to participate in the American dream.   American companies will be able to create additional jobs based on  tax relief envisioned by the Finance Committee. As such, we should pass  the resolution and reconciliation in a timely manner, and we should  oppose this amendment.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  amendments be called up en bloc and reported by number: Paul No. 1296  and Cardin No. 1375.   I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote in relation to  these amendments in the order listed; that there be no second-degree  amendments in order to the amendments prior to the votes; finally, that  there be 2 minutes, equally divided between the managers or their  designees, prior to each vote, and that all votes in this series be 10  minutes in length.    Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment. Budget rules don't accommodate current tax policy. This  means at least $460 billion of scored revenue loss can be attributed to  the difference between a current law baseline and a current policy  baseline. Many of the tax extenders covered by this amount are popular  and are supported on a bipartisan basis.   This amendment is corrosive to the budget resolution's privilege. It  falls outside the scope of what is appropriate for inclusion. Adoption  of corrosive amendments could be fatal to the resolution's privilege,  and loss of privilege could compromise our ability to pass tax reform  and to enforce the budget spending limits.   Further, this amendment is also nongermane. The Congressional Budget  Act requires that amendments to a budget resolution be germane--a  statutory regulation we can't ignore.   So I raise a point of order against this amendment under the Budget  Act's section 305(b)(2).    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  amendments be called up en bloc and reported by number: Paul No. 1298,  Lee No. 1430, and Paul No. 1277.   I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate now vote in relation  to the Kaine amendment No. 1249 and that following disposition of the  Kaine amendment, the Senate vote in relation to the above amendments in  the order listed; finally, that there be 2 minutes equally divided  between the managers or their designees prior to all further votes  tonight and that they be 10 minutes in length.    The next four votes will be on the Kaine amendment No.  1249, the Paul amendment No. 1298, the Lee amendment No. 1430, and the  Paul amendment No. 1277.    Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment. The congressional budget clearly empowers the Budget  Committee chair as scorekeeper. Since becoming chairman in 2015, I am  pleased to say that the Budget Committee has always discharged its  responsibilities with scores in hand, proving our important work and  function without this amendment. In fact, the 28-hour rule is a recent  creation, and its repeal shows no deviation from Senate practice. It  would require 28 hours on every amendment.   It is also important to note that a budget resolution is not a law.  Because it is not a law, it cannot supersede or replace any statutory  provisions. The Congressional Budget Act is a law and sets forth the  rules that the congressional budget must follow.   The proposed amendment attempts to make a significant change to  section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act, which should be  accomplished through regular order legislation which the President  signs.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment. The amendment seeks to reduce discretionary appropriations  this fiscal year by $43 billion. As Members are aware, the resolution's  discretionary figures for this fiscal year are fully consistent with  the Budget Control Act spending limits. If they weren't, then the  resolution would be subject to a 60-vote point of order.   This year's resolution also includes Overseas Contingency Operations  funding at $77 billion. This amount is equal to the President's request  and is allowable under the Budget Control Act. The  [[Page S6624]]  members of the Budget Committee worked hard to craft a resolution with  levels that would put us on a better fiscal path, with $5.1 trillion in  spending reductions over the next 10 years. The resolution already  contains ample restraint to both discretionary and mandatory spending.   As the Appropriations Committee has reported many of its bills  already, this amendment could be detrimental to the appropriations  process as it stands today and the allocation this resolution will  provide.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  amendments be called up en bloc and reported by number: Udall amendment  No. 1553, Lee amendment No. 1428, Paul amendment No. 1404, Lee  amendment No. 1429, Fischer amendment No. 1552, Cantwell amendment No.  1301, Enzi amendment No. 1561, and Perdue-Whitehouse amendment No.  1167.   I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate now vote in relation  to these amendments in the order listed.    Mr. President, for the information of Senators, we expect  to have this series of votes and then move to passage of the  resolution. That means there are hopefully approximately eight votes  left. Some of them may be voice votes.   Mr. President, I yield to the leader.    Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment, reluctantly. I have always fought to make sure the rural  communities can keep the lights on. Approximately half of the land in  my home State of Wyoming is under Federal control, and counties,  therefore, are unable to obtain property tax revenue from a large part  of the State.   Payment in lieu of taxes isn't a giveaway to these counties. It is  compensation for the money they lose because they are unable to tax  Federal lands within their borders, even though they are required to  provide services on those lands. However, this resolution already has  the reserved funds for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program. I find  this amendment to be duplicative and unnecessary. Furthermore, the  vote-arama isn't the correct forum to contemplate making any program  permanent and mandatory, even one I have long supported.   I look forward to working with my colleague from New Mexico and with  other interested Members from Western States on fiscally responsible  legislation to provide fairness and equity for America's rural counties  and their communities.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.    Mr. President, I request that everybody sit in their seat,  and we could do these votes in 7\1/2\ minutes. If everybody wanders off  and comes back in, we could be here half the night. There should only  be about seven votes left, and some of those could be by voice vote,  like the next one.    I appreciate the way those on that side have taken their  seats and voted.                              Amendment No. 1428     Mr. President, I yield back all time and ask for a voice  vote.    Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank everybody who  has gotten us to this point. There is this vote, and I hope there will  be one voice vote after it and then final passage.   I am urging my colleagues to support this amendment. This amendment  offers technical and conforming changes that are needed for the House  of Representatives to be able to enforce the budget resolution. This  amendment will help maintain fiscal discipline in the House so both  Chambers can continue to work and put America on a more sustainable  footing. What is also important for my colleagues to know is that these  provisions apply to the House only. The Senate enforcement remains  unchanged.   I hope you will support me on this amendment.   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I know of no further amendments to the  resolution.                        Amendment No. 1116, as Amended     That is the substitute. I yield back time on that.    Mr. President, I am tempted to debate that, but we will get  to do that as we do the provisions of this after it is all voted on.   I hope everybody will adopt the substitute by voice, and then vote on  adoption of the resolution.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I am going to contain my remarks to the  budget and its process.   For several days--in fact, for several weeks--I have been listening  to the same rhetoric of what this budget will do. This budget is a  special process. It  [[Page S6632]]  does outline a plan for what we can do over 10 years. That is a long  time. I don't know that we ever make it past the first year. In fact,  some budgets do not last more than 40 days before we waive the budget,  but we need to have a blueprint. This is a blueprint that covers 10  years in spite of some of the rhetoric that this bill will not do any  of the things that have been claimed. The reason that it will not do  any of the things that have been claimed is that everything in the  budget requires action by another committee before it can be done.  Maybe they will take what we have in the budget and do that. Usually,  they do not. If they were to, we could balance it, in this case, over a  10-year period. That is too long. Interest is going to eat us alive  before that time. We are going to have to do something else.   I remember, when President Obama came into office, he had an idea. He  said that the economy was too sluggish, so he was going to do a  stimulus bill. Here, they are complaining about this $1.5 trillion  that, perhaps, might be part of the flexibility for doing tax reform.  We did more than that in the stimulus, and it did not work and went  into the hands of a few people. Some of it never did get used. Some of  it went to very few people. It was supposed to go to shovel-ready  projects. Some of those projects have not been done yet, so that did  not work.   We have had a slow economy. In fact, it seemed to have been slowing  down, not speeding up, until last November. Last November, people  showed a sign of hope, and the economy started going the other way. It  is reflected in the stock market and some of the commodity prices  because they felt that those could be produced again.   We decided that we had to try a different approach, and the different  approach was to try to put the money in the hands of hard-working  Americans. That is the middle class that some of the people talk about,  and it is the poor that some of the people talk about. It is everybody.  When we do tax reform, it will affect everybody. In fact, there are  even some studies that show that when you do the corporate tax, it  increases money for individuals who are working because there will be  more competition for people, and that will drive up wages. Some  economists have pointed that out. Yet, rather than argue with the  Congressional Budget Office about how much the change is going to be,  we said: No. Go ahead. Do your static one just as though no change had  been made at all. We are willing to bet that there will be a very  slight increase that will cover what we are talking about as a possible  deficit and that that deficit will not develop if we increase just a  very small amount in productivity.   Just about every economist asked: How come you are picking such a low  number? Well, we try to be conservative and hope that the number goes 4  or 5 or 6 points higher than that. If it does, we will have money to  start paying back some of the debt. If it just stays at my estimated,  conservative amount, at the end of 10 years, we will have a surplus of  $197 billion.   We have a chance to put America on a different route, one that will  increase jobs, one that will get the money into the hands of the  people, realizing that they probably know better what to do for  themselves and their families than we do.   I do hear a lot when I go home about different government programs  that are not working. In my studies, I have found that we not only have  programs that are not working but that we have programs that nobody  ever takes a look at. We have programs that have a lot of duplication.  We have 160 housing programs. There are really only 5 things that those  160 programs do, so shouldn't we have just 5 of them and maybe have  them specifically and all under one agency and set some goals and see  if they meet those goals?   I was visiting with a lady from Africa who happens to be in charge of  finance in her country. She said: You know, we have performance  contracts in our country, and a performance contract means that  everybody, including the towns, does a list of what they are going to  get done during the year.   Because they are smaller than the United States, once a year they get  everybody together who has a performance contract, and everybody  reviews his performance contract. If you do not meet your performance  contract, there is a little bit of public embarrassment; whereas we do  not even check to see if they did anything. We do not even check to see  if they have plans. We have to change that, and some of the things in  this budget will allow that to happen.   I appreciate the way that we finished up in committee. I allowed the  other side to see the budget early. Normally, they get to see it after  opening statements are done. Imagine that--do the opening statement  about what you think is going to be in the budget. Although some of the  speakers I have heard around here act like they are still thinking that  something might be in the budget that is not, they got to see it 5 days  early in exchange for submitting their amendments, which is what every  other committee does. Submit the amendments early, and then we can look  through them and see how much duplication there is and some that can be  accepted from both sides. As a result, we started with over 150  amendments, and we voted on 25. We took five from the other side,  making it a bipartisan budget.   Nevertheless, after the committee process, we brought it to the  floor, and we had an open amendment process today. In fact, as for the  way the rules are on this, after we voted on the last amendment--of  course, before we voted on final passage--somebody could have said:  Wait a minute, I have one more, and he could have gone on all night.  Again, we had to think of a civil process today that would result in  our being able to finish at what would be considered an extremely early  hour.   There was a little different tone to the amendments than what I had  seen before--I think people will agree with that--which was that they  were focused on the actual items in the budget, not on ``gotcha''  amendments. Usually, they say: Well, that person is up, and he has this  little soft spot, so if I throw in this amendment, he will be on  record, probably, having to vote against it, or he will vote for it,  and that can be used against him. Either way, they would be able to use  it. I didn't see those amendments this time, and I appreciate that.   I appreciate my colleagues for their consideration, their  cooperation, and a lot of patience that has gotten us to this point.   I thank Leader Mitch McConnell for allowing the Senators to do their  jobs, to do them in committee, and to do them here on the Senate floor.  This commitment to an open, honest, and transparent legislative process  is crucial to helping Congress restore the trust of the American  people.   I also owe thanks to the outstanding members of the Senate Budget  Committee, who fought so hard and so tenaciously to outline a plan that  could balance the budget over the next 10 years while providing the  tools needed to reform our Tax Code and boost the economy. The  Presiding Officer was a part of that committee, and the Senator who  just finished presiding was a part of that committee. I appreciate the  careful and calculated way they looked at it, provided suggestions,  then asked good questions at hearings and helped to come up with that  budget.   Thanks are due, as well, to the many Members on this side who came  and spoke on the budget's behalf, who offered amendments to make it  better--well, almost always to make it better--and who worked with each  of us and each other to move through the resolution's debate and the  vote process together.   I would also like to focus for a moment on some of the staff who  helped to lead us here. I want to thank the Republican staff of the  Senate Budget Committee. That is Betsy McDonnell, my staff director,  who is relatively new to the position, but you would never know that in  the way she took ahold with her knowledge and friendship among people,  again, on both sides of the aisle. She has been able to work some  wonders to where we had the least votes in a vote-arama that, I think,  we have ever had. That came from her being able to combine some of them  but also in helping them redraft so that they were covering a different  area than somebody else might be covering, which eliminated some of the  repetition.   I want to thank my deputy staff director, Matt Giroux, and Paul  Vinovich, Becky Cole, Thomas Fuller,  [[Page S6633]]  Elizabeth Keys, Joe Brenckle, Jim Neill, Steve Robinson, Greg D'Angelo,  Tom Borck, Richard Berger, Jeremy Dalrymple, David Ditch, Susan  Eckerly, Alison McGuire, Will Morris, Steve Townsend, Kelsie  Wendelberger, and our interns Catherine Konieczny, Jake Whitaker, and  Matt Pfeiffer. They are quite a team that has been doing a lot of work,  both daytime and night and while the Senate has been out of session.   So I would also like to offer a special thank-you to Eric Ueland, who  previously served as my staff director. He has been nominated for a  post within the administration, and he is still waiting for his vote  here, which is being delayed a lot--not just on his but apparently on  all of them.   Eric has played an important role on this committee and throughout  his time in the Senate. Two years ago, Eric was instrumental in helping  Congress approve its first balanced 10-year budget since 2001, which  represented an important step toward putting our country on not just  another course but a better course. He is careful, precise, and dogged  in his work. He has a tremendous knowledge of the history of the Senate  and particularly the budget process. I especially appreciate his  understanding of the complex Senate rules and precedents, along with  the Budget Act. I wish him Godspeed in his next position in service to  our great Nation.   As well, thanks are due to my personal office staff who have to carry  a load because I am not there when I am working on the budget stuff,  but they keep me well informed so we are progressing on some of the  State stuff at the same time. I particularly have to thank my chief of  staff, Tara Shaw, who, because a new administration came in and liked  the employees I had working for me, hired many of them away and we had  to find replacements and she did an outstanding job with that. She has  helped to kind of hold me together during this whole process and gives  me outstanding advice so that I know not only what I am doing but why I  am doing it, and, again, she has a tremendous history of what I have  done before, which helps me as a good reminder. She is an outstanding  chief of staff.   I also want to include my legislative director, Landon Stropko. When  you are the budget chairman and you are worried about some of the  numbers, you can give the legislative director a heart attack because  as budget director you have to vote against some things that have some  unusual numbers to it, but it might be something people in Wyoming are  interested in. We were able to resolve some of those conflicts. I  always support Wyoming, as I mentioned. For anything that happens in  the budget process, there is another process that will actually require  some votes to finish up anything that is in there, and we will see that  everything in there comes out in Wyoming's favor as well as for the  rest of the Nation. I am not trying to do anything partial just to our  part of the country, although a lot of things I work on have to do with  very rural places. We are the least populated State in the Nation, but  we are also the biggest State in the Nation so we have a lot of open  space to invite people to.   I also want to thank Bart Massey, Liz Schwartz, Natalia Riggin,  Aniela Butler, Charlie Carroll, Shawna Newsome, Garnett Decosimo, Chris  Lydon, Aron Wehr, and Dylan Mitchell. I want to thank my Communications  Director, Coy Knobel, our press team, Max D'Onofrio and Rachel Vliem,  and the rest of the Wyoming team.   I have a bunch of people in Wyoming who primarily work on casework  and do an outstanding job doing that.   I also want to thank the Budget Committee's bipartisan staff: Kim  Proctor, Katie Smith, George Woodall, Grace Bruno, and Kevin Walsh, as  well as Celina Inman, who has been on loan to us from the Government  Publishing Office. You can tell around here it takes a lot of  government printing.   We have also been supported by the great work of our leadership, the  floor and cloak room staff. I thank them for their continued good work  and dedication to this institution and the country as a whole.   In particular, I want to thank Sharon Soderstrom, Hazen Marshall,  Jane Lee, and Brendan Dunn in the leader's office; Monica Popp, John  Chapuis, and Emily Kirlin in the whip's office; and very especially  Laura Dove, who really runs this place. She has a history from when her  dad was the Parliamentarian, and I am sure there was dinner table talk  that has led her to know a lot of the precedents. I have seen when  somebody disagreed with her, she was able to just go over and pull out  a manual and turn almost instantly to the page and say: Here it is. She  does an outstanding job of helping us stay on the right track. I also  thank Robert Duncan, Chris Tuck, Megan Mercer, Tony Hanagan, Mike  Smith, Katherine Kilroy, and Chloe Barz in the cloakroom.   I would really be remiss if I didn't thank the Senate  Parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, and her team, along with our  bill and amendment clerks who kept us on the straight and narrow, but I  particularly want to point out our Senate Parliamentarian who has to go  through the technical details of every sentence of everything we do.  When you talk about a filing cabinet of ideas all contained in one  place, she does it. She knows precedent. She has been working at it for  a long time. To be Parliamentarian, you have to be somebody who really  likes detail work and pressure because when somebody comes in, they  don't say: Take a look at this, and maybe I will see what you think  next week. No, they want to know right now what you think, and  fortunately she is able to, with a very great personality, say: Not  yet, and then she does her research and comes up with some great  explanations--not ones we always agree with--but great explanations for  any decision she makes, and we really appreciate that.   So you can see that it takes a whole lot of people, and I haven't had  a chance to get the list of the people from the other side of the aisle  who have been working on, in some cases countering what we are doing  and keeping their people informed, but that is the Senate; that is,  there are all these people behind the scenes who are helping to make it  work and to do it right. That is important. We want to do it right.   Now, I think we could work together a lot better if we were able to  work in smaller bites. I get a little upset when we do comprehensive  stuff around here. I have watched so many times when we take a  comprehensive bill and soundly defeat it or maybe narrowly defeat it,  but we defeat it. I figured out, when we do something that ought to be  in separate bites, that this piece loses 5 votes and this piece loses  10 votes and this piece loses 12 votes, and pretty quickly you don't  have a majority anymore, but if you do it in smaller bites, you may  lose 5 votes, lose 12 votes, and it isn't a big deal. Getting it done  would be the big deal. So if people would settle for working one issue  and sticking to that issue and not say: No, I have this amendment that  I know nobody will like, but this is such an important bill, if I could  get it in there, it will make it through and hardly anybody will know-- that is not legislating, and we shouldn't be operating that way. We  should be doing an item at a time, in bite sizes, so the American  people can understand it, and we get it done.   I think a lot of people have done a great job here, including the  pages. It is late, so rather than go on--I made it to after 10 p.m. so  you don't have to have class tomorrow morning. With that, I will close.   I yield the floor.
