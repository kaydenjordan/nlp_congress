 Madam President, as a senior member and former  chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, each month I recognize and celebrate the American  entrepreneurial spirit by highlighting the success of a small business  in my home State of Idaho. Today I am pleased to honor Rupe's Burgers  in Blackfoot, which will celebrate its 34th anniversary this month, as  the Idaho Small Business of the Month for June 2021.   Rupe's Burgers is an American-style diner and drive-in known for its  quality food and strong community foundation. In 1962, former owner  Vaughn Rupe opened an A&W Restaurant and after years of success made  the decision to sell the restaurant in 1978. In 1987, Vaughn's son  Kevin purchased the property and renamed the restaurant ``Rupe's  Burgers.''   Rupe's Burgers prides itself on its dedication to community service.  The Rupe family donates and volunteers for local philanthropic  missions, such as the Santa's Helpers Program, a holiday drive  organized by Bingham County emergency responders to provide gifts to  economically disadvantaged children. The restaurant has also donated to  local organizations that promote the success and leadership of women,  such as Blackfoot Distinguished Young Women and Soroptimists. In  addition to its philanthropic efforts, the Rupe family puts a premium  on serving and celebrating the Blackfoot community, featuring  memorabilia from local school sports teams and providing nearly 50 jobs  to the local community.   Congratulations to Kevin and all of the employees of Rupe's Burgers  on being selected as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for June  2021, and congratulations on 34 years in business. You make our great  State proud, and I look forward to your continued growth and  success.                            ____________________
