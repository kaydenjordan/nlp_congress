 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 8, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced       by $10,000,000)''.        Page 34, line 18, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $10,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 478, the gentleman  from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin) and a Member opposed each will control  5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment today to support the DOD Cyber  Scholarship Program with strong bipartisan support from my good  friends, Mr. Ratcliffe, Ms. Stefanik, Mr. Correa, Ms. Rosen, Mr. Lieu,  and Ms. Shea-Porter.   Mr. Chairman, since 2001, DOD has run the Information Assurance  Scholarship Program in order to boost the Nation's cyber workforce  through scholarship and capacity-building grants. Scholarship  recipients are required to fulfill a service obligation by working in a  cybersecurity position at DOD upon graduation.   Mr. Chairman, this program had been extremely successful, bringing  nearly 600 students into the DOD workforce. However, due to budget  constraints, the Department has reduced funding and stopped recruiting  new students. This year we seek to reinvigorate the  [[Page H6497]]  program, calling it the DOD Cyber Scholarship Program.   As the ranking member of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on  Emerging Threats and Capabilities, I fully understand the budget  pressure the Department has been facing. However, cutting the pipeline  of cyber talent into the Department is incredibly shortsighted. We face  a critical workforce shortage right now, as we speak, when it comes to  cybersecurity across all sectors of the economy and in government.   The challenges of building up our cyber talent is something that  keeps me up at night. We know that cybersecurity is the national  security issue of the 21st century and that no conflict, both today or  in the future, will be fought without a cyber component as a part of  it.   Now, DOD has made significant strides in preparing to defend the  Nation in this new domain, standing up USCYBERCOM and improving its  cybersecurity posture through programs like the wildly successful Hack  the Pentagon program and DARPA's Cyber Grand Challenge. But these  initiatives need talented network engineers, cybersecurity researchers,  and, yes, hackers.   The Cyber Scholarship Program encourages students to look at  cybersecurity as an area of academic study and then exposes them to the  amazing mission set at the Department. While we may not be able to  compete on a dollar-to-dollar basis with the private sector in terms of  salary, public service certainly is its own reward, and DOD has the  most challenging and rewarding problems facing us today and the honor  that comes with protecting their fellow Americans.   We need as many digital natives to enter this exciting field and  experience the rewards of public service, which is why we must  reinvigorate the Cyber Scholarship Program with this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I worked with the same colleagues who joined me on this  amendment to include similar funding in the National Defense  Authorization Act. I would like to thank my friends, Senators Kaine,  Perdue, and Rounds for leading a similar effort across the Capitol in  the Senate.   So I would also like to, again, thank Chairwoman Granger and Ranking  Member Visclosky for their steadfast commitment to our armed services.  This commonsense amendment will help ensure DOD is prepared for future  fights, and I urge its adoption.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, just briefly, I thank my colleagues that  were speaking in favor of my amendment. I thank the majority for  accepting the amendment and supporting the effort to build up our  Nation's cyber workforce.   Cybersecurity is the national security challenge of the 21st century.  We are doing great things to meet those challenges. We just need to  make sure our workforce can meet those needs. I know this amendment  will be a major step in helping us to achieve that goal.   I thank all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and I thank the  chair and ranking member for their support of this effort.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).   The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Suozzi    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10  printed in part B of House Report 115-261.
