 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor People  Incorporated, a leading nonprofit and human service agency in western  New York.   This year, People Incorporated is celebrating its 50th year of  service to western New Yorkers with intellectual and developmental  disabilities, as well as families and older adults.   The agency was founded in 1970 by a small group of parents and  professionals to better meet the needs of people with disabilities and  their loved ones.   Since then, People Incorporated has grown and expanded its services.  They currently serve over 10,000 individuals and families every single  year.   People Incorporated provides access to housing and healthcare in a  safe and welcoming environment. Their innovative services have helped  thousands of people across western New York to live independently.   I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking People Incorporated for 50  years of compassionate community care.                            ____________________
