 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Horsford and the coanchors  for this evening, the gentleman from Maryland and the gentlewoman from  California.   I do rise today to lend my testimony to the conversation about police  reform, safe communities, and the value of Black lives.   The brutal beating and the death of Tyre Nichols is a reminder that  we do, indeed, have a long way to go to solve the structural racism and  the systemic police violence in America.   Tyre was a son. He was a father. I am a mother and a grandmother of  sons and daughters. He had a passion for skateboarding and photography,  a young person with purpose, potential, and his life was ahead of him.   The Congressional Black Caucus has always been the conscience of the  Congress, and that is why we are pushing  [[Page H704]]  for reforms to our justice system, specifically regarding the actions  and the conduct of law enforcement because no one in this Nation should  fear interacting with police officers in their communities, but many  Black and Brown people do each and every day. Everybody wants to be  safe, and we want safer communities.   Tyre Nichols should still be alive today. That is why we must address  the public health epidemic of police violence that disproportionately  affects our communities.   Senator Tim Scott, a Republican, in his quote was absolutely right:         We have got to unite against this blatant disregard, he       said, for human life, especially from those who have been       entrusted with immense power and responsibility for our       communities.    We are keenly aware that the police are asked to handle situations  sometimes that they simply aren't trained for or equipped to handle.  But like many CBC members, I've been there when a police beating or  shooting rocked our communities.   In my home of Charlotte, North Carolina, Keith Lamont Scott was  having a mental health crisis when he was shot and killed by police,  leading to the first major protest and demonstration for Black lives in  our community.   That doesn't absolve the officers involved of responsibility, but  what it does mean is that with better training and a different approach  to policing, Keith Lamont Scott could be alive today, and he should be.   Another man, Justin Carr, lost his life during the protests. Keith  Lamont Scott and Justin Carr should both still be alive today.   Something has got to change to prevent further unnecessary deaths,  and that is why the CBC and I have consistently supported the George  Floyd Justice in Policing Act and other necessary reforms.   Police culture needs to change, and it needs to change right now.  That is why the CBC is actively engaging all relevant stakeholders with  the aim of developing a legislative solution that can pass Congress and  ensure meaningful police accountability reforms.   For every mom and dad and son and daughter, and for every Black  person, it is imperative that we deal with this issue and form some  legislative solutions and some executive actions and community-based  results.   That is how we can put an end to this pattern of Black lives being  taken at the hands of law enforcement.   I leave you with the words of Zianna Oliphant, who was 9 years old  when she addressed the Charlotte City Council in the wake of the Keith  Lamont Scott protests in 2016.   She said: ``I feel like that we are treated differently than other  people. I don't like how we're treated. Just because of our color. . .  .   ``We are Black people, and we shouldn't have to feel like this. We  shouldn't have to protest because y'all are treating us wrong. We do  this because we need to and have rights.   ``I was born and raised in Charlotte. I've never felt this way until  now. I can't stand how we're treated. It's a shame that our fathers and  mothers are killed, and we can't even see them anymore.''   Mr. Speaker, 9 years old, this young lady was. The truth is clear.  Children can even see it. I hope as the CBC continues its work, more of  our colleagues will see the truth as well.
