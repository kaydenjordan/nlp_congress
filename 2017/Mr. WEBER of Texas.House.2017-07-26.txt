 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Make  America Secure Appropriations Act of 2018. I am particularly pleased to  support language from H.R. 3266, which provides appropriations for  energy programs within the Science, Space, and Technology Committee's  jurisdiction.   For years, the Energy Subcommittee, which I chair, has listened to  experts and gathered data to determine appropriate priorities for the  DOE. The bill brought before the House floor reflects the findings of  the committee. It funds basic and early-stage research, and it does so  all the while reducing spending.   Importantly, this bill includes specific appropriations for programs  authorized in my bill, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act,  which establishes a clear timeline and parameters for DOE to complete a  research reactor. This type of research requires access to fast  neutrons currently only available in Russia.    The completion of our own research reactor is crucial, Mr. Chairman,  in ensuring materials and nuclear fuels R&D takes place in these United  States of America. The versatile neutron source, or fast test reactor,  authorized in my legislation will provide the United States with this  vital capability.   I want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen for specifically including $35  million in funding, and Chairman Simpson, to begin the design and  construction of vital research infrastructure in this appropriations  bill.   America must maintain our nuclear capabilities and continue to  develop cutting-edge technology here at home. This bill provides  direction and robust funding for early-stage nuclear energy research.  Without it, we will fall behind.   It is vital that we ensure this important research and development is  fully funded. We cannot afford to miss the economic opportunities  provided by next generation nuclear technology. I encourage my  colleagues to support this pro-science, fiscally responsible  legislation.
