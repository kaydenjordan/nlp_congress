 Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to commend our  chairman, Mr. Roe, and ranking member, Mr. Walz, for their bipartisan  efforts.   I rise to speak on S. 544, the bill that will eliminate the sunset on  the Veterans Choice Program.   The Veterans Choice Program was a bipartisan effort to quickly help  our veterans in need by ensuring they had access to quality health care  after the crisis in Phoenix. However, it was a temporary program. It  was not intended to last longer than a few years until Congress could  have developed the future of VA community care. As many of my  colleagues note, the Choice Program needs an update. This bill  represents the first step of that process.    It is expected that the Veterans Choice fund will still have funding  by August 2017, as noted, when the Choice Program is scheduled to  sunset. This bill will ensure that our veterans will be able to use  those resources, and it will ensure those who have long-term care  through the Choice Program will not suddenly find themselves without  care.   But, as we design a new program to replace the Choice Program, we  must ensure that it is an effective and efficient system of care that  follows the very best practices of American health care. Part of that  is ensuring that these healthcare practitioners do not discriminate on  the basis of race, sex, gender, or sexual orientation.   The current Choice Program eliminated those protections to facilitate  faster implementation, and while I am concerned of the regulatory  burden these antidiscrimination measures could provide, I am committed  to working with my colleagues across the aisle on a commonsense and  reasonable compromise. We can make a program that not only provides  effective and accessible care for our veterans, but also prevents  discrimination in the workplace and upholds the finest ideals of the  United States of America.
