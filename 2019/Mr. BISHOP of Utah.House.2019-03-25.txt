 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar) taking the lead this evening and talking about this  important issue.   Look, one of the things we always need to do is learn the lessons of  history, so we simply do not repeat them.   In the late 1800-1900s, communism was the new government concept that  excited the elites of that particular era to the point that it was such  an expansive idea, that part of the reason that Woodrow Wilson wrote  his 14 points was to intellectually challenge communism and restate the  significance of democracy and republican forms of government.   When communism did obviously take root in the Soviet Union and China,  it was not a philosophical statement, it was simply an excuse for the  good, old-fashioned dictators to tell people how to live their lives.   So as Lenin called it, it was important to have the vanguard of the  proletariat, so the government would tell people how to think until  people realized that the government was right in the first place.   Those are some of the parts of history that we never want to repeat  again.   Now, if the Green New Deal, this toothless wish, was merely a one- and-done manifesto, then maybe that would be one thing, but my fear is,  it becomes an opening salvo into the dangers that are stated when we  decide that the government must find the solutions, the government must  tell people what to think and what to do, that elites are the ones who  have all the ideas; when in reality, history has shown us that  solutions always come from people who were empowered to find and make  decisions for themselves, and find solutions for themselves.   People need to be given options. People need to be given choices,  people need to be able to chart their own destiny.   My fear is elitism enriches and empowers would-be autocrats,  denigrates the roles of individuals, and those are dangerous attitudes  that must be discussed and must be understood in some way.   And let's face it, some of the people--the cheerleaders for the Green  New Deal--they simply don't get it.   When they live in areas where commutes, family errands are measured  in blocks and subway stops, that is different from other people in  America who, when they take a drive into town to buy school clothes  that is going to take the entire afternoon.   It is different than people who realize that they have to make a  choice between healthcare and heating their home; and that is a real  responsibility for them, and a real problem.   The burdens imposed by the Green New Deal, which have been outlined  by several speakers already, are those that land squarely on the  shoulders of humble, hardworking Americans while the elites pat  themselves on the back.   For the rural west, my State of Utah, it is not really a Green New  Deal; it is, rather, a green raw deal for them to live.   Now, recently in my committee where I am the ranking member, we had  an amendment that Mr. Graves made to one of the rules that would  request an analysis of economics before any bill was considered.   Now, one of the freshmen Democrats spoke to that issue, and I want to  just restate what he said. I thought what he said was profound.   He stated, I think we have to be very mindful of the people, their  jobs, their ability to pay their bills, because of the changes that we  make.   And this is a discussion that should always be had. We shouldn't just  be speaking in the theoretical.   Now, ironically, even though I thought his words were spot on, that  motion to have that policy was defeated.   Nonetheless, I recently joined other ranking members in asking  Speaker Pelosi that if there was serious discussion, that unlike H.R.  1, this is going to be heard by many committees, many voices will have  a chance at talking about what will actually happen.   These hearings ought to ask how this Green New Deal might impact  energy prices and home prices and jobs and healthcare.   So far, those who have done the series of studies--so far they're  from the  [[Page H2789]]  outside--the outlook looks pretty bleak on what the potential could  indeed be.   There are already many complex examples of negative impacts that  would happen if this was actually to become a reality.   So as stated in our plea to Speaker Pelosi, I do fear that this Green  New Deal would hurt Americans struggling to make ends meet, the very  people it purports to help. And worst of all, it could permanently put  the American Dream out of reach for millions of people.   We need to really look very carefully at this and not just assume  statements that are being made taking place. We need to learn from  history and not repeat those same mistakes.   Mr. Speaker, I am appreciative of having the opportunity of being  here as part of this Special Order to try and talk about some of the  realities of this purported deal.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity of  speaking one more time here especially because this is such a  significant issue that you are addressing to the people and because, as  leader of the Congressional Western Caucus, you have held a whole lot  of forums to discuss the implications of what could be there.   So in one of the last forums, we had policy think tanks and industry  and conservation groups that were there testifying. I was struck by the  comments of Thomas Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance,  when he said: ``For nearly a decade now, the United States, long  blessed with vast natural resources, has benefited from the greatest  energy expansion in the history of the world. Our energy producers have  delivered the low-cost, affordable, and reliable energy that has fueled  economic growth and opportunity for all Americans, no matter their  race, sex, creed, or color.''   Now, it is interesting, as we talk about this concept, that,  according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, by 2020 the  United States will become a net exporter of energy for the first time  since 1953. That means no longer are we going to be reliant upon  questionable foreign powers like Russia or Saudi Arabia for our energy.   Even the concepts that we have developed, the fracking and horizontal  drilling, those concepts have allowed us not only to expand what we are  doing, but also have allowed us to have a carbon emission reduction at  the same time. We were the world leader in carbon reduction in 2015,  2016, and 2017, and we are still on that same track again.   In fact, one of the things I find unique about the Green New Deal is  it fails to realize that, because of what we have been able to do in  oil and natural gas, energy prices are down for those who are most  vulnerable in our society. We can afford to cook our food and heat our  homes better than ever before.   And while this production has risen significantly, methane emissions  have decreased at the same time. In fact, the EPA reported that U.S.  greenhouse gas emissions are already down 10 percent in the last 10  years.   So while the Green New Deal has every potential of destroying jobs  for millions of people, it still also ignores other alternatives for  green energy. For example, it says absolutely nothing about nuclear or  hydropower.   Let's face it, 10 percent of our energy today stills comes from  hydropower, and hydropower is clean. It leaves behind no waste. It is  considered one of the most effective ways of producing electricity. And  yet it is absurd to believe that we can achieve zero net carbon  emissions without dealing with nuclear or without dealing with  hydropower as part of the mix. That is part of the reality that needs  to be brought out here.   We have grown our economics. We have cleaned our environment. We have  lowered the cost of living for so many people.   We should not denigrate everything that the current system is already  doing that for some people, for some elitists, they simply want to try  to ignore that and ignore the fact that, if we want to continue on this  path, what we need to do is empower people to be able to come up with  solutions on their own. It is not going to happen by the government  telling people how to live and what to think. We need to empower  people, not empower the government.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the opportunity of expressing  that idea again.    Mr. Speaker, one of the problems that Baltic  countries have--Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania--is they are right next- door to the monolith Russia, that has used its energy potential to  blackmail and intimidate these other countries. Even today, they have  finally broken away from their oil and gas dependency on Russia. Their  electrical grid is still tied to Russia.   What Lithuania was able to do is import a natural gas mobile station.  They were able to get off of the Russian dependency so they could, once  again, have their own resources coming in there.   Estonia does the same thing with their oil shale. They have been able  to produce their own energy, which allows them to have independence and  not be bullied by large countries, in this case, by Russia.   That is one of the things we are doing in what we are already doing.  That is one of the futures that we are having. In fact, it is  interesting that some of the countries we visited that were very proud  of what they were doing with alternative energy, they always have to  have a backup system.    And that backup system is based on coal. Without  that, they could not guarantee baseloads that they have to have just to  keep their countries going.  [[Page H2791]]         Mr. Speaker, I guess what the gentleman is saying  is, if you want the economy to grow, if you want people to be  empowered, if you want to find solutions not only to environmental  issues but also energy issues, empower people to come up with that. We  are actually doing that.   America's history is a history that is positive. Empower that to go  forward. Don't try and stop it with some other elitist idea from the  top-down theories.    Mr. Speaker, that is true.
