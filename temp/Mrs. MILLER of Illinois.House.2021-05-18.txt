 Madam Speaker, our Nation must be united in  our condemnation of the acts of terror and stand in support of the  State of Israel, our ally and strategic partner, the beacon of light in  the Middle East.   Hamas is a terrorist organization with the sole purpose of destroying  Israel. Since last Monday, more than 3,000 rockets have been fired from  Gaza into Israel.   One of my daughter's close friends attended school in Israel. She has  been awakened to rockets being fired over her head, and she has spent  days on high alert, ready to run for shelter at any given moment.   No country would tolerate thousands of rocket attacks against major  cities and population centers. Israel has the obligation and duty to  defend its citizens against the violent attacks from Hamas.   Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East. President Trump was  the President of peace. His agenda was right, and the United States  should stand strong as a friend to Israel.   My family and I will continue to pray for the peace and safety of the  people of Israel as they combat terrorism.                            ____________________
