 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding and  for his leadership, and I thank the chairman for his commitment to  bipartisanship as well. I believe this NDAA is a true testament to  that.   I rise today in support of H.R. 7900, the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2023  because our investments in modernization and innovation are more  important than ever.    Our adversaries are focused on our defeat, on and off the  battlefield. China is pouring money into research and development of  emerging technologies, recruiting top scientists, and stealing  intellectual property to gain a tactical edge.   This NDAA pushes the Department to accelerate innovation and  strengthen its cyber posture, both of which are critical to maintaining  superiority in this era of great power competition.   I am proud of the work that my subcommittee has accomplished, the  Cyber, Innovative Technologies, and Information Systems Subcommittee,  along with Chairman Langevin, throughout this bill. Our commitment to  work together, I believe, is shown in  [[Page H6224]]  the input that we have both worked across the aisle to include in this  year's NDAA.   We included provisions to improve opportunities for early-career  scientists to work with DARPA. This NDAA authorizes great work that the  Defense Innovation Unit is doing to field commercial technology by  doubling its funding, and it expands the critical work being done in  biotechnology and batteries.   We bolstered and strengthened the Department's information security  systems and gave Cyber Command the tools that it needs to succeed.   As the ranking member of the Cyber, Innovative Technologies, and  Information Systems Subcommittee, I support this bill fully and  encourage my colleagues to do the same.
