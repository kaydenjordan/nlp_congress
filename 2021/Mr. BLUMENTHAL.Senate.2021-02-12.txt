 I am going to be fighting--fight like hell.         We're going to fight like hell.        I'm going to fight like hell.        Fight like hell.         Mr. President, I send a question to the desk for the  House managers.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut, Senator  Blumenthal, has a question for the House managers.   The clerk will read the question.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         Former President Trump and his attorneys have cited the       Brandenburg v. Ohio case in support of their argument that       the First Amendment protects Trump. Did the Brandenburg case       prohibit holding public officials accountable, through the       impeachment process, for the incitement of violence?    Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, Mr. President, Senators.   So let's start with the letter of more than 140 constitutional law  professors, which I think they described as partisan in nature. That is  a slur on the law professors, and I hope that they would withdraw that.  There are very conservative luminaries on that list, including the  cofounder of the Federalist Society, Ronald Reagan's former Solicitor  General, Charles Fried; as well as prominent law professors across the  intellectual, ideological, and First Amendment spectrum. And they all  called their First Amendment arguments frivolous, which they are.   Now, they have retreated to the position of Brandenburg v. Ohio. They  want their client to be treated like a guy at the mob, I think they  said, a guy in the crowd who yells something out. Even on that  standard, this group of law professors said there is a very strong  argument that he is guilty even under the strict Brandenburg standard.   Why? Because he incited imminent, lawless action and he intended to  do it and he was likely to cause it. How did we know he was likely to  cause it? He did cause it. They overran the Capitol, right?   So even if you want to hold the President of the United States of  America to that minimal standard and forget about his constitutional  oath of office, as I said before, that would be a dereliction of  legislative duty on our part if we said all we are going to do is treat  the President of the United States like one of the people he summoned  to Washington to commit an insurrection against us. OK.   The President swore to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution  of the United States. That is against all comers, domestic or foreign.  That is what ours says, right? Did he do that? No. On the contrary. He  is like the fire chief. He doesn't just say: Go ahead and shout  ``fire'' inside a theater. He summons the mob and sends the mob to go  burn the theater down, and when people start madly calling him and  ringing alarm bells, he watches it on TV. And he takes his sweet time  for several hours and turns up the heat on the deputy fire chief, whom  he is mad at because he is not making it possible for him to pursue his  political objectives   And then, when we say, ``We don't want you to be fire chief ever  again,'' he starts crying about the First Amendment. Brandenburg was a  case about a bunch of Klansmen who assembled in a field, and they  weren't near anybody such that they could actually do violent damage to  people, but they said some pretty repulsive, racist things. But the  Supreme Court said they weren't inciting imminent lawless action  because you couldn't have a mob, for example, break out, the way that  this mob broke out and took over the Capitol of the United States of  America.   And, by the way, don't compare him to one of those Klansmen in the  field asserting their First Amendment rights. Assume that he were the  chief of police of the town who went down to that rally and started  calling for, you know, a rally at the city hall and then nurturing that  mob, cultivating that mob, pulling them in over a period of weeks and  days, naming the date and the time and the place, riling them up  beforehand, and then just say: Be my guest. Go and stop the steal.   Come on. Back to Tom Paine. Use your common sense. Use your common  [[Page S692]]  sense. That is the standard of proof we want. They are already treating  their client like he is a criminal defendant. They are talking about  beyond a reasonable doubt. They think that we are making a criminal  case here.   My friends, the former President is not going to spend 1 hour or 1  minute in jail. This is about protecting our Republic and articulating  and defining the standards of Presidential conduct, and if you want  this to be a standard for totally appropriate Presidential conduct  going forward, be my guest, but we are headed for a very different kind  of country at that point.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.
