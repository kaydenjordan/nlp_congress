 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I am delighted to come  to the floor this evening for this Special Order, because I come to pay  tribute to an iconic American, John H. Johnson, the founder of the  Johnson Publishing Company, the founder of Ebony magazine, Jet  magazine, Fashion Fair, three radio stations that he owned, a  television station, and lots of other business interests and ventures.   Growing up in southeast Arkansas during the 1950s and coming into  contact with a Jet magazine or an Ebony that one of the schoolteachers  may have in his or her possession or one of the ministers may have  brought to town from wherever they came or the hairdresser may have had  one or two, that was an exciting thing for a young African-American boy  in the rural South.   Little did I know that the man responsible for those products had  grown up just a few miles away, or at least until he was in the ninth  grade, John H. Johnson, Arkansas City, Arkansas. Close to McGehee;  Dermott; Lake Village; Eudora; Greenville, Mississippi, all of those  little towns.   Of course, John H. Johnson was fond of being a storyteller. He used  to tell the story of how his mother had told him: Johnny, when you  finish the eighth grade, we are going to move to Chicago so that you  can go to high school.   Then when he finished the eighth grade, she told him: Johnny, I  didn't save enough money for us to move, so you are going to have to go  to the eighth grade again. And he told her: No, mom. That is all right.  I will just go to work and help you save money. And she said: Nope, you  are going to the eighth grade again.                                time  2015    And so as bright as he must have been and as bright as he was, he had  to do the eighth grade twice. Of course, eventually they did move to  Chicago. He did go to high school. As a matter of fact, he went to high  school with Redd Foxx and with Nat King Cole, and Mr. Abernathy, who  owned and built a taxi company. He even went to school with Professor  Timuel Black, who just died a few weeks ago. Tim was 102. He released  his last book 2 years ago when he was 100.   And so John H. Johnson did go to high school at Phillips and DuSable,  became president of his class, of course editor of the yearbook, editor  of the school newspaper, and he was then offered a scholarship to the  University of Chicago.   Well, he wasn't sure that he could go because he wasn't sure that he  would have enough money, even with the scholarship. But he made a  speech at an Urban League dinner, and the fellow who owns Supreme Life  Insurance liked it, and he hired him to come and  [[Page H6120]]  work for him. So he was then able to make use of his scholarship and go  to school.   After working for Supreme for 2 years, he actually became the  president's assistant because he was so industrious and so bright and  all of everything that he was.   Then he decided he would go into business for himself, and so he  managed to borrow $500 or make use of $500 that his mother let him have  or use, and he started his publishing business, a little magazine. He  developed it and got so good at it until he did another one.   He developed the Ebony magazine; he developed the Jet magazine; and  at the height he had 2,300,000 subscribers. He was zipping and zooming.   Part of what propelled him was the fact that in 1955 when Emmett Till  was mutilated, murdered, and killed, he published the gruesome  photographs of Emmett Till, and many people proclaimed that that really  jump-started in a serious way the modern day civil rights movement  because as people saw the gruesomeness of the murder of Emmett Till,  they became motivated, engaged, involved.   It was the era that produced Dr. Martin Luther King, John Lewis,  civil rights icons.   But at the same time that Mr. Johnson was publishing his magazines,  he was really projecting the positivity of African Americans, showing  Blacks who were superstars, promoting the idea.   The fact that he had to come to Chicago to high school was not really  anything unusual. Many towns in the rural South at that time did not  have high schools for African Americans. As a matter of fact, many of  them didn't have any schools at all. Julius Rosenwald and Booker  Washington teamed up and got with people in communities, and they built  5,000 schools. They are called the Rosenwald schools. As a matter of  fact, our iconic colleague John Lewis attended one of those. John went  to a Rosenwald school.   But John Johnson continued to develop his business and became so good  at it; and he was a great storyteller himself. He didn't work as a  journalist. He worked as a businessman. But he had stories that he  could tell.   I was so amazed to get to meet him and know him and live in the area  where his cousin lived, who introduced me to him. I remember we were in  a group, an organization, and somebody said we needed to raise $500 for  something, and somebody said, well, why don't we ask Johnny Johnson for  it? And his cousin, Miss Willie Miles Burns, who was the head of the  subscription department and worked for him, held up her hand, and she  said, Johnny Johnson, who is that? The fellow said, Oh, you know, the  guy down there at Ebony. And Miss Burns said, Oh, you mean Mr. John H.  Johnson? He ain't no Johnny Johnson. He is Mr. John H. Johnson. She  said, He is my relative, and I call him mister every time I call his  name.   Well, obviously Mr. John H. Johnson continued to develop his  businesses and ended up on the Forbes 400 as one of the wealthiest 400  people in the United States of America. He received every accolade,  every honor, every possibility of people acknowledging what he could do  and what he had done.   He used to tell a story about building a building, owning a building  on Michigan Avenue, and he couldn't purchase it because the people who  owned it wouldn't sell it to him. So he got a friend of his to purchase  it for him. Even to this day, the legend in Chicago is that he has the  only building on Michigan Avenue that has a driveway where you can  drive in off the street and go through the building.   Notwithstanding any and all of that, John H. Johnson was a very  common man. You could walk up to him and talk with him. He went down  every day and picked up his newspaper and had a conversation with the  person who sold the newspaper.   Of course, he ended up with all kinds of honorary doctorates, degrees  from Harvard University, the University of Arkansas.    I was thrilled and delighted to go down to Arkansas City with him  when they decided to move the home that he had lived in from where it  was located and moved it downtown to make a museum out of it. It was a  two-room house, but it's called a shotgun house. Shotgun just meant you  could open the front door and open the back door, and you could look  all the way through, out into the back. Well, they moved the house from  its location down to near the courthouse in Arkansas City, and that is  where it currently is located.   Of course, Mr. Johnson was given the Medal of Freedom by President  Clinton. He was Man of the Year from the national Chamber of Commerce,  the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP, all of this but still being a  regular kind of person.   Of course, the Congressional Black Caucus honored him. How could we  not? He was obviously an icon who demonstrated that it really wasn't so  much where you came from as much as it was where you were going. It  didn't really matter what didn't exist. It was what you created. And he  obviously was one of the most creative individuals. He had a book  publishing company that Lerone Bennett wrote ``Before the Mayflower''  and published it.   After all was said and done, John H. Johnson was an unusual man, an  outstanding man that the poet may have been thinking of when he  suggested that:       If you can keep your head when all about you      Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;      If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,      But make allowances for their doubting, too;      If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,      Or, being lied about . . . or being hated . . .      And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise.      If you can dream--and not make dreams your master;      If you can think--and not make thoughts your aim,      If you can meet with triumph and disaster      And treat those two impostors just the same . . . `'    Well, John H. Johnson, a man who will always be a historic figure,  who gave so much to America. Two years ago the Arkansas General  Assembly decided to make November 1 a State holiday, honoring a native  son, as November 1, 1945, was the date John H. Johnson launched Ebony  and thats the ideal date to celebrate his legacy.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Johnson for what he meant not just for  Arkansas but what he meant for America.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
