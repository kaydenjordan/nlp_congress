 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the world's eyes are trained this week  on the people of China who appear to be engaged in the largest and most  widespread protests against the country's repressive Communist Party  government since 1989 and the events of Tiananmen Square.   While most of the rest of the world has learned how to adapt to the  coronavirus, mitigate its worst effects, and get on with living our  lives, the people of China, where the whole crisis began, are still  trapped in a ``Groundhog Day'' of permanent pandemic measures.   Chairman Xi's so-called Zero COVID policy is managing to be both  horribly repressive and totally ineffective at the very same time-- horribly repressive and totally ineffective at the very same time. They  have had unending cycles of punishing lockdowns, repressive  quarantines, and mass testing.   Reports and social media posts are flying around the country--like  allegations that the government let people burn up in an apartment  building fire rather than break quarantine and that a 4-month-old baby  girl died because the COVID rules did not allow her to get proper  medical treatment. Of course, sadly, none of this is new or an  aberration. This is actually perfectly in line with the CCP's long and  brutal history.   As in the past, the CCP is failing their citizens and lying about it.  When the rest of the world tunes in to World Cup matches, they see  cheering crowds. But in China, the broadcasts censor views of the  stands to prevent their citizens from seeing unmasked foreigners  enjoying actually a normal life.   The people of China have put up with this dystopian state of affairs  for nearly 3 years now, and now their patience has ended. Across  China's major cities, residents are taking to the streets and speaking  out. Local, civil protests are not uncommon in China, but these  protests appear to have a different character--more widespread, more  bold and brave, more fed up.   Unsurprisingly, demonstrators have received harsh treatment from the  authorities who reportedly have beaten protesters and detained a  foreign journalist covering the events.   The state media keeps parroting propaganda, but video evidence of the  protests and the heavyhanded response is getting through the CCP's  ``Great Firewall.'' Thus far, the people have not backed down.   Now, you hear some people suggesting that if a clumsy authoritarian  nation is facing such troubles at home, it must pose less of an  international threat than we thought. Ah, but this is precisely wrong.  Vladimir Putin's previous aggressions against Georgia and Ukraine, its  operations in Chechnya and Syria, and now this latest brutal war show  exactly how even clumsy and dysfunctional regimes can inflict a  terrible toll on free nations and free peoples. Iran, North Korea, and  Syria have spent decades proving the very same thing. Of course, China  isn't declining; it is continuing to expand and modernize its military  power. And Xi and  [[Page S6833]]  his CCP constantly show us that their view of denying their own  people's freedom at home and disrupting other countries' freedom  through the Indo-Pacific has two goals that actually go hand in hand.  For thugs and dictators, repression at home and aggression abroad are  two sides of the same coin.   So when we see the mismanagement and dysfunction from regimes like  Putin's and Xi's, the answer is not--not--for America and our allies to  relax our vigilance, pull inward, or pay less attention to our global  interests; the answer is to increase our vigilance, redouble our  strength, and keep our friends and partners even closer.   The Biden administration's statement yesterday on the Chinese  people's protest was actually too tepid. But what we need are not just  stronger short-term words but stronger long-term actions and  strategies.   The support that America and our friends have provided to Ukraine has  not just been an act of philanthropy to an innocent people who deserve  help fighting off the invaders; it is also bringing major benefits to  the United States and our partners in the most practical terms.   In the course of fighting for their homes and families, the brave  people of Ukraine are seriously degrading the abilities of one of the  free world's greatest self-appointed adversaries to deal out violence.  Putin and other wannabe tyrants the world over are learning that the  cost-benefit calculus to bullying and bloodshed doesn't look like they  thought it would.   The importance of this deterrence goes beyond just Europe. China has  spent decades investing steadily in military technologies that increase  threats to U.S. forces and our allies in the region. The CCP has  steadily built military installations in the South China Sea, like a  bully standing on a street corner, trying to grab control over  international waters and shipping lanes. China has spent years  methodically building up the very capabilities it would need to seize  Taiwan by force if its people refuse to bend the knee, as we have  already seen them do in Hong Kong.   So clearly we need to invest in our own strength, in our own  alliances, in our own military modernization and defense industrial  base.   The United States needs a strong, well-equipped military capable of  preserving the strategic advantage and projecting power anywhere in the  world. We need allies and partners willing to invest in their own  capabilities. We need our private sector and our partners to understand  that free peoples ought to be doing more trading among ourselves but be  a lot more careful locating their capital and their employees in a  repressed country that disregards basic freedoms and steals  intellectual property on an industrial scale.   We need a sufficient military industrial base to keep ourselves safe  and remain the free world's arsenal--a win-win for our security and for  our economy. Among other things, that means rebuilding munitions  stockpiles and weapons inventories that have been allowed to atrophy  since the end of the Cold War. It means not waiting to arm and train  our partners until a bad actor has already started a war. It means not  wasting American strength and credibility, as this administration has  done by desperately chasing sweetheart deals with Iran and abandoning  Afghanistan with no strategy.   Providing for the common defense is one of our basic duties here in  Congress. The Democratic leader should have prioritized the National  Defense Authorization Act months ago. I am glad we will finally be  turning to this essential bill shortly. Strong funding and strong  authorization for our national security should never have to be a  partisan issue. I know our Democratic friends have internal  disagreements about what level of funding our Armed Forces deserve, but  Republicans can guarantee this much: Our side will keep standing strong  for American security and American strength.                            ____________________
