 Mr. President, I so appreciate the comments of the  minority leader.                            ____________________     Mr. President, oftentimes, when I am home and I am  talking to constituents in Nevada, they look at Washington as a bubble.  They don't really think that things happen here unless they see it on  the news or they have no trust in us really coming together to work on  behalf of our constituents.   I think it is time we focus on what needs to be done in the best  interest of our country than focusing on political gain or  gamesmanship.   The reason why I say that is, I don't know about the President pro  tempore, but I know every single Senator comes from a State, and they  care about their constituents. They get emails from their constituents  and letters from their constituents. When we go home, we claim to be in  a recess, but it is not really a recess. We are home working. We are  talking to our constituents and businesses and the individuals who are  there. And if we are really listening to our constituents, particularly  at a time like now, when this pandemic has created the worst health  crisis we have seen not just in this country but around the world and  has contributed to an economic crisis, then we are hearing from our  constituents that they are struggling right now.   The reason they are struggling is because we have asked them to stay  at home and shelter in place to stem the spread of this virus. We have  said: Listen, we don't have a vaccine. We are working on it, but we  don't have it right away. We need to ramp up our tests so we can make  sure you can get it, and quickly, to determine whether you have this  virus or the antibodies so we can then quarantine you and shelter you.  But until we even get to that point, we have asked everybody to stay  home. And they have done it.   I know in my State of Nevada, we have the highest unemployment rate  in this country right now--25 percent.  [[Page S5388]]  Businesses have shuttered. People have stayed home to help us stem the  spread of this virus. What we told them months ago is that, if you do  this, we will be there. Our Federal Government will be there to work  with you. We will help you. We will make sure you have money in your  pocket so you can afford healthcare, so you can pay your bills, so you  can pay your rent, you can pay for your food, so you do not have to  have any economic insecurity. We made that commitment to them. We  promised them.   I have to say that we still have to follow that obligation. They are  doing their part, so why aren't we doing ours?   At the end of the day, the President pro tempore and I both know, and  all of our colleagues know, that there is more economic insecurity in  this country right now than we have ever seen before because of this  pandemic: food insecurity, housing insecurity, job insecurity,  education insecurity. There is a homework gap. We know it. It is  happening. So now it is time for us to stop the posturing, stop the  political gamesmanship and really do what we committed when we swore an  oath to this office when we were sworn in, that we were going to do  right by people across this country, looking out for their interests-- not our interests but the best interests of this country.   So I come to the floor today to really ask my colleagues: Let's try  and do what is right for the best interests of this country, now more  than ever.   I know you get them. I get letters. I have letters from constituents  right now--I can't tell you--and I have been inundated with them.   A constituent from Nevada wrote:         I urge you to extend the federal eviction moratorium and       include at least $100 billion in funding for emergency rental       assistance in the next . . . relief [package]. [This]       assistance will enable households, including those who have       lost jobs or who already were struggling to pay rent before       the pandemic, to remain stably housed and avoid the       devastating and long-lasting harms of eviction.    That is from a constituent. I didn't write that. They sent it to my  office. In this letter, this constituent from Nevada goes on to say:         It is important to be kind and compassionate. Especially       during this time. We have the opportunity to learn and to do       better always. No one should be forced out of their home       during a global pandemic.    Those are similar to other letters I receive. I know you receive  them. I know our colleagues receive them. That is why, today, it is  important for us to focus on so much that is happening, including that  economic security. Right now I want to focus on one piece of it that we  need to address that should be part of a global piece, which is this  idea that, right now, millions of Americans are concerned about being  evicted from their homes.   In the middle of a pandemic, when people need a safe place to call  home, they are concerned that they don't have the money to pay their  rent because we have asked them to stay home.   I have said this before on the floor of the Senate. I will say it  again. In the middle of a pandemic, housing is healthcare. Security in  your own home is healthcare. Yet we have millions of people across the  country on the brink of eviction.   In mid-July, a quarter of adults reported that they were housing  insecure. That is one in four. In more than half of the States in  America, eviction bans have expired. That means, across the Nation,  more and more families will have to pack up everything that they can  carry in the space of hours.   There could be 40 million evictions nationwide by the end of the  year, and what we have seen amongst the data that comes in to all of  our offices is that families of color are likely to be the hardest hit.  In my home State of Nevada, experts believe that nearly half a million  people are at risk of eviction--perhaps as many as 300,000 of them in  Nevada by September. Among renters, up to 47 percent face that risk.   Staving off Nevada evictions could cost Nevada $850 billion in rental  assistance over the next year. That is just one State. But do you know  what? The States, the local governments, everyone has been impacted by  this pandemic, and they are rightly looking to Congress to address it.  They are desperate for us to pass meaningful legislation to get them  money to pay their bills, to enact protections that let them stay in  their homes and apartments.   We need to help them now. We can't turn our backs. We cannot turn our  backs on Americans now, more than ever. They need our help. And we need  the administration, we need leadership--Republican leadership--coming  to the negotiating table to get real relief passed, not hollow  political gestures.   We need a package that will include housing and rental assistance,  prevent an epidemic of homelessness, and stabilize the housing markets  because, if we don't, the consequences are going to haunt families and  our economy for years.   Now, I know this. Take it from me. In Nevada, we saw 200,000 families  lose their homes because of the 2008 housing crisis. That foreclosure  crisis hit Nevada so hard, and it has been a long, long road back for  so many Nevadans.   I am determined not to ever see that happen again and to bring  relief. If I am in a position--as we all are here in Congress--to bring  that relief, why aren't we in a room negotiating it? Why are we not  talking regularly? We did it with the CARES Act immediately. We saw the  need, and we did something about it.   Nevadans are already struggling to find work, to afford food, and to  stay healthy during this pandemic; plus, they are helping their  children learn as schools start to reopen. They cannot effectively do  that--none of it--without a safe place to stay, a roof over their head.   Housing is the key to any sense of stability in our chaotic world  right now. It is time to end the political games. Americans expect it.  They need a roof over their head. That is why it is so vital we pass  legislation, not just to help Nevadans but people all over the country  pay their rent and utility bills when they cannot safely go to work  because of this health pandemic   We already have legislation that is out there. We know it. The House,  months ago, passed the Heroes Act, which addresses this issue. Our  colleagues have introduced legislation--Senator Brown's Emergency  Rental Assistance and Rental Market Stabilization Act is out there-- that can do the job. We can talk about how we bring this bill forward  that helps so many families.   It is not just rental stabilization but to help families keep a roof  over their head. Remember, there are a lot of small businesses that are  landlords. There are many businesses that are landlords who are  shouldering the missed opportunities, and they are struggling.  Landlords have bills to pay as well. They have mortgages; they have  taxes; they have insurance, staff--let alone their families whom they  have to take care of. Without assistance, many of them will go bankrupt  or can be forced to sell their properties.   So let's focus on the essentials, the basic need for things like  shelter. Let's keep people safe and off the streets. Let's pass Senator  Brown's rental assistance bill. Senator Reed has a housing assistance  fund bill to help homeowners avoid foreclosure. Senator Menendez has a  housing counseling bill. There are so many others. They are in front of  us.   We have an opportunity to do the right thing here. The Senate just  needs to do its part by making sure those homes are safe and stable, by  passing legislation that is going to have a positive impact on so many  Americans across this country.   I thank the Presiding Officer for listening. I thank my colleagues  for at least having the ability and the will to try to do something  through the legislation that was introduced, but now more needs to be  done. We can't just introduce legislation. Now is the time to do our  jobs as Senators: to come to the floor of the Senate, bring legislation  to the floor, and debate it. Let the American public actually see us  work and do our jobs that we promised them we would be doing.   It is OK to debate legislation. It is OK to compromise and come forth  with good government and good policy that is going to lift all of us  up. That is what the Senate should be doing, and that is what I look  forward to from my colleagues.   I yield the floor.
