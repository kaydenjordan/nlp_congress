 Mr. President, the committee is closely monitoring  upgrades to F-35 software and other capabilities under the continuous  capability development and delivery C2D2 stragetic modernization  framework. The principal purpose for C2D2 is the development of Block 4  software and weapons system upgrades, which also includes other  elements like Technical Refresh-3 and dual weapons capability, to  ensure the F-35 maintains it operational advantage. However, the  committee is concerned the planned F-35 air vehicle capability growth,  associated with Block 4 weapons systems enhancements, will exceed the  established thrust, power, and thermal management capabilities of the  current F135 propulsion system beginning with the delivery of Lot 18  aircraft. Such a capability gap between the current F135 performance  and future requirements could significantly constrain the operational  capabilities of the F-35 weapons system.   The committee is aware of a recent agreement to conduct a 6-month  propulsion study and operational assessment to determine the specific  F135 propulsion growth requirement that would address this capability  gap. The study to determine the future propulsion requirement is  expected to conclude in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. The  committee strongly endorses this approach and encourages the Department  of Defense to submit recommendations to Congress following completion  of the study. Further, the committee strongly supports a long-term  focus on propulsion improvements over fiscal years 2021-2025 necessary  to support engineering and manufacturing development for upgraded  engine production supporting the planned delivery of Lot 18 aircraft.   Therefore, the committee directs the Department of Defense and Joint  Program Office to establish an F135 Propulsion Growth Program that  ensures propulsion growth requirements are aligned with and support  weapons systems upgrade requirements. Finally, the committee directs  the Secretary of Defense to include funding in the fiscal year 2022  budget request to support the F135 Propulsion Growth Program across the  Future Years Defense Plan.                            ____________________
