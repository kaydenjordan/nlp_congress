 Mr. Speaker, in honor of National Police Week, I rise  today to recognize the Dunlap, Tennessee, Police Department on its  selection as a finalist for the 2018 Secretary of Defense Employer  Support Freedom Award.   This award, given each year by the National Committee for Employer  Support of the Guard, recognizes employers who go above and beyond to  support their employees serving in the National Guard and military  reserves. Out of 2,300 nominations nationwide, the Dunlap Police  Department was chosen as one of just 30 finalists for the award, whose  recipients will be announced next month.   Under the leadership of Police Chief Clint Huth, who is himself a  Navy Reserve Master Chief, the Dunlap Police Department has been active  in their support for their guard and their reserve employees.   Like many employers across the country, Chief Huth and the Dunlap PD  play an important role in our Nation's military readiness through their  unwavering support of our reserve components.   On behalf of Tennessee's Fourth District, I would like to  congratulate them on their recognition and offer my sincere gratitude  for the commitment they have made to our citizen soldiers.                            ____________________
