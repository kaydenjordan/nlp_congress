 Madam Speaker, I want to express my full support for  the brave Cubans who are demanding freedom from their tyrannical  communist government.   For over 60 years, the regime in Cuba has run the country into the  ground. It doesn't recognize the basic human rights of its citizens,  and Cuban people don't have access to food, economic opportunities, or  COVID-19 vaccines.   The Cuban people are now taking to the streets to fight for  individual liberty and freedom. As authoritarians do, the regime has  arrested hundreds of demonstrators and cut off their communication with  the outside world.   Madam Speaker, a communist government will do whatever it takes to  keep the Cuban people under its thumb. The Cuban Government has a lot  in common with the Chinese Communist Party. Both will stop at nothing  to hold on to power and have no regard for the rights of the people  they govern.   The Cuban government wants to silence its citizens' demands for  freedom, just as the Communist Chinese Party silences those in Hong  Kong and Xinjiang who simply want to be free.   Cubans, and Cuban Americans especially, know communism does not work.  It only brings poverty and oppression. It is our privilege as Americans  to live in a country that values freedom, the Lord, and we must support  those brave Cubans who want the same in our own backyard only 90 miles  off the coast of the Florida.                            ____________________
