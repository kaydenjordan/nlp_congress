 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding, and  especially thank our colleague, Cheri  [[Page H990]]  Bustos, for bringing this important legislation to us.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4445, the Ending  Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act.   In 2017, our country experienced a dramatic and needed shift. Women  in a variety of industries responded to news of allegations against  powerful men with the hashtag #MeToo, banding together in solidarity to  expose predatory behavior that has been overlooked and excused for  generations. But some women are still not able to speak out against  their abusers because forced arbitration agreements prevent them from  doing so.   Last year, the House Committee on the Judiciary heard testimony from  women from a variety of backgrounds and political parties, who have  suffered the dual injustices of sexual abuse and forced silence through  arbitration. Their stories illuminate how forced arbitration agreements  are too often used to protect assailants and their companies at the  expense of working women. It is past time for Congress to enable these  women to reclaim their voices and take control over their own lives.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4445.
