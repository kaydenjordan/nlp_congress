 Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Scanlon from  Pennsylvania for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield  myself as much time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I agree with Representative Scanlon. I want to open  the government. Republicans want to open the government. Democrats want  to open the government. So I respectfully ask House and Senate  Democrats to stop holding our Federal workers hostage.   You know, on December 20, I voted for and Republicans voted for in  the House a bill right here, standing right here on December 20, that  would have kept the government open, and then we would not have had any  of these discussions or need for these bills, because the government  would still be open. Unfortunately, not one Democrat Member of the  House voted for it.   I, too, have Federal workers in my district who are hurting, these  great men and women who work hard each and every day of their life,  single mothers who are waiting for their paycheck. So I call on my  colleagues across the aisle to please come to the negotiating table.   I believe the number one rule in Negotiations 101 is you have to show  up. Repeatedly, we have seen the Republicans and the President request  the Democrat leadership to come and negotiate, give a counteroffer.  They refuse to show up.   I say, if the House Republicans already passed a bill that would have  kept the government open and now we are at this impasse, but the  Democrat leadership refuses to come to even a negotiating table or a  counteroffer, I just don't know what to say.   Well, Madam Speaker, once again, we have returned to the House floor  to consider yet another short-term spending bill that once again is  most likely going nowhere. For what is now the fourth time in 3 weeks,  we have returned to the House floor on a rule to consider an  appropriations bill as part of the majority's efforts to fund the  government without working with President Trump.   Unfortunately, we think this effort is just as shortsighted as the  previous bills over the last couple of weeks, and today's rule is again  destined to ignore the fundamental realities at issue.   But first, as I said before, let's take a quick look at how we got to  this point.   On December 20, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would  have funded the government and prevented the shutdown. It included a  continuing resolution through February 8. It included disaster relief  and funding for border security that the Democrats say they want, but  are not listening to our own law enforcement on the border on their  recommendations. That was a bill the majority of the Senate supported  and the President said he would sign.                                time  0930    Unfortunately, as we all know, the Senate refused to take up the  House measure, mostly because of their 60-vote rule, where they need  Democrats to get on board, and parts of the government shut down when  appropriations lapsed. Again, not one single Democrat in the House  voted for this bill, which would have avoided this whole, entire  partial government shutdown.   On January 3, when the new Congress was sworn in, the House took up a  continuing resolution through February 8, only this time swept clean of  essential disaster relief funding or funding for border security. To  date, the Senate, as we know, has refused to take up this measure, and  the President has said he would not sign it because it doesn't have  additional money for border security.   Last week, then again, the House took up four more spending bills,  that covered four of the outstanding seven appropriations titles.  Unfortunately, like the week prior, these bills also did not include  funding for border security. Even more unfortunately, these bills were  ones that were produced by the Senate alone during the last Congress,  and that did not even reflect any work by, or input from, the House of  Representatives. Just as publicly stated the Senate has not taken up  any of these bills during this Congress and has no plans to take this  one up either.   On Tuesday, the majority put up yet another continuing resolution.  This one a suspension bill, to fund the government through February 1,  but, yet  [[Page H685]]  again, omitting any funding for border security, which is the key  ingredient to get negotiations done. That bill failed to reach the two- thirds threshold to pass under suspension of the rules.   And then, yes, yesterday, the House took up a supplemental disaster  appropriations bill that was intended only to provide just over $12  billion in necessary disaster relief for affected communities. This was  a bipartisan bill. We could have passed it out of here.   But instead of bringing up this bipartisan disaster relief bill to  the floor, the majority chose to play politics once again and decided  at the last minute to attach yet another continuing resolution to this  bill, again, without any border security funding, and, again, to fund  the government through February 8. That bill passed the House  yesterday, yet there is no sign that the Senate ever has any intention  of taking that bill up. In any event, the President has made it clear,  and I believe the American public has made it clear, that we want  border security.   And that brings us to today. I have to tell you, I am running out of  ways to describe what the majority is doing, but I imagine the Speaker  knows where I am going with this. Once again, the majority is bringing  up yet another continuing resolution--this one goes to February 28-- and, again, with no funding for border security. And yet again, it is  clear that if we pass this bill, the Senate will not consider it and  the President will not sign it because it does not include funding for  border security.   We now see the common thread in all the majority is doing: bringing  up bills again and again and again, to fund the government, without  dealing with the fundamental problem. All of these repeated continuing  resolutions are the same. Only the date has changed. All of them fail  to fund border security, which Americans have told us again and again  they want and need. And all of them are continued avoidance of what  needs to happen in order to end this shutdown: real, sincere  negotiations with the Senate and the President over border security.   I feel that this is an exercise in futility. The majority is failing  to acknowledge the crisis happening at our southern border. As you  know, I am a Member from Arizona, a border State. When will the  Democrats get serious about ending this government shutdown and come to  the negotiating table to work out a deal that has a real chance of  being signed into law?   Listen, I know that border security is a crisis. The other night on  TV, when Speaker Pelosi and Chuck Schumer said it is a manufactured  crisis, I can tell you firsthand, that is not accurate. We do have a  crisis on the border, and we need to fix it. I have been to the border.  I have been to the border several times. I recently visited the United  States-Mexico border in Nogales, Arizona, where I met with Customs and  Border Protection agents. The crisis we are dealing with at the border  is not just illegal immigration, they said. There is illicit drugs  flowing through our borders, which are killing our children and adults,  human trafficking, and they told us that dangerous cartels are using  our loose immigration laws to exploit the women and children, having  them travel thousands of miles.   Do you know that Doctors Without Borders say that, I believe one in  three of these women have been sexually abused? This is unconscionable.  We need border security. And it is the law enforcement, the Customs and  Border Protection, that have said repeatedly, have told me personally,  yes; part of the solution is a border fence.   In 2006, Democrats supported a border fence. Chuck Schumer and then- Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton funded $52 billion for 700  miles of fencing. Now the President is asking for $5.7 billion. That is  only 1/10th of 1 percent of the Federal budget. And, unfortunately,  because of their refusal to add this to any bills, it has shut down the  government.   This rule before us today is just another ploy. Democrats are  refusing to negotiate and refusing to deal with this national security  issue. Please, let's stop these games and pass a real bill that funds  border security, that opens the government, that funds disaster relief,  send it to the Senate, and have it signed into law.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close as well, and I  yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, in closing, this is the fourth time we have  deliberated on this floor, in the last 3 weeks, on the exact same type  of package.   The date keeps changing--sometimes it is February 1; sometimes it is  February 8; sometimes it is February 28--but it is all the same. None  of them include funding for border security. It is the fourth time that  the same result will ensue. The House of Representatives is in a  perpetual cycle of Groundhog Day that we cannot seem to escape.   Representative Scanlon and I serve, of course, on the Rules Committee  together, and it is Groundhog Day. We just say the same things each and  every day. Really, let's get to the negotiating table, and, really,  let's get something done.   The majority seems to be insistent on reviewing these same  appropriations packages again and again, fully knowing that the Senate  has made clear they will not take up these bills because there is no  border security in them.   Finally, Madam Speaker, I would be remiss if I did not mention that  this bill is again coming to the floor under a closed rule. Of the  eight bills the House has considered under a rule this Congress, seven  have been closed, with no opportunity for Members to present new ideas  and new amendments.   Now, I know that Chairman McGovern has assured us he wants a more  open process, and I believe he is sincere in his assurance. We saw a  more open process on the disaster supplemental bill we considered  earlier this week, which has so far been the outlier of this Congress,  with 15 amendments made in order on a structured rule. I look forward  to considering more rules that have a more open process than the one we  are considering today.   Madam Speaker, I urge ``no'' on the previous question, ``no'' on the  underlying measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that, I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
