 Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the  100th anniversary of the Joplin High School Junior Reserve Officer  Training Corps, one of the oldest such programs in the United States.   At a time when our Nation faces extraordinary challenges at home and  abroad, preparing the next generation is paramount. The future lays in  the hands of our youth. Since 1919, Joplin High School JROTC has been  developing outstanding citizens for Missouri through leadership  development, discipline, and service.   Today, less than 1 percent of Americans serve in the military; yet,  Joplin High School JROTC has 120 cadets who are part of the program's  historic legacy under the leadership of Lt. Col. (Ret.) Joshua Reitz  and 1SG (Ret.) Richard Banks. Some of these cadets will go on to put  the lessons and leadership training they received into practice through  service in the U.S. Armed Forces. Military service is not only a  career, but a lifestyle full of continuous reward and knowledge. For  those that choose the path of Military Service, we should thankful.   To the members of Eagle Battalion, I urge you to uphold your school's  core values of truth, honor, and loyalty. These values may be no  guarantee of popularity, comfort, or success, at least not as the world  defines success; yet, a life of integrity characterized by these  virtues is a life of which you can be proud.   The path of leadership is a difficult one and often lonely. America  needs strong servant-leaders in the next generation willing to confront  the challenges we face with courage, rooted in the principles that make  our Nation great.   As your Senator, I have been given the solemn responsibility to  nominate young women and men for placements at our Nation's service  academies. It is a duty I do not take lightly, knowing that these  future leaders will be on the frontlines of securing American freedom.  I encourage those of you who have been a part of Joplin High School  JROTC to seriously consider applying for one of these highly selective  spots. The program's legacy of excellence demands that I give your  candidacy the consideration it deserves.   I want to thank Joplin High School ROTC for their dedication to their  school, to Joplin, to Missouri, and to our country. Congratulations on  the first 100 years of service, and here is to the next century of  service.                            ____________________
