 Madam Speaker, I bring attention to the American people  of what should be the number one story in every newspaper in the  country tomorrow, but we know they won't even cover it.   Today were released the encounters and releases at the southern  border for August--just shy of 140,000 people. By  [[Page H7948]]  comparison, 2 years ago in August of the prior administration, it was  13,000. So, in 2 years, we have gone from 13,000 to 140,000.   That also means a corresponding increase in the amount of fentanyl  crossing the border, and we all know that, right now, we have well over  100,000 illegal drug deaths in America, and of those 100,000, the vast  majority contain fentanyl.   I also point out that, right now, the deportations are about one  quarter per day as to what they were for people committing crimes 2  years ago.   I want the American people to wake up and demand something serious be  done on the border, and I beg the press corps to talk about the new  August numbers for people crossing here illegally.                            ____________________
