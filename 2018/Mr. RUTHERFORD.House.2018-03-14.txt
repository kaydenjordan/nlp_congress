 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me  this time.   Mr. Speaker, today the House of Representatives has a chance to take  an important first step towards keeping our students and our teachers  safe by passing the STOP School Violence Act.   This bill is the result of bipartisan work of Representative Hal  Rogers, Representative Ted Deutch, and also Representative Kilmer. We  also incorporated, as we mentioned earlier, excellent ideas and key  elements from legislation by Chairwoman Granger, Representatives Susan  Brooks, Chabot, Rodney Davis, Messer, and Bost. I want to thank all of  them for their work and commitment to this very important issue.   I would also like to recognize in a very special way the dedication  and passion of the parents and members of Sandy Hook Promise, who have  been integral to us moving this bill forward. I really cannot say  enough about that organization.   As a career law enforcement officer and sheriff for 12 years in my  hometown of Jacksonville, Florida, I know firsthand the importance of  communities working together to spot early warning signs of violence.   This is why this bill invests in early intervention and prevention  programs in our local schools, so that our communities and law  enforcement can be partners in preventing these horrific acts from  occurring.   We need to give students, teachers, and law enforcement the tools and  training they need to identify warning signs and to know who to  contact, and  [[Page H1561]]  provide them an anonymous tip source to provide that information.   Now, I should point out here that those receiving the tips, the  agencies that are charged with providing due process, are the ones who  should provide due process here, not the tipster, not the child who may  be calling in to talk about an issue that he thinks is important to law  enforcement.                                time  1315    That is their responsibility to provide due process to the  individuals involved.   This bill also gives funding for physical enhancements to help harden  the target on our school campuses. I know from my law enforcement  experience that security does require a multilayered approach. Our bill  supports one very important layer of security for our schools. There is  still much more work to be done, but the best way to keep our students  and teachers safe is to give them the tools and the training to  recognize those warning signs to prevent violence from ever entering  our school grounds. This bill aims to do just that, Mr. Speaker.   As I used to tell my community in northeast Florida when I was  sheriff, I do not want to be the best first responder to an active  shooter event. I want to prevent that occurrence before it happens, and  that is the goal of the STOP School Violence Act.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
