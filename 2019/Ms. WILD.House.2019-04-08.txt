 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Matthew Vital, an  eighth grader from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and his entire family.   Yesterday, Matthew became a national golf champion, winning the  Drive, Chip & Putt national title for the boys 12 to 13 age group. He  holed a difficult chip and drained a 30-foot putt at Augusta's 18th  green, the same course where PGA professionals will compete at the  Masters in a few days.   The Morning Call, our hometown newspaper, features a great photo of  Matthew that captures the focus and determination that he demonstrated  in this tournament and has demonstrated throughout his already  impressive golfing career.   Mr. Speaker, I say to Matthew that the qualities that led him to this  victory--a powerful work ethic and a commitment to setting goals and  seeing them through--will serve him well not just on the course, but  also in school and in every aspect of life: Keep working hard. Your  family, your community, and your Congresswoman are proud of you.  Congratulations.                            ____________________
