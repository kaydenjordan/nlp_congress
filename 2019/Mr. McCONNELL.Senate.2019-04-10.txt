 Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    Madam President, the Senate continues to build on last  week's progress in restoring our normal tradition regarding lower level  nominations. We are moving several well-qualified nominees more  promptly through floor consideration. We are clearing the considerable  backlog of those who had been mired for months in our Democratic  colleagues' across-the-board obstruction campaign.   Make no mistake, there is still a very long way to go. There are  still too many vacancies on the President's team. There are still too  many would-be public servants waiting for partisan barriers to fall.  But this body should be proud of the progress we are already making and  the healthier precedent we are setting for the future.   Yesterday the Senate voted to confirm both Daniel Domenico, the  President's choice to serve as U.S. District Judge for the District of  Colorado, and Patrick Wyrick to be a district judge in the Western  District of Oklahoma.   Today we will turn our attention to Cheryl Stanton's nomination to  lead the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division. It has been 1 year,  7 months, and 5 days since Ms. Stanton's nomination arrived in the  Senate. In that time the nomination has been favorably reported by the  HELP Committee not once, not twice, but three  [[Page S2350]]  times--three times through committee for this graduate of Williams  College and the University of Chicago Law School and two times sent  back to the President for the former executive director of the South  Carolina Department of Employment and Workforce. Well, hopefully the  third time will be the charm, and we can finally do the prudent thing  on the Senate floor. I hope each of my colleagues will join me in  support of the Stanton nomination later this week.   Later this week, as I noted yesterday, we will finish with the  nomination of David Bernhardt to join President Trump's Cabinet as  Secretary of the Interior. Speaking of procedures coming in threes,  this would be the third time Mr. Bernhardt will have been confirmed by  the Senate. He served previously as the Department's Solicitor and as  its Deputy Secretary. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation,  his ``proven leadership'' in these roles ``has helped restore the  multiple use of America's public lands.''   They are not alone. Over his tenure, Mr. Bernhardt developed a  reputation among sportsmen, conservation groups, and western Native  American Tribes as a strong leader and partner in their efforts. So  once again, I hope each of my colleagues will join me in voting to  confirm David Bernhardt later this week.                            ____________________     Madam President, on a completely different matter, for  some time now, my colleagues and I have been speaking out about the  Democrats' parade of fantastical new proposals--plans to spend  unprecedented sums of Americans' money in order to seize unprecedented  control over Americans' lives.   Just a few weeks ago, the Senate voted on the so-called Green New  Deal. It was Washington Democrats' plan to power down the U.S. economy  and have the Federal Government intrude on basically every economic  transaction and personal life choice in radically unprecedented ways.  The specifics of the proposal, limited as they were, painted enough of  a picture for outside experts to roughly estimate the price tag at as  much as $93 trillion, which is more money than the Federal Government  has spent in its entire history, in exchange for the systematic  dismantling of American prosperity.   It advocated for the abolition of the most affordable and plentiful  domestic energy resources available to American families and a hog-tied  American economy that our competitors would leave in the dust.   So it should come as no surprise that for the sequel we see and hear  that Senate Democrats may soon officially introduce their proposed  Washington, DC, takeover of health insurance--the plan I call  ``Medicare for None.''   It is a fitting name for a proposal that would gut the Medicare  Program as American seniors know it, reuse the label on a new,  government-run, one-size-fits-all arrangement, and remove 180 million  Americans from the private insurance they have chosen in order to  funnel them into a system without choice.   What is especially ironic is that my Democratic colleagues are  choosing to agitate for this pivot toward socialism during this  particularly important economic period--at this particular moment, with  more job openings than Americans looking for work for the first time  since recordkeeping started, when we have seen unemployment reach a 49- year low and wages growing faster than they have in a decade. It is the  kind of economy where a single mom in Mississippi says: ``It's amazing  that I'm getting paid almost $20 an hour to learn how to weld.''   It is the kind of economy where garage door installers in Nevada say  they are literally afraid to let potential new hires walk out the door  because American workers are in such high demand.   Let's remember that this transformation is being helped along by  Senate Republican ideas and policies that are the polar opposite-- totally opposite--of what our Democratic friends are now calling for.   Here is how Republican pro-growth and pro-opportunity policies helped  us get where we are: by encouraging job creators to invest here at home  instead of penalizing success; by recognizing that working families  know best how to spend their paychecks, not Washington; and by creating  conditions for an economic surge that touches every corner of our  country.   Now all of America is reaping the benefits. This isn't like the last  administration, where 75 percent of new jobs and 90 percent of the  population growth flowed into the very largest metropolitan areas. This  time it is an all-American comeback, and all kinds of communities are  benefiting from more jobs, more opportunities, and more growth in pay.   Monday is tax day. It is not exactly a time many of us look forward  to, but this year marks the first time Americans are filing under the  new Republican tax reform law that has helped them keep more of their  paychecks and has helped to create the outstanding economy we see  today. Democrats may be working overtime to bring this bright chapter  to an end, but over here, on this side of the aisle, we will keep  making sure that this is still just the beginning of these brighter  days for the American people.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with  respect to the Brady nomination, the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived.
