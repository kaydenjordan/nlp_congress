 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and legacy  of Peggy Ann ``Peg'' Lautenschlager, whose passing at the age of 62  leaves Wisconsin without one of its greatest public servants. Peg was a  true trailblazer in Wisconsin politics, and her kindness, tenacity, and  strength will be greatly missed.   Peg was a native of Fond du Lac, WI. The only daughter of Milton and  Patsy Lautenschlager, Peg attended Goodrich High School, now known as  Fond du Lac High School, and graduated in 1973 as valedictorian of her  class. Her early academic accomplishments were the initial signs of her  future success.   After graduating summa cum laude from Lake Forest College, Peg earned  her law degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1980. Peg  broke through the glass ceiling of Wisconsin politics a mere 5 years  later and never looked back. In 1985, Peg won an election as the first  woman district attorney for Winnebago County. She later served as  Wisconsin's first woman attorney general from 2003 to 2007. Between  those two important bookends of her career, she spent every ounce of  her professional energy in service to the people of Wisconsin.   In 1987, she unseated a 32-year incumbent to win election to the  State assembly representing her hometown of Fond du Lac. She quickly  became well respected for her work promoting criminal justice reform,  sexual assault prevention, fair elections, and open records. President  Bill Clinton appointed her to serve as the U.S. Attorney for the  Western District of Wisconsin in 1993. Peg found a mentor and a friend  in her boss, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, who named Peg to the  [[Page S2118]]  U.S. Attorney General's advisory committee, the first Wisconsinite to  serve on the committee.   Peg was unstoppable. She was one of those rare jewels who was as  caring as she was brilliant and funny as she was passionate. She will  go down in the history books as one of Wisconsin's most powerful women,  and she used every bit of that power in pursuit of justice for those  who didn't have a voice. Her greatest legacy, however, is not something  you can point at or capture in a headline. It is the countless women  who can see themselves in a courtroom or on a ballot because they were  inspired by Peg's audacity in never letting anything stop her. It is  the hundreds of young girls who can imagine themselves walking through  doors that they had always assumed were closed to them because Peg had  already blazed that trail.   Peg was a brilliant attorney, a fierce friend, and a loving mother.  Colleagues and staff struggled to keep up with her as she juggled  dozens of legal cases, three phones, and five children. She toggled  seamlessly between a discussion of the finer points of case law against  drug manufacturers overcharging for pharmaceuticals and a call about  her middle-schooler's wardrobe crisis. She tackled both challenges with  the same passion, heart, and ingenuity.   Peg's memory will be kept alive by her husband, Bill, her five  children, and all of us lucky enough to have known her. She knew that  serving as the first woman attorney general in Wisconsin was not only  an honor, it was a momentous responsibility. She carried that honor and  responsibility proudly. She leaves behind a legacy that will be carried  forward by women in Wisconsin who boldly pursue success in law and  politics.                            ____________________
