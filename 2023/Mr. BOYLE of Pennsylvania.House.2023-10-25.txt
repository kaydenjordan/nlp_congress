 Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today, I missed  rollcall vote No. 526 and No. 527 on the floor of the House of  Representatives. I was in Philadelphia to be with my wife for a  surgical procedure. Had I been present, I would have voted ``Present''  on rollcall No. 526 and ``Hakeem Jeffries'' on rollcall No. 527.                                time  1350
