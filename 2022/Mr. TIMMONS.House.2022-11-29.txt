 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Bost and Chairman  Takano for supporting this bill and bringing it to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our bill, H.R. 5943, to  designate the outpatient clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs  in Greenville, South Carolina, as the Lance Corporal Dana Cornell  Darnell Outpatient Clinic.   A native of Greenville, South Carolina, Dana Cornell Darnell was a  lance corporal in the United States Marine Corps during the Vietnam  war. On April 24, 1967, his platoon was ambushed by North Vietnamese  Army forces. He quickly worked to silence enemy fire. Even after being  temporarily blinded, he refused to be evacuated and quickly began  assisting in the care of the wounded.   For his extraordinary heroism, Lance Corporal Dana Cornell Darnell  was awarded the Navy Cross.   Renaming the Greenville VA clinic in honor of Lance Corporal Darnell  will ensure we never forget the courage, service, and sacrifice of our  fellow South Carolinian.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the entire South Carolina delegation for their  support of this bill. We believe the Lance Corporal Dana Cornell  Darnell Outpatient Clinic will serve countless veterans throughout the  upstate and uphold our promise to those who gave our country their all.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5943.
