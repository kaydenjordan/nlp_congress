 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor Ossining Padres  Hispanos, a lifeline for the local Latino community, and its executive  director, Ana Guzman, who immigrated to the United States from Ecuador  33 years ago.   Born from a simple Facebook group that translated school updates,  Padres Hispanos has evolved into a vital community resource, serving  thousands with food, clothes, language classes, workplace training, and  critical classes on legal, financial, and immigration matters.   Just this past weekend, I joined Ana and community residents at  Ossining Padres Hispanos to celebrate the graduation of their home  health aide program, with over 30 people now joining the ranks of this  critical workforce that helps our seniors age in place gracefully.   Clad in orange, symbolizing hope and energy, Ana and her team stand  as a beacon of resilience, inclusivity, and solidarity in Ossining and  across Westchester County.   I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Ossining Padres Hispanos and Ana  for  [[Page H2608]]  their relentless commitment to our community's welfare. I thank them  for making Ossining a better place for all.                            ____________________
