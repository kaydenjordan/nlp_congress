 Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to a  critical and often hidden issue facing our Nation. Each year, nearly  18,000 foster children across our country age out of the system with no  permanent place to call home. Right now, over 125,000 foster children  are eligible for adoption and waiting for their forever family. Over  1,600 of those children live in Nevada. Every single child deserves a  safe, loving, and permanent family.   November is National Adoption Month, a time to recognize and  celebrate the many ways that families are created, including through  adoption. There are children in our communities, waiting to belong, to  be loved, and to be a part of what so many of us take for granted.  Sitting down to a meal with a parent, knowing you have a family member  in the audience at a school event or knowing that someone is, indeed,  waiting up to make sure you get home safe and by curfew. The very idea  that someone cares enough to make sure homework is done, and to listen  when your day doesn't go so well does immeasurable good for children.   Our Nation's foster children are in a situation that is no fault of  their own. Most are there due to severe neglect or abuse. They have  experienced trauma. They have been suddenly taken away from all they  know, bringing few possessions, stored in a garbage bag, with them as  they move from home to home. The goal is always to reunite foster  children with their biological families if it can be done safely, but  unfortunately, that isn't always an option. For the children who remain  in our foster system, we can and must do better.   Absolutely no child is unadoptable. By working together, we can  achieve a future where every child in our Nation knows without a doubt  they belong and they have a family. I encourage anyone interested in  learning more about adoption to visit www.adoptuskids.org or reach out  to local community organizations to find out more about how to get  involved with mentoring or supporting foster children in other ways.   As I hear from constituents about the work they do to help raise  awareness and improve outcomes for foster youth, I am so encouraged. I  remain committed to working with my colleagues in the Senate to create  a brighter future for our most vulnerable children.                            ____________________
