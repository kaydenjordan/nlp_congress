 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to make  it easier to get mental healthcare. We should pass the National Suicide  Hotline Designation Act and make 988 the national number for mental  health emergencies.   When your house is on fire, you don't have to look for a phonebook to  know who to call. You just dial 911. Mr. Speaker, it ought to be the  same way for mental health emergencies as well. And that is just the  beginning.   Let's lead by example and change our culture so getting a mental  health checkup is just part of routine life.   Deployed servicemembers can set an example by getting a mental health  checkup within 2 weeks of returning home from their deployments. That  bipartisan requirement is in the House version of the NDAA.   Let's start a conversation in this country so that getting mental  healthcare is a regular part of life.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, right now, with President Trump's  permission, Turkey is slaughtering our Kurdish allies, the only people  who stand between us and ISIS, men and women who have died by the  thousands to protect Americans from terrorism, the families of our  American constituents, like Seyhmus Yuksekkaya from my district.   As a result, Russian and Syrian forces are taking our positions next  to them. ISIS prisoners are escaping, and, Mr. Speaker, the crisis has  only just begun.   We must act today because the President has taken the side of  dictators and butchers. The President has never put his life on the  line for our country, like our Special Forces soldiers who have been  fighting terrorists in Syria, whom he mocked earlier today by saying  they are shooting each other.   Perhaps if he had not dodged the draft by lying about his feet,  sending another American in his place to Vietnam, he would know  something that all veterans know well, that there are a lot of ways you  can fail in battle. You can fail physically. You can fail to summon the  mental courage. You can have a bad strategy or bad tactics. But nothing  is worse, nothing is more evil, than betrayal.    Yet, betrayal is exactly what this President has done. It sends  exactly the wrong message to our allies, to our troops, and to our  enemies.   Our Commander in Chief should lead with American values. He should  lead by the idea that there is no better friend and no worse enemy than  the United States of America.   Today's vote is necessary because there has been no worse enemy to  the Kurds and no better friend to our enemies than this President.
