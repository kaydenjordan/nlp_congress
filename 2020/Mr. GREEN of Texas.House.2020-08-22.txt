 Madam Speaker, it is shameful and sinful that  history will record that, on the great issues of our time, many of  them, the Senate failed to act. On issues concerning life and death,  the Senate of the United States of America refused to act.   On the great issue of the HEROES Act, which has lifesaving  implications--some 86,000 have died since it was passed--the Senate has  failed to act.   On the issue of delivering lifesaving medications by way of the  Postal Service, when the Postal Service needs our help, the Senate has  refused to act.   And a Senate that refuses to act puts the actions of the House at  risk, because the truth is this: It takes an act of Congress to help  these entities; it takes an act of Congress to help the people of the  United States of America; and you cannot get an act of Congress if the  Senate refuses to act.
