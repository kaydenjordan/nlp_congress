 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  authorized to sign duly enrolled bills or joint resolutions on Tuesday,  March 13, 2018.    Mr. President, just 2 days ago, the White House announced  its plans to reduce gun violence in our Nation's schools. This is an  important issue, and the White House's recommendations should be taken  seriously. I certainly do.   The President's blueprint attempts to address this pervasive problem  from multiple angles during what has been a period of heightened  tension and discord across the country. Parents and children continue  to grapple every day with the aftermath of the shooting at Stoneman  Douglas High School in Parkland, FL. But, of course, the problem didn't  start with that single event and what I think can only be fairly called  a catastrophic failure across the board, which resulted in this  terrible tragedy.   One important piece of the White House plan is to train school  staffers. The President strongly supports a bill introduced by the  senior Senator from Utah that would authorize funding for school safety  improvements. You wouldn't think that would be controversial. Those  school safety improvements include training efforts, school threat  assessment, and crisis intervention teams. This bill is called the STOP  School Violence Act. We ought to pass it, and we ought to pass it  today.   As Senator Hatch said last week, there has been little disagreement  but a lot of discussion and debate and not much legislative progress.  He said: ``To break the impasse, we must unite on the issues where we  agree.''   I couldn't agree with Senator Hatch more. We must unite on the issues  where we can agree. One of those issues relates to a bill that I have  introduced with the junior Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Murphy, to  improve background checks on gun purchases.   NICS is the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. As of  earlier today, the bill called Fix NICS now has 69 cosponsors. That is  nine votes more than we need in order to pass legislation, so clearly  we could and should get it done.   The numbers speak for themselves: 32 Republicans and 36 Democrats  want to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check  System. Why? Because we want to save lives.   There have been some who have come to the floor and have said in  public comments: Well, we want to do more.   Well, God bless you. I hope that we will have other ideas presented  that could do even more, but we know this has the political support and  the critical mass we need to get this done in the Senate and to get it  done now.   The reason this particular legislation is supported by so many  Senators is, essentially, that it enforces current law. In other words,  current law states that a felon--a person convicted of a felony in any  court in the Nation--cannot buy or possess a firearm. It also says that  a person who has committed and been convicted of an act of domestic  violence cannot purchase or possess a firearm. If you entered the  country illegally, you cannot possess or purchase a firearm, and so on  and so forth. There are also provisions that if you have been  adjudicated as a person with mental illness, you cannot legally  purchase or possess a firearm. The problem is that many States and the  Federal Government have done a very poor job of uploading the  appropriate information into the FBI's National Instant Criminal  Background Check System, so there are gaps in the system.   The most notable one recently occurred in Sutherland Springs, TX,  outside of San Antonio, where 26 people were killed and 20 more were  injured by a gunman who purchased the guns illegally. He lied on his  background check and, sadly, the Federal Government had failed to  discharge its duty to upload the appropriate information, which would  have revealed that at the point of sale. I am convinced that those 26  people who are dead would be alive today and the 20 more who were  wounded would not have been shot if an appropriate background check  system had been in place. We have reached critical mass, and I believe  we are at a tipping point.   I believe the public is demanding that we do something. That is what  we usually hear when these mass shootings occur. People say: Well, do  something.   My question is, OK, what is it that you want us to do?   This is something concrete and specific. It enjoys broad political  support and will save lives, so I believe it is worth doing, and it is  worth doing today, if possible.                                  Tax Reform    Mr. President, the other topic I want to address is the legislation  that was signed into law in December called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  That is the formal name of the comprehensive overhaul of our Nation's  Tax Code. The tax change we made was a change in the law that doubled  the standard deduction, meaning that for the first $24,000 a married  couple earns, they will pay zero income tax. It doubled the child tax  credit. It lowered tax rates across the board, and for the first time  in a long time, it made the United States more competitive when it  comes to attracting investment and businesses around the globe.   (Mr. CRUZ assumed the Chair.)   We know that our Tax Code had been a self-inflicted wound. With the  highest tax rate in the world, businesses were moving offshore to lower  tax jurisdictions--such as Ireland, for example--in order to avoid the  highest taxes here in  [[Page S1656]]  the United States. We changed that by lowering the business tax rate to  attract people to bring that money back to the United States rather  than leaving it overseas.   Today, I want to briefly mention one of several portions of the law  that is frequently overlooked. They don't steal the headlines, but they  actually deserve more recognition.   The one I am thinking of is the one sponsored by the junior Senator  from South Carolina, Mr. Scott, called the Investing in Opportunity  Act. Importantly, this measure helps incentivize long-term private  investment in communities that need it most. That is why it is called  the Investing in Opportunity Act. It provides a new way for investors  across the Nation to pool their resources through newly created  opportunity funds established specifically for making investment in  economically distressed communities, so designated by State Governors.   As any businessperson will tell you, private capital formation is a  necessary ingredient for planting the seeds of job creation and  opportunity. Our economically distressed communities need this sort of  investment, and this provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act makes that  possible and more likely.   That is just one of the provisions we need to keep reminding folks  back home about because they get so much disinformation, and, of  course, there is so much information coming at us that it easily gets  lost in the day-to-day shuffle. These are important provisions, and I  think they bear some emphasis.   The Presiding Officer and I have the great privilege of representing  28 million Texans. He and I hear from them from time to time on the  legislation we pass. On the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, I heard from Pam  from Amarillo, TX. She prefers that her last name not be mentioned, and  I will certainly respect that. She thought she had made a mistake when  she was figuring out her payroll at her company at the end of February.  Because the pay increases to employees were just that big, she thought  she had made a mistake. She said the differences in withholding were  ``significant'' and a real ``boost in salary.''   Similarly, we heard from Glenda from Midland, TX, who wrote to me  recently. Glenda has been retired since 2013, which, she reminded me,  means that she is living on a fixed income with no possibility of pay  increases or year-end bonuses. That doesn't mean she is not grateful  for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. She said that the reduction in her  income taxes feels like a raise, even though she is retired and living  on a fixed income.   She took the critics to task for calling her additional income  crumbs. She said that maybe to them it is crumbs, but ``every single  dollar makes a difference'' to her. She called the effects of the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act an ``absolute blessing.''   I want to express my gratitude to Glenda and Pam for sharing their  stories because I think it is really important to make sure that the  facts get out.   According to what the Bureau of Labor Statistics said last week,  Midland--where Glenda lives--had the largest employment increase in the  country over the last year. This past January in Midland, the increase  was 10.4 percent. In Texas, they also had the lowest unemployment rate  of 2.4 percent, a significant decrease from 4 percent at the same time  last year.   Of course, as the Presiding Officer and I know, Midland is the  epicenter of energy production, and they are basically trying to get as  many people as are willing to work on the jobs that produce energy to  fuel our economy. Glenda is actually a part of a larger story that  involves not only the place she calls home but also the entire country.   After years of economic stagnation, Americans are finally getting  some good economic news. In February, the U.S. economy added 313,000  jobs--313,000 jobs. That is about one-third of a million. The  unemployment rate is at a 17-year low, and it would have been even  lower but for the fact that the number of people actually in the  workforce increased by 806,000 in February alone. Let me say that  again. The reason the unemployment rate actually didn't dip  statistically lower from 4.1 percent is that 800,000-plus Americans  reentered the workforce. To me, that is a remarkable statistic and a  reason for hope that our economy will continue to grow and people will  continue to find work, provide for their families, and pursue their  dreams.   Since January of last year, our economy has added nearly 3 million  jobs. Consumer confidence is at the highest level since 2000. The good  news is that it is happening not because the Federal Government is  spending the money but because the people who are actually earning it  are getting the money and spending it as they see fit.   Glenda and Pam are just two of the examples I have mentioned, but  they are proof that spirits are high, people are hopeful, and the  economy is gaining force.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have 8 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
