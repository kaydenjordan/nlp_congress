 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. The BLM  venting and flaring rule, or the BLM methane rule, represents one of  the Obama administration's most egregious abuses of executive power  designed to destroy responsible energy production on Federal land.   BLM exceeded statutory authority by attempting to regulate air  quality; authority that is vested solely with the EPA. Methane  emissions from oil and natural gas have significantly declined in  recent decades without duplicative Federal regulations in a time when  oil and gas production in the U.S. has surged.   It is frustrating that this rule is somehow cloaked under the idea  that it will benefit taxpayers. It won't. It is an onerous rule with no  connection to the reality of the physics and chemistry of energy  production. It will reduce American energy production on Federal land  and, therefore, reduce royalties due to the U.S. Treasury.    This amendment brings accountability to executive rulemaking. I thank  Congressman Pearce and applaud him, as well as Congressmen  [[Page H7176]]  Westerman and Cramer for their similar amendments crippling other Obama  rules.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
