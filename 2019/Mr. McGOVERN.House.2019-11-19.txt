 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order at any time to take from the Speaker's table the bill, H.R. 1865,  with the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider in the House,  without intervention of any point of order, a motion offered by the  chair of the Committee on Appropriations or her designee that the House  concur in the Senate amendment with the amendment submitted for  printing by Representative Lowey of New York in the portion of the  Congressional Record designated for that purpose in clause 8 of rule  XVIII; that the Senate amendment and the motion be considered as read;  that the motion be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Appropriations; that the previous question be considered as ordered on  the motion to adoption without intervening motion or demand for  division of the question; and that House Resolution 708 be laid on the  table.    Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 708 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 708         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R.       3055) making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce       and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal       year ending September 30, 2020, and for other purposes, with       the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider in the House,       without intervention of any point of order, a motion offered       by the chair of the Committee on Appropriations or her       designee that the House concur in the Senate amendment with       an amendment inserting the text of Rules Committee Print 116-      38 in lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted by the       Senate. The Senate amendment and the motion shall be       considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for one       hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       motion to its adoption without intervening motion.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  [[Page H8968]]  reported a rule, House Resolution 708, providing for consideration of  the Senate amendment to H.R. 3055. One hour of general debate has been  provided, controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Appropriations.   Mr. Speaker, funding the government may seem like an arcane exercise  to some watching this debate today, but it is the most basic  responsibility any Member of Congress has. And failure to follow  through could be devastating.   Remember what happened during the Trump shutdown? The President and  Republican leaders who controlled the Congress then caused the longest  government shutdown in American history.   Hundreds of Federal workers were forced to miss paychecks. The men  and women who keep our country safe struggled to put food on the table.  Members of the Coast Guard, FBI agents, Border Patrol officers, and TSA  agents waited in long lines at food banks to provide for their  families. Millions of households were at risk of experiencing a gap in  their SNAP benefits without a backup plan. And I could go on and on.   These debates are not just some abstract political exercise. They  have real-life consequences. And that is why this majority passed bills  to fund roughly 96 percent of the Federal Government earlier this year,  but Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans couldn't get their work  done.   So today we find ourselves needing to take action, once again, before  funding runs out later this week. And, once again, this majority is not  shirking its responsibilities. We are taking the lead through a bill  that not only keeps the lights on, it addresses the most critical  budget priorities we face.   In addition to funding the government through December 20, the  underlying measure also gives our military a 3.1 percent pay raise. It  fully funds a fair and accurate 2020 Census, and it keeps critical  public health programs going for another month, so consumers don't see  a gap in care. Families, businesses, and communities need this  certainty while talks continue on a longer-term deal.   Just as important as what is here, Mr. Speaker, is what is not here.  There are no controversial policy provisions, nothing designed to make  Members run to their partisan corners. This is simply about whether key  programs remain authorized and funded, whether members of our military  are able to avoid the pain of budget uncertainty, and whether we  guarantee an accurate 2020 Census.   You know, we fight about a lot of issues on this floor, but this bill  should not be one of them. I know President Trump's disposition is to  govern by tweet. That is what helped bring on the last Republican  shutdown. I don't know if he has logged on in the last few minutes and  tried to throw a wrench into the process, but I hope that regardless of  what he does or doesn't say in the next few days, Republicans will join  us in agreeing that we should not be shutting the government down.   We should pass this bill. We should allow appropriators to have more  time to negotiate and continue this process in an orderly way. Make no  mistake, this majority will continue fighting hard for our priorities.  We are going to keep defending vital programs, and we will be providing  a check on the Trump administration. But we are going to fight for what  we believe in while averting another costly shutdown because it is the  right thing to do, and it is the responsible thing to do.   I don't expect that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are  always going to share our priorities, but I do know that there are many  in the House, and I include my ranking member who was also an  appropriator in that category, who is sincerely dedicated to making  sure we do our job to making sure we fund our government, to making  sure that we achieve a reasonable compromise, and to making sure that  we avoid another shutdown that has such catastrophic effects.   So I urge all my colleagues to join with us. Let's allow more time  for talks to continue while saying enough to government shutdowns.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we don't have any additional speakers on  our side, so we are ready to close any time the gentleman is.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Let me begin my closing by again thanking the gentleman from Oklahoma  (Mr. Cole) not only for his work on the Rules Committee but also for  his work on the Appropriations Committee. I think he understands the  importance of making sure that we don't have any more government  shutdowns, but he also understands that in this place, no matter who is  in charge, you don't always get 100 percent of what you want and that  sometimes compromise is appropriate and necessary to do the right  thing.   Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman knows, we on this side tried to  accommodate the minority in terms of the underlying measure, changing  the underlying measure at the minority's request. Unfortunately, a  Member on the minority side objected, so we were not able to do that,  but I do have nothing but the highest respect for the gentleman, and I  appreciate his words.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I know that some of my friends on the other side of  the aisle would have drafted a different bill if they were in charge. I  want my colleagues to know that if I could wave a magic wand and have  my own way in everything, I would, too.   For example, I would have removed the 4-month extension of the  PATRIOT Act's FISA provision from this bill. I have voted against this  program in the past and for bipartisan reforms that would strip the  government of this unchecked and, I believe, unconstitutional spying  power.   I may be the chairman of the Rules Committee, but I don't believe it  should be my way or the highway on everything. I don't believe in  blowing up a bipartisan, bicameral negotiation just because I didn't  get my own way on a particular provision.   But make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, I hope that we have a standalone  and robust debate on the FISA when the extension expires next year. As  I said, this is a 4-month extension that we are talking about.  Meaningful reforms, I think, are long overdue.   Let me remind my colleagues what is at stake today. 800,000 Americans  had their paychecks held hostage for 35 days during the President's  last shutdown. Workers couldn't pay their bills. Communities lost  access to health and safety services. Our national security was  endangered. Our economy was harmed. The nonpartisan Congressional  Budget Office estimates that it cost us billions of dollars for the  President's shutdown.   The choice before us today is whether we are going to vote to cause a  repeat of that devastation or not. I think the costs are too high, and  I would like to think my Republican friends have learned their lesson.   Look, no one expects either side to stop fighting for what they  believe in, but let's do it while the lights are on.   There is really nothing terribly controversial here. This is not a  radical proposal. It is about keeping the government funded through  December 20, giving the men and women of our military a raise, fully  funding the Census, and encouraging Senator McConnell and Senate  Republicans to finally get their work done.   House appropriators, I would say in a bipartisan way, did most of  their work. The Senate remains a problem on getting a yearlong budget  deal.   Quite frankly, if it were possible, the Senate majority leader should  be sued for malpractice due to his inaction. But we are where we are,  and we should all be able to agree on that. Mr. Speaker, I strongly  urge a ``yes'' vote on this rule and on the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.
