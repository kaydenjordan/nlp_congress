 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my  amendments, which will help fund critically needed flood mitigation  infrastructure in South Carolina's Lowcountry and protect my  constituents from harmful PFAS contaminants.   This month marked the start of hurricane season, and given the  ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is more essential than ever that we  invest in flood mitigation infrastructure that will protect places like  downtown Beaufort and hospitals in Charleston's medical district.   In the Lowcountry, when it rains, it floods. Each year, our  communities face tidal flooding that poses significant health, human  safety, and economic risks. If a weather-related disaster hits during  the COVID-19 pandemic, the results will be severe.   That is why I am proud to offer two amendments that will ensure  natural disaster preparedness and flood mitigation projects are  prioritized in this legislation.   I also offered an amendment that will require the Federal Government  to investigate wild fish in PFAS-contaminated waters and the risk of  consuming such fish to humans and natural predators.   In a pair of recent studies, it was determined that PFAS were present  in groundwater on Joint Base Charleston, as well as in wild fish in the  Ashley and the Cooper Rivers. Given the health and environmental  hazards associated with PFAS exposure, it is critical that we ensure my  constituents are not put at risk.   I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in  supporting my amendments, as well as the underlying legislation.
