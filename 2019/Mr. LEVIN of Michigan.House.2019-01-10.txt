 Madam Speaker, I rise as a proud cosponsor of  H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, a bill to implement  universal background checks as a critical first step towards ending the  public health crisis of gun violence.   Today, I speak up in honor of the Moms and Students Demand Action  leaders from Michigan's Ninth District who have inspired me. I speak up  because it is unacceptable that far more people per capita are shot and  killed annually in our country than in other wealthy nations. And it is  unacceptable that in 2016, more than 1,200 Michiganders died from  firearms-related injuries.   I speak up because the American people are counting on us to save  lives, and this bill is a commonsense way to do that. I feel privileged  to cosponsor this bill as one of my first actions in Congress. We owe  it to families everywhere to get this done.                            ____________________
