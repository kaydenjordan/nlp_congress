 Mr. Speaker, I rise to bring attention to the  outstanding community service demonstrated by the student athletes from  North Central Sports Club in Nebraska.   Harsh weather and devastating flooding has hit much of Nebraska this  spring, causing destruction to many homes and communities and  agriculture-producing facilities throughout our State. The recovery has  not been easy, but the hard work, dedication, and generosity of  Nebraskans has been on full display since the disaster struck. I want  to highlight one group, the North Central Sports Club, which is made up  of student athletes from Rock County and Keya Paha County, Nebraska.   These student athletes were excited for their upcoming trip, an  annual tradition, after completing the hard work of not only their  competitive sports seasons and academic requirements, but also the  fundraising which keeps the program running. However, instead of taking  their annual trip, the students decided to donate the funds to help  with the recovery of their neighboring community, which suffered much  more of the storm's damage.   Mr. Speaker, Nebraskans don't scare from a challenge, nor do they  stand by as their friends and neighbors suffer. I am honored to  recognize these student athletes from Rock County and Keya Paha County,  Nebraska, for their generosity and community service.                            ____________________
