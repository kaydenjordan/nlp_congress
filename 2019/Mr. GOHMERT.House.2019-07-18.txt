 Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Carter), a former district judge.       Swearing in of the Honorable Richard Hudson into the Texas Navy     Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Hudson).    It is wonderful to have a new admiral in the Texas Navy,  and we welcome Congressman Hudson to that role, that honorary role, in  the Texas Navy.   And we are grateful to Judge Carter for his role in making that  happen and to our great Governor Greg Abbott. I thank both the  gentlemen.  [[Page H7137]]    It is nice to be able to do something that brings a smile. But I  think, for Texans to ask that people remember the Alamo harkens back to  feelings within us that freedom and liberty are something worth dying  for. That is what all of those Texans did.   And with due deference to my friend from Tennessee, Marsha  Blackburn--yes, I know--we are grateful to Tennessee for their  contribution at the Alamo and to Texas as well.   But those people had a choice: Were they going to run or were they  going to stand for freedom, stand against despotism. And they chose to  stand.   And here it is 163 years later, and we still remember, and we are  still inspired. Liberty comes at great cost, and we are forever  grateful to our God and to our predecessors who took such a stand  against tyranny.   There is a lot of tyranny going on in the Middle East, and there will  be until the end of time. But each of us has a responsibility to do  what we can to help accommodate and protect those who can't help  themselves.   That is why some of us are pro-life. But when it comes to life in the  Middle East, it has been shocking now for years, under the previous  administration, the people that were supported, the weapons that were  provided to people that were called the ``vetted moderate rebels''  against the leader of Syria.   Yet we saw over and over again those so-called ``vetted moderate  rebels'' were constantly allowing their weapons to be seized--there is  some question whether they were actually turned over--to radical  Islamists who hate Americans, who made clear, yeah, they are not crazy  about some fellow Muslims, but they like them a whole lot better than  they do the United States and Christians.   So it was tragic, in years prior, when our current U.N. general  secretary was in charge of the refugee program at the U.N. and people  were noticing, under the then head of the refugee program at the U.N.,  now general secretary--they were noticing that, gee, you are helping  all these Muslims, which is wonderful, but there is a significant  percentage in those areas, some areas there, that are being overrun by  ISIS, where there are Christians and the Christians appear to be the  target of genocide.   And it has been a long time since I read his quote, but in essence it  was basically, well, those Christians are very important to those areas  historically where they are, and so we think it is important to just  let them stay in those areas.   Well, what Christians had found was, if they tried to go to the  refugee camps where they were unwelcome and brutalized, they were lucky  if they got out with their lives. But they weren't welcome.   And the head of the refugee program did nothing that we can find to  accommodate Christians to the extent that he was accommodating Muslims.  I don't know if it was an innate bias, prejudice, bigotry that he had-- maybe still has--or whether it was just sheer ignorance on his part,  deciding to save some people and not save a big bulk of the Christians.   So they were being wiped out. There was a genocide going on.   I saw this story today by Edwin Mora. The title of the article is,  ``Hope Is Back: Trump Helps Save Christians, Yazidis in Iraq From  Extinction.''   It goes on to say, ``U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is  helping bring Christians and Yazidis in Iraq back from the brink of  extinction fomented by a genocidal campaign at the hands of the Islamic  State, religious minority representatives declared this week at the  second Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom convened by the  Department of State.   ``The U.S. Government has officially determined that ISIS committed  genocide against Christians, Yazidis, and other religious minorities  during its reign of terror in the Middle East that began in 2014 . . .  `'   Of course, that was when the Obama administration was in its heyday.  Of course, we didn't realize how much the DOJ, FBI, and some of the  Intel community had been weaponized and actually corrupted.    The article goes on, ``Echoing Yazidis activists and a U.S.-based  Syriac Catholic Iraqi priest who spoke to Breitbart News, a Chaldean  Catholic priest from a parish in a Christian Iraqi town indicated that  hope for the future along with security improvements have returned to  religious minority communities devastated by ISIS, courtesy of the  Trump administration efforts.   ``Their comments came during the 3-day ministerial summit. . . .   ``While delivering a speech during the event on Wednesday, Father  Thabet Habib Youssef, a Chaldean Catholic priest from the town of  Karamles in Iraq's Nineveh Province, thanked the Trump administration  for its assistance.''   And this is what Father Youssef had to say:   ``I wish to give thanks to the government of the United States for  including us in this important conference and a special thanks to the  administration of President Trump for his concern and commitment to the  persecuted minority communities in Iraq.   ``I can say this conference gives us hope. Our greatest fear in the  early years was that the world would forget us. This conference tells  us we are not forgotten.'   ``Nearly half of the Christian families who fled Karamles, liberated  by U.S. and local forces in November 2016, have returned, and Father  Thabet expects many more to come back in the coming year.   ``Although ISIS burned down the homes and churches in the Christian  town, `We are determined to return and rebuild.'   ``Today we have 45 percent of our families returned, and we hope in  this next year we will see many more.'   ``He went on to say that the Iraqi government needs to do more to  bring about `real change and support for the protection, safety, and  equal rights for the minority communities in Iraq.'   ``The U.S.-funded nation-building efforts, coupled with''--and let me  make myself clear on that, I'm talking about helping others build their  nations--for those who claim that America is trying to build some  hegemony, has imperialistic notions, as it always has--it just tells us  they had terrible history teachers.                                time  1330    They are not intentionally spreading untruths. They are just  ignorant. They don't know what the real truth is because the real truth  is, we have never been an imperialistic nation. If we were, if we had  been then English would be all that was spoken in France, and Germany,  and Japan, and many other nations. That is not who we are. That is not  who we have been.   We have given our most precious commodity, American lives, for  another people's freedom.   Back to this article. It says: ``The U.S.-funded nation-building  efforts, coupled with assistance from the Catholic group Knights of  Columbus and the government of Hungary, have rendered the town of  Karamles a `story of success and we are optimistic it will survive' '',  Father Thabet also said.   ``Northern Iraq's Nineveh province is the historical homeland of  Iraqi Christians and home to the largest concentration of religious  minorities in the country.''   So it goes on and also talks about the help this has been to Yazidis.   And I note this week we had resolutions or amendments to condemn and  express the majority of the House's sentiment that we shouldn't do  anything to help in the effort against those who are killing,  persecuting, and trying to commit a genocide against the Yazidis in  Yemen. But, thankfully, that is only from the majority in the House.  That is really unfortunate.   But there has also been news this week that we may have a very strong  anti-Israeli resolution filed. Why not? The majority doesn't ever  condemn specific anti-Semitism by Members here in the House; so why not  file a resolution? We will see if it gets filed. That is the news.   That resolution supports the boycott against Israel; even though the  people it supports, that resolution would support, would be the very  people that have said they want Israel wiped off the map. They want no  Israel from the river to the sea. They want it gone. They want a  genocide. They want the Jews wiped out, and that is a goal.   It was a goal of Arafat. It is why, when Ehud Barak, as prime  minister of Israel, when President Clinton was twisting his arm so  strongly, basically  [[Page H7138]]  offered Arafat virtually everything he wanted.   I, personally, knowing biblical history, I think you had a case  where, just as God hardened the heart of Pharaoh, initially, when Moses  was asking to let his people go, I think Arafat's heart was hardened.  He got basically everything he wanted, but he turned it all down.   If he had accepted it, it would have been basically impossible for  Israel to defend itself under anything but nuclear means; no  conventional way to defend Israel if Arafat had accepted that, what I  would consider, outrageous proposal. But fortunately, he didn't accept  it, and so Israel has been able to defend itself since then.   But the attacks are daily. They are ongoing. There is an ongoing  effort by enemies of Israel that are being promoted by some Democrats,  some in Congress, some outside of Congress. That is who they are  supporting, people that are, every single day, smuggling rockets into  Gaza, smuggling weapons, trying to smuggle weapons into Israel, and  continuing to teach hatred, blind bigotry against the Jewish people,  against Israel.   So I would be thrilled if that resolution did not get filed; but that  is up to individuals in Congress. Everybody has a right to file  whatever bill they think will be most helpful.   But I have looked for Scripture in the Bible that says, those who  curse or seek to harm Israel will be blessed. And I just--it is just  not there. So it causes me grave concern to think that we may have  people in leadership positions in the United States, again, who really  want to harm Israel. They want to divide it.   I know we have a growing group that don't believe anything in the  Bible. But for those of us who do, when we are told that any nation  that divides or attempts to divide Israel will bring down judgment on  itself, that causes me great concern for the country for which I have  taken an oath to defend repeatedly; as a member of the United States  Army, as an Assistant District Attorney, as a District Judge, as a  Chief Justice, and as a Member of Congress.   That oath means so much to me that I think it would be a good idea to  be supportive of the Nation of Israel, and I am thrilled we have a  President that is doing that.   Even though, reports I have heard from people that were there, he had  Cabinet officials telling him he was going to start World War III if he  recognized Jerusalem as the capital. A bit like some of the stories of  Lincoln being told by every member of the Cabinet it would be a  disaster if he finalized the Emancipation Proclamation.   Lincoln knew it was right in his heart, and with every Cabinet member  reportedly against him and arguing against it, he, in essence, said the  ayes have it. He was the only one.   Here you had not all, but most of the Cabinet really hammering  President Trump not to recognize Jerusalem as the capital. He knew in  his heart it was the right thing to do. He had said he would do it; he  did it.   I know some can't find anything at all admirable about President  Trump; they are so blinded by their hatred. But I think that is a  pretty amazing thing that President Trump has done.   And now, to hear from Christians in the Middle East who were the  objects of genocide, being wiped out, being killed, destroyed, taken  off of the map completely, without much of anything helpful from the  so-called United Nations, it is amazing what President Trump has done  in that regard.   So when I hear friends across the aisle saying we have lost respect  around the world, they are not seeing and hearing what I am. The last  polls I saw were that, around the world, there is more respect for our  President than the prior administration.   And the truth is, in respect, there is a little element of fear. You  can not like somebody, but still respect them, and fear can be  involved.    We have a reputation that is growing again, that we have a President  that will do what he said. Sometimes he is talked out of taking steps,  like bombing and killing 100 or more in Iran. But what we are seeing in  Iran is amazing, because their economy is suffering dramatically, so  much so you see them lashing out and trying to, whether it is by  attacking ships, trying to use whatever power they can. The pressure is  intensifying.   And I would humbly submit, this will not be a President who, in  response to the biggest supporter of terrorism in world history, sends  them pallets full of billions and billions of dollars in cash to help  the biggest supporter of terrorism, who has killed and been responsible  for the deaths of more American military than anybody else in recent  decades.   So they can say what they want about our President. He is doing  amazing work.   And it is interesting, I keep hearing this term ``racist'' and the  President keeps talking about American citizens. Well, until recent  days, it has never been racist to talk about American citizens.   In fact, going back again to the comment of Benjamin Franklin after  the Constitutional Convention: ``It's a republic, if you can keep it.''   He knew that republics, the very few that have been established, that  just means they elect representatives. It is not the totally democratic  governing that was, for example, in Athens, as a city state. They had a  democracy.   And what historians have seen, clearly, is that when it is a true  democracy, where everybody participates--they had jurors, they would  have 501 jurors in just a court case. And what that would often lead to  what would be mob action. I mean, people get stirred up, and they end  up coming out with a sentence like they did for Socrates, that was far  beyond anything appropriate whatsoever. You take an innocent man like  that and have him put to death simply because you had too many jurors  that got each other worked up.   So that is where Rome made a great stride forward. They said, you  know what? There were problems. It was a good idea, but there were  problems with a complete democracy, where everybody participates in all  governing decisions, except jurors, and that is 501.   But Rome figured out, we need a representative form of government; so  it has parts of it that are democracies, and in part it is a  representative government, so it is a republic. And until Caesar  crossed the Rubicon and made it into a virtual dictatorship--of course,  that didn't last long because as, Mark Antony said:         Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable       man. So are they all, all honorable men.    There was trouble in the Roman empire. But they began to have a flood  of people that were not Roman citizens. They lost their power. They had  begun bread and circuses; gave away way too much in what was considered  welfare of that day, bread and circuses.   And, as I recall, it was even Caesar that decided maybe we are  corrupting people by providing this form of welfare and entertainment.  But by that point, it was too late to rein it in and, for all of these  factors, and others coming into play, people crossing the borders and  taking a toll, the Roman Empire was eventually lost.   No country is going to last forever. I love this country. I have  offered to die for this country. That is what you do when you sign up  and take an oath in the U.S. military.   But when people begin not to appreciate the good things that their  nation does and is doing, has done, and they build up hatred toward  their own nation, you really are on the downhill slide and you are  moving ever closer to the dustbin of history. Eventually every country  is going to get there.   But our goal in this body should be to perpetuate this little  experiment in self-government, the best ever contrived. Keep it going  as long as possible. Don't let it die on our watch. But it is in  trouble.   And as we have bills, I don't know anybody on this entire House  floor, either party, who is against standing behind and helping those  incredible American heroes of 9/11 and the days following. We are all  for that.                                time  1345    But then we have people in the majority who see an opportunity.  Instead of doing what we normally do and have an authorization for 5  years and 5 years extend 10 years, we had a bill that was extended to  2092.   There will not be a firefighter or policeman who is alive anywhere  close to 2092, first responder that was there during 9/11 and doing  these heroic works. So why would they choose 2092?  [[Page H7139]]    Well, the saying in Washington is no matter how cynical you get, it  is never enough to catch up. But you go by what we have seen.   People in this body often, and it has happened on both sides of the  aisle, like to get a bill, especially with money, get it extended out  as far as possible, way beyond the existence of people for whom it is  dedicated, and then when those people eventually pass away, you will  see an effort to come in here and say, wow, we had all this money that  we have passed overwhelmingly, and now the people aren't there that it  was originally meant for, so let's start giving this money to other  people, people that we want to curry favor with.   That is not the way it is supposed to go. I voted for it out of  respect for our heroes, but for goodness' sake, 2092, seriously? How  could anybody with a straight face say: Oh, if you are not for paying  out billions and billions of dollars in 2091 to 2092, then you must  hate the first responders of 9/11? That is ridiculous.   They have inspired me from that time, and in my hometown in east  Texas and other towns all over east Texas, all the same thing. People  lined up to give blood.   The first time I went, they said: There is hours and hours of wait to  give blood for people in New York so we would ask that you come back  tomorrow.   You couldn't even get in. That was true all over east Texas and all  over the country. People cared deeply about what they had seen happen.  We were under attack from outside. There were no hyphenated Americans.  We were all just Americans wanting to help each other and help those  who had been harmed.   So I hope that the Senate will take a look at that and be able to be  more responsible so that the 9/11 fund will truly be for the people who  the 9/11 fund says it is supposed to be for.   We are loading up future generations with so much debt. That alone  could be enough to bring down our country. It is time to become  responsible.   And I know across the aisle we have had these hearings on the bills,  the Equality Act, for example, and I understand the sentiment behind it  is to try to avoid any type of discomfort, uncomfortable feelings by  anybody because of their chosen gender.   But as we brought out at our hearings before the Equality Act was  passed in committee and here on the floor, there is a danger, and it is  not about making people a little uncomfortable because they are  biologically male but they want to go to a women's restroom.   As a former felony judge, I have heard the testimony about the  trauma. I have seen the effects of sexual assault on women. I have read  and understand that women who are victims of sexual assault have three  to four times more occurrence of PTSD.   There are different explanations as to why they have so much higher  rate of PTSD than even our soldiers in combat, but also that a trigger  for reliving the horrors, the awful crime against them and their person  is to be in a small, confined area and have someone of the opposite sex  come in. We were laughed at and belittled when we brought up that  concern.   The story was contained in another story. It was about a British  leader who was pushing for transgender bathrooms. It is now under  criminal investigation or charges.   But this was a story I missed back in February: ``A trans `woman'  ''--meaning biological man but considered himself, herself, whatever  you want to say, to be a woman--``was allowed to walk free from  Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court in Scotland after being convicted of sexually  assaulting a 10-year-old girl in a supermarket restroom.   ``The attacker, whose name is given as Katie Dolatowski, waited for  the young victim to come out of a toilet cubicle at Morrisons  supermarket . . . then grabbed her by the face and forced her back  inside.   ``Dolatowski told the girl to remove her trousers and warned that a  man outside would kill her mother . . . but she fought back, striking  the pedophile in the face, belly, and crotch and tearing away to her  father and siblings outside.   ``Dolatowski had attempted to photograph a 12-year-old as she  urinated at another supermarket a month prior . . . but Judge James  Williamson decided not to send the sex offender to prison, instead  handing down a tagging order and community service order. . . . The  girl's mother was horrified, saying she felt `very, very let down' and  that she did not have any confidence whatsoever that Dolatowski will  not go out and do something equally as bad or worse.''   It is important to still discuss this because the Senate hasn't taken  it up, and I hope they won't take it up because of the problems of the  so-called, misnamed Equality Act. It is not equality for female sexual  assault victims, that is for sure.   But then it contained another reference: ``Girl Guides''--it is like  Girl Scouts--``Expels Leaders Who Opposed Trans Shower-Sharing  Policies.   And this insert says: Two Girl Guides leaders were expelled after  they opposed ``new rules which compel units to let transgender- identifying males share showers and other facilities with girls as  young as 5.''   There are other references like: Allegedly transgender prisoner gets  life after raping two women, sexually assaulting inmates in female  jail.   Another: Mother arrested in front of her children for calling a trans  activist a man; said Kate Scottow was arrested for calling a trans  activist a man online and a judge has banned her from referencing their  former male identity.   So there was a time when people could say hurtful things in America,  but as we see with any declining society--not declining in goods and  services, but declining in morality and as a society. We see it in L.A.    The most so-called liberated and liberal leaders of cities in America  seem to have more homelessness, more defecation on the streets, more  pollution.   Where are all the green activists, by the way? I mean, these people  are polluting like crazy, and they are out there with signs picketing  everywhere else, but for some reason they don't seem to be bothered by  the destruction of an orderly society.   You go back to some of the great city-states, one of their big  problems was sewage. And if you have too much homelessness, you  encourage it, bless it, then it can cause problems for any society.   But that also brings us to our southern border, the continued  expressions from this body about wanting to get rid of any enforcement  of our border and refusing, in the $4.6 billion that was passed out of  this House, not one dime for detention beds, not one dime to help the  Border Patrol do their job to secure the border, not one dime to help  build a wall barrier where we need it, when we basically, because of  liberals who may mean well, but they basically turned over our southern  border to drug cartels.   Some of the most evil people in the world, these drug cartels, and we  are not going to enforce our border. That message from the majority has  gone out over and over again, and what it does, as the Border Patrol  will tell you if you go down there as often as I have: Every time one  of you guys in Congress talk about amnesty, legalization, not enforcing  the border, any of those things, we get surges.   And they will also tell you, and I have seen it for myself, the drug  cartels control everybody, when and where they cross the border, and  they will send groups. The Border Patrol know when they send a group in  the middle of the night, they have to stand there and go through in- processing all these people, asking them their questions.   And despite what some of our colleagues across the aisle have said,  these are sympathetic border patrolmen. I have seen it over and over  again. I have seen hundreds of very sympathetic border patrolmen, but  they are at their wits end.   An article here from Michaela Ross today talking about ``Sick,  Exhausted Border Agents Stoke Exodus Fear in Migrant Surge,'' the  migrants, the illegal aliens coming in.   I have been castigated for referring to them as ``aliens,'' like they  are from some other planet; and I had to remind my colleagues the very  bill that they were supporting referred to them as aliens, and they  were a little embarrassed because they didn't realize they referred to  them as aliens. They thought it was just mean-spirited Republicans.   It is kind of interesting when you see that kind of thing, but it is  a tragedy,  [[Page H7140]]  and it is a humanitarian crisis on our southern border. And it is no  longer just a humanitarian crisis for those who are pouring over our  border illegally. They are taking their toll on the border patrolmen.  Some have suspected that: Gee, maybe that is a strategy of the  Democratic Party.   You keep talking about amnesty, about getting rid of border  enforcement, which will encourage more and more people to come in.   You keep claiming that people, no matter whether they came in  illegally or legally, should be allowed to vote and keep encouraging  people in.   You refuse to give a dime for border enforcement. You refuse to give  a dime for beds to house people who are pouring in illegally for what  they need to be able to detain people that commit criminal acts in  coming into the country.   You continue to talk about doing away with any criminality to  violating the law and more people come in.   You devastate those officers who have taken an oath to defend our  border and our Constitution, and they are already having recruiting  problems.   Why would somebody want to come work where you have got a major party  of the two in the country that castigates you at every turn, says you  can't or won't protect babies, children, you do not care, you are mean,  you are evil, when you are out there doing everything you can, and you  are being harassed, not being given what you need?   And then we had this bill this week in Judiciary talking about it was  going to add millions and millions and millions of dollars of  requirements for the Border Patrol to have to follow, lest they be  pursued with some kind of charge or allegation, and yet not give them a  dime to do those jobs, knowing that the result will be more and more  people flooding in, more and more humanitarian crisis. Then you blame  the humanitarian crisis on those who are trying to secure our Nation.                                time  1400    Then you get an allowance for all of those people who have poured in  illegally, and many of them don't speak English. They don't know what  is going on. They have never been educated on how you sustain a self- governing country.   All I can figure, the assessment has to have been made, yes, it will  have our country in chaos for a little while, and we will have to take  away some freedoms because of all the chaos, but, as Democrats have  said, that will end the Republican Party nationally, as the Democrats  were able to do in California with 2 or 3 million pouring in and voting  that had come in illegally after the amnesty in 1986.   Actually, after 1986, when they were given amnesty, now it is legal  for them to vote, and that changed California into a very Democratic  State.   And there is an assessment: We can do that for the Nation and  eliminate the Republican Party as having any kind of viability. And  then once we do that, even though it has taken quite a toll on the  country, we will get control back again. We will rein in the chaos, and  the Republicans will be gone and we will be a one-party country.   Somebody must have made that kind of assessment to be pushing the  kind of bills that they are.   We cannot allow that chaos to occur and to build, because it wasn't  just Ronald Reagan, but historians throughout time have noted, once you  have a country that has had great freedom and it loses that freedom, it  doesn't come back. Reagan said not in that generation, but I have  trouble finding where it ever came back once a nation of freedom lost  it. That is a real potential if we don't get things under control.   I think God has blessed this country more than any country. I know  Solomon's Israel was just an absolutely amazing place, but there is no  place that has ever had our opportunities, our individual freedoms, our  individual assets, never in the history of the world.   There is nothing wrong with recognizing the greatness that America  has been. It is only in recognizing America's greatness that you can  determine we want to perpetuate that for future generations to have  those opportunities, those freedoms, those assets.   But we are in trouble, and there has got to be a change or our time  as the greatest country in history will become a self-fulfilling  prophesy of those who say: ``Ah, it was never that great.'' ``Nah, it  is not a great country.'' ``No, I have always been embarrassed of  America.'' That will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. We will lose  our greatness. We will lose our freedom.   I said to three individuals from Australia who were here on Capitol  Hill a couple years ago: Hey, I have had people up here say when we  lose our freedom, I guess we can all come to Australia.   Neither of them even laughed. One of them said: Do you not  understand, if you lose your freedom in America, China will take over  Australia before you could ever get there?   America is a shining light on a hill. We give people hope. I have  heard it and seen it from Africans with tears in their eyes--and, yes,  they were Christians. Maybe you would be prejudiced against them. But  they said: We need America strong if we are going to have any chance of  security and freedom in our own country.   Let's keep America strong. Let's support Israel. Let's support  enforcing the law as it is, as it has been, and as we need it to  prolong and perpetuate this incredible country.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
