 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 150th  anniversary of Franklin Savings Bank, one of the oldest and most  successful business in Franklin County and the only locally owned bank  in Franklin County. Today the bank has eight locations across western  and central Maine, including a commercial lending center in Ellsworth.   Founded on February 24, 1868, when Governor Joshua Chamberlain signed  a bill into law incorporating the bank, the bank's early mission was  ``to help the people of Franklin County lay by something each year and  deposit in some good bank where it will be safe and earn a little  something.'' At the beginning, President Joseph Fairbanks said that  they preferred the small accounts of children, which would be added to  little by little over time, over the large account of a rich man. Times  have changed since then, with the bank now serving four Maine counties  with eight locations, but their dedication to customer service has not  waivered. Over the past 150 years, Franklin Savings Bank has shifted  from focusing on individual savings accounts to now also offering home  mortgage lending and commercial lending. Online banking services were  added to Franklin Savings Bank in 2001 and have only increased, today  offering customers the ability to deposit, complete transactions, and  pay bills all from the convenience of their cellphone.   Franklin Savings Bank is not only committed to its customers, but  also to its neighbors in the communities it serves. In 2000, the board  of directors established the Franklin Savings Bank Community  Development Foundation. This is a not-for-profit foundation that  supports the community, economic, and educational needs within areas  served by the bank. Over the first 15 years, the foundation has  contributed $2 million to local economic development, education, and  various charities.   Amidst the mortgage crisis of 2008, Franklin Savings Bank continued  to be a safe and trusted place for the people of Maine to keep their  money. Franklin Savings Bank was named the Strongest Bank in Maine for  19 years and, during the mortgage crisis, the strongest bank in New  England. Today Franklin Savings Bank is consistently ranked as one of  the safest banks in the country. Their mission is to continue to be a  financially strong and independent community bank, and I look forward  to seeing their continued growth and impact on the State of Maine. I  join with their customers in congratulating Franklin Savings Bank on  150 years of leadership in western Maine.                            ____________________
