 Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to serve on this great  committee under the chairman's leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this important bill, which  incorporates my bill, the Community CARE Act, which reauthorizes  funding for community health centers for the next 2 years.   Community health centers have a proven track record of providing  high-quality, cost-efficient healthcare to approximately 25 million  Americans, including 7 million children, and 300,000 veterans each  year. There are over 100 million coordinated and integrated patient  visits through the 1,400 community health centers across the country.                                time  0945    This bill will reauthorize CHIP for the next 5 years. This program is  vital for the roughly 360,000 children on CHIP in Florida alone.   Additionally, this bill provides clarity for CHIP buy-in programs,  such as the one we have in Florida. This sets the rules of the road and  will ensure that 12,000 children in Florida's CHIP buy-in program will  continue to have access to CHIP.   Mr. Speaker, let's get this done now for our children. I urge passage  of this important piece of legislation.
