 Mr. President, I would like to take this  opportunity to thank and congratulate a constituent of mine, Annapolis  resident Harvey Lewis Stein, whose inspiration, vision, and  perseverance were singularly responsible for construction of the  Commodore Uriah P. Levy Center and Jewish Chapel at the U.S. Naval  Academy. The facility is named for Levy (1792-1862), the first Jewish  commodore in the U.S. Navy who was famous for refusing to flog his men,  choosing to lead through inspiration, not intimidation. The Levy Center  is centrally located between Mitscher Hall, where midshipmen eat  together three times a day, and Bancroft Hall, where all 4,400 of them  live. It contains a 410-seat synagogue, a kosher kitchen, a fellowship  hall, a character learning center, classrooms, and offices for the  brigade's social director, the academic board, and the academy's honor  board. It is stunningly beautiful, designed by internationally renowned  architect Joseph A. Boggs.   When the U.S. Naval Academy was founded in 1845, all midshipmen were  required to attend Christian worship services. It was not until 1938  that the academy allowed Jewish midshipmen to attend a local  synagogue--Congregation Knesset--on Sunday to worship their own faith.  In 1981, the academy opened an All-Faith Chapel, which provided worship  space for Christians and Jews alike. This chapel included an Ark, a  Torah reading table, and storage for prayer books and other religious  articles. Catholic midshipmen used this chapel to celebrate daily Mass.  While this chapel was a great improvement over the other spaces offered  for Jewish worship, it too presented problems, particularly with regard  to seating. It often proved too small for services celebrating major  holidays and life-cycle events.   Still, the Jewish program grew, and a full-time Jewish chaplain  joined the academy's complement of chaplains in 1986. The need for a  dedicated Jewish chapel was not just based on space constraints,  however. There was a need to show the public, including the Navy, that  Jews do serve in the military and have done so in every American  conflict since pre-Colonial days. In addition, Jewish middies needed  the resources to enhance their identity, both religiously and  culturally.   Supporters of a Jewish chapel created the Friends of the Jewish  Chapel--FOJC--to provide programs for Jewish midshipmen and support the  needs of the rabbi. CDR Howard Pinskey, SC, USN (Ret), a 1962 academy  graduate, became the FOJC's first president. He navigated the  organization through its earliest days of development and became the  cheerleader who bridged the divide between the birth of a fledgling  Jewish community and the opportunities that awaited its growth.   Many people worked for many years on the project, but one person had  the skill and tenacity to see it through to completion. In 1994, Harvey  Stein envisioned a dedicated house for Jewish worship, as well as a  social hall for sharing communal dinners, holding classes, enhancing  Jewish culture, examining ethics, and bringing together students of all  faiths to congregate, study, engage, and socialize.   To proceed, Mr. Stein had to bring the Naval Academy and the  Department of the Navy on board, find a building site, design the  building, and raise the necessary funding. Mr. Stein was part of the  group that successfully appealed to the academy's administration and  the Secretary of the Navy, obtaining a letter of intent and then a  letter of commitment. Then, Mr. Stein became instrumental in providing  the FOJC with its necessary 501 (c) (3) status which allowed FOJC to  begin the fund raising process.   Mr. Stein, a successful entrepreneur who founded the home decor and  merchandise firm HLD, is a team-builder who skillfully cultivated an  effective group of volunteers and professional men and women to  champion the Jewish chapel's cause. Through his tenacity, he found ways  to navigate the hurdles that seemed to block the way to success. He  cultivated relationships with military personnel and civilians who knew  how to weave their way through the labyrinth of bureaucracy to a  successful end. He encouraged good work by setting an example through  his own energy and work ethic. He opened his heart, his office, and his  home to the project. Most importantly, he trusted his team, and in  return, more than 3,000 donors from three countries lent their  financial, legal, spiritual, military, and political support to the  Commodore Uriah P. Levy Center and Jewish Chapel. The Levy Center cost  $8.0 million to design, build, and furnish. Military construction funds  totaled $1.8 million; private donations the FOJC raised covered the  balance. Today, this magnificent building stands as a mitzvah and a  testament to one man's resolve that failure was never an  option.                            ____________________
