 Mr. President, I am here to address the specific topic  about energy laws, but hearing my friend and colleague from Connecticut  talk about the healthcare law, I would just point out that as 20  Democratic candidates for President assemble tonight and tomorrow night  in Miami, they are going to be there calling for a repeal and  replacement of the Obama healthcare law.   The leading candidate, the Senator from Vermont, is going to say,  under this healthcare law that we have now in this country, this  healthcare system is the most bureaucratic, inefficient system in the  world, and he is going to propose a one-size-fits-all healthcare system  that repeals and replaces the ObamaCare healthcare law with a system  where people will pay more to wait longer for worse care. As a result,  180 million people who get their insurance through their jobs will lose  their insurance. Also, as a result, the 20 million Americans who are on  Medicare Advantage will lose that coverage as well.                                Energy Policy    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss my continued  efforts to modernize our Nation's energy laws.   Since my arrival in 2007 in the Senate, I have worked in the Senate  on pro-growth energy policies. My goal has always been to protect  workers, to promote American energy, and to provide for innovation.   The Presiding Officer is from an energy State. He knows that today  the United States is the world's top energy producer. We are the global  leaders in oil as well as natural gas. Still, the energy sector is  evolving at a fast clip. We need to stay ahead of the curve to stay on  top, so our laws should reflect this changing reality.   The key, of course, is innovation. That is why I am constantly  talking with folks in the industry, people back home in Wyoming, and  taking the pulse. I listen to the workers in coal mines and oilfields  of Campbell County, to the researchers at the labs at the University of  Wyoming. What we discuss are best practices and issues such as: How can  we streamline energy permitting? How can we speed research? How can we  ensure safety and protect the environment?   My point is, we need to know the situation on the ground. I know the  Presiding Officer hears that in North Dakota on a regular basis. That  is how we need to make sure energy laws make sense--knowing what is  happening on the ground.   I proposed practical reforms that reflect that reality. I recently  offered legislation to modernize the Federal electricity law. It is  called the UPDATE PURPA Act. PURPA refers to the 1978 Public Utility  Regulatory Policy Act. Senators Risch, Cramer, and Daines are original  cosponsors of this UPDATE PURPA law. Principally, we want to protect  families from inflated electric bills.   People in Wyoming and North Dakota and other States are overpaying.  [[Page S4538]]  That is because PURPA requires State utilities to purchase renewable  power and then pay above-market rates to do it. They have to buy it  even when their customers do not need it, and that is the problem.   Forty years after that law was passed in 1978--fast forward, here we  are 41 years later, and clearly it has outlived its purpose. The law's  original intent was to diversify power sources, and it certainly  succeeded. Wind and solar power now provide about 9 percent of the  electricity in this country--9 percent wind and solar.   The fact is, renewable power technology has improved rapidly so we no  longer need to micromanage these purchases. Consumers should not  continue to overpay for electricity due to outdated rules, regulations,  and laws. UPDATE PURPA would solve this problem. It protects utility  customers from added costs; it frees State utilities from unnecessary  mandates to buy power; and it helps develop all energy sources,  including renewable energy.   I am also working to pass a bill called the USE IT Act. It stands for  Utilizing Significant Emissions with Innovative Technologies. This  bipartisan bill would help researchers find uses for captured carbon  dioxide emissions.   The research is already happening in Wyoming. It is taking place  outside Gillette in the Integrated Test Center. The USE IT Act will  further this effort. It will apply our Nation's brightest minds to take  carbon from the air, to capture it from the air, to trap it, and to  transform it into valuable products.   Captured carbon can be used to extract oil from wells that otherwise  would not be profitable. It can also be used to make building materials  and carbon fiber. It can be used for medical purposes.   In addition, I am working to promote nuclear energy. Nuclear power is  safe, reliable, and carbon-free. Today it provides 60 percent of  America's carbon-free electricity. It is by far our largest carbon-free  source, and it is doubling the wind and solar in terms of the total  that we get from wind and solar. We have already made progress on  advanced nuclear technology because earlier this year we passed a  bipartisan nuclear bill called the Nuclear Energy Innovation and  Modernization Act, and that became law--signed into law.   This bill, now law, will ensure that we remain a leader in nuclear  innovation. It will simplify the process for licensing and developing  advanced reactors. This progress will help increase our use of carbon- free energy. We need all the energy. We need the renewable energy. We  need the nuclear energy. We need the oil, gas, and coal. We need all of  it, and we must address our nuclear waste problem.   That is why I fought to complete the licensing of the storage  facility at Yucca Mountain. I recently chaired a committee hearing on  this draft proposal.   As I wrote in the Wall Street Journal, ``The lack of progress on  Yucca Mountain has become a roadblock for nuclear power in America.''   Both parties want Americans to use more carbon-free energy, so both  parties should embrace sensible, scientific solutions.   Another energy issue I am addressing is reform in the process that we  use to get permits to get permission to explore for energy, to use our  resources. Earlier this year, I introduced a bill called the ONSHORE  Act. It stands for Opportunities for the Nation and States to Harness  Onshore Resources for Energy.   We have a very talented staff that comes up with these creative  names. It is onshore energy--Opportunities for Nations and States to  Harness Resources for Energy. The ONSHORE Act will simplify the Federal  onshore oil and gas permitting process. So whether we are talking about  oil and gas permitting or utilities or carbon capture or nuclear power,  we must engineer our way to American energy solutions.   Commonsense reforms will help the United States stay on top and stay  safe at the same time.   I yield the floor.
