Mr. President, basketball brought Seymour Bryson to the  Southern Illinois University at Carbondale in 1955. He had a record- setting career at the school, winning most valuable player all 4 years,  setting a then-school record in scoring and holding the school's record  for rebounds, which stands to this day. As remarkable as his basketball  career was, Seymour went on to make his mark with more than four  decades of work making SIU a better place.   Seymour was a three-degree alumnus of SIU, earning a bachelor's  degree in social work in 1959, a master's degree in rehabilitation  counseling in 1961, and a doctorate in educational psychology in 1972.  At the time, he was one of three African Americans to progress from  assistant professor to full professor at SIU, first African-American  associate dean of a college, and the second of three African-American  deans.   Generations of all ages could come to Seymour for advice. It was that  kind of trust that earned him leadership roles throughout the  community. He was active in a variety of roles, including president of  the Carbondale chapter of the NAACP, member and chair of the  Diversifying Faculty Initiative, president of the Jackson County 708  Mental Health Board, and president and member of the board of directors  of the Carbondale United Way.   Seymour received numerous awards throughout his life, including the  Senator Emil Jones Mentoring Award, the Introspect Access Award, the  Distinguished Service Award from the Illinois Committee on Black  Concerns in Higher Education, and the 2019 SIU Distinguished Alumni  Award for his humanitarian impact.   His family was never far from his heart. He loved time with his  grandchildren. They had wonderful trips to Dairy Queen and seeing  movies together. They got their love of reading through him and their  trips to bookstores. He captured much of these moments in film as an  amateur photographer.   Seymour helped define what it meant to be a Saluki in his career and  life. He passed away on May 5, we remember him for his service to his  community.   Seymour is survived by his loving wife of 59 years, Marjorie Bryson;  son, Todd Bryson; daughters, Robin Bryson and Keri and her husband  Stephen Burns; grandchildren, Jordan Bryson, Keric Young, Kendall  Young, Adrian Bryson, Francesca Sanchez, Fernando Sanchez, and Isaiah  Burns; sisters, Susie Barnes and Janice Bryson Carol and her husband  Paul Henry of Carbondale, and brother, Raymond and his wife Cynthia  Bryson; and a host of nieces, nephews, and dear friends.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it didn't feel historic at the time for  Harvey Welch, but it was. Harvey, a native of Centralia, IL, came to  Southern Illinois University Carbondale on a basketball scholarship and  became the first Black student at the university to letter in  basketball in 1951. He achieved this 3 years before the Brown v. Board  ruling found school segregation unconstitutional.   Harvey played basketball at SIU from 1951 to 1954. He also was the  first Black student to complete the ROTC program at the university.  When he finished college, he joined the U.S. Air Force and was one of  the first three Black officers to be promoted to lieutenant colonel.  [[Page S2917]]    Never forgetting SIU, Harvey came back to Carbondale after he retired  from the Air Force in 1975. He became the first Black dean of student  life at SIU and served as vice chancellor of student affairs from 1987  to 2000.   In addition to SIU, Harvey continued serving his community through  the Carbondale Park District, Rotary International, and Southern  Illinois Regional Social Services. His work earned him the Carbondale  Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year Award in 2007.   SIU recognized with the Distinguished Service Award during  commencement in 2018. For 22 years, students benefited not only from  his leadership and wisdom, but from the Harvey and Trish Welch  Scholarship Fund too.   Harvey helped define what it meant to be a Saluki. He loved hunting  and golf, but his commitment to SIU and his family came first. Future  generations of Salukis will continue to look up to Harvey's legacy of  service and dedication.   On May 4, Harvey passed away after an extraordinary life of service  to his country and his community.   Harvey is survived by his four children and their spouses: Harvey  Cato Welch and Anita, Gordon Patrick Welch and Retha, Karen Annette  Welch Edwards and Terry, and Brian David Welch and Petrice. He leaves  behind 11 grandchildren, 3 great-grandchildren, and numerous nieces and  nephews.                            ____________________
