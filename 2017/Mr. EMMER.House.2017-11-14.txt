 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 21st Century Flood  Reform Act, which will reauthorize and reform our National Flood  Insurance Program.   The NFIP provides important relief. Millions of Americans rely on  this program to provide coverage when disaster strikes. The nearly 50- year-old NFIP program, however, is in desperate need of reform.   Today's legislation will not only reauthorize the program for 5  years, it will take steps to better align premium rates to risk,  improve FEMA's mapping and appeals process, and begin to correct the  way the NFIP manages what are known as repetitive loss properties.   Most importantly, H.R. 2874 lays the groundwork for a private flood  insurance marketplace to take hold, which will improve the fiscal  stability and solvency of the NFIP for future generations to come. This  bill is a good start, but these reforms must continue to be built upon  in the years ahead.   I am thankful for the hard work of Chairman Hensarling, Housing and  Insurance Subcommittee Chairman Duffy, and the entire Financial  Services Committee staff for working to get this bill to the floor  today.   As many continue to rebuild their lives following the devastation of  Harvey, Irma, Sandy, and others, we need a National Flood Insurance  Program that stimulates choice and encourages proactive behaviors to  better protect our citizens.   Mr. Speaker, again, this legislation is a good start. I encourage all  of my colleagues to support this bill.
