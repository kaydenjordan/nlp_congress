 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  SAFE Banking Act.   This is a banking bill. It defends civil liberties with a simple  concept: If it is legal in your State, you should be able to bank it.  No Federal regulator should be able to block an American's lawful  access to the financial system.   In Ohio, legal, State-regulated businesses are being forced into  using cash or intermediaries. This bill will help get cash off our  streets and into the regulated financial system.   I am also pleased the bill includes Mr. Luetkemeyer's legislation to  stop the closing of accounts on the basis of political biases or  motivations.   For far too long, financial institutions have said: You are not going  to bank those people, are you?   It is time to defend civil liberties and pass this important bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge bipartisan, broad support of its passage.
