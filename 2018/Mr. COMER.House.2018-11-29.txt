 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2846) to require the collection of voluntary feedback on services  provided by agencies, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 2846         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Agency Customer       Experience Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--        (1) the Federal Government serves the people of the United       States and should seek to continually improve public services       provided by the Federal Government based on customer       feedback;        (2) the people of the United States deserve a Federal       Government that provides efficient, effective, and high-      quality services across multiple channels;        (3) many agencies, offices, programs, and Federal employees       provide excellent service to individuals, however many parts       of the Federal Government still fall short on delivering the       customer service experience that individuals have come to       expect from the private sector;        (4) according to the 2016 American Customer Satisfaction       Index, the Federal Government ranks among the bottom of all       industries in the United States in customer satisfaction;        (5) providing quality services to individuals improves the       confidence of the people of the United States in their       government and helps agencies achieve greater impact and       fulfill their missions; and        (6) improving service to individuals requires agencies to       work across organizational boundaries, leverage technology,       collect and share standardized data, and develop customer-      centered mindsets and service strategies.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       all agencies should strive to provide high-quality,       courteous, effective, and efficient services to the people of       the United States and seek to measure, collect, report, and       utilize metrics relating to the experience of individuals       interacting with agencies to continually improve services to       the people of the United States.

SEC. 8. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that adequate Federal funding       is needed to ensure agency staffing levels that can provide       the public with appropriate customer service levels.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 2846, sponsored by Congressman  Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania.   The Federal Government is in the service industry. Members of this  Chamber and our staffs work every day, both here and in our respective  districts, to serve our constituents, the American people. The same can  be said of the executive branch.   For instance, the Department of Veterans Affairs serves this Nation's  military men and women by providing healthcare services, funding  education under the GI Bill, and helping veterans and their families  afford homes.   However, the 2017 American Customer Satisfaction Index found that the  Federal Government ranks near the bottom of all industries in the  United States when it comes to customer service. The Federal Government  can and must do better for the very people who pay its bills.   In the private sector, companies understand the importance of  customer service. As Americans, we can barely  [[Page H9716]]  go one day without being asked by a company to provide feedback,  whether it is when we make a purchase online, when we call our banks or  credit card companies, or when we go out to eat at a restaurant. But  Federal agencies often don't prioritize customer feedback because they  don't have to compete for customers.   The Federal Agency Customer Experience Act will change that by  requiring certain high-impact agencies to collect voluntary feedback on  the services they provide, while also making it easier for other  agencies to do the same if they choose to.   Using feedback provided by the public, agencies will know more about  which aspects of their services are working and which need to be  improved. The voluntary questionnaires created under this bill will  address the individual's satisfaction with a specific agency  interaction and ensure they were treated with professionalism and  respect.   Finally, the Government Accountability Office will create  governmentwide customer experience scorecards to show everyone which  agencies excel and which agencies need to improve.   I thank the bipartisan group of my colleagues who supported H.R. 2846  during committee consideration of the bill, and I urge all Members to  support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3121) to require the purchase of domestically made flags of the  United States of America for use by the Federal Government, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3121         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``All-American Flag Act''.       SEC. 2. REQUIREMENT FOR AGENCIES TO BUY DOMESTICALLY MADE                     UNITED STATES FLAGS.         (a) Requirement for Agencies to Buy Domestically Made       United States Flags.--        (1) In general.--Chapter 63 of title 41, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new       section:       ``Sec. 6310. Requirement for agencies to buy domestically         made United States flags         ``(a) Requirement.--Except as provided in subsections (b)       through (d), funds appropriated or otherwise available to an       agency may not be used for the procurement of any flag of the       United States, unless such flag has been 100 percent       manufactured in the United States from articles, materials,       or supplies that have been grown or 100 percent produced or       manufactured in the United States.        ``(b) Availability Exception.--Subsection (a) does not       apply to the extent that the head of the agency concerned       determines that satisfactory quality and sufficient quantity       of a flag described in such subsection cannot be procured as       and when needed at United States market prices.        ``(c) Exception for Certain Procurements.--Subsection (a)       does not apply to the following:        ``(1) Procurements by vessels in foreign waters.        ``(2) Procurements for resale purposes in any military       commissary, military exchange, or nonappropriated fund       instrumentality operated by an agency.        ``(3) Procurements for amounts less than the simplified       acquisition threshold.        ``(d) Presidential Waiver.--        ``(1) In general.--The President may waive the requirement       in subsection (a) if the President determines a waiver is       necessary to comply with any trade agreement to which the       United States is a party.        ``(2) Notice of waiver.--Not later than 30 days after       granting a waiver under paragraph (1), the President shall       publish a notice of the waiver in the Federal Register.  [[Page H9717]]         ``(e) Definitions.--In this section:        ``(1) Agency.--The term `agency' has the meaning given the       term `executive agency' in section 102 of title 40.        ``(2) Simplified acquisition threshold.--The term       `simplified acquisition threshold' has the meaning given that       term in section 134.''.        (2) Clerical amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of such chapter is amended by adding at the end the       following new item:  ``6310. Requirement for agencies to buy domestically made United States                flags.''.         (b) Applicability.--Section 6310 of title 41, United States       Code, as added by subsection (a)(1), shall apply with respect       to any contract entered into on or after the date that is 180       days after the date of the enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 3121, introduced by Congresswoman  Bustos of Illinois. H.R. 3121 is a bipartisan bill to ensure government  agencies only buy United States flags made from 100 percent American- made material.   Most Americans may think American flags purchased with taxpayer money  for the government are made here at home by Americans using only U.S.  materials. Surprisingly, this is not a uniform requirement in current  Federal acquisition laws and regulations. When it comes to the content  of American flags purchased by executive agencies, the requirements  under the current law are inconsistent.   The Department of Defense and the military departments generally are  required to buy American flags made entirely of U.S. materials, but  civilian agencies are currently permitted to buy flags that are  manufactured in the U.S. consisting of only 51 percent American-made  materials, or sometimes even less than that.   This bill brings all executive agencies under a single rule when it  comes to the content of American flags bought by agencies across the  government.   Rather than impose new rules and exceptions for DOD and civilian  agency flag purchases, the All-American Flag Act recognizes and  essentially adopts current DOD requirements and exceptions.                                time  1730    H.R. 3121 contains limited exceptions that recognize practical  realities, such as domestic nonavailability, in keeping with current  law governing DOD purchases in textiles, including U.S. flags.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Bustos and the many cosponsors  who are leading this effort to honor America's greatest symbol of  freedom, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3154) to amend the Inspector General Act of 1978 relative to the  powers of the Department of Justice Inspector General.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3154         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Inspector General Access Act       of 2017''.       SEC. 2. INVESTIGATIONS OF DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PERSONNEL.         Section 8E of the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C.       App.) is amended--        (1) in subsection (b)--        (A) in paragraph (2), by striking ``and paragraph (3)'';        (B) by striking paragraph (3);        (C) by redesignating paragraphs (4) and (5) as paragraphs       (3) and (4), respectively; and        (D) in paragraph (4), as redesignated, by striking       ``paragraph (4)'' and inserting ``paragraph (3)''; and        (2) in subsection (d), by striking ``, except with respect       to allegations described in subsection (b)(3),''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H9718]]  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3154 introduced by  Congressman Richmond of Louisiana.   Inspectors general perform a critical oversight function with regard  to misconduct at their respective agencies. The Oversight and  Government Reform Committee has long pushed for IGs to have timely and  complete access to all the information they need to fulfill their  oversight and investigative functions.   In continuance of that mission, H.R. 3154 removes an outdated statute  that prevents the inspector general from investigating certain  misconduct at the Justice Department.   Under current statute, the DOJ IG must refer allegations of  misconduct by Department attorneys to the Office of Professional  Responsibility, or OPR, rather than initiate an investigation himself.   The OPR existed prior to the creation of the DOJ IG in 1988, and OPR  retained this specific authority when the DOJ IG was created.   H.R. 3154 seeks to harmonize the DOJ inspector general's  investigative authority with that of the rest of the Federal inspectors  general, who are not similarly restricted. The bill repeals the  provision requiring the IG to refer allegations of attorney misconduct  to OPR.   Congress and, in particular, the Oversight and Government Reform  Committee have consistently supported the need for independent and  transparent oversight of Federal agencies and programs.   The current division of investigative authority at DOJ is  inconsistent with the committee's history of supporting the notion of  an unburdened IG.   The IG is confirmed by the Senate, is accountable to the public, and  only can be removed by the President after notification to Congress.  Further, the IG has statutory reporting obligations to both agency  leadership and Congress.   In contrast, the Director of OPR is selected and appointed by the  Attorney General, answers to the Attorney General, and can be removed  or disciplined by the Attorney General.   The IG's independence is critical to the value of their work.   The IG maintains transparency by publishing its reports on a public  website. The website contains information about the reports,  operations, and functions of the IG, including a full archive of its  completed reports and its ongoing work. This standard of transparency  does not apply to OPR.   Adverse findings by OPR against a DOJ lawyer are subject to review by  the Department's leadership and can be overruled by the Department's  leadership without any transparency.   It is important to note that this division of authority is a unique  situation in the Federal IG community. For instance, the Securities and  Exchange Commission Office of Inspector General is responsible for  handling misconduct allegations against SEC lawyers, including those  with prosecuting authority.   The need for this legislation has also been discussed in multiple  hearings before our committee and in reports by watchdog groups. The  DOJ IG, Michael Horowitz, testified before this committee most recently  on November 15, 2017, about the importance of eliminating this  discrepancy.   Congress' own watchdog, the Government Accountability Office, has  issued reports with recommendations to empower the DOJ IG.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 5759) to improve executive agency digital services, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5759 introduced by  Congressman Khanna of California.   The U.S. Federal Customer Experience Index measures citizen  interactions with the Federal Government. The 2018 index gave Federal  agencies failing scores. Citizens deserve and expect better from their  government.   H.R. 5759, the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act, or  21st Century IDEA, requires agencies to modernize their websites and  digital services. 21st Century IDEA takes a systematic approach to  modernizing websites, services, and forms, so as not to unduly burden  agencies.   New and redesigned agency websites will have to meet modernization  requirements, such as being searchable, customizable, and secure.                                time  1745    Meanwhile, each agency will survey and create a plan for updating its  existing websites and digital services, prioritizing those that are  used most by the public. Agencies will also digitize forms so that  electronic signatures may be used. All these modernization efforts will  improve our constituents' experiences when interacting with Federal  agencies.   The bill is supported by the Information Technology Industry Council;  The Software Alliance; Adobe; Information Technology and Innovation  Foundation; Software & Information Industry Association; ServiceNow;  CompTIA; and Microsoft.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Khanna and Congressman Ratcliffe for  introducing this important piece of legislation, and to all of the  cosponsors on the committee.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 6777) to amend chapter 3 of title 5, United States Code, to  require the publication of settlement agreements, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6777         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6777, introduced by  Congressman Palmer of Alabama.   Transparency and public participation are critical to maintaining the  public's trust in its government. Since the 1970s, however, Federal  agencies have increasingly resolved litigation by entering into consent  decrees and other legally binding settlement agreements rather than  through a public trial.   These agreements were often negotiated behind closed doors. Secret  negotiations prevent the public from holding the Federal Government  accountable for decisions made without their input.   States, local governments, industry stakeholders, and taxpayers are  often directly affected by the agreements, but are shut out of the  negotiations. For example, a consent decree entered into by the  Environmental Protection Agency required the city of Fort Smith,  Arkansas to reform its sewer systems in 12 years. Sewer utility bills  increased by 167 percent in 3 years to fund the obligations of the  agreement, while residents' incomes simultaneously decreased by 11  percent.   Due to poor recordkeeping, it is impossible for Congress and the  public to determine the full cost of Federal settlement agreements.  Most of the public's access to Federal settlement agreement information  is currently determined by individual agency discretion, usually issued  in the form of a press release.   Further, heads of agencies can declare a settlement confidential and  seal the contents of the agreement without providing any explanation.  The Settlement Agreement Information Database Act seeks to correct this  problem by shining light on the details of Federal settlement  agreements. The bill requires the establishment of an electronic and  publicly-available database of agencies' settlement agreements. It  requires Federal agencies to enter basic information about settlement  agreements into the database.   Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense transparency bill, and I urge my  colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 6901) to amend chapter 36 of title 44, United States Code, to  make certain changes relating to electronic Government services, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 6901         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Federal CIO Authorization       Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. CHANGES RELATING TO ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT SERVICES.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6901, introduced by  Congressman Will Hurd of Texas.   The Federal CIO Authorization Act is a bipartisan measure to  modernize legacy Federal technology policy.   The Office of Electronic Government was established by the E- Government Act of 2002. The head of this office is commonly referred to  as the Federal Chief Information Officer, or Federal CIO.   This bill authorizes and renames the Office of Electronic Government  as the Office of the Federal CIO. Codifying the position of the Federal  CIO emphasizes the importance of the role to the formation of  government-wide technology policy.   Under this bill, the Federal CIO will report to the Director of the  Office of Management and Budget.   The bill also codifies the position of Federal Chief Information  Security Officer, under the direction of the Federal CIO.   The bill promotes cost-efficient and secure technology use throughout  the Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Hurd), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
