 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms.  Jalisa Peterson from Liberty County High School on being a finalist for  the 2019 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards.   One of 29,000 students across the country who participated, Ms.  Peterson was one of only eight high school students acknowledged in the  State of Georgia for exceptional projects of community service.  Specifically, she volunteered at a local orphanage, playing games,  crafting art, reading, and building relationships with children, all  the way from newborns to 18-year-olds.   I am very proud of Ms. Peterson's work and glad to have someone like  her in the First Congressional District of Georgia.   I am glad to see this award is encouraging more community service, a  crucial aspect in order to make our world a better place to live.                            ____________________
