 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Dr.  Richard Gottfried, whose life was tragically taken, along with 10 other  congregants, during the attack at the Tree of Life Synagogue in  Pittsburgh on October 27.   Raised in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, Rich concluded his studies at the  University of Pittsburgh Dental School. There, he met Peg Durachko,  with whom he enjoyed a beautiful 38-year marriage.   Rich and Peg ran a local dental practice. They also joyfully gave  back to their community, providing dental care to the needy, including  immigrants and refugees, at the Catholic Charities Dental Clinic and at  the Squirrel Hill Medical Center.   Their boundless love was reflected in their full respect of and  engagement in each other's Jewish and Catholic faiths. When not serving  as synagogue president or providing dental care, Rich and Peg relished  evenings at home on their deck with wine and cigars.   What took Rich from us was an act of pure evil, hatred, and anti- Semitism. Love must overcome hate, and the love displayed by Rich and  Peg, and now continued by her, can lead us all from grieving to  healing.   May Rich's memory be a blessing to Peg and his whole community.                            ____________________
