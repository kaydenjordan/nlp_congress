 Madam Speaker, ever since the Magna Carta, it has  been a settled principle of good governance that the power that  appropriates public funds should not be the same power that spends  them. This is at the heart of our Constitution, the separation of  powers.   Simply speaking, it is mother's rule writ large. Mother has one slice  of pie left and two hungry sons. How does she cut the pie so that both  brothers are satisfied? One slices, the other chooses. One brother  cannot abuse his powers precisely because of the powers accorded to the  other.   And it is the same with our Constitution. One brother makes law, but  cannot enforce it; the other enforces law, but cannot make it. One  brother appropriates money, but cannot spend it; the other spends  money, but cannot appropriate it.   Now, imagine how differently mother's rule would work if the same  brother who sliced the pie also chose his piece.   Yet that is exactly the principle of congressional earmarks: Choosing  the same slice of pie you have just cut or, more precisely, spending  the same money that you have just appropriated. Nearly 1,500 earmarks,  totaling $5.7 billion, have been dropped into the so-called  infrastructure bill alone since a bipartisan spending frenzy revived  this corrupt practice this year.   This monumentally bad idea rests on two arguments. The first is that  elected Members of Congress, and not unelected bureaucrats, should  spend the people's money. The problem, of course, is that  Representatives aren't elected by all the people, only by their  distinct constituencies. Representatives are inherently biased toward  their own districts. That is why Congress is designed to act  collectively.   Only the executive answers to the entire Nation and can resist the  manifest excesses of a body controlled by 535 demanding constituencies  and their district-focused Representatives. That is why appropriating  money is a congressional function, and spending it is an executive one.   The second argument is that earmarks can grease legislation by buying  off the votes of individual Members whose judgment would otherwise  oppose a measure. Add a few local projects for that Member, and  suddenly a bill he would never vote for on its merits becomes a local  imperative overriding his sound judgment.   Please explain to me how that is a good thing.   And if earmarks are to be handed out as a reward for voting  legislation, Members will prudently keep a list of earmarks handy as  the demand for vote for any bill, whether or not they already plan to  vote for it.   And this is not a theoretical discussion. We have learned the hard  way what comes from breaching the Constitution's checks and balances.   The first problem is the corrupting nature of earmarks. When we place  the power to appropriate and the power to spend in the same hands, we  bypass the most important check that we have against corruption.   A local company produces a product the Pentagon neither needs nor  wants.   Well, what to do?   Ingratiate yourself with the local Congressman; have him tell the  Pentagon what it needs and who will provide it; and then reward him  lavishly at election time and repeat. It should come as no surprise  that many of the congressional scandals of the 1990s and 2000s arose  from earmarks.   Second, earmarks bypass the normal process in which projects compete  on their merits. Worthy projects don't need earmarks if appropriations  are spent by the executive branch, according to well-established  competitive, open-bid procedures. Earmarks are only required to protect  unworthy projects from merit-driven competition. And even if there is  such a thing as a good earmark, the price invariably is logrolling all  the bad ones.   Third, earmarks harm the central tenet of federalism: That local  projects should be financed by local communities, and Federal  expenditures reserved for the Nation's general welfare.   When a local government proposes an earmark, what is it saying?   It is saying the project is so low on its priority list, it won't  spend its own local taxpayers funds; but it is perfectly happy to have  taxpayers in other communities foot the bill. The result is a grab bag  of dubious projects that rob St. Petersburg to pay St. Paul for  projects St. Petersburg doesn't deem worthy enough to spend its own  funds on, and that St. Paul pays for but receives no benefit from.   We have sung this old song many times before and it has never ended  well.                            ____________________
