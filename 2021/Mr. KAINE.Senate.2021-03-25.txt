 Mr. President, this bill authorizes additions to two  existing wilderness areas within the George Washington National Forest  in Bath County, VA. This text represents years of negotiation and  compromise among Virginia stakeholders who rely in different ways on  the GW Forest.   In many parts of America, Federal land management is controversial.  Some may view these lands as repositories for timber, energy, or  minerals. Others may enjoy using recreational trails through them.  Others may believe that they should be left to nature and not  disturbed. The truth, of course, is that all of these uses are  important; the conflict lies in agreeing on which lands are best suited  to which purposes.   In the lead-up to the latest multiyear GW Forest Management Plan,  various forest users came together to see if they could find reasonable  compromises that would avoid years of unproductive disagreement and  litigation. This group, known as the George Washington National Forest  Stakeholder Collaborative, succeeded. Through hard work and consensus,  the collaborative made joint recommendations to the U.S. Forest Service  for forest management and protection. Preservation advocates consented  to timber harvest and other active forest restoration and management in  certain areas, while forest products interests consented to wilderness  and light management in other areas. Following this fruitful  collaboration, the Forest Service convened the Lower Cowpasture  Restoration and Management Project, bringing together the collaborative  and other stakeholders to help develop management activities on this  particular part of the forest in Bath County. Again, this collaborative  succeeded, with everyone getting some of what they want and giving some  ground.   The collaborative has now come together to support the wilderness  additions in this bill, which designates 4,500 acres to be added to the  Rich Hole Wilderness Area and 1,000 acres to be added to the Rough  Mountain Wilderness Area. I am proud to partner on this with my  colleague Senator Mark Warner, and we are following in the path blazed  by Senator John Warner and Representative Rick Boucher, who led the  original Virginia Wilderness Act in 1984. I am further proud that this  bill passed unanimously in the Senate last Congress and as part of a  package passed the House this Congress. I hope it will cross the finish  line soon.   Taking care of our Nation's public lands is good for the economy and  good for the environment. Land disputes may often be contentious, but  this example proves they don't have to be. When everyone comes to the  table and invests the necessary time, we can find common ground. I hope  this will be a lesson for us in other tough policy challenges, and I  encourage the Senate to support this bill.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Lee, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Whitehouse,          Mr. Wyden, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Booker, Ms. Warren,          Mr. Sanders, Mr. King, Mr. Kaine, and Mr. Wicker):   S. 1013.
