 Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago, America achieved the greatest  technological accomplishment in human history.   Three men, Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Buzz Aldrin, set off  from Cape Canaveral on a voyage that President Kennedy called ``the  most hazardous, and dangerous, and greatest adventure on which man has  ever embarked.''   Four days into their 8-day mission, Neil and Buzz climbed down the  ladder of the lunar module and stood on the surface of the Moon; the  very first human presence on a celestial body other than Earth; a feat  that, to this day, no other country has equaled. And we did it five  more times.   Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin could not have accomplished this  alone. Apollo 11 was the culmination of the hard work of more than  400,000 Americans who, with limited experience, and comparatively  primitive technology, committed themselves to accomplish this task and  completing President Kennedy's order of returning the astronauts safely  home.   I am so proud to represent Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas,  and the historic Mission Control of that Apollo era.   On the wall of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee  here on Capitol Hill, where I serve as the senior Republican on the  Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, is written, from the Bible,  Proverbs 29:18, which reads: ``Where there is no vision, the people  perish.''   The 50th anniversary of the first Moon landing should serve as a  reminder of what we, as a Nation, can accomplish when we do have a  clear mission.   Six hundred million people from around the world gathered around  their grainy television sets to watch those first steps. What is  amazing is that this took place only 40 years after Lindbergh first  flew across the Atlantic; and only 65 years after two bicycle-making  brothers from Dayton, Ohio, achieved powered flight in Kitty Hawk,  North Carolina.   The Apollo program built upon these accomplishments and exponentially  pushed our technology forward; and we are on the cusp of doing it  again.   President Trump and Vice President Pence have ensured that we are,  again, pushing outward, and launching America back into its dominant  role as the global leader in space. We have our vision. This time, we  head to the red planet by way of the Moon, and this time we stay.   NASA Administrator Bridenstine has focused NASA on achieving these  goals with the Artemis program, Apollo's sister, and I will continue to  use my position in Congress to advocate for the support needed for NASA  to accomplish this very worthwhile effort.   Mr. Speaker, as we commemorate the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 this  week, I would like to thank all out there who helped us get to the  Moon, and all those out there who will get us back to the Moon; and  thank them for their tremendous contribution to our country.   I am anxiously looking forward to the next small steps and giant  leaps in our space program.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1250, a  bill to designate the U.S. Postal Service facility in Hardin, Texas, as  the ``Lucas Lowe Memorial Post Office''.   As my colleagues know, to fast-track a postal legislation, we collect  cosponsorships from every other member of the State's delegation. When  you come from a State as large as the State of Texas, this can  certainly be easier said than done. Although everything is bigger in  Texas, I am proud to inform you that we have the support of all 36  members of the Lone Star State of Texas' delegation to honor this  American hero, Lucas Maurice Lowe, with the naming of a memorial post  office.   Chief Warrant Officer 2nd Lucas Lowe of Hardin, Texas, was tragically  lost to us during a training flight just after Christmas in 2016 during  his time in the Texas Army National Guard. A hardworking man who loved  being in the service, Lowe especially loved to fly.   After enlisting in the Army in 2004, Lowe completed an 11-month tour  in Afghanistan in 2005 to 2006 and a 14-month tour in Iraq in 2007 to  2008. He later attended Warrant Officer Candidate School in Fort  Rucker, Alabama, where he also attended flight school to become an AH- 64 Apache attack helicopter pilot. He was an amazing soldier who  faithfully served both God and his country.   However, when the world lost Lucas, we lost more than a dedicated  pilot. We lost a man who always went out of his way to lift others'  spirits and encouraged them to reach for higher success in life.   Lucas was a wonderful family man who loved his wife, his children,  and his family more than anything else. He loved his children more than  life itself. He loved camping in the woods, hunting, fishing,  campfires, and good music. He enjoyed dancing, playing golf, cooking,  and singing to brighten someone's day. He always had a way of making  someone's day better.   Admired by all, his courage and dedication made him a natural-born  leader. He touched the lives of all who knew him, and he lived his life  with an optimistic spirit, always ready to take on the next big  challenge.   Lucas is survived by his wife, Kami; and five children, Clayton,  Lance, Alysen, Logan, and Tenley.   He is dearly, dearly missed throughout the Texas Guard, the entire  Hardin community and Liberty County, and by those family and friends he  left behind.
