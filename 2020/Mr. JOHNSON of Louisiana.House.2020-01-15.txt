 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding a moment.   Mr. Speaker, here we are again, marking this tragic anniversary as we  do every year. The reason we have such sorrow and such a burden is  because it is such an unspeakable sorrow what has happened to nearly 60  million innocent, unborn children in this country.   Our Nation's birth certificate is the Declaration of Independence,  and it states succinctly what has been known as the American creed, and  we know it by heart: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that  all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with  certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness.''                                time  1845    The Founders recognized life first among those inalienable rights  because they acknowledged that we are made in the image of a holy God,  and because of that, there are some very serious implications that  follow.   It means every single human life has inestimable dignity and value.  And our value is not related in any way to our socioeconomic status,  the color of our skin, what ZIP Code we live in, how talented we may  be, or what we can contribute to society. Our value is inherent,  because, as our Founders acknowledged, it is given to us by our  creator.   Roe v. Wade tragically defied that American creed, and it has  resulted, as we said, in the murder of more than 60 million innocent  American children.   How can we stand by and allow this to happen? We can't, and we will  not.   And I will just say this in the very brief moment that I have.  Tonight we will continue to pray, we will continue to work, we will  continue to legislate, we will continue to litigate, and we will  continue to march and stand for women and children and the sanctity of  every single human life until the promise of our Nation's birth  certificate is realized.
