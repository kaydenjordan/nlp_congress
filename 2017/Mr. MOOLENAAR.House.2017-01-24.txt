 Mr. Speaker, today, the House voted to end taxpayer  support for abortion.   A majority of Americans believe abortion is wrong, and they do not  wish to see their tax dollars pay for this gruesome procedure that ends  the life of another human being. This legislation permanently puts into  law a longstanding policy that has been renewed by Congress every year.  It will reassure Americans that the hard-earned money they pay to the  government will never be used to fund abortions.   This is necessary because the Affordable Care Act, a law that has  been unaffordable for so many Americans, actually paid subsidies for  healthcare plans that include abortion. This is unacceptable. A child  in a mother's womb is a blessing. Americans expect their tax dollars  will never be used to pay to end the life of an innocent child.   Today's legislation will protect taxpayers and, most importantly, our  society's most vulnerable--the unborn.  [[Page H667]]                                ____________________
