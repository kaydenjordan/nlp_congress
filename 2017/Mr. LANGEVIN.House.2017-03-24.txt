 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the  Republican effort to gut the Affordable Care Act, an effort that will  result in millions of people across the country and tens of thousands  of my constituents in Rhode Island to lose their health coverage, and  it will ultimately result in costs rising.   Before the ACA was passed, the House held 79 hearings over the course  of a year. Today's Republican plan was pushed through three committees  without a single hearing and with substantial changes being made behind  closed doors in the dead of night.   Mr. Speaker, I am a veteran of many healthcare debates, and I can  tell you this is not how sound policy is made, especially policy that  will have real consequences for hardworking Americans.   Since the passage of the ACA, I have had faith that Republicans and  Democrats could come together to strengthen the law and further improve  healthcare for all Americans. There is still that opportunity to come  together, Mr. Speaker, but the rule, along with the underlying bill,  has shaken that faith.   Supporting the rule means putting ideology above the well-being of  the American people. This does not have to be a zero-sum game. I know  that we can come together.  [[Page H2387]]    Let's defeat this rule and the bill. Come together in a bipartisan  way to fix the problems of the ACA.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard).
