 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 512, the  WINGMAN Act.   I am honored to represent the First District of Michigan, which, as a  State, has a higher than average percentage of veterans, and the First  District has double the percentage of veterans of the rest of the  State. To advocate for these fine men and women who have served so  honorably, we have the absolute imperative to make sure that they get  the help that they need to cut through the bureaucratic red tape at  agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs.   I have been serving in Congress for just over a month now, and,  already, my office has been flooded with requests from veterans seeking  aid in navigating the benefits claims process.   Unfortunately, the VA is notoriously plagued by a culture of  complacency and inefficiency. Even something as simple as checking the  status of a veteran's claim means that congressional staff members have  to circle back around numerous times with VA employees before being  able to provide the veterans in the First District with an accurate  update.   As a veteran of the Vietnam war, I know that time is valuable to our  veterans. We have to introduce more efficiency and transparency into  the benefits claims process.   H.R. 512 is designed to cut out the middle step. The WINGMAN Act  provides congressional offices with read-only access to veterans'  records within the Veterans Benefits Administration. This commonsense  bill allows our veterans quicker access to simple status inquiries,  provides greater transparency for congressional offices, and allows the  VA employees more time to work on completing these claims.
