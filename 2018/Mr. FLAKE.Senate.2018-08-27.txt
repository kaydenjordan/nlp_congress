 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, until the very end, he served his country-- until the very end. ``Service,'' to John McCain, meant living something  unique in all the history of the world. It meant living in service to  something unique--the American idea.   E pluribus unum--``from many, one''--might seem like a quaint vestige  from a more idealistic time when compared to the brutal and determined  divisions of our time, but it was an idea that defined John McCain's  life. In and through his service, he defied categorization; frustrated  the tired conventions of the way party loyalists were supposed to  behave; acted against his own political interests time and again in a  way that, from our vantage  [[Page S5948]]  point today, is nothing short of awe-inspiring; and he recognized that  democracy was hard but that living in bondage to tyranny was far  harder.   We talk a lot in this Chamber about freedom. No one in this city and  few in American history knew as much or as vividly about the price of  freedom as did John McCain. Our words are too often cheap and eminently  forgettable, but John McCain paid our freight with his body and with  his soul.   To our shame, he lived long enough to have to take to this Senate  floor to inveigh against the rank tribalism that we have fallen into  lately. He knew that giving in to our worst impulses to score pyrrhic  political victories was as easy as it was dangerous and was and is a  tangible threat to American democracy--a democracy to which he gave  every bit of his life.   If I may, and with your indulgence, I will read from Senator McCain's  last speech from this room.   On July 25, 2017, while bearing the fresh wounds from his last  battle, Senator McCain stood in this Chamber. Thinking not of himself  but of his country, he exhorted, inspired, pleaded, and cajoled all of  us in an attempt to shake us to our senses in order to reject the  prevailing ugliness that seized the Capitol. One last time, he was  standing alone to do what was right. In a sure sign of just how  desperate he was, he even appealed to our decency and to our reason-- qualities that seem to have long fled Washington.   That day last summer, he said in part:         We are the servants of a great nation, ``a . . . nation,       conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that       all men are created equal.'' More people have lived free and       prosperous lives here than in any other Nation. We have       acquired unprecedented wealth and power because of our       governing principles, and because our government defended       those principles.    He went on:         America has made a greater contribution than any other       nation to an international order that has liberated more       people from tyranny and poverty than ever before in history.       We have been the greatest example, the greatest supporter,       and the greatest defender of that order. We aren't afraid. We       don't covet other people's land and wealth. We don't hide       behind walls. We breach them. We are a blessing to humanity.    He continued:         What greater cause could we hope to serve than helping keep       America the strong, aspiring, inspirational beacon of liberty       and defender of dignity of all human beings and their right       to freedom and equal justice? That is the cause that binds us       and is so much more powerful and worthy than the small       differences that divide us.    Until the very end, he served his country.   Now, as we consider the life of this man, in stark relief to what now  passes for our politics, he continues to serve as a beacon to who we  are and what we can be when we are at our best.   If John McCain can forgive the North Vietnamese torturers, we can at  least forgive each other. But that gesture of Senator McCain's was not  merely a gesture of conciliation for conciliation's sake; it was  reflective of a world view that saw the humanity even in his enemies,  of a sometimes unfathomable decency that could overcome most any  difficulty, of a deep dedication to another American idea--the idea  that character is destiny--and to the eternally optimistic preference  for tomorrow over yesterday.   I don't know whether Senator McCain--whether John--subscribed to the  ``great man'' or ``great woman'' theory of history, the notion that the  story of humanity is written by the actions and choices of great  individuals. I don't know if he believed that, but I do know this: He  lived it. I know this because it was my great honor of a lifetime to  serve in this body with Senator McCain as the other Senator from  Arizona.   Long before that privilege was accorded me by the people of my State,  I was John McCain's constituent. When the necessity presented itself to  point up examples for my daughter and my four sons of lives lived with  principle and purpose, of role models, I had to look no further than my  own Senator. I have a pretty good idea that such approbation would be  mocked most loudly by John McCain himself. I imagine he would have some  choice and colorful language in response to the outpouring of love and  tributes since he has left us. We know that, like all of us, the  Senator was not perfect. In fact, if you are interested in an inventory  of his failings, McCain himself was the most eager to provide it. Yet,  as a former aide of his said in the past few days, McCain was not  perfect, but he perfectly loved his country.   Words are a poor measure of any life, much less a life the size of  John McCain's and the swath he cut on this Earth. Yet we must try. We  may never see his like again. For the sake of the country he loved, we  owe it to his memory to try to be more like him so that when the season  of mourning is over, we don't merely dispense with our earnest tributes  and go right back to our venality. Because the poverty of our words  notwithstanding, we have lately wasted a lot of words in this town  doing and being everything that John McCain was not.    We would do well to allow this moment to affect us in ways reflected  not merely in our words but in our deeds. We would do well to reflect  on John McCain's example today and ask ourselves if we are living up to  it or even coming close. We would do well to honor him by emulating his  example.   We, of course, will never have his extraordinary comic timing. He  ribbed me without mercy--and with only a little exaggeration--that the  only way I got elected to anything was because of my hundreds of  siblings and thousands of cousins. I would have laughed harder if there  wasn't some truth to it.   We will never possess his grace in both victory and defeat. We will  never have his servant's heart nor his power and clarity about the  daily effort that freedom requires. John McCain knew firsthand the epic  global struggle for freedom, and so he was freedom's greatest champion  in the Senate. He also knew that history is not a straight line and  that the ghosts of the great ideological struggle of the 20th century  are still here haunting the 21st. As he recently told Jeffrey Goldberg  of the Atlantic, ``There's always a Putin somewhere in the world, and  you're meant to oppose them with all the skills God gave you.''   As we say goodbye to John McCain, let us take up his banner. His was  always the good fight. We are fortunate to have known him best in  Arizona, but he was bigger than any one State. He always belonged to  America and to the world, and now he belongs to the ages.   Farewell, Senator. Farewell, John.   I yield the floor.
