 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 480,  I call up the bill (S. 114) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit an annual report  regarding performance awards and bonuses awarded to certain high-level  employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 114, as amended, the VA  Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017.   It has been a long week of negotiations, but we are here today with  an agreement we--and, more importantly, our veterans--can all be proud  to support. I know that I am.   Ranking Member Walz and I have worked feverishly with our Senate  counterparts to find a solution that can pass both Chambers and ensure  that veterans will continue to be able to access care in the community.   The VA Choice and Quality Improvement Act of 2017 would expand  veteran access to care both inside and outside the Department of  Veterans Affairs healthcare system by, number one, providing $2.1  billion to sustain the Choice Program for the next 6 months,  authorizing 28 VA medical center facility leases, and improving VA's  ability to recruit and retain high-quality employees by including many  of the provisions of H.R. 1367, as amended, which were sponsored by Dr.  Brad Wenstrup, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, and  unanimously approved by the House in March. I would be remiss if I did  not impress upon my colleagues a sense of urgency about this  legislation.   The Choice Program was created 3 years ago in response to the  nationwide VA access crisis that began with 40 veteran patients who  died while waiting for VA care in Phoenix, Arizona. Due to much higher  than expected veteran demand for Choice care, the program is slated to  run out of money by mid-August. It would leave devastating consequences  for veterans in its wake.   Starting with an extremely tight 90-day implementation period and  countless contract modifications with third-party administrators, I  will be the first to admit that the Choice Program has been plagued  with problems. But I will also tell you that the program has come a  long way from where it once was and is responsible for more than 1  million veterans getting the care they need closer to home and in a  more timely manner. The good Lord only knows how many lives have been  saved or prolonged. That is a success.   If Choice were to end 3 weeks from now, Mr. Speaker, VA's most senior  leaders, including Secretary Shulkin, have warned that waiting times  for veteran patients will increase to pre-Choice Phoenix levels. They  also said continuity of care would be disrupted for veterans across the  country, and some of our most vulnerable veterans may not be able to  get care without either a long, possibly debilitating wait time or an  excessive travel distance. That is failure.   Passage of this bill today, followed by swift passage by our  colleagues in the Senate, would preserve Choice for the next 6 months.  That would allow the program to continue serving veterans while we  continue the hard work of creating a stronger, more integrated VA  healthcare system for the years ahead.   Some stakeholders have expressed frustration that Congress has not  been adequately supporting VA's internal capacity for care and too much  attention has been paid since the 2014 access crisis to addressing  issues with growing veteran demand for community care programs, Choice  included. They argue that providing increased funding for Choice  without identical increases in funding for VA medical facilities is  harmful to veterans. I totally disagree.   I do not believe that argument is fair or constructive, given the  historic funding increases that VA has received in recent years and the  growth in staffing, programming, and the VA physical footprint that has  resulted from those increases. In fact, VA's budget--that is the  healthcare budget, not total budget. The VA's healthcare budget has  grown more than $83 billion since I came to Congress in 2009.   Mr. Speaker, we were spending $93.7 billion when I was sworn into  this House in 2009. The President's request this year is $186.5  billion. In the same time, the number of VA full-time employees has  increased by almost 63,000. What is more, we just passed a MILCON-VA  Appropriations bill which includes a $3.9 billion increase for VA  medical care.   Nevertheless, I have listened to the concerns of those stakeholders,  which include many veterans service organizations, and I respect their  viewpoints and their willingness to be strong advocates for our  Nation's veterans. As a matter of fact, I belong to many of these  organizations.   That is why this bill includes provisions to increase VA internal  capacity by authorizing 28 medical facility leases, most of which are  for community-based outpatient clinics, and by enhancing VA's ability  to maintain a robust, highly qualified workforce in recognition of the  many challenges VA has in competing for workers in an extremely  competitive hiring market.   To offset a significant portion of the costs of this legislation, we  have used offsets that have been used routinely on a bipartisan basis  over the last decades and that were included in the legislation which  first created the Choice Program 3 years ago.   As I alluded to earlier, this bill was crafted as the result of  negotiations between myself; my friend, Ranking Member Sergeant Major  Walz; and Senators Isakson and Tester, the chairman and ranking member,  respectively, on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. I am  grateful to them for this work.   I am also grateful to my friends and colleagues in the House  leadership for their efforts and willingness to do the sometimes  difficult work of finding a solution that is in the best interests of  both veterans and taxpayers and to our VSO partners for their input and  support throughout the past weeks.   There is still much work ahead. This is only a 6-month patch to the  Choice Program. The ranking member and I have a framework agreement for  moving forward, but that will require the cooperation and buy-in from  all my colleagues in the House and Senate.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), who is my good friend. I had the privilege  of visiting Bruce Poliquin's beautiful State last summer.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an  additional 30 seconds.                                time  1045     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Arrington), chairman of the Subcommittee on Economic  Opportunity on the full Committee of Veterans' Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, since we are doing a Maine  advertisement here today, I will say one thing negative about Maine. I  herniated a disk in my back climbing Mount Katahdin with my good  friend, French Hill from Arkansas, last summer. It wasn't all good.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I do want to associate my remarks with those of the  ranking member.   We have a lot of thanks to go around, but the major thanks go to our  veterans who serve this great Nation. I think it would be remiss on us  and a pox on this body if we didn't do what is right for our veterans.  And we are.    As Mr. Walz said, this is just the first step, although a major one,  in a transformative process that we have been given the opportunity on  this committee to do.   We serve 21 million veterans in this country that have served this  Nation honorably. We have a great organization. I think a lot of times  it doesn't get said that the VA does a lot of good work.   I don't go home where there is not a day that I don't run into  somebody at the grocery store or somewhere that  [[Page H6538]]  tells me of a positive thing that happened to them at the VA. It is not  everywhere, though.   I also get stopped and told and have stacks of documents on my desk  that tell me the problems with the VA. We hear those loud and clear. I  think both of us do.   But I think it is an opportunity for us as a body--not just this  committee, but the entire body--to thank our veterans, pass this bill  unanimously, send it to the Senate, and then to the President's desk  for his signature.   I, once again, thank Mr. Walz, his committee and staff, and our  committee and staff for working in a bipartisan way to pass this.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support S. 114, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 95) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide child care  assistance to veterans receiving certain medical services provided by  the Department of Veterans Affairs, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 95         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of such chapter is amended by inserting after the       item relating to section 1730A the following new item:  ``1730B. Child care assistance for veterans receiving mental health                care and other intensive health care services.''.       SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF REDUCTION IN AMOUNT OF PENSION FURNISHED                     BY DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS FOR CERTAIN                     VETERANS COVERED BY MEDICAID PLANS FOR SERVICES                     FURNISHED BY NURSING FACILITIES.         Section 5503(d)(7) of title 38, United States Code, is       amended by striking ``September 30, 2024'' and inserting       ``September 30, 2026''.       SEC. 4. EXTENSION OF REQUIREMENT FOR COLLECTION OF FEES FOR                     HOUSING LOANS GUARANTEED BY SECRETARY OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS.         Section 3729(b)(2) of title 38, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) in subparagraph (A)--        (A) in clause (iii), by striking ``September 30, 2024'' and       inserting ``December 31, 2024''; and        (B) in clause (iv), by striking ``September 30, 2024'' and       inserting ``December 31, 2024'';        (2) in subparagraph (B)--        (A) in clause (i), by striking ``September 30, 2024'' and       inserting ``December 31, 2024''; and        (B) in clause (ii), by striking ``September 30, 2024'' and       inserting ``December 31, 2024'';        (3) in subparagraph (C)--        (A) in clause (i), by striking ``September 30, 2024'' and       inserting ``December 31, 2024''; and        (B) in clause (ii), by striking ``September 30, 2024'' and       inserting ``December 31, 2024''; and        (4) in subparagraph (D)--        (A) in clause (i), by striking ``September 30, 2024'' and       inserting ``December 31, 2024''; and        (B) in clause (ii), by striking ``September 30, 2024'' and       inserting ``December 31, 2024''.   [[Page H6539]]      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 95, as amended, the  Veterans' Access to Child Care Act. This bill would make the Department  of Veterans Affairs' successful pilot program to provide childcare  assistance to veterans seeking mental or other intensive healthcare  services through the VA healthcare system permanent.   I have been a ``Doctor Dad'' myself, and I know firsthand how  difficult it can be to manage childcare responsibilities on top of  everything else.   We know that the lack of childcare is a barrier to care for many  patients and that assisting veteran parents, grandparents, and  guardians in finding childcare opportunities while they are attending  VA appointments will relieve a major stress point and increase access  to care.   I am grateful to Congresswoman Julia Brownley, the ranking member of  our Subcommittee on Health, for her leadership in sponsoring the  Veterans' Access to Child Care Act.   I am proud to support this bill and urge my colleagues to do so as  well.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all  Members to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2772) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  provide for requirements relating to the reassignment of Department of  Veterans Affairs senior executive employees, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2772         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``VA Senior Executive       Accountability Act'' or the ``SEA Act''.       SEC. 2. SEMIANNUAL REPORTS ON REASSIGNMENT OF DEPARTMENT OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS SENIOR EXECUTIVE EMPLOYEES.         (a) In General.--Subchapter I of chapter 7 of title 38,       United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the       following new section:       ``Sec. 723. Reassignment of senior executives         ``(a) Approval of Reassignments.--No individual employed in       a senior executive position at the Department may be       reassigned to another such position at the Department unless       such reassignment is approved in writing and signed by the       Secretary.        ``(b) Semiannual Reports Required.--Not later than June 30       and December 31 of each year, the Secretary shall submit to       Congress a report on the reassignment of individuals employed       in senior executive positions at the Department to other such       positions at the Department during the period covered by the       report. Each such report shall describe the purpose of each       such reassignment and the costs associated with such       reassignment.        ``(c) Senior Executive Position Defined.--In this section,       the term `senior executive position' has the meaning given       such term in section 713(g)(3) of this title.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of such chapter is amended by inserting after the       item relating to section 723 the following new item:  ``724. Reassignment of senior executives.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2772, as amended, the VA  Senior Executive Accountability Act, or SEA Act. This bill would  provide needed transparency of the Department of Veterans Affairs'  reassignment of members of the Senior Executive Service. Specifically,  the bill would require the Secretary to personally approve of a  reassignment of VA's approximately 350 SES employees.   It would also require VA to report to Congress identifying those  employees who are reassigned and the cost associated with  reassignments.   I thank Representative Taylor for his thoughtful legislation. And  with that, Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in  supporting H.R. 2772.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Taylor), the author of this bill and a Navy SEAL.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all  Members to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3262) to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  to carry out a pilot program to provide educational assistance to  certain former members of the Armed Forces for education and training  as physician assistants of the Department of Veterans Affairs, to  establish pay grades and require competitive pay for physician  assistants of the Department, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3262         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(e) Educational Assistance.--        (1) In general.--In carrying out the pilot program, the       Secretary shall provide educational assistance to individuals       participating in the pilot program, including through the use       of scholarships, to cover the costs to such individuals of       obtaining a master's degree in physician assistant studies or       a similar master's degree.

(2) Period specified.--With respect to each individual       participating in the pilot program, the period of obligated       service specified in this paragraph for the individual is--        (A) if the individual is participating in the pilot program       through a program described in subsection (e)(2) that       specifies a period of obligated service, the period specified       with respect to such program; or        (B) if the individual is participating in the pilot program       other than through a program described in such subsection, or       if such program does not specify a period of obligated       service, a period of three years or such other period as the       Secretary considers appropriate for purposes of the pilot       program.        (g) Breach.--        (1) Liability.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), an       individual who participates in the pilot program and fails to       satisfy the period of obligated service under subsection (f)       shall be liable to the United States, in lieu of such       obligated service, for the amount that has been paid or is       payable to or on behalf of the individual under the pilot       program, reduced by the proportion that the number of days       served for completion of the period of obligated service       bears to the total number of days in the period of obligated       service of such individual.

EXTENSION OF REQUIREMENT FOR COLLECTION OF FEES FOR                     HOUSING LOANS GUARANTEED BY SECRETARY OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3262, as amended, the  Grow Our Own Directive--or GOOD--Physician Assistant Employment and  Education Act of 2017.   The PA profession has a long and storied connection with veterans as  the first class of PAs was primarily composed of Army medics and Navy  corpsmen who served in the Vietnam war.   And I might add, when I did basic training at San Antonio, Texas, at  Fort Sam, one of the first PA classes was there.   Today, the Department of Veterans Affairs is the single largest  employer of PAs in the country. Nevertheless, PAs are consistently  identified as one of the top five professions where VA is experiencing  the largest staffing shortages.   H.R. 3262, as amended, would help solve that by creating a pilot  program to provide assistance to veterans who want to pursue education  and training to become a PA and to serve their fellow veterans by  working at VA medical facilities.   I am grateful to Congresswoman Ann Kuster for sponsoring this  legislation and shepherding it through the legislative process, and I  am confident that it will go a long way in resolving existing PA  recruitment and retention issues, ensuring that VA medical facilities  are appropriately staffed with high-quality PAs and, in turn,  increasing access to care for veteran patients.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  H.R. 3262, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1115     Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), who is the  chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations on the  full Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I certainly support this bill, and I want to thank both  General Bergman and Ms. Kuster. We made a trip to Afghanistan together  a couple of years ago. She has a dogged--and I will say ``dogged''-- commitment to the veterans in her district and to this country, and I  want to thank her for bringing this piece of legislation up. I believe  it will make a difference, I truly do, when it is implemented.   And I want to thank the ranking member, and his staff and mine, for  bringing a lot of pieces of legislation to the House floor in the last  couple of weeks. This week, especially, we have had some success here,  and that means veterans had success. Certainly, the post-9/11 GI Bill  that was passed this week is an enormous bill and will do good  generations after no one ever remembers who was on this floor debating  that bill. So I want to thank them and thank my colleagues and wish  everyone a safe recess and a healthy recess.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
