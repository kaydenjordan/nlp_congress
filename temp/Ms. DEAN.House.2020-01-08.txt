 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule, and I thank  Representative Scanlon for allowing me this brief time.   PFAS water contamination continues to harm America's health. The  EPA's website describes some of the effects: ``low infant birth  weights, effects on the immune system, cancer . . . and thyroid hormone  disruption.'' Our constituents deserve better. Our constituents have a  right to clean water.   Finally, we are making some progress. Over the last year, we have  considered and passed more PFAS legislation than any previous Congress,  and this week's PFAS Action Act marks our most comprehensive step.   We also see progress at the local level. In my district, contaminated  surface water runoff from Horsham Air Guard Station has polluted local  wells and waterways for years.                                time  1245    Last week, the Air Force released the funds for a $2.8 million  containment and filtration system at the runoff site. I commend them  for their leadership. Still, however, much work remains.   PFAS contaminants exist on more than 400 military bases nationwide  and threaten the health and safety of those who live nearby. Addressing  this challenge fully requires a national solution. That means listing  PFAS as a toxin, banning its manufacture, regulating its disposal,  cleaning up our water supplies, and providing health testing and  treatment to everyone who needs it.   I thank Representative Dingell for her tenacity in drafting and  passing this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this rule.
