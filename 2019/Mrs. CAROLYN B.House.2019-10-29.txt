 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding and for his leadership on the committee and for  this resolution, and also Anna Eshoo and Chairman Schiff and so many of  my friends and colleagues for their long efforts to pass it on both  sides of the aisle.   As a member of the Congressional Caucus on Armenian Issues and the  Representative of a large and vibrant Armenian community in New York  City, I strongly support H. Res. 296, affirming the United States'  record on the Armenian genocide.   104 years ago, 1.5 million Armenians were murdered by the Ottoman  Empire in the first genocide of the 20th century. Ever since, Armenian  communities from across the world, including those in my district, have  been forced to fight for recognition and justice for Turkey's denial in  so many ways, from the illegal invasion of Cypress by Turkey to the  vicious attacks on Kurds within and without the borders of Turkey.   With our vote today, the United States takes a long long overdue step  to stop Turkey from hiding the truth of its actions. The Armenian  genocide must be acknowledged by all, and in doing so, we can hope to  prevent the next genocide.
