 Mr. President, today I wish to remember and pay tribute to  former Senator Harris Llewellyn Wofford, Jr. and his life of dedicated  service to our country and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   Harris lived a life of service, committed to advancing civil rights  and ending injustice. Early in his career, Harris went to India to  study nonviolence and the teachings of Gandhi. The lessons he learned  during that time would become indispensable as Harris got to know Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr., and became involved in the civil rights  movement, helping to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the first civil  rights legislation since reconstruction.   When John F. Kennedy was running for President in 1960, Harris was an  adviser on his campaign. Days before the election, Dr. King was  unjustly imprisoned, and Wofford urged Kennedy and his team to call  Coretta Scott King to comfort her and demonstrate his commitments to  civil rights. Once Kennedy was elected, Harris Wofford served as  Special Assistant to the President for Civil Rights and chairman of the  Subcabinet Group on Civil Rights. He urged the President and Attorney  General Robert F. Kennedy to pursue civil rights legislation. Wofford  would join Martin Luther King and others in the Selma to Montgomery  Civil Rights marches in 1965 in support of voting rights for African- Americans.   While serving in the Kennedy administration, Wofford worked with R.  Sargent Shriver on the creation of the Peace Corps, eventually leaving  the White House to serve as the Peace Corps' special representative to  Africa and director of operations in Ethiopia, as well as associate  director. He would also play a role in the creation of Volunteers in  Service to America, a domestic version of the Peace Corps.   In 1991, when former Pennsylvania Senator H. John Heinz was killed in  a plane crash, my father, Governor Robert P. Casey, turned to Harris  Wofford to fill the vacancy. Harris went on to win a special election  and served until 1994 when he narrowly lost reelection. While in  office, he worked to pass the National and Community Service Act,  creating AmeriCorps, the Senior Corps and Learn and Serve America.  Harris would go on to serve as the head of AmeriCorps.   If one tried to sum up Harris Wofford's life in one word, it would be  service. He truly believed that through service every individual could  contribute to the betterment of his or her community, State, country,  and the world. Harris Wofford's friend, Martin Luther King, Jr., said  ``everyone can be great, because everyone can serve.'' Today we honor  Harris Wofford's life of service which will continue to inspire  Americans to serve one another and our Nation.                            ____________________
