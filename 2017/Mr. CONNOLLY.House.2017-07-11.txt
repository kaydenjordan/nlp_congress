 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 702, the Federal  Employee Antidiscrimination Act of 2017, as amended.   I also thank my good friend, Ranking Member Elijah Cummings, for his  work on this measure and for his leadership and passion of our  committee's ongoing efforts to ensure that Federal equal opportunity  programs truly guarantee equal opportunity.   Most agencies are careful to ensure that their personnel policies  protect employees' rights and that their EEO programs ensure that if  discrimination does occur, employees can seek fair and timely redress.   Unfortunately, there have been instances in which agencies fail to  meet the standards of a model EEO program. When that occurs,  hardworking Federal employees are harmed.   For example, during the last Congress, the Committee on Oversight and  Government Reform conducted a number of hearings to examine how  allegations of harassment and retaliation were handled at the National  Park Service and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, including the  Forest Service.   In the case of the Park Service, a former superintendent of the Grand  Canyon, one of our premier parks, received a report in 2013 documenting  multiple allegations of sexual harassment. But rather than determining  whether further investigation was warranted or disciplinary action  should be pursued, the superintendent attempted to bury the report.   A year later, more than a dozen current and former employees sent  their allegations directly to the Secretary of the Interior. The  Secretary referred those allegations to the Inspector General. After an  extensive investigation, the IG found ``a long-term pattern of sexual  harassment and a hostile work environment'' at the Grand Canyon River  District.   The Inspector General's Office also identified more than 20 other  individuals who ``reported experiencing or witnessing sexual harassment  and hostile work environments,'' and the IG confirmed that previous  reports of sexual harassment ``were not properly investigated or  reported.''   As disturbing as these findings are, the Inspector General has also  found instances of sexual harassment and retaliation at other parks,  including iconic places like Yellowstone National Park and the  Canaveral National Seashore.   While the Park Service has announced measures to address the serious  shortcomings in its EEO programs, it is clear that deficiencies in  these programs are longstanding and have hurt numerous employees.   Similar chronic problems have occurred at the Department of  Agriculture. The EEO program there has now been the subject of two  extraordinary letters sent by the Office of Special Counsel to the  President of the United States.   In May 2015, the Special Counsel wrote to warn the President that  USDA's civil rights program ``has been seriously mismanaged, thereby  compromising the civil rights of USDA employees.''   Just last month, the Office of Special Counsel wrote again to the  President, finding that ``while the Office of the Assistant Secretary  for Civil Rights has taken positive steps to improve its performance,  based on the significant number of cases that are still subject to  delays, OSC has determined that the agency response is unreasonable in  part. USDA may need to devote more resources to the Office to ensure  that cases are promptly processed and hold senior supervisors  accountable for the mismanagement in this office.''   Such findings are not to be tolerated, and they highlight why this  bill, H.R. 702, the Federal Employee Antidiscrimination Act, is  urgently needed.   This measure would require that the head of an agency's EEO program  report directly to the head of the agency himself or herself. The  measure would also require that an agency's EEO program be operated  independently of its human resources or general counsel offices,  ensuring that the EEO program is focused solely on protecting the civil  rights of all employees and applicants.   H.R. 702 would strengthen the accountability mechanisms central to  the effectiveness of the EEO process. For example, the bill would  expand the notifications that agencies are required to provide when  discrimination is indeed found to have occurred, and it would require  agencies to track and report whether such findings resulted in any  disciplinary action.   The bill would also prohibit agencies from attempting to gag  employees by banning policies, forms, or agreements that seek to  prohibit or restrict an employee from disclosing to Congress, the  Office of Special Counsel, or an Office of the Inspector General any  information that might relate to a violation of any law, rule,  regulation, or waste, fraud, or abuse.   H.R. 702 is essentially identical to the bill we considered in the  last Congress, which passed the House by a vote of 403-0. I urge  Members to support the measure again.   As I close, Mr. Speaker, I join with Ranking Member Cummings in  urging the Senate to move on this measure as expeditiously as possible,  without the addition of extraneous and harmful amendments that might  seek to curtail due process rights of Federal employees.   Any employee who engages in discriminatory or retaliatory behavior or  who harasses another employee must be held accountable. The American  public expects no less. Current personnel policies and practices are  adequate to ensure that this can occur, and there is no need for any  amendment to this bill that would undermine or weaken employees' due  process rights.   Mr. Speaker, I talked to Representative Elijah Cummings recently. He  is doing great. He is full of fight and can't wait to get back here to  Congress. We expect to see him shortly.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, that was a hard act to follow. I was transported to the  1960s. I was always a fan of Merle Haggard, but not necessarily his  political philosophy. I don't believe the proposition that if you  disagree with the policies of your government, you have to leave the  country. I actually believe the beauty of America is that you get to  disagree, you get to respectfully dissent, and you still get to live  here as a full-fledged American.   I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of this bill to  designate the facility of the United States Postal Service in  Bakersfield, California, as the Merle Haggard Post Office Building.   Merle was born in Bakersfield in 1937, and, as my friend from Florida  said, took a circuitous route to becoming ``the poet of the common  man,'' as he was known.   As a teenager, he often found himself in reform school after  committing petty crimes. By the age of 20, he was serving time, as Mr.  DeSantis said, in a California prison. It was that experience, however,  that helped him turn his life around.   In prison, Merle Haggard rediscovered his love of music, and later  put his talent to work on the Bakersfield club circuit. By singing  about poverty, the struggles of the ordinary man and woman, and how  music saved him during dark times, he captured the imagination and the  attention of the entire country, and had 38 number one country hits.   In 1994, Merle was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In  2010, he received a Kennedy Center Honors from President Barack Obama.  After a long and fulfilling life, Merle died on his 79th birthday in  April of last year.   Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to recognize the incredible  accomplishments to our culture that Merle Haggard represents to  celebrate his country music and his ability to give a voice to working  men and women everywhere who keep their ``nose on the grindstone'' and  ``work hard every day.''   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 1988, and I reserve the balance  of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on this side. I  just want to echo the sentiments of Mr. McCarthy, the majority leader,  in honoring a great artist who overcame enormous obstacles in his life  to achieve great success and to make contributions to American culture.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
