 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6824, the President's  Cup Cybersecurity Competition Act.   Mr. Speaker, you merely have to turn on the news to hear about the  latest ransomware problem that continues to vex our country. According  to research funded by the National Institute of Standards and  Technology, there is a deficit of almost half a million cybersecurity  employees in the U.S. Now more than ever, it is critical that the  Federal Government provide cybersecurity education and pathways to  Federal employment and make Federal retention of this limited skill set  a priority.   One very important effort is underpinned by the President's Cup  Cybersecurity Competition Act. CISA launched the first President's Cup  Cybersecurity Act in 2019, as a national cybersecurity competition for  both individuals and teams, aiming to identify, challenge, and reward  the best cybersecurity talent in the Federal workforce.    This bill grants CISA the authority to fully implement the  cybersecurity competition with certain parameters and provide prizes to  winning individuals and teams. By codifying the cybersecurity  competition, we further incentivize a skilled cybersecurity workforce.  We also signal that Congress is committed to addressing Federal  cybersecurity recruitment and retention challenges.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join me in supporting H.R. 6824, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H4979]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2520, the State and Local  Government Cybersecurity Act of 2021.   Today, State and local governments are not in the position to defend  their networks against cyberattacks from sophisticated foreign  adversaries or cybercriminals. State and local governments are rich  targets for cyber adversaries, and the frequency of attacks is only  accelerating as budgets are increasingly constrained.   The Federal Government needs to redouble their efforts to support  State, local, Tribal, and territorial government entities to bolster  their cybersecurity posture.   To help remedy this, this bill amends the Homeland Security Act of  2002 to provide for engagements with SLTT entities to increase Federal  support and information sharing.   Additionally, the bill expands DHS' responsibilities concerning  grants and cooperative agreements. The bill also provides DHS the  ability to coordinate with SLTT entities to conduct exercises, provide  technical and operational cybersecurity training, as well as promote  cybersecurity education and awareness.   S. 2520 will help shore up SLTT vulnerabilities against malicious  cyberattackers and will go a long way to strengthen our more localized  entities that are closer to the everyday American.   I urge Members to join me in supporting S. 2520, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6873, the Bombing  Prevention Act of 2022. Between just January 4 and February 16 of this  year, the FBI reported more than 50 bomb threats against domestic  targets.   The DHS Office of Bombing Protection, or OBP, has a mission to  protect life and critical infrastructure by building capabilities  within the general public and across public and private sectors to  prevent, protect against, respond to, and mitigate bombing incidents.   To that end, this bill will more aptly enable OBP to conduct its  mission by requiring: a strategy for securing critical infrastructure  against terrorist explosives; promoting awareness of risks posed by the  misuse of explosive chemicals and bomb-making materials; and a database  of capabilities and requirements to track public and private terrorist  explosive threats.   This legislation is a critical step toward ensuring that threats to  our domestic security posed by bombings and malicious use of explosives  is mitigated to the best of our ability.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join me in supporting H.R. 6873, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Crawford).    Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 6825, the Nonprofit Security Grant  Program Improvement Act of 2022.   FEMA's Nonprofit Security Grant Program is an important resource  available to nonprofit organizations, especially our houses of worship.  As we all know, faith-based communities across the country face varying  levels of discrimination, and it is vital that we strengthen our  Nation's emergency preparedness posture to prevent violence against all  religious groups.   H.R. 6825 expands the use of Nonprofit Security Grant Program funds  to include alteration or remodeling of existing buildings or physical  facilities and facility security personnel costs, including costs  associated with contracted security.   This bill requires more accountability on the part of FEMA to  Congress by requiring the Administrator of FEMA to include information  on the number of applications submitted by eligible nonprofit  organizations to each State, the number of applications submitted by  each State, and specific operations of the grant office in FEMA's  annual report to Congress.   Finally, this legislation also establishes an office within FEMA to  provide outreach, engagement, education, and technical assistance to  support eligible nonprofit organizations. This will better ensure that  eligible organizations, including houses of worship, know the resources  available to them.   I urge Members to support H.R. 6825, and I reserve the balance of my  time.  [[Page H4984]]         Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge Members  to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, I proudly rise in support of my bill, H.R. 6871,  the DHS Acquisition Reform Act.   The Department of Homeland Security has many critical missions,  including: protecting the Nation from terrorist attacks, enforcing our  trade and immigration laws, and securing our borders, among many  others.   The goal of this legislation is to make DHS a better steward of  taxpayer money. We need to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent in a  way that is transparent and accountable to the American people. DHS  continues to face challenges in its acquisition program, such as the  inconsistency of organizational and oversight structures, and  variability in the application of Department policies.   In January 2021, the Government Accountability Office reported that  of the 24 acquisition programs it audited, 10 had been in breach of  their cost goals, schedule goals, or a combination of both, at some  point during fiscal year 2020. This means it will cost the Department-- and subsequently, the taxpayer--more money to get what the Department  needs. We need to do what we can to stop this.   Further, in 2018, the inspector general reported that DHS components  have a habit of acquiring goods and services before they adequately  define the requirements or develop performance measures. The more DHS  tacitly accepts this type of behavior in its programs, the more program  costs can be expected to grow.   Given these challenges, and the significant level of DHS investment  in these programs, it is vital we ensure that the proper oversight and  organizational structures are in place for DHS to acquire goods and  services in the most efficient and effective way possible.   This bill designates the DHS Under Secretary for Management as the  Department's chief acquisition officer, or CAO, and outlines specific  responsibilities and authorities regarding acquisitions.   These responsibilities include overseeing the DHS Acquisition Review  Board; exercising acquisition decision authority to approve, modify, or  cancel acquisition programs; and establishing and distributing policies  regarding acquisitions.   The bill also lays out in statute two critical offices at DHS: The  Office of Test and Evaluation and its responsibility to oversee  independent testing of acquisition programs, and the Program  Accountability and Risk Management Office and its role in DHS  acquisitions.   In addition, the bill describes the acquisition responsibilities of  other senior DHS leaders, including: the chief financial officer, the  chief information officer, and the Under Secretary of Strategy, Policy,  and Plans.   This bill will ensure that DHS has the appropriate mechanisms in  place to succeed and will make its acquisition process open and  transparent to the American taxpayer.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mr. Torres, for cosponsoring  this measure, as well as Ranking Member Katko and Chairman Thompson for  bringing it to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join me in supporting H.R. 6871, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 6868, the Cybersecurity Grants for  Schools Act of 2022.   Last year, cybersecurity authorities observed incidents involving  ransomware in nearly every critical infrastructure sector. Given the  rise of cyber threats to our country, it is more important now than  ever that we grow an expert cyber workforce capable of defending  Americans against nation-state actors, criminals, and other malicious  cyber actors.   Research estimates a deficit of 3.1 million skilled cybersecurity  professionals needed to perform this work and keep our country safe.  There is a multitude of issues contributing to our cyber workforce  shortage, which is particularly acute in the Federal sector. Lack of  exposure, uneven education, and Federal agency onboarding issues all  exacerbate the problem.   This is why it is more critical than ever to support efforts that  deliver cybersecurity, STEM, and other computer science curricula and  resources to our K-12 educators.   The Cybersecurity Grants for Schools Act of 2022 enables the  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, to award  grants or other financial assistance for cybersecurity and  infrastructure security training and education programs at the  elementary and secondary education levels. The ability to offer  financial support for this cyber training will enhance cybersecurity  education to bolster the country's next generation of cybersecurity  professionals.   I thank my colleague on the Homeland Security Committee,  Representative Garbarino, for his consistent leadership on  cybersecurity.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join me in supporting H.R. 6868, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 5658, the DHS Roles and  Responsibilities in Cyber Space Act.   Many recent cyber events, to include the Russian probing of U.S.  critical infrastructure, have shown that enhancing the security and  resilience of our critical infrastructure must be a top priority for  Congress and for the Nation.   The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, is the  lead Federal Agency for asset response during a significant cyber  incident, as directed by Presidential Policy Directive 41. CISA is also  the lead Federal coordinator for securing critical infrastructure  across all 16 sectors, in coordination with designated sector risk  management agencies.   This bill outlines specific reporting requirements that DHS, in  concert with CISA, must submit to Congress. These requirements include:  review of utilization of Federal cyber incident response plans;  explanation of roles and responsibilities of DHS in the Federal  Government's response to a cyber incident; explanation of DHS  authorities and how its components respond to a cyber incident; and  recommendations to provide further clarity on roles and  responsibilities of DHS in cyber incident response.   This bill will help clarify Federal roles in cyber incident response,  thereby eliminating confusion in the midst of an actual cyber event.   I thank the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon) for sponsoring this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join me in supporting H.R. 5658, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
