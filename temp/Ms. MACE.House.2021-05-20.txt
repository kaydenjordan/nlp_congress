 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to speak on behalf of a great  American and constituent of mine, Rich O'Brien.   Rich's story is one that inspires hope. He is the operations manager  for PGA HOPE Charleston. PGA HOPE stands for Helping Our Patriots  Everywhere, and it is the PGA's flagship program to do military  outreach.   As one of the leaders of the golf therapy movement, he is a testament  to hope. Madam Speaker, 12\1/2\ years ago, he was on his deathbed,  paralyzed from the neck down after a catastrophic injury where he broke  his back, his neck, and had four skull fracture injuries and brain  damage in every lobe. Rich died three times at the scene of the  accident before an EMT was able to revive him and eventually place him  into an induced coma.   He was lucky, though, and eventually regained feeling in his fingers  and toes and learned to walk and talk again. He was able to use golf  therapy to rehabilitate his injuries.   Following his own recovery, he started helping others to use golf  therapy and became an advocate for others with disabilities. As  Charleston welcomes the PGA Championship this weekend, Rich deserves  applause and praise for his charity and willingness to help other  veterans like him through golf therapy.
