 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the previous  question. There is absolutely no denying that there is a crisis at our  southern border.   I spent Saturday in Del Rio, Texas, where I would invite everyone in  this House to go take a look for themselves at what I saw, nearly  15,000 people crammed under the bridge in unsafe, shanty-like  structures after bum-rushing our border and getting into this country  illegally. Meanwhile, the port of entry is closed, just a hundred yards  from this bridge.   Most of these people are from the age of 18 to 35, but I spoke with  many children, families, and even women who were expecting within the  next day, multiple of whom have given birth this past week, all while  suffering the sweltering heat, 100 degrees during that day.   You cannot fathom the horrific conditions--the rape, the assault, the  crime, the drugs--right here on our border.   I spoke to migrants who told me that the U.S. border is easier to get  into than that of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. This is  unacceptable and is a direct result of the Biden administration's  disastrous crisis and policy at our border.   Just today, senior DHS officials have told us that the border is  secure. It is not.   I am proud to join with Ranking Member Katko and my colleagues on the  Homeland Security Committee to offer a comprehensive border security  solutions bill. It is time to stop playing political games with our  security and with our immigration laws. We must return to policies that  we know work to stem the flow of illegal immigration and regain  operational control of our southern border.   Enough is enough. Something must be done. I urge my Democratic  colleagues to call this what it is, a crisis, and to stand for our  border security.
