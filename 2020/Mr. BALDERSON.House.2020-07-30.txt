 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of an amendment I  offered alongside Representatives Cisneros, Larsen, and Young. This  amendment would increase funding to Small Business Development Centers  by $5 million by fiscal year 2021.   SBDCs provide a critical resource to small business owners and  entrepreneurs who use the centers for free consulting and at-cost  trainings. SBDCs have a return on investment of over two to one, and  last year they helped generate $7 billion in new sales. It will be even  more valuable as our small businesses recover from this pandemic.   As a Member of the House Small Business Committee, I have seen  firsthand how effective SBDCs can be for our Nation's economic engine.  Now, more than ever, we need to strengthen our support for small  business programs.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on this  amendment and support Main Streets across America.
