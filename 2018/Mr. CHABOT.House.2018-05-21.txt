 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz  for their leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5044, the Service- Disabled Veterans Small Business Continuation Act.   This bill ensures that the surviving spouses of Service Disabled  Veteran Owned Small Businesses are able to retain the Service Disabled  Veteran Owned status of their small business for 3 years, as was  mentioned, after the passing of the veteran spouse.   This policy is already codified in title 38 of the United States  Code. However, there is a lack of parity between title 38 and the Small  Business Act.   I have heard from several small businesses about this issue,  including one in my district, that this discrepancy creates legal  uncertainty and confusion in the application of this important policy.  What we are trying to do is clear it up.   To guarantee clarity and certainty for the administration of these  Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, the Small Business Act  must conform with the policy prescribed in title 38.                                time  1615    H.R. 5044 dispels any legal uncertainty, ensuring that these  important policy changes to the law are sustained. Most importantly,  this bill provides peace of mind for surviving spouses of veteran  business owners. And one of the main things a veteran is always looking  out for is making sure that his or her spouse is taken care of after  they are gone. So this will not only give the surviving spouse peace of  mind, but the veteran himself or herself peace of mind ahead of time.   Again, I thank the chairman and the ranking member and members of the  House Veterans Affairs' Committee for their leadership in clearing this  up and, again, giving peace of mind to veterans and their spouses all  over America. I would urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5044.
