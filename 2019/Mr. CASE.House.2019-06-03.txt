(2) Applications.--To be eligible to receive a grant or       enter into a cooperative agreement under this subsection, an       entity described in paragraph (1) shall submit to the       Secretary an application at such time, in such manner, and       containing such information as the Secretary may require.        (3) Terms and conditions.--A grant or cooperative agreement       under this subsection shall be subject to such terms and       conditions as the Secretary determines to be appropriate,       including making data publically available and interoperable       with other Federal datasets.        (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized       to be appropriated to carry out this section $40,000,000 for       each of fiscal years 2020 through 2023.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DelBene).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1261, the ``National  Landslide Preparedness Act.''   H.R. 1261 establishes a national program to identify and reduce  losses from landslide hazards and a national 3D Elevation Program.   The bill also authorizes a study of ground subsidence.   Climate change charges us with the responsibility to study  significant landslide threats to mitigate damages and protect our  citizens.   The 3D Elevation Program (3DEP), authorized under H.R. 1261,  systematically collects 3D elevation data in the form of light  detection and ranging (lidar) data for the conterminous United States,  Hawaii, and the U.S. territories, with data acquired over an 8-year  period.   Mr. Speaker, due to global warming, high river levels provoke floods  and landslides, which block roads and hinder people from escaping life- threatening situations.   More than 30,000 people worldwide were killed by landslides between  2004 and 2010, according to the Geological Society of America.   And in the U.S. between 25 and 50 people are killed by landslides  every year, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).   Slides can occur in all 50 states, but regions like the Appalachian  Mountains, the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Coastal Ranges have  ``severe landslide problems,'' according to the USGS.   Mother Nature is unpredictable and can endanger our constituents'  lives and homes if advanced warning procedures are not established.   Continued wet weather has also resulted in rivers reaching  increasingly dangerous levels.   As of 25 February, National Weather Service data showed over 250  rivers in the Midwest, South and East to be above flood stage.   In February 2019, one person died in flash flooding in Tennessee  after a storm system was caused by a landslide brought on by record- breaking rain to the Nashville area.   The Cincinnati metropolitan area is another region that faces  constant threats of landslides.   It sits in part on what's called the Kope shale formation, which  breaks down easily and is highly prone to landslides.   In 2010, the Cincinnati metro area faced landslides that wrecked  properties and caused damages that were difficult to assess.   Losses from landslides in the United States were estimated in 1980 to  exceed $1 billion per year.   The U.S. Geological Survey estimated annual losses to be between $2  billion and $4 billion per year.   However, landslide costs across the country are not currently tracked  or measured in a uniform way by any one agency.   Passage of H.R. 1261 will result in the:   publication of a national strategy for landslide hazards, risk  reduction, and response in the United States (including territories);   Development and maintenance of a publicly accessible national  landslide hazard and risk inventory database;   an expanded early warning system for debris flow; and   the establishment of emergency response procedures for the rapid  deployment of federal scientists, equipment, and services to areas  impacted by a significant landslide event.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1261 incentivizes geologic investigations, good  engineering practices, and effective enforcement of land-use management  regulations to reduce landslide hazards.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1261  to establish and strengthen the nation's emergency preparedness  procedures to assess and evaluate landslide damages and threats.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 559) to amend section 6 of the Joint Resolution entitled ``A  Joint Resolution to approve the Covenant To Establish a Commonwealth of  the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States  of America, and for other purposes'', as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 559         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Northern Mariana Islands       Long-Term Legal Residents Relief Act''.       SEC. 2. LONG-TERM LEGAL RESIDENTS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF THE                     NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS.         Section 6(e) of the Joint Resolution entitled ``A Joint       Resolution to approve the Covenant To Establish a       Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political       Union with the United States of America, and for other       purposes'', approved March 24, 1976 (48 U.S.C. 1806), is       amended by adding at the end the following:  [[Page H4202]]         ``(6) Special provision regarding long-term residents of       the commonwealth.--        ``(A) CNMI resident status.--An alien described in       subparagraph (B) may, upon the application of the alien, be       admitted in CNMI Resident status to the Commonwealth subject       to the following rules:        ``(i) The alien shall be treated as an alien lawfully       admitted to the Commonwealth only, including permitting entry       to and exit from the Commonwealth, until the earlier of the       date on which--         ``(I) the alien ceases to reside in the Commonwealth;

and        ``(II) may, in the Secretary's discretion, authorize       deferred action or parole, as appropriate, with work       authorization, for such alien beginning on the date of the       enactment of this paragraph and continuing through the end of       such 180-day period or the date of adjudication of the       alien's application for CNMI Resident status, whichever is       later.         ``(iii) Nothing in this subparagraph may be construed to       provide any alien granted status under this subparagraph with       public assistance to which the alien is not otherwise       entitled.        ``(iv) An alien granted status under this paragraph--         ``(I) is subject to all grounds of deportability under       section 237 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.       1227);

       ``(III) is inadmissible to the United States at any port of       entry outside the Commonwealth, except that the Secretary of       Homeland Security may in the Secretary's discretion authorize       admission of such alien at a port of entry in Guam for the       purpose of direct transit to the Commonwealth, which       admission shall be considered an admission to the       Commonwealth;        ``(IV) automatically shall lose such status if the alien       travels from the Commonwealth to any other place in the       United States, except that the Secretary of Homeland Security       may in the Secretary's discretion establish procedures for       the advance approval on a case-by-case basis of such travel       for a temporary and legitimate purpose, and the Secretary may       in the Secretary's discretion authorize the direct transit of       aliens with CNMI Resident status through Guam to a foreign       place;

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 559 would provide relief to a small group of long- term Northern Mariana Islands legal residents who will otherwise be  forced to leave the Commonwealth by June 29 of this year if this  legislation is not passed.   This legislation is similar to legislation introduced back in 2011,  which was ultimately included in bipartisan, comprehensive immigration  legislation which passed the Senate in 2012 and to legislation which  has extended their status previously.   Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. Sablan), the sponsor of the  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I commend my colleague from the Northern Mariana Islands for so ably  representing his people. As the Representative proudly representing  Hawaii, I recognize him and his constituents as members of our Pacific  Islands ohana, and I commend him also for working very closely with the  administration to get this bill right from both sides' perspectives. It  is a truly bipartisan bill.   It is a necessary bill, and I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
