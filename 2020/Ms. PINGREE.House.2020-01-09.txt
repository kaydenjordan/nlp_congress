 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank Chairman Pallone and Congresswoman Dingell for their  leadership on PFAS issues, and I thank Congresswoman Spanberger, who is  also a sponsor of this amendment with me.   I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 535, the PFAS Action  Act of 2019. This bipartisan bill would take much-needed and long- overdue action on these forever harmful chemicals.   These pervasive and dangerous chemicals pose serious risks to both  human health and to our environment, and the delay in taking action on  them has been inexcusable. They are known hormone disruptors, and  studies link exposure to them to kidney and testicular cancer, thyroid  disease, and other health problems.   PFAS chemicals are concentrated in human and animal blood and tissue  and can remain there for years. It is estimated that 99 percent of  Americans have PFAS in their blood.   In my home State of Maine, PFAS was first discovered from the  groundwater at former military installations from firefighting foam,  but PFAS has also been found in our public water supplies, soil, animal  products, and household products like cookware and carpets.   A 2015 review by the Environmental Working Group showed the majority  of PFAS in homes comes from its presence in carpets and textiles. The  U.S. Centers for Disease Control named carpet as the number one source  of PFAS exposure for infants and toddlers, who, as you can imagine,  spend a lot of time playing, lying, and crawling on carpets.   My amendment would expand the Environmental Protection Agency's Safer  Choice label to additional household products, including carpet, rugs,  clothing, or upholstered furniture certified not to contain PFAS. This  change would prompt manufacturers to develop safer alternatives and  help consumers find and buy healthier products for their homes.   I urge my colleagues to join me in taking action for the health of  our communities and the environment and vote ``yes'' on my amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute of my time to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).    Madam Chair, consumers have the right to know what  harmful chemicals are in their homes, and they should have the ability  to choose products that keep their families and their environment safe.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  2015
