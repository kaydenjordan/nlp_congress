 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Barr for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the National  Strategy for Combating the Financing of Transnational Criminal  Organizations Act. I want to thank my colleague Representative Kustoff  for his work on this important issue.   The Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance has been examining  global criminal organizations and the threat they pose to the United  States financial system.   These sophisticated and dangerous organizations, like drug cartels,  increasingly pose a direct threat to the safety and security of all  Americans. They have fueled the opioid crisis that continues to kill  tens of thousands of Americans each year, including the spread of human  trafficking, among a host of other illicit activities.   I want to remind my colleagues that entire communities are still  plagued by this crisis, including hard-hit communities in western  Pennsylvania.   Beyond the opioid crisis, though, I want to highlight an  exceptionally dangerous situation in which the United States finds  itself.   Some of the cartels are now working directly with organizations like  Hezbollah, a terrorist organization, as reflected in a recent Politico  article. Fortunately, the new administration is taking a tougher stance  now with the announcement of a newly created Hezbollah Financing and  Narcoterrorism Team.   Mr. Speaker, it is about time America fought back against this  growing international threat, and this bill will help ensure the  government has a strategy to stay in this fight. Lives depend on it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend Mr. King for his  work on the Heartbeat Protection Act. It gives us an opportunity to  reflect on some of those bigger issues that we have going on in our  society.   This is personal to everybody. We all have our own stories of when we  are in a family situation and somebody becomes pregnant. I certainly  remember that when my wife and I had our first child. The first visit  to the doctor when you got to hear the heartbeat was just amazing.   I remember also having a subsequent appointment where the doctor  couldn't find the heartbeat. We were very concerned, very worried, so  they sent us to the hospital. They wanted us to have another test. It  is a small town we were in. The hospital was where they had the  sonogram. My wife and I were praying all the way: Please, let this baby  be okay.   Well, we got to the hospital and the technician did a sonogram, and,  lo and behold, we saw the baby, we saw the beating heart, and we were  just in awe at this new human life.   Mothers and fathers are forever changed when they first hear that  heartbeat, that tiny pulse that reinforces the big and beautiful  reality of a precious human life.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I rise in support of H.R. 490, the Heartbeat  Protection Act. As a lawmaker, I took an oath to our Constitution to  protect the constitutional rights of all Americans. That is why I am  cosponsoring this bill.   This legislation protects a pre-born baby's life when his or her  heartbeat is detected. A heartbeat is a very basic sign of life. The  pulse represents a unique person with inherent dignity and natural,  human and constitutional rights that extend throughout the continuum of  life through conception until natural death.   And where do these rights come from?   The Founders who signed the Declaration knew, for the Declaration  itself says: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men  are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain  unalienable rights.''   That is interesting, Mr. Speaker, because the first unalienable right  that is identified is the right to life.   Do you know who else knew?   President Kennedy.   President Kennedy reminded us in a different context, in the struggle  against atheistic totalitarian communism. He said these words: ``And  yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are  still at issue around the globe--the belief that the rights of man come  not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God.''   The right to life, defined in our Declaration, protected in our  Constitution, and reiterated time and again by leaders across the  religious and political spectrum, applies to every human life. It is  easy to see who is human, if you look.   Twenty-six years ago, the late Governor Bob Casey from Pennsylvania,  and others, including Sargent Shriver and Eunice Kennedy Shriver,  signed onto a statement regarding abortion as true today as when it was  published. Under the section of that document that was titled ``Without  a Doubt, a Human Life,'' Governor Casey and his coauthors observed:         From the beginning, each human embryo has its own unique       genetic identity. Three and a half weeks after conception,       its heart starts beating. At 6 weeks, brain activity can be       detected. At the end of 2 months, the limbs, fingers, and       toes are complete. By 3 months, the baby is quite active,       forming fists, bending arms, and curling toes. At 4 months,       vocal cords, eyelashes, teeth buds, fingernails, and toenails       are all present. By 5 months, the baby is sucking its thumb,       punching, kicking, and going through the motions of crying.       By 6 months, it responds to light and sound and can recognize       its mother's voice.   [[Page H1437]]     The statement went on:         Advocates of unrestricted abortion do not want the public       to focus on these undeniable facts of fetal development,       but the facts cannot be ignored. They may claim that       abortion is a violent act, not against potential life, but       against a living, growing human being, a life with       potential.    Governor Casey subscribed to that belief.   Mr. Speaker, let's be clear. Intentionally stopping a heartbeat is  not healthcare.   H.R. 490 recognizes what science has already affirmed: that there is  a baby growing in her mother's womb, one with her own distinct  heartbeat.   Therefore, we have an obligation to protect the most vulnerable among  us: to defend the defenseless.   How can our country continue to flourish and claim itself as a  champion of human rights when we allow our society to rid ourselves of  our own future generations?   That is why I came to the floor today to urge support for the  Heartbeat Protection Act, to give our country a chance to reflect on  some of the deeper questions and deeper values, to walk in solidarity  with one another when one encounters a difficult situation, and to  stand in each another's shoes with empathy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
