 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment in the  en bloc.   Mr. Chairman, my district is home to Chester, an economically  distressed, majority Black city that has struggled for generations. As  a result, major polluting industries have set up shop in Chester next  to schools, hospitals, homes, and businesses. One of these polluters, a  large municipal waste incinerator, was featured on a CNN report that  aired just this week.   All day every day my constituents are breathing in carcinogens  released by the incinerator like mercury, cadmium, and particulate  matter that prevent them from working, learning, and leading healthy  lives. At the same time, the Trump administration has failed to enforce  Clean Air Act standards that could protect these citizens.   Fortunately, our Interior appropriations bill ensures that Clean Air  Act enforcement is a priority, but this amendment makes clear that the  administration cannot take these underserved communities like Chester  for granted.   This Congress will not allow environmental injustice to go unchecked.  We will fight for our constituents, and we will take meaningful steps  to address the public health and environmental justice crises that lack  of EPA enforcement has fostered.
