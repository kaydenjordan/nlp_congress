 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, unlike past occasions when I have  spoken on the topic of gun violence prevention, I am actually pleased  to talk about some good news. A powerful alliance across the aisle has  enabled us this morning to introduce a measure that will be a modest  but significant breakthrough. It is a breakthrough in  [[Page S7274]]  hopefully providing better data, more complete information for the  database that provides for background checks. It is essential that more  accurate and thorough data be provided in the database because  background checks are no better than the information provided to them,  as we have seen again and again, in Sutherland Springs most recently  but also Charleston and Blacksburg, where individuals legally barred  from accessing firearms were permitted to do so because of gaps in the  NICS system. Each of those killers walked out of a gun store having  purchased firearms from a federally licensed dealer, even though they  should have been ineligible, because of gaps in the reporting system;  that is, the information reported to the national system that collects  that data and provides the underpinning for this program.   We are a bipartisan group that says, in effect, enforcement must be  rigorous, as complete and effective as possible. New laws may be  sought, and we will continue to seek a broader background check law, as  well as a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We in  this coalition may be divided on those issues, but at the very least,  we can join arms and link together on this measure.   These provisions will help enforce public safety protections that  could mean the difference between life and death. Nonreporting now puts  people at lethal risk, riddling with gaping holes a system that should  keep guns away from killers. The Federal background check system is  only as good as the information provided to it.   I am proud to be part of this alliance. I look forward to the next  steps--the prompt passage of this legislation and other measures that  perhaps will evoke the same kind of bipartisan spirit across the aisle.   I am working with a number of my Republican colleagues on a measure  relating to military reporting, particularly as it concerns domestic  violence. All of us who have been attorneys general, as the Presiding  Officer has been, know the scourge of domestic violence and how much  more dangerous it is--five times more lethal--when there is a gun in  the house. More than half of the homicides in this country occur as a  result of domestic violence. More effective enforcement requires steps  that enable resources as well as awareness in the military and in our  civilian courts.                             Judicial Nominations    Mr. President, on the topic of effective enforcement of the law, I  rise today on a related topic, which is the quality of our judiciary.  Our laws are only as effective as the judges who implement them.   I rise with regret because the administration is attempting to  radically reshape our judiciary, to remake the bench in the image of a  far-right dogma that basically contravenes what we are and where we are  as a nation.   This administration has proposed extreme nominees who will seek to  undo decades of critically important progress in recognizing and  protecting reproductive rights, LGBT rights, voting rights, workers'  rights, environmental protections, and more.   For the last 10 months, this administration has tried its level best  to move our country backward by implementing its destructive, deeply  unpopular agenda. They want to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. They  want to abandon LGBT Americans. They want to make it harder to vote,  harder to organize, harder to breathe clean air and drink clean water.   If they fall short in carrying out this cruel agenda through  Executive action and legislation, this administration has looked to the  courts to do its dirty work. The Trump administration seeks to flood  the Federal judiciary with judges--appointed for life--who will defend  their indefensible goals. This plot is not hidden. It is not secret. It  is out in the open. President Trump has made it clear. He claims to  have a litmus test for Supreme Court nominees--he will nominate someone  who will ``automatically'' overturn Roe v. Wade. Just last month, the  Senate voted to confirm two circuit court nominees--Allison Eid and  Joan Larsen--who had been listed by then-Candidate Trump as potential  Supreme Court nominees, indicating that they have passed that litmus  test. When I asked both of these nominees whether their records would  lead someone to believe that they would ``automatically'' reverse Roe  v. Wade, they both demurred. They said they did not know why they were  selected for President Trump's Supreme Court short list--no idea. I  don't believe it. Then-Candidate Trump laid out his Supreme Court  selection criteria in clear, unambiguous terms.    Yesterday we heard testimony from a circuit court nominee, Justice  Don Willett, of the Texas Supreme Court, who proudly described himself  in 2012 as the ``consensus, conservative choice from every corner of  the conservative movement: pro-life, pro-faith, pro-family, pro- liberty, pro-Second Amendment, pro-private property rights, and pro- limited government.'' That is the way that he described himself.   When I asked him what he meant by tying himself to these labels, he  refused to give me a straight answer. In fact, he said, in effect, that  he was just pandering to the public for votes, that that was part of  his reelection pitch. Maybe he didn't believe it, but we have all been  around long enough to know what these terms mean to voters and what  they mean to the President of the United States. They aren't dog  whistles, literally, but they represent specific ideologies. They are  shorthand for specific dogma.   I have no confidence that Justice Willett will be an impartial and  objective implementer of the law and enforcer of the measures that we  pass here.   Just last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to advance Brett  Talley. He is someone who wrote that the solution to the Newtown  shooting--he wrote it 3 days after that massacre--is to ``stop being a  society of pansies and man up.'' He is someone who has written that the  country ``overreacted'' and that ``the Second Amendment suffered''  after the murder of 20 children and 6 adults in Newtown.   After one of the great tragedies of this country in recent years, his  reaction was that the Second Amendment suffered. He is someone who has  disingenuously written that Democrats want to take away everyone's  guns. Even setting aside the fact that he has never tried a case in his  career, he is someone who should be nowhere near the bench, at least  not as a judge.   I hope my Republican colleagues will revisit their decision to  support him.   I want to emphasize that the compromise that we have reached today  and that we are introducing in this bipartisan group takes away no  one's guns if one is law-abiding and otherwise complies with the law.  In fact, it provides incentives and rewards to States that do better  reporting. It makes sure that a robust reporting system prevents the  sales of firearms to people who are a danger to themselves or others,  including convicted domestic abusers.   This exaggeration, distortion, misinformation from Mr. Talley is, I  think, emblematic of what kind of judge he would be.   Let us not forget that we are, in fact, judged by the company that we  keep. President Trump is willing to nominate someone like Jeff Mateer  to a lifetime appointment on the Federal District Court for the Eastern  District of Texas. He was not on the docket this week, but he could  well come before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a hearing in the  coming weeks.   This is someone who has called transgender children ``Satan's plan.''  He has proudly said: ``On the basis of sexual orientation, we  discriminate.'' He has advocated conversion therapy for LGBT children.   With these nominations, President Trump has shown the type of people  he is willing to propose for lifetime appointments on the district  court, as well as the court of appeals. As someone who has practiced in  the district courts of Connecticut and others around the country, as  well as in courts of appeals in the Second Circuit and elsewhere, these  appointments have a special meaning to me and to others who are well  versed in the way our justice system works.   For many people in this country, the U.S. district court is the first  place they seek justice. They rely on Federal judges to be above  politics and to be above personal ideology and dogma of the right or  the left wing. The U.S. district court is the first place they seek  justice, and, for many, it is the last place. Adverse rulings for them  are often the end of the line because they lack the resources to pursue  appeals to  [[Page S7275]]  the circuit court. Our district court judges are often the voices and  faces of justice that the people of the United States most trust and  rely on.   What we see in these nominees is a pattern. They have clearly  demonstrated through their actions, their statements, their  temperaments, and their characters that they are, simply, unfit and  unable to serve as impartial judges, especially when it comes to our  Nation's most vulnerable communities. Our Nation's most vulnerable  communities are often the ones who rely the most on those Federal  courts.   There can be no benefit of the doubt for nominees when they  articulate the kinds of beliefs and dogma that these individuals have  in their pasts and that they refuse to disavow in the present. I will  oppose them, and I hope my colleagues will join me. I believe that on  both sides of the aisle, we share a commitment to the credibility and  trust of our judiciary.   As I have said before on the floor, our judges do not have armies;  they do not have police forces. The enforceability of their rulings  really depends on the credibility and trust that the people of our  Nation have in them as individuals who put on robes, because they are  supposed to put aside their personal prejudices and beliefs and fairly,  impartially, and objectively enforce the law.   I fear that these nominees lack these qualities, and that is a  tragedy for our Nation, whatever your politics. Someday, you will  likely be before a judge--maybe not all, but many of you will--and you  will want that judge to look at both sides of the courtroom and say  that they both have an equal chance to make their cases, not tilt one  way or the other because of the judge's personal beliefs. I hope that  my colleagues will send a message to the President of the United States  that one cannot politicize the American judiciary.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
