 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Health Enterprise  Zones Act of 2022.   The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light the severity of inequities  in the U.S. healthcare system. Latinos and African Americans  experienced the highest death and infection rates during the pandemic.   But inequitable access to quality, affordable healthcare is not  unique to the past 18 months. Centuries of structural and systemic  racism continue to result in poorer health outcomes in communities of  color. Historically, these communities are underserved by health  professionals, which both causes and further exacerbates health  disparities.   That is why I am proud to introduce The Health Enterprise Zones Act  of 2022, which uses a market-based approach to incentivize increased  health provider participation in structurally disadvantaged areas.   This bill would direct the Department of Health and Human Services to  designate health enterprise zones based on measurable and documented  health disparities in areas with poor health outcomes.   These zones would be eligible Federal grants for projects to reduce  health disparities and provide healthcare providers employee tax  credits, a 10 percent Medicare reimbursement bonus, and student loan  repayment.   I want to thank Representative Anthony Brown for introducing the  House companion, and I look forward to working on this bill into the  next Congress. I hope our colleagues will join us in taking this key  step to achieving health equity.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. on  Tuesday, December 20, and that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session for the  consideration of Executive Calendar No. 972, R. Russell Rumbaugh, to be  an Assistant Secretary of the Navy; further, that the Senate recess  from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus  meetings.    For the information of the Senate, rollcall votes are  possible during Tuesday's session.                            ____________________     If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous order  following the remarks of the Senator from Georgia.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________
