 Madam Speaker, I thank the chair for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1425, the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act.   As a two-time breast cancer survivor, I know how important it is to  have access to quality, affordable healthcare, especially for those  like me who have preexisting conditions.   This pandemic has shown us that every American needs access to  quality, affordable healthcare. Many Americans have lost their  employer-sponsored insurance and found affordable health coverage  outside of their grasp, outside of their own reach.   The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act  incentivizes Medicaid expansion, improves Medicaid coverage, fixes the  family glitch, and ensures that every American has access to quality,  affordable healthcare. That is our right. That is our right as  Americans, to have affordable healthcare, to be able to take care of  our loved ones, take care of ourselves and live a good, sustainable  quality of life.   There is so much work that needs to be done, but this legislation  truly takes important steps to ensuring that every American has the  ability to be able to have access to health coverage.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues across the aisle to vote ``yes.''   I am a preexisting condition, and in my district there are over  300,000 people like me who have preexisting conditions--45,000 of those  in my district are children under the age of 17--and we deserve to be  cared for, and we deserve to have a good quality of life afforded by  affordable and good, quality healthcare.
