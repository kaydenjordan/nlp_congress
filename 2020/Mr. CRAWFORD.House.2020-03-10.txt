 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the heroism of two  police officers in Forrest City, Arkansas, Lieutenant Eric Varner and  Detective Eugene Watlington, who stopped a potential mass shooting in  progress on February 10.   On that fateful morning, a gunman entered a Wal-Mart in Forrest City  and began threatening customers. Officers Varner and Watlington  responded within minutes, despite not wearing body armor, as  plainclothes officers. When they confronted the suspect and tried to  peacefully deescalate the situation, the gunman opened fire. Both  officers were struck, but they were able to return fire and kill the  shooter.   Both officers were seriously injured, and I ask that my colleagues  join me in praying for a speedy and full recovery.   Lieutenant Varner and Detective Watlington saved many lives that day  without regard for their own safety, and I invite Congress to join me  in honoring them.                            ____________________
