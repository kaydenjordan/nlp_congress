 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize a friend and colleague who will be retiring from Congress as  the 116th Congress comes to a close. I have served with Dr. Phil Roe  since we came into Congress together as classmates in 2009.   Phil represents the First Congressional District of Tennessee. His  pathway to Congress includes being an Eagle Scout, veteran, mayor, and  medical physician, delivering more than 5,000 of his future  constituents.   Phil and I have sat next to each other on the House Education and  Labor Committee for 12 years. We started at the very end of the  seniority seating and now sit prominently as senior members.                                time  1230    Congressman Roe has left his mark serving the American people as  chair and Republican leader of the House Committee on Veterans'  Affairs. He authored the MISSION Act, which ensures veterans have the  ability to receive the best possible care now and in the future, and  the Forever GI Bill, which ensures veterans won't lose access to the  education benefits that they earned through their service.   Madam Chair, in his own words, Congressman Phil Roe said it best:  ``I'll leave Congress at the end of the year knowing that our Nation's  heroes are better served today because of our work.''   Thank you, Phil. And thank you to his wife, Clarinda, and their  family for sharing Phil with us. Best wishes for whatever the next  chapter's adventures bring.                     Farewell to Congressman Greg Walden     Madam Speaker, in 2018, Congressman  Greg Walden won his 11th term in Congress to represent Oregon's Second  Congressional District. When the 116th Congress ends, he will retire  after 22 years of service to our Nation.   Greg graduated from the University of Oregon with a journalism degree  and took over the operations of his father's radio station in Hood  River--and added another--before winning his congressional seat in  1998.   In 2014 and 2016, he successfully chaired the National Republican  Congressional Committee. Greg served as chairman of the House Committee  on Energy and Commerce in the 115th Congress and currently serves as  the Republican leader of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.   Madam Speaker, I am honored to have worked with Congressman   Greg  Walden and share passions with him: his passion to improve forest  management and lead reforms to make our Federal forests healthier, make  our rural communities more financially solvent, and make our forests  more resilient to climate change.   To his wife, Mylene, thank you for sharing this lifelong Oregonian,  Eagle Scout, and great public servant with us.  [[Page H7166]]    Best wishes, Greg. I know you will continue to make a difference in  retirement.                     Farewell to Congressman   Rob Bishop     Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize a  retiring leader and mentor, Congressman   Rob Bishop.   A public schoolteacher turned public servant,   Rob Bishop represents  Utah's First Congressional District in the United States Congress. I  have had the privilege of serving with and under the leadership of  Congressman Bishop on the Committee on Natural Resources for 8 years.   First elected in 2003, Rob served as chairman of the powerful House  Committee on Natural Resources and is now its ranking member. He has  been a key player on many public land bills.   Congressman Bishop is committed to helping Congress strike a balance  for wise management of our public lands and resources. Protecting  private property rights and State sovereignty and preserving the  Western heritage are among his chief priorities on the committees that  guided him. There is no stronger fighter to protect the livelihoods of  public land users in rural America, while ensuring that we are  responsible stewards of our natural resources.   Madam Speaker, Congressman   Rob Bishop negotiated much of the  legislation included in the Natural Resources Management Act. This  legislation expanded access to public lands, while also shrinking the  size of the Federal estate, and provided wins for America's sportsmen,  hunters, and fishermen.   Thank you, Rob, for your service, your friendship, and your  mentoring. Thank you, as well to his wife, Jeralynn, and his children  and grandchildren for sharing Rob with us.   Best wishes in the next chapter of life.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give a  special shout-out to Mike Vuckovich, superintendent of the Indiana Area  School District.   Mike was recently recognized as one of America's Superintendents to  Watch for 2020. He was one of only 24 recipients to receive this  recognition and the only Pennsylvanian.   Mike has been on the job just 2 years but recently was recognized by  the National School Public Relations Association as a 2020  Superintendent to Watch. The organization selects superintendents from  across the country who ``demonstrate dynamic, fast-paced leadership  with strong communication at its core.''   This is exactly what Mike has done with his time at Indiana Area  School District.   Mike has been a champion for digital technology and online  communication throughout the district, investments that have clearly  come in handy in the age of coronavirus. The district's new website and  social media accounts have been a useful tool to keep parents,  teachers, and students on the same page during what has undoubtedly  been a hectic and stressful school year.   I thank Mike for his drive, dedication, and initiative, and I am  pleased to have a leader like Mike in Indiana County.                            ____________________
