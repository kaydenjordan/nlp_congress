 Mr. Speaker, the Trump White House and the  U.S. Treasury Secretary continue to issue formal reports about the  Republican corporate tax cut plan. These reports are devoid of fact or  credibility and have been categorically rejected by each and every  respectable tax expert.   These tax cuts will pay for themselves and fuel $2 trillion in  economic growth over the next decade.   Not true. Tax cuts have never come close to paying for themselves,  not once or ever in human history.   Corporate tax cuts will trickle down to increase annual household  income in America by between $4,000 and $9,000.   No one believes this or them. For the White House Council of Economic  Advisers to say this is official misconduct and a blatant fraud  perpetrated against middle America.   Mr. Speaker, this big, corporate tax cut is a massive giveaway to  corporate America and a major takeaway from middle America.                            ____________________
