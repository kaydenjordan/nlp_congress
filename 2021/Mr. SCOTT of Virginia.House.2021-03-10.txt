 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the American  Rescue Plan Act.   Passing this plan will give schools the resources they need to comply  with the CDC guidelines to reopen safely and to remain open, and the  resources needed to make up for lost time in the classroom.   Passing this plan will help institutions of higher education weather  this pandemic and provide urgent financial assistance to their  students. It will help childcare providers to keep their doors open so  working parents can rejoin the workforce.   Passing this plan will prevent more than a million retirees from  losing their hard-earned pensions and avert an economic calamity that  would destroy countless businesses and cost taxpayers at least $170  billion.   Passing this rescue plan will also improve access to affordable  healthcare during the pandemic, and it will cut child poverty about in  half.   Passing this plan will protect vulnerable Americans across the  country, including families facing financial hardships, older Americans  trying to stay safe, and survivors of domestic and gender-based  violence.   Mr. Speaker, the American people have been calling on us to deliver  relief and to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, we come together to  send a resounding message that help is on the way.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the American Rescue Plan  Act.
