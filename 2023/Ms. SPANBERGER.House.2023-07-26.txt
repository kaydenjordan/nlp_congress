 Mr. Speaker, I stand here to recognize some of  Virginia's many proud veterans and military families. One of my most  powerful memories of my late grandfather was when I took him to the  World War II Memorial and had the opportunity to stand with him on the  side marked Pacific and hear some of his stories from his time in  service. These are stories that he, throughout my childhood, never  shared, but at that memorial chose to share with me.   As a Representative for Virginia's Seventh District and as a  Representative of many military families and veterans, I ensure that I  am giving a voice and putting into the Congressional Record some of the  extraordinary stories of service that we have throughout our district.   Earlier this year, I reached out to Virginians across the Seventh  District asking them to share stories of service to recognize their  loved ones who answered the call or share their own experiences. I  heard from people across the Seventh District, and I was proud to share  some of those stories in May during Military Appreciation Month, and I  will continue to do so into the future.   Kenneth J. Schmidt from Prince William County shared the long record  of service in his family, writing ``My family is a proud military one.  Our father served during World War I. Seven brothers-in-law, two  cousins, and my oldest brother served during World War II. My other  brother and I served during the Korean war. Army, Navy, Air Force, we  were there.''  [[Page H3958]]    I thank Mr. Schmidt for his family's sacrifices on behalf of our  country.   We received a story from James Willess who lives in Fredericksburg.  Mr. Willess wrote, ``My father, Homer Leroy Willess, served in the U.S.  Navy from July 1937 to September 1945, mostly in the Pacific theater.  Four of his brothers also served in the Navy, and his eldest sister  served as an Army nurse during World War II. Three of his younger  brothers served in the Navy during the Korean war, and their youngest  sister served as a Navy nurse during the Vietnam war. I am extremely  proud of my father and siblings for serving their country in uniform  during three major wars.''   Neil Hornung from Spotsylvania, a veteran himself, shared with us,  ``I served in the Marine Corps from 1982 until 2008. Served in  Operation Desert Storm, Operation Desert Shield, and Operation Uphold  Democracy. My last tour was as the Marine Corps lead for critical  infrastructure.''   I thank Mr. Hornung for his service.   Mr. Hornung wanted to recognize a member of his family who followed  in his footsteps. He wrote, ``My oldest son is First Lieutenant Brandon  Hornung, United States Marine Corps, currently stationed on Okinawa.''   I thank Brandon for his service. Please stay safe.   Paul from Spotsylvania shared his father's story of service in the  United States Marine Corps. He wrote, ``My dad, Ed Czartosieski, was at  the Battle of Chosin Reservoir in Korea as a marine pilot flying  Corsair aircraft. He flew out of Hagaru and was surrounded by Chinese  forces. He assisted in saving many lives with the `advance to the rear'  as the Marine Corps. He retired as a test pilot for Grumman Aerospace  on Long Island. Dad is doing well in Greenport, New York, and soon to  be age 100.'' Paul wrote, ``I hope to get to the United States Marine  Corps Museum in Quantico, Virginia.''   Harry Dolph from Stafford sent us the story of his mother, a patriot  who stepped into service on behalf of our country when it needed her  the most. Mr. Dolph wrote, ``My mother, Caroline Alva Bush, was one of  the first dozen women to enlist in the U.S. Navy during World War I,  and served in personnel in Washington, D.C.''   George Wratney from Orange County shared a story highlighting the  sacrifices and contributions of military families.   Mr. Wratney shared with us, ``I was a Marine in Vietnam from April  1968 to May 1969, but this is about my bride of 22 months when I left  home, and the thousands of military brides like her, who had no one `in  their boat' back home to share stories, fears, anxieties. No email  then. No social media. Only prayers. We owe them, all of them, much  gratitude as they stood by.''   I thank Mr. Wratney for his service and recognizing the service and  the sacrifice of military families like his bride.   Veterans, servicemembers, and Virginia's proud military family  members are our neighbors, friends, and community members--their  stories are woven into the fabric of our Nation and certainly  Virginia's Seventh District. We owe them a debt of gratitude, and we  must thank every American who answered the call and every American that  will do so in the future.   We are undoubtedly freer thanks to the service and sacrifice of  Virginians that answered the call.                            ____________________
