 Mr. President, I ask to speak for 1 minute as in  morning business.    Across Iowa this weekend, farmers will be in their  fields as they continue the 2020 harvest season. Iowa farmers have now  harvested all but about 10 percent of our soybeans and 30 percent of  our corn.   Because I am in Washington, DC, this weekend with the confirmation of  Judge Barrett, I won't be able to give my social media followers my  weekly update on the 2020 hashtag ``CornWatch'' or hashtag  ``SoybeanWatch'' series from the Grassley farm. The purpose of this  weekly series is to give people who have never stepped foot on a farm  an idea of the complexities that go into planning, growing, and  harvesting a bountiful crop.   Between COVID-19 supply chain disruptions, drought, and a derecho,  the 86,000 Iowa farm families have faced one of the most challenging  years in recent memory. Farmers are only 2 percent of the population,  but they provide food, fuel, and fiber for the other 98 percent.   I want to send my best wishes to farmers and their families as we are  nearing the final stretch of the harvest season.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote on the  confirmation of Judge Barrett to become Associate Justice of the U.S.  Supreme Court. I will be voting in favor of her nomination, and I urge  my colleagues to do just the same.   As was made clear to millions of Americans who watched her hearing,  Judge Barrett has the temperament, the modesty, and the humility that  we should all expect in a judge. She approaches cases without bias or  personal agenda. She made that very clear to almost every question  asked to her by every member of the Judiciary Committee.   Most importantly, Judge Barrett understands the proper role of  members of the Judiciary and our constitutional system of separated  powers. That is, a judge should interpret--not make--the law. Making  law is, under the Constitution, the responsibility of the Congress, not  the Supreme Court. She also made that very clear in almost every  question that she was asked by members of the Judiciary Committee.   Judge Barrett has an impressive command and, of course, the respect  for the law and the Constitution. Clearly, from her testimony, she  respects precedent, and she practices judicial restraint. In her words:  ``A judge who approaches a case as an opportunity for an exercise of  will has . . . betrayed her judicial duty.''   She went on to explain to the committee her legal method, how she  considers statutes and the Constitution and how she interprets and  applies the statutes and the Constitution. Her judicial method is  rigorous and exacting but fair. She testified that she would listen to  both sides in every case. She said: ``We want judges to approach cases  thoughtfully and with an open mind.''   When pressed on how she might rule in a particular case, Judge  Barrett promptly applied what we all know as the Ginsburg rule, and she  did it just like every other recent nominee to the Supreme Court for  the last 30 years when Ginsburg first told the Judiciary Committee that  there would be no hints, no previews, or forecasts, and Judge Barrett  demonstrated her independence by often repeating the Justice Ginsburg  rule.   I specifically asked Judge Barrett if she had made any promises or  guarantees to anyone about how she might rule on a case. She responded  this way to my question:         The answer is no. . . . No one ever talked about any case       with me. . . . I can't make any pre-commitments to this body       either. It would be inconsistent with judicial independence.    To quote further:         I'm not willing to make a deal--not with the committee, not       with the president, not with anyone. I am independent.    That quote or similar words were spoken by Judge Barrett to almost  every suspicious Judiciary member about whom she might have made some  deal ahead of time to get on the Supreme Court.   Contrary to critics' claims about her being biased, Judge Barrett is  evenhanded and has ruled for both plaintiffs and defendants in all  kinds of cases. She believes in justice for all, in accordance with the  law and the Constitution, just like we would expect everybody to say  who is a lifetime appointee to the Judiciary, but we don't see all of  them following that practice.   She went on to tell the committee: ``I am fully committed to equal  justice under the law for all persons.''   When asked if she will follow the law wherever it leads, she said:  ``Yes.'' Then she said: ``I have an agenda to stick to the rule of law  and decide cases as they come.'' Yet that wasn't good enough for our  Democratic colleagues and their leftist allies.   However, throughout the hearings, the Democrats and many in the media  deliberately misrepresented Judge Barrett's views on the Affordable  Care  [[Page S6433]]  Act. They claimed her critique of Chief Justice Roberts' reasoning in  the 2012 ACA case will dictate how she will vote in some upcoming  cases. They obviously didn't listen to her when she had no preconceived  notions about any case and had made no promises to anybody.   The Democrats even pushed the story line that Judge Barrett signaled  to President Trump that she would support invalidating the ACA if she  were confirmed to the Supreme Court. That is nonsense. Judge Barrett  made it clear that she didn't have an agenda. She testified: ``I have  no hostility to the ACA.''   Legal scholars critique court decisions all the time even when they  don't disagree with the outcome. For instance, Ruth Bader Ginsburg,  before her nomination, criticized the Court's reasoning in Roe v. Wade,  but no one claimed that Ginsburg didn't support the outcome of Roe v.  Wade.   Judge Barrett's critique of Roberts' reasoning was shared by many  legal commentators across the political spectrum, including by ones on  the other side of the aisle. Even President Obama rejected the notion  that the Affordable Care Act was a tax instead of a penalty. The  question of its being a tax or a penalty and the constitutionality or  the unconstitutionality of the ACA was what they were critiquing based  on Roberts' decision to uphold the constitutionality of the ACA, for it  could be constitutional under the taxing powers of the Congress. Even  Roberts didn't pay any attention to that fact. We even had Democrats  saying that the penalty for the individual mandate was a penalty and  that it wasn't a tax. Moreover, Judge Barrett's critique of Justice  Roberts' reasoning dealt with an interpretation or a provision that is  no longer in effect because we did away with the individual mandate.   The question before the Supreme Court this fall, then, will be  entirely separate, and it is pointless to speculate. Yet the Democrats  wasted much time on that type of speculation--question after question,  Democrat after Democrat, on that side--when they were questioning her.   Senate Democrats want to portray Judge Barrett as a threat to  healthcare. They want to distract from the fact that they recently  filibustered a COVID relief bill that would have protected preexisting  conditions. This all is just a Democratic election year scare tactic,  and they are using it almost totally as a reason to vote against Judge  Barrett.   It happens, though, that the voters aren't buying it, that the public  is not buying it. A recent Politico poll shows a majority of Americans  wants the Senate to confirm Judge Barrett, and a recent Huffington Post  poll says: ``Voters favor the confirmation of the Supreme Court nominee  Amy Coney Barrett by a 9-point margin.''   She will be confirmed. That is what we are going to do on Sunday into  Monday. Maybe our Democratic colleagues will finally show up for work,  do their job, and give Judge Barrett an up-or-down vote on the merits  because I think the public knows now, if it were listening in to the  Judiciary Committee as it was voting her out, that the Democrats  boycotted the committee's deliberation. Let's not forget that, just 4  years ago, the same Senate Democrats declared that the Court needed  nine to function properly. Judge Barrett is that ninth. Only 4 years  later, they don't seem to think so.   Judge Barrett is a jurist of honor, of integrity, and of great  principle. The Judiciary Committee received a number of letters in  support of her nomination. They all praised her intellect, her  judgment, her collegiality, and her kindness. We all saw that kindness  as she testified over a 3-day period of time.   Judge Barrett won't be a politician on the Bench. She will make  decisions as they should be decided--in an impartial manner and in  accordance with the law and the Constitution. I am pleased to vote in  favor of Judge Barrett's confirmation to be an Associate Justice of the  Supreme Court, and I urge my colleagues to support her as well.
