 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of this  amendment to increase funding of bilateral tuberculosis (TB)  assistance, and I want to thank Representatives Engel (D-NY) and Green  (D-TX) for joining me. The three of us are Co-Chairs of the  Tuberculosis Elimination Caucus and have long worked toward that goal.  This includes domestically, such as in the State of Alaska, which  suffers from high per-capita TB rates in the United States, but also  internationally.   The U.S. Agency for International Development does a tremendous  amount of work across the globe providing aid. One of its most  important battles is against TB, which kills more people worldwide than  any other infectious disease. In 2015 this amounted to 1.8 million  people dying, out of the 10.4 million affected. This is more than HIV  and Malaria combined. To make things worse, TB is preventable and  curable.   Imagine if the Centers for Disease Control came out and said next  year there is going to be a new disease. That this disease is going to  infect over 10 million people and kill almost 20 percent of them in  just one year. I imagine we would take it very seriously.   This is not an old world disease. TB is real and it is deadly.  Pandemics of infectious disease in recent years have shown us the need  to combat them ahead of time, not wait until it arrives at our shores.  We have come a long way in combating TB, but more work needs to be  done.   This amendment makes that possible and I urge its adoption.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel).   The amendment was rejected.              Amendment No. 96 Offered by Ms. Frankel of Florida    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 96  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division A (before the short title) insert       the following:                          limitation on use of funds         Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used by the Secretary of Interior to implement the final       rule entitled ``Alaska; Hunting and Trapping in National       Preserves'' (80 Fed. Reg. 64325 (October 23, 2015)), or to       develop, issue, or implement any other rule of the same       substance.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Alaska (Mr. Young) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alaska.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment that was  successfully included in the House fiscal year 2017, which prohibits  funds in this act being used to implement the Obama administration  National Park Service rule that interferes with the State's wildlife  management authority on national preserved lands of Alaska.   Mr. Chairman, when we became a State, we were guaranteed to have  management of all Federal lands and State lands on fish and wildlife  management. Under the Obama administration, they tried to do  differently on the wildlife lands, and now they are trying to do it on  the BLM lands and the park preserves, not the parks themselves.   I suggest, respectfully, if you want to follow the law, you adopt  this amendment, as it should be, as is proposed, and we will be able to  manage lands we were guaranteed by this Congress to the State of  Alaska.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as he may  consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert), my good  chairman from the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as he may  consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert), my good  chairman from the Appropriations Committee.    You know, I rarely do this, but I'm deeply  disappointed in my good lady from Washington. * * *   This was a preserve, and we were guaranteed this in the Alaska  National Lands Act. No more. No more. And the State, under the  Constitution, has the right to manage fish and game.   Now, I know your side doesn't believe in State's rights. You don't; I  do. My job is to protect my State, not your State--my State.   And what you said a while ago was really nonsense. It was written by  an interest group, not yourself. Maybe  [[Page H7156]]  your staff is affiliated with the Humane Society or some other group,  and I'm disappointed.   My Native people support this amendment. You talk about natives.  Alaskans, our first Americans, support this amendment. And I really am  disturbed. * * *   I am still talking.    I didn't say ``damn.'' You said it.    I didn't say ``damn.'' You said it.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to  withdraw my offending words.   And to the gentlewoman, I do apologize. I get very defensive about my  State. We have gone through these battles for the last, actually, 45  years, and we are a State. I have my people to represent, as you do  yours. I do apologize for my statement. I recognize it was out of  order, so I hope you accept my apology.   The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman  from Alaska?    And I thank the gentlewoman.   The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the words are stricken from the  Record.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of my amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of my amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division A (before the short title) insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available under this Act       may be used to require changes to an existing placer mining       plan of operations with regard to reclamation activities,       including revegetation, or to modify the bond requirements       for the mining operation.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Alaska (Mr. Young) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alaska.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment, which was  successfully included in the House fiscal year 2007 Interior  appropriations bill, prohibits the funds to be used by the Bureau of  Land Management to change their existing placer mining plans of  operations with regard to environmental mitigation in Alaska.   Alaska is one of the very few places left in the United States where  placer mining is being still conducted. Unfortunately, unelected  bureaucrats have targeted these small mom-and-pop, usually retired  people, family miners from attaining unattainable regulations under the  falsehood of protecting the environment.   Mr. Chairman, this is a sound piece of legislation that should be  accepted by this committee and this body to make sure those people  elected participate in mining on lands that are old. This is a mining  area that has been mining for the last 100 years, yet the BLM has  decided they are going to take these little miners and put them out of  business.   Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of my amendment. It is very simple. It  protects the smaller people of America. Let them do what they wish to  do. Letting them have an activity after they retire I think is actually  important. As I said before, it was adopted before.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5  minutes.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I listened very carefully to what the  gentleman from Alaska had to say, and the bulk of my objection, Mr.  Chairman, is that this is better addressed in the Policy Committee than  on the Appropriations Committee as a rider.   BLM does many outreach activities, including public meetings and  interactions with individual miners, and is working with industry to  incorporate best management practices in new science-based reclamation  techniques.   In the course of the reclamation activities, it has been necessary to  increase the annual cost to miners to recover these streams and restore  ecostream function.   This amendment would prohibit the cost of reclaiming these areas to  placer miners who are profiting from mineral extractions on BLM managed  land.   I do hear the gentleman talking about not all business is the same  shape or size, so I really think that we should work through the Policy  Committee. For that reason, I object to this amendment, and I would  encourage the gentleman from Alaska to work through the Policy  Committee.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson).    Mr. Chairman, I, again, urge passage of the  amendment, and I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their  work.  [[Page H7157]]    This is a mom-and-pop operation. If I thought it was going to do  anything wrong--it has been mined for 100 years. They came in, they had  a guy in a wheelchair, and they made him walk to his mine because you  couldn't use a mechanized vehicle. Now, that is not good personnel.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).   The amendment was agreed to.                  Amendment No. 45 Offered by Mr. Westerman    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 45  printed in House Report 115-297.
