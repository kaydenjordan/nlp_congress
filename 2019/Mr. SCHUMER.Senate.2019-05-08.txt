 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I give my  remarks under leader time and that the vote occurs immediately after.    Madam President, I begin this morning with a heavy  heart, having heard of the abrupt passing of New York Times journalist  Robert Pear.   It just so happens that Robert lived on my floor in college during  freshman year. While everyone else in those days had long hair and wore  bell-bottoms, Robert had a flattop, was always studious, inquisitive,  polite, and very decent, earning him the nickname ``The Deacon.'' He  was the first to go into the library and the last to come out late at  night. The Deacon was different from most of us but earned all of our  respect.   Robert maintained the qualities of studiousness and inquisitiveness,  politeness and decency throughout his personal and professional life.  In my view, he represented the very best of America.   When Robert's byline appeared on a story--and so often, his stories  were on the front page, above the fold of the New York Times--the  reader knew the reporting would be both important and authoritative.   His death is a loss for journalism itself. I send my condolences to  his family in this moment of profound grief.
