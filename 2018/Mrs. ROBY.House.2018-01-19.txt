 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 694, I call up  the bill (H.R. 4712) to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit  a health care practitioner from failing to exercise the proper degree  of care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or attempted  abortion, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 694, the bill  is considered read.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4712         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(2) Any infant born alive after an abortion or within a       hospital, clinic, or other facility has the same claim to the       protection of the law that would arise for any newborn, or       for any person who comes to a hospital, clinic, or other       facility for screening and treatment or otherwise becomes a       patient within its care.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. Roby) and  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Alabama.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4712.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Alabama?   There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4712.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Alabama?   There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, the pro-life movement in Washington today  is so exciting. Forty-five years ago this month, the Supreme Court of  the United States ruled in Roe v. Wade to make abortion legal and  available nationwide.   While many abortion activists celebrate this anniversary, it  represents a particularly somber occasion for those of us who advocate  for life at all stages. Every year since this ruling, the pro-life  community has gathered in Washington to march in peaceful protest, and  that is exactly what brought thousands of passionate individuals here  today.   I would like to extend a very sincere thank-you to each and every  person who made this trip today to participate in the March for Life.  For those individuals, their dedication to the pro-life movement is  inspiring, and I and many of my colleagues stand with them.   I would especially like to recognize all of the individuals from my  home State of Alabama who made the 12- to 13-hour trip. I am proud to  have people like these Alabamians and others here to represent our  great State and our Nation in this pro-life movement.   I believe it is only fitting that we take action today here in the  House of Representatives to defend the defenseless as thousands of  Americans are here to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves.  I am proud to stand here today as a cosponsor of the legislation that  we are considering, H.R. 4712, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors  Protection Act.   I would also like to thank my colleague from Tennessee, Marsha  Blackburn, for her leadership on this legislation.   At this point, I don't think that it is a secret that I am  unapologetically pro-life, and I believe that our laws and our policies  should assign the utmost importance to every life at every stage. I  have been proud to stand here on the House floor many times in defense  of the unborn, but this time we aren't even talking about unborn  children. We are here to talk about those who have already been born.   The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is pretty simple. It  states that, if a baby is born alive after a failed abortion, he or she  must be given the same exact medical care that would be given to any  other baby.   I know we will continue to play politics about when life begins and  argue about the point at which the law should step in to protect it.  And while I understand that not everyone agrees with my strong pro-life  stance, I cannot fathom how any person could be opposed to legislation  that protects babies who are so alive that you can look them in the  eye.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), who is the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Tennessee (Mrs. Black).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Tennessee (Mrs. Black).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Smith), who has served a long time as the chairman of the  Pro-Life Caucus   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, in 2018, doctors routinely diagnose and treat  illnesses and disabilities suffered by the littlest patients: unborn  babies as well as newborns. They enhance both the child's health and  longevity.   Abortionists, on the other hand, take a far different approach. They  dismember and chemically poison children to death for profit.   For decades, babies have survived later term abortions. A  Philadelphia Inquirer story some thirty-seven years ago called baby  survival ``the dreaded complication.'' In other words, it is a  complication that a child survives.   I got involved in the pro-life movement when I read an AP story of a  child who survived a later term abortion. The abortion rights movement  then, in 1972, before Roe v. Wade--it was in New York--were apoplectic  about it because the baby survived. That should have been a reason for  rejoicing.   Dr. Willard Cates of the CDC was breathtakingly candid when he said:  ``Live births are little known because organized medicine, from fear of  public clamor and legal action, treats them more as an embarrassment to  be hushed up rather than a problem to be solved. It's like turning  yourself in to the IRS, he said. What is there to gain? The tendency is  not to report because there are only negative incentives.''   An undercover investigator asked an abortionist: What do you do? What  is your protocol when the child is born alive?   He said: ``I mean the key is, you need to pay attention to who's in  the room, right?''   That was what he was quoted as saying.   We are talking about coverup, ensuring that the people who are in the  abortion clinic all gag themselves and not speak to the truth of what  has happened when a baby has been killed after birth.   The legislation today requires a significant penalty for healthcare  practitioners present at the time the child survives the abortion,  exercise the same degree of skill, care, and diligence to preserve the  life and health of the child, and then get them to a hospital.   This is humane legislation. I urge my colleagues to support it.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I would just like to point out that it is not  currently Federal law, or the law in all 50 States, that a baby born  alive after a failed abortion receive medical treatment instead of  being left on the floor to die. That is why we are here today, to  require under Federal law nationwide that a baby born alive after a  failed abortion receives medical care and isn't left on the floor or in  a trash can to die.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Budd).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from North Carolina  an additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from North Carolina  an additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  South Dakota (Mrs. Noem).

Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Banks).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Madam Speaker, it is my honor to yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn), the lead sponsor of this  important bill, who has been such a fierce advocate for the unborn.                                time  1030     Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Of course, like so many of my colleagues, I support this measure, but  it feels really strange standing here today in defense of living,  breathing children, to have to make a case that a baby who survives an  abortion and is born into this world should be treated just like a baby  born any other way, but, unfortunately, we must.   There is currently no law mandating that a baby born alive after a  failed abortion receive medical treatment instead of being left to die.  That is why we are here, to require, under Federal law nationwide, that  a baby born alive after an abortion attempt receives the  [[Page H569]]  same care that any other baby would receive.   So finally my question, Madam Speaker, to those who would oppose such  a measure is this: How is the life of one baby any different or less  valuable than the life of another baby? How does anyone justify that?   I know that, as Members of Congress, part of our job is to debate  with each other about issues facing our Nation. I take that job  responsibility very seriously. I just don't believe this particular  issue is up for debate.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4712. I yield  back the balance of my time.   Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule  and the underlying bill. With this bill, the Majority has declared war  on the health and wellbeing of millions of women, rolling back women's  health care. The bill's inflammatory language is an insult to women and  the doctors who provide them with care.   This legislation is redundant, and would criminalize the work that  doctors do legally today. This would unnecessarily intimidate  healthcare providers like Planned Parenthood, who serve 2.4 million  Americans every year with lifesaving services like pap tests, breast  exams, and screenings for sexually transmitted infections. For many  low-income families, Planned Parenthood is their only option.   Family planning is a critical component of women's economic security.  Being able to determine when and how to have children has a direct  effect on a working woman's ability to chart their course in terms of  schooling, careers, and family. These decisions should be left to  women, their loved ones, and doctors.   This bill is spiteful, mean-spirited, and dangerous. It limits  women's healthcare choices and interferes with the patient doctor  relationship--in fact, the American Congress of Obstetricians and  Gynecologists call this legislation, and I quote ``a gross interference  in the practice of medicine.''   The Congress should not stop women from accessing care, and we  certainly should not be hindering a woman's ability to make her own  healthcare decisions. We ought to be protecting the rights of every  woman to make her own family planning decisions, and to have access to  a full range of healthcare services. I urge my colleagues to reject  this partisan, cruel bill.
