 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam  Speaker, I rise with a heavy heart to support this resolution.   When we came to Washington in 1961 to go on the Freedom Rides, we  chose that day. When we came here on August 28, 1963, for the March on  Washington, it was joyful. We met with a young President, President  John Fitzgerald Kennedy.   When we came here on August 6, 1965, for the signing of the Voting  Rights Act, we were excited and hopeful. We met with President Lyndon  Johnson.   But today, this day, we didn't ask for this. This is a sad day. It is  not a day of joy.   Our Nation is founded on the principle that we do not have kings. We  have Presidents, and the Constitution is our compass.   When you see something that is not right, not just, not fair, you  have a moral obligation to say something, to do something. Our children  and their children will ask us: What did you do? What did you say?   For some, this vote may be hard. But we have a mission and a mandate  to be on the right side of history.                                time  1630
