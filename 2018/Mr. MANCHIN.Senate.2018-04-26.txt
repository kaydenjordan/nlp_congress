 Madam President, in March 2016, we lost a young woman  with great potential named Jessica Grubb. Jessie was a great student, a  loving daughter and sister, and an avid runner. She was also recovering  from an opioid addiction.   When she had surgery for an infection related to a running injury,  her parents were there to take care of her, and both Jessie and her  parents told her doctors and hospital personnel that she was a  recovering addict and not to be prescribed opioids.   Unfortunately, Jessie's discharging physician did not see this note  in her chart, despite it being in there eight separate times. He did  not know that she was a recovering addict and sent her home with a  prescription for 50 oxycodone pills.   Her parents talked to her on the phone when she got home, but that  was the last time they talked to her. She had passed away that night in  her sleep. The temptation was too great for her, as it would be for so  many in recovery.   Her death was tragic, but preventable.   That is why I introduced Jessie's Law and why I fought to have it  included as part of the fiscal year 2018 omnibus appropriations bill.  The fiscal year 2018 LHHS Appropriations Subcommittee Senate Report,  which was signed into law, includes the following commonsense language  to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish best  practices for hospitals and physicians for sharing information about a  patient's past opioid addiction when that information is shared by the  patient with the healthcare provider: ``Opioid Medical Record  Reporting.--The Committee is deeply concerned about the devastating  impact that the opioid epidemic is having on families throughout the  country, and recognizes that medical providers must have access to  information about their patients' past opioid addiction if that  information is provided by the patient. The Committee encourages the  Secretary to develop and disseminate standards that would allow  hospitals and physicians to access the history of opioid addiction in  medical records (including electronic health records) of any patient  who has provided information about such addiction to a healthcare  provider.''   These standards will be created in honor of Jessica Grubb and will  help ensure that a patient's substance use disorder history is included  in a patient's record like any other life-threatening medical issue,  including a penicillin allergy.   This will help keep a tragedy like Jessie's death from ever happening  again by ensuring that, when individuals are open about their past  addiction, healthcare providers will have access to the information  that they need to provide medically appropriate care and save lives.                            ____________________
