 Madam President, I am pleased to join Senator Collins and  Senators Van Hollen, Cortez Masto, and Klobuchar in introducing  legislation that would permanently reauthorize the United States  Interagency Council on Homelessness, the Council or USICH.   The Council was established during the Reagan administration as part  of the landmark McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. Over  the last three and a half decades, it has brought Agencies from across  the Federal Government together to coordinate efforts to address  homelessness. In 2009, the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid  Transition to Housing, HEARTH, Act, which I authored along with Senator  Collins, expanded the Council's role, allowing it to work with public,  nonprofit and private stakeholders to develop a national strategic plan  to end homelessness. With a small budget and a small staff, the Council  has helped guide Federal, State, and local stakeholders in deploying  their resources in a smart, effective and coordinated fashion. The  results have been evident. In the decade after USICH published its  first plan, overall homelessness declined 9 percent. Family and  veterans homelessness declined significantly, as well, with the total  numbers dropping nearly 30 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In  fact, the Council has been able to help 83 communities and three States  effectively end veteran homelessness.   Even with this progress, homelessness has persisted, and we have  faced a growing challenge in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The  Department of Housing and Urban Development's 2022 Annual Homelessness  Assessment Report to Congress found that, on ``a single night in 2022,  roughly 582,500 people were experiencing homelessness in the United  States,'' while the majority of individuals experiencing homelessness  were living on the street or in other unsheltered locations and were  not in homeless shelters. The COVID-19 pandemic and its accompanying  economic effects have also pushed homelessness rates higher in many  parts of the country. Indeed, the number of individuals experiencing  homelessness increased in the majority of States between January 2020,  and 2022, including a staggering 48 percent jump in my home State of  Rhode Island.   USICH can help us meet this challenge by guiding how its 19 Federal  member Agencies deploy and leverage their resources with nonfederal  partners in order to help communities effectively address homelessness.  We know that smart, coordinated investments in programs that address  homelessness and increase affordable housing pay additional dividends.  According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, ``Based on 22  different studies from across the country, providing permanent  supportive housing to chronically homeless people creates net savings  of $4,800 per person per year, through reduced spending on jails,  hospitals, shelters, and other emergency services.'' In short, helping  people avoid homelessness not only helps them, it can also save  taxpayers money, and USICH helps make our investments to address  homelessness more informed and more effective.   Indeed, the Council continues to prove that the government can work  and save money in the process. That is why we should permanently  authorize USICH and why organizations like the National Low Income  Housing Coalition, the National Alliance to End Homelessness, the Rhode  Island Coalition to End Homelessness, and HousingWorks RI have  supported our bill. I urge our colleagues to join us in supporting this  legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mr. Warner):   S. 745. A bill to designate additions to the Rough Mountain  Wilderness and the Rich Hole Wilderness of the George Washington  National Forest, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.
