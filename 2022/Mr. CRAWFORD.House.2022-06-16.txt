 Mr. Speaker, I think the American people need to  understand two things. One, if you eat, you are involved in  agriculture. And, two, food security is national security. So, we keep  those things in mind as we have this conversation today. Everyone in  this room is involved in agriculture.   Despite that, we have before us today a bill that makes it more  difficult for our farmers and ranchers to carry out their primary  mission, which is to feed, clothe, and shelter 98 percent of the  population that is not engaged in agriculture. Two percent of Americans  provide for 100 percent of Americans and the rest of the world. This  bill doesn't truly address the challenges that they face every day.   Democrats would rather demonize producers in the private sector  instead of taking responsibility for the inflation that is changing the  lives of our  [[Page H5622]]  constituents every day everywhere in the country. Every day, our world  becomes more globalized and our economies become more interconnected.  As a result, the need for food security grows.   One day, Russia is weaponizing food in Ukraine, and the next day,  China is buying pieces of the American agriculture supply chain.   I have said it before and will say it again: Agriculture security is  national security, and we can no longer afford to stand by while our  adversaries exploit the supply chain and American food security  flounders under continued inflation inflicted by this administration.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 7606. For those of us who  represent rural constituents, this should be the easiest ``no'' vote  you ever make.
