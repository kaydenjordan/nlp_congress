 Madam Chair, let me thank Chair Lowey and the Speaker  for responding with urgency in bringing this legislation that I  support, H.R. 5687, to the floor to help the families of Puerto Rico  who are enduring, once again, another natural disaster.   Beginning on December 28, seismic activity began in Puerto Rico and  continued to escalate, including a 6.4 earthquake. These quakes and  ongoing quakes have destroyed homes, infrastructure, affected power  generation, and triggered blackouts across the island.   Close to 7,500 people have left their homes out of fear that they may  collapse, seeking shelter wherever they can find it.   Staff from the Natural Resources Committee investigated the damage  caused by the earthquakes on the southern coast of Puerto Rico. In a  committee report, we recommended high-priority actions, including  emergency funding, which H.R. 5687 represents.  [[Page H945]]    The administration's recent statement opposing H.R. 5687 shows total  disdain for the people of Puerto Rico. President Trump continues to lie  to the American people about the amount of Federal funding spent to  address natural disasters on the island.   The President and his administration have a responsibility to ensure  the people of Puerto Rico are treated as full Americans and not  colonized subjects. I hope that, at the National Prayer Breakfast,  there was some echo of understanding regarding the teachings of the  Good Samaritan, the compassion that we must have for other people, and  that those will motivate the House today to pass this bill and move it  forward. The disaster recovery funds that have been appropriated for  Puerto Rico need to be disbursed.   The people of Puerto Rico deserve much more. Our fellow Americans on  the island deserve to be treated as we have treated all Americans, from  Katrina to Sandy, with the same concern, the same support.   Madam Chair, I urge passage of the legislation.
