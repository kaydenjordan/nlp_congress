 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Graves for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, agricultural producers have been forced to operate their  businesses under three different definitions of water in the last 10  years, and this most recent rule removes longstanding bipartisan  exemptions for common water features like ponds and streams found on  family farms and other private property.   With this vote, Congress has a golden opportunity to stand up not  only for people who feed, fuel, and clothe us all, but also for all  Americans whose businesses and private lives will be affected by this  Big Government encroachment onto their property.   While President Biden would like to federally regulate every small  stream, ditch, and puddle from sea to shining  [[Page H1228]]  sea, American producers have been the careful custodians of their own  resources for centuries. They are the original conservationists, and  their livelihoods already depend on their voluntary efforts to care for  their water resources.   How we vote today will speak volumes. We can either tell Americans  that we believe the Federal Government knows best, or we can tell them  that the Federal Government should get out of their way and let them do  what they do best. I know where I stand.
