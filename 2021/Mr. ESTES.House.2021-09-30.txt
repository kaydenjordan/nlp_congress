 Madam Speaker, today I would like to honor one of the  finest men to ever come from the State of Kansas, Father Emil Joseph  Kapaun, or Kapaun, as he is frequently referred to in Kansas.   Father Kapaun, or Kapaun, who grew up on a farm in Kansas, was  ordained as a priest for the Wichita Diocese on June 9, 1940. He went  on to become a U.S. Army Chaplain during World War II and the Korean  war with the rank of captain.   Father Kapaun died in a North Korean prison camp on May 23, 1951, at  the age of 35. In 35 short years, Father Kapaun sacrificed more and  saved more lives and souls than many could ever hope to do in 100  years.   Many around the world rightly celebrate the story of Father Kapaun,  who is being considered for sainthood by the Catholic Church; a first  for a native Kansan.   His Medal of Honor citation gives a small glimpse at the deep  reservoir of Father Kapaun's bravery and honor. It reads:         Chaplain Kapaun calmly walked through withering enemy fire       in order to provide comfort and medical aid to his comrades       and rescue the wounded from no-man's-land.    After the battle, when given the option to escape to safety with his  unit, Father Kapaun volunteered to stay behind to care and minister to  the wounded. He was subsequently captured by the Communists and taken  to a prison camp where he was forced to march more than 60 miles in  harsh weather.   While in captivity, his frank, down-to-earth Kansas manner, along  with the unassuming farm style and dry wit, made him the servant leader  for all the POWs held by the Communists. Although greatly suffering  himself, he always put his needs second to others. His strength and  optimism allowed his  [[Page H5564]]  fellow GIs to once again believe that they would one day return to  freedom in America.   We know that Father Kapaun suffered unthinkable cruelty at the hands  of his prison guards who had a special hatred for Christians. But as  the many stories attest, their rage and violence did not deter Father  Kapaun in the slightest.   One of his fellow prisoners wrote a letter upon returning from Korea,  saying that, ``with his scraggly beard and his odd-looking woolen cap  made of the sleeve of an old GI sweater, pulled down over his ears, he  looked like any other half-starved prisoner.   ``But there was something in his voice and bearing that was  different--a dignity, a composure, a serenity that radiated from him  like a light. Wherever he stood was holy ground, and the spirit within  him a spirit of reverence and abiding faith went out to the silent,  listening men and gave them hope and courage and a sense of peace. By  his very presence, somehow, he could turn a stinking, louse-ridden mud  hut, for a little while, into a cathedral.''   Another passage from that letter reads that, as Father Kapaun spoke,  ``the agony in the garden, the road to Calvary, the Crucifixion, became  very real to us, who ourselves lived daily under the threat of death,  and who bore our own crosses of blows, and cold, and illness, and  starvation. But Christ endured, he told us, and we, too, must endure,  for the day of resurrection from the tomb of the prison camp would  surely come.''   For generations, Father Kapaun has inspired hundreds around the world  to greater faith and service through adversity. Today, I am proud that  Father Kapaun has returned home to his native Kansas. He is truly an  American hero of the first class.                            ____________________
