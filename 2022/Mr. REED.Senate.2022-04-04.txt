 Mr. President, today, I am joined by Senator Menendez in  introducing the Insider Trading Prohibition Act, a bill that will  finally define the offense of insider trading. This legislation is  desperately needed because, in the absence of a statutory definition,  the courts have cobbled together a dizzying array of interpretations of  anti-fraud statutes, creating what is an inconsistent and complicated  body of common law for deciding insider trading cases. What should be  simple has become unnecessarily complex.   Indeed, Judge Jed Rakoff, who has presided over many insider trading  cases before the Southern District of New York, wrote in a recent  opinion that ``the crime of insider trading is a straightforward  concept that some courts have somehow managed to complicate.''   Consider the following hypothetical example. A financial analyst  receives information about XYZ Corporation's earnings from a company  insider, like an executive or board member, before this information is  publicly released. The analyst then shares this inside information with  her portfolio manager who subsequently trades in XYZ stock. I suspect  most Americans would agree that the portfolio manager was given an  unfair advantage. But the courts are not so sure. They have left an  open question whether this very trade would constitute illegal insider  trading. Experts agree that this kind of judicial uncertainty is one  reason among many of why Congress must clarify the law of insider  trading.   Former SEC Commissioner Robert J. Jackson and former U.S. Attorney  Preet Bharara have written that ``[t]he shoddy state of American  insider-trading law affects everyone. Prosecutors  [[Page S1938]]  and regulators are stuck enforcing laws that are ill-suited to 21st- century misconduct. Lawyers struggle to tell their clients what they  can and cannot do within the bounds of the law. And ordinary Americans  are left asking whether financial markets are stacked in favor of those  who skirt the rules.''   Columbia Law School Professor John C. Coffee, Jr., noted that  ``[t]here is general agreement today that the law of insider trading  has grown overly complex and technical. As a result, it is hard for the  public to understand its logic or for practitioners to give advice with  respect to the scope of the prohibition. Moreover, to the extent that  insider trading is judge-made law, disparities and inconsistencies  among the U.S. circuit courts becomes inevitable because there is  little in the way of a definitive statutory text to provide precise  guidance.''   State regulators agree, too. For example, Maryland Commissioner of  Securities Melanie Senter Lubin recently stated on behalf of the North  American Securities Administrators Association that ``[d]efining the  standards for insider trading liability by statute would add greater  clarity and consistency to this important area of the law.''   This is precisely what Senator Menendez and I are doing in our bill.  We are seeking to finally distill the offense of insider trading to  clear bright line rules. Simply put, if a person trades a security on  the basis of information that the person is aware is material and  nonpublic and is aware was wrongfully obtained, then that person has  engaged in unlawful insider trading.   Under our legislation, insider trading would be prohibited if a  trader knows or has reason to know that her information was wrongfully  obtained, for example, through theft, bribery, hacking,  misappropriation, or a breach of a fiduciary duty for a personal  benefit. We do not intend to restrict those who take the time to  independently develop their own information from publicly available  sources from trading on the independently developed information.   By cracking down on those who rig securities markets to favor the  well connected, our legislation provides everyday investors with a fair  shot at seeing some returns after investing their hard-earned savings.  Incidents of insider trading, and the perceived pervasiveness of the  practice, have for years served to validate the public's worst  assumptions about Wall Street culture. It is time we clearly define  what is appropriate under the law and take this meaningful step towards  improving the integrity of our securities markets for professional  traders and retail investors alike.   I would like to thank Senator Menendez for working with me on this  legislation, and I urge our colleagues to join us in supporting the  Insider Trading Prohibition Act.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, I am joined by Senator Menendez in  introducing the Insider Trading Prohibition Act, a bill that will  finally define the offense of insider trading.
