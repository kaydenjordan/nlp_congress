 Mr. President, our Nation recently celebrated Veterans  Day, one of the most sacred days on our national calendar. Across the  land, grateful Americans paid tribute to the brave men and women who  have defended our freedom throughout our history.   Today, nearly 20 million Americans hold the title of veteran. That  includes almost 110,000 men and women in my State of Maine, one of the  highest percentages in the country. It is estimated that some 48  million patriots have served in uniform since our Nation's founding.  Among them is a very special group of more than 3,500 heroes who have  received the Medal of Honor, the highest award for valor in action.  Although more than 160 years have passed since the medal's inception,  its foundation of courage and sacrifice have remained constant.   More than 100 Mainers have earned the Medal of Honor. In observation  of Memorial Day last May, Emily Burnham of the ``Bangor Daily News''  authored a fascinating story profiling four of them. I am delighted to  insert her inspiring story into the Congressional Record and to recap  briefly the heroism she described.   Early in the Civil War, fisherman Andrew Tozier enlisted in the 2nd  Maine Infantry. He was wounded at the Battle of Gaines Mill in Virginia  and captured. After being released by the Confederates, he joined the  20th Maine Infantry Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Joshua  Chamberlain.   At Gettysburg, he was the Regiment's color bearer. During the  decisive stand Chamberlain led at Little Round Top, Sergeant Tozier  stood at the center of the regiment with the regimental flag tucked in  his right elbow while he used the rifle of a wounded member of the  color guard to return fire on the attacking Confederates in defense of  his comrades.   After the war, Mr. Tozier was adrift and fell into a life of crime,  stealing cattle and other property. When he was arrested, Chamberlain,  then Governor of Maine, took Mr. Tozier and his wife into his home and  helped him turn his life around. In addition, Gov. Chamberlain, a Medal  of Honor recipient himself, recommended Andew Tozier for the medal for  his bravery at Little Round Top. Veterans helping fellow veterans  remains an American tradition.   Before World War II, Edward Dahlgren worked as a seed potato  inspector in Maine's Aroostook County. He enlisted in the Army in 1943  and served with the 36th Infantry Division. On February 11, 1945, in  France, Sergeant Dahlgren led the rescue of a unit surrounded by German  forces, repeatedly attacking enemy positions alone and capturing nearly  40 prisoners. His Medal of Honor citation credits his ``bold leadership  and magnificent courage'' for repulsing an enemy attack and saving an  American platoon from great danger.   Charles Loring of Portland distinguished himself in both World War II  and the Korean war. In 1942, he enlisted in the Army Air Forces and  flew 55 combat missions as a fighter pilot. In December of 1944, he was  shot down over Belgium and spent 6 months as a prisoner of war.   Major Loring returned to combat duty in 1952, flying an F-80 jet  fighter in Korea. Leading a patrol on November 22 of that year, he  spotted a concentration of enemy artillery that was pinning down UN  ground troops. As Loring began his bombing run, his plane was severely  damaged by anti-aircraft fire. Rather than abort his mission and leave  the ground troops in danger, Loring dove his damaged aircraft into the  enemy position. He was killed instantly, but his action resulted in the  complete destruction of the threat. When Major Loring's widow was  presented the posthumous Medal of Honor by President Eisenhower on May  9, 1954, it was announced that the new Air Force base in Limestone, ME,  would bear his name.   Gary Gordon grew up in Lincoln, ME. After graduating from his school  in 1978, he enlisted in the Army and later volunteered for the elite  Delta Force unit. On October 3, 1993, while serving in a peacekeeping  mission in Mogadishu, Somalia, Master Sergeant Gordon and fellow sniper  1SG Sergeant Randy Shughart took action to rescue the crews of two  Black Hawk helicopters that had been shot down by Somali gunfire.   Heavily outnumbered and outgunned, Gordon and Shughart fought their  way to the first helicopter, pulled the crew from the wreckage, and  defended their position until they ran out of ammunition. Both gave  their lives defending their fellow soldiers, and both received the  Medal of Honor.   Their extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are immortalized in  the book and movie ``Black Hawk Down.'' Last year, I had the privilege  to join in the dedication of a memorial to Master Sergeant Gordon in  his hometown of Lincoln.   Although separated by many years and theaters of combat, these four  share the common bond of uncommon valor. They are powerful reminders  that our Nation has been blessed throughout our history by ordinary  citizens who possess the character and the strength to do extraordinary  things.  [[Page S6659]]    Veterans Day is a meaningful observance throughout America. Nowhere  did Veterans Day 2022 have more meaning than in the small Maine town of  New Vineyard. That is when Army Air Forces Sergeant Zelwood Gravlin  returned home for burial 79 years after he perished in the skies over  German-controlled Romania during World War II.   Sergeant Gravlin was a gunner on the B-24 Liberator bomber ``Four  Eyes'' that was shot down on August 1, 1943, during Operation Tidal  Wave that targeted the Romanian oil refineries that fueled the Nazi war  machine. Fifty-one of the 177 B-24s on that harrowing raid did not  return.   The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency began exhuming unknown remains  associated with Operation Tidal Wave in 2017. One set of remains, which  were first interred in a Romanian cemetery and then at an American  Military Cemetery in Belgium, were positively identified as Sergeant  Gravlin's in July.   This remarkable event underscores the commitment of the American  people that the men and women who serve our country will always be  honored and, no matter how many years pass, they will never be  forgotten. May God bless our veterans and may God bless America.   I ask unanimous consent that the ``Bangor Daily News'' story by Emily  Burnham be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                        [From the Bangor Daily News]  These 4 Medal of Honor Recipients From Maine Set Themselves Apart With                               Their Bravery                             (By Emily Burnham)         More than 100 Mainers have been awarded the Medal of Honor,       the U.S. govermnent's highest honor for military members. Of       those Mainers, each one has an amazing story of bravery and       valor, each important to know and be inspired by.        These are the stories of four of those courageous Mainers,       who distinguished themselves on the battlefield for the sake       of their fellow soldiers and their country--and in some cases       made the ultimate sacrifice.                               Andrew J. Tozier         Of the Mainers awarded Medals of Honor for their bravery       during the Civil War, few have a post-war story that's nearly       as remarkable as the story of their battlefield gallantry,       but Andrew Tozier is one such person.        Born in Monmouth, Tozier escaped an abusive father to first       become a sailor. At age 23, not long after the Civil War       began, he enlisted in the 2nd Maine Infantry Regiment. He was       injured and captured at the Battle of Gaines Mill in Virginia       in 1862, but after being released by Confederate forces he       joined Company I of the 20th Maine in 1863.        At Gettysburg, he was the color bearer for his regiment,       and on Little Round Top he defended his fellow soldiers       alone, a feat of bravery for which, decades later, his       commander, Brig. Gen. Joshua Chamberlain, recommended he be       awarded the Medal of Honor--and he was, in 1898, when he was       60.        After the war, Tozier spent nearly five years as a       criminal, stealing cattle and other property in towns across       Maine. He had a powerful ally when he was finally arrested:       Chamberlain, who by then was Maine's governor. Chamberlain       pardoned Tozier, and invited him to live at his house in an       effort to get Tozier to clean up his act. Tozier spent the       rest of his life working as a fisherman, dairy farmer and       factory worker.        Tozier was portrayed by Maine actor Herb Mitchell in the       movie ``Gettysburg,'' and his story was told in the song       ``Ballad of the 20th Maine'' by Maine band the Ghost of Paul       Revere.                           Edward Dahlgren, Caribou         Aroostook County native Edward Dahlgren lived most of his       life quietly in the town of Blaine, working as a seed potato       inspector for the state. But during World War II, he was       personally responsible for keeping an American platoon out of       danger during an enemy counterattack in Oberhoffen, France,       and capturing about 40 German soldiers during the skirmish on       Feb. 11, 1945--just a few months before the war ended in       Europe.        That action earned him the Medal of Honor, presented to him       by President Harry S. Truman. When he was awarded it, he was       the only living Maine Medal of Honor winner after the Civil       War. Lt. Dahlgren lived in Maine for the rest of his life,       and a hall at the former Loring Air Force Base was named for       him, as was a street in Caribou. He died in 2006 at age 90.                           Charles Loring, Portland         Few military members serve in two wars--let alone       distinguish themselves in both the way Portland native       Charles Loring did. A few years after graduating from       Cheverus High School, in 1942, Loring enlisted in the U.S.       Army Air Force and received training as a fighter pilot. He       would spend the next two years flying missions in both North       America and, eventually, on the European front. By December       1944, he'd flown 55 combat missions.        On Dec. 24, 1944, Loring was shot down in Belgium, and       spent the next six months as a Nazi prisoner of war. He was       liberated three days before the war in Europe ended on May 8,       1945.        Loring's actions that garnered him the Medal of Honor came       seven years later when, after years training other pilots, he       returned to combat duty in July 1952 as a jet fighter pilot       during the Korean War. On Nov. 22 of that year, while leading       a flight patrol near the 38th parallel, Loring spotted       Chinese artillery that was pinning down American ground       troops nearby. The Chinese crews fired on Loring's aircraft       and damaged it, but rather than abort the mission, Loring       turned off his radio and dive bombed the artillery,       eliminating the threat. He died on impact, and his body was       never found.        On May 9, 1954, Loring's widow received the Medal of Honor       from President Dwight Eisenhower. On the same day, it was       announced that the newly built Air Force base in Limestone       would be named for him--Loring Air Force Base, which operated       until 1994.                             Gary Gordon, Lincoln         Master Sgt. Gary Gordon, a native of Lincoln and graduate       of Mattanawcook Academy, joined the Army straight out of high       school, eventually joining the elite 1st Special Forces       Operational Detachment-Delta, or Delta Force.        In 1993, he was posted as part of a peacekeeping mission in       Mogadishu, Somalia, and on Oct. 3 of that year went in with       his fellow sniper Randy Shughart to protect the crews of two       Black Hawk helicopters that had been shot down by Somali       gunfire during the Battle of Mogadishu, made famous by the       book and film ``Black Hawk Down.''        During the battle, Gordon urged his superiors to let him       get on the ground to protect the crew of the downed       helicopters from Somali soldiers. Shughart and Gordon alone       pulled the crew from the helicopters and defended their       position until they ran out of ammunition. Both died       defending their fellow soldiers.        Gordon and Shughart were awarded the Medal of Honor, the       first awardees since the war in Vietnam. Gordon's widow,       Carmen, was presented with the medal in 1994 by President       Bill Clinton, and in 1996, the USNS Gordon was named for him.       Last year, a statue of Gordon was unveiled in his hometown of       Lincoln, and this year, Maine lawmakers advocated for naming       a Maine-built Navy destroyer after him.                            ____________________
