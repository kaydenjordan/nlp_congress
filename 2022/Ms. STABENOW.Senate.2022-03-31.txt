 Will the Senator yield?    Madam President, I thank Senator Thune and Senator  Klobuchar. I know that the chair of the Commerce Committee is coming  down to speak.   I just wanted to say congratulations. Thank you for your wonderful  leadership on this. Obviously, with my hat on as chair of the  Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, this is a big deal, as  they would say. This is a very big deal to, certainly, all of our  growers in Michigan but, I know, across the country.   So thank you for your great bipartisan work, and hopefully, we can  get this all the way across the finish line. I know the President is  anxious to sign it.    Madam President, before I give my remarks, I want to  give a shout-out again to our great leader, the chair of the Commerce  Committee, Senator Cantwell. I don't know if this is a record, but  Senator Cantwell moved this bill so fast through the committee, it is  amazing. It is just building on the great work of the committee with  the Innovation and Competition Act and so on.   Again, on behalf of all the farmers in Michigan and across the  country, this is really important legislation.   (The remarks of Ms. Stabenow pertaining to the introduction of S.  3979 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced  Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')   Ms. STABENOW I yield the floor.    Mr. President, as the pandemic began, Congress, on a  bipartisan basis, made sure our schools and our summer meal programs  had easy-to-use flexibilities so they could continue to feed hungry  children who were no longer physically in school or no longer able to  go to a meal site in the summer because of COVID.   All across America now, because of a lot of hard work on a lot of  people's part, our kids are now back in school, which is great. But 90  percent of our schools are still struggling to provide children healthy  food as a result of higher food prices, less available staff, and more  supply chain delays and shortages that we know about all the time. In  fact, part of that relates to this bill which was just passed on  shipping. This is part of the supply chain breakdown that has affected  the ability for our schools to be able to get what they need for our  children.   We have 90 percent--all this in red, across the country--of the  States saying: We need these flexibilities that have been in place from  the very beginning of COVID. We extended the flexibilities before, and  they need them to continue to be able to feed children in our country.  School cafeterias, summer meal providers--everybody is working as hard  as they can to get back to normal, but they need time to transition so  our children aren't hurt in the process. The USDA, school  administrators, local mayors, even school food suppliers themselves  have said they need these flexibilities to continue for another year.   Back in January, the Agricultural Secretary, Secretary Vilsack,  called on Congress to once again extend what we call the nutrition  waivers so that schools and meal providers had the flexibility they  need to feed hungry children who may have their only meal at school or  their only breakfast or their only lunch at school or, in the summer,  through the feeding programs.   We have been working in good faith, as we always do, across the aisle  to make this extension happens. We were working on having that happen  as part of the omnibus. It was a real shock to me and to many of the  Senators who care deeply about our children when Republican Leader  McConnell refused to agree to extending the school nutrition  flexibilities as part of the omnibus bill that we just passed, that we  know was critically important to pass. We don't want the government to  shut down. We had essential, critical resources for Ukraine and so many  other issues. But our kids were left behind in this one, and it is not  right. We need to fix it.   We are in a critical transition period right now, but we are not out  of the pandemic yet. Without having these flexibilities extended,  without this support, up to 30 million children who get their food,  their only healthy meals at school will see their breakfast and lunch  disrupted, and that makes absolutely no sense. Millions of kids will  show up at their summer meal program this July and could very well see  a ``closed'' sign.   That is why, today, Senator Lisa Murkowski and I are introducing the  Support Kids Not Red Tape Act, along with Senator Collins and all 50  Members of our Democratic caucus.   Let me stress that this is a temporary extension with a clear end  date and a lot of procedures put in place to safely get schools and  summer meal programs back to normal operations. We want to give them  time to transition.   I am so grateful for our colleagues' support--52 colleagues. We only  need eight more. We only need eight more Republicans to join us to get  this done right away, just like we did the shipping bill.   Our schools need time. Our kids need time right now rather than  having this abruptly end June 30, which is not very far away. So let's  be clear. To abruptly pull the lunch tray away from hungry kids at the  end of June is just plain wrong.   Since the pandemic started in March 2020, food insecurity for  families and their children has jumped by nearly two-thirds. We all  know the stories. We have all seen the lines. People across the country  are engaging to support each other. One in five kids comes to school  hungry, and school and summer programs may be the only meal that they  get. During the pandemic, it was even worse. Now, because of all the  challenges continuing, we are not out of the woods on this yet in terms  of feeding our children.   How have these flexibilities helped our children be able to get  healthy meals? One example is in Rapid City, SD, where the local school  district has partnered with Meals on Wheels in the summer to deliver  meals to where the kids are. It makes sense. This has been a lifesaver  for hungry children in their rural communities who had no way to get to  the one school meal site that was miles and miles away.   In Arkansas, the food insecurity rate among children skyrocketed to  over 32 percent during the pandemic, 32 percent of the children being  food insecure, not being able to have a healthy meal.   Fayetteville and Bentonville schools' summer meals programs have  provided weekly meal pack pickups with a week's worth of breakfast and  lunch. So rather than a parent who is working trying to figure out, how  do I get my child to a place to get a healthy breakfast, and by the  way, I may have to take them back again for a healthy lunch--by the  way, in the rural community, there is not a lot of public  transportation. It certainly affects everyone in urban areas, suburban  areas, and rural areas, but the distances in rural communities are an  extra burden oftentimes. So they put together the capacity to do a  week's worth. Those were the flexibilities we gave them that we want to  continue.   In Edgecombe County, NC, resourceful schools found a way to get meals  to 100 kids during the summer by using  [[Page S1913]]  the schoolbus. The schoolbus wasn't being used, so they put the food on  a schoolbus and went out to the neighborhoods, out to the kids.   As a result of these flexibilities, twice as many kids got summer  meals during the pandemic, which is something we also need to learn  from. Just as we have learned the importance of high-speed internet  after the pandemic, and we have addressed that, which is great, we have  now learned that we need to rethink some of these things here, in terms  of the flexibilities for our schools and how we deliver summer meals,  how we address schools during the school year.   So it goes to show you what a big difference it makes for hungry kids  when we don't make them or their families or their meal providers jump  through all kinds of hoops to get something as basic as a healthy meal.   In schools across Kentucky, from smalltown Madison County to  metropolis Jefferson County, these flexibilities have kept kids from  getting caught in the redtape and going hungry if their struggling  parent just missed one piece of paper on a form.   It has been a relief to school food service directors in small towns  who are already working with half the staff, twice the stress of  putting together healthy meals with all the food and supply chain  shortages we have talked about.   Right now, school food service directors in Utah are placing orders  for next year, knowing that many of the items they need are currently  not available and the ones they can find have doubled in price.   The flexibilities and increased funding to deal with these costs--the  things we have given them to deal with this--have made it possible to  make substitutions when basic items like ground beef are not available  or fruit is not available, to be able to put together something healthy  in a different way.   Losing these flexibilities will cut their budgets by 40 percent and  force meal providers to make pretty dire choices on which children to  feed and how schools are going to pay for it.   Without our bill to support kids and cut redtape, all of these  desperately needed flexibilities are going to go away at the end of  June. They are just going to go away--all the support for schools, all  the support for children, all the new creative things that have been  able to be done to help children get healthy meals, done.   School meals, summer programs will have to scale back. Some will have  to stop feeding kids altogether. Children will once again go hungry  because of paperwork and bureaucracy outside of their control. I mean,  you think about this: Are we on the side of bureaucracy or are we on  the side of kids?   This legislation is on the side of kids. My colleagues supporting  this bill and sponsoring this are on the side of kids, not redtape.   The unnecessary stress is going to be felt by families in every part  of our country, from small towns to big cities, to suburban areas. So  our bill gives us a clear, easy path forward to make sure children and  to make sure schools have the time and the support they need to get  back on their feet as we recover from the pandemic and to be able to  plan for how this phases out. Schools across the country are telling us  that these flexibilities are critical to continuing--absolutely  critical.   So it is time for us to listen to them and to do the right thing for  our children. I urge my colleagues to pass the Support Kids Not Red  Tape Act as soon as possible.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as the pandemic began, Congress, on a  bipartisan basis, made sure our schools and our summer meal programs  had easy-to-use flexibilities so they could continue to feed hungry  children who were no longer physically in school or no longer able to  go to a meal site in the summer because of COVID.
