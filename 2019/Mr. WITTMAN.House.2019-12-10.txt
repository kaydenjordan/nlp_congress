 I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for his stout and  devout effort to highlight the differences between socialism and  capitalism.   Just as you have heard, this really is a stark difference. It really  is about what was this Nation founded upon. What was it that our  Founding Fathers had in mind that was so important to who we are? What  were they doing to escape other systems of government to come here to  create what has been and will continue to be the most accommodating and  perfect form of government ever created? And why has it survived longer  than any other form of government?   It is because it highlights and allows the human spirit to prevail in  all situations. And if you look at just what the definition of  socialism is, it does, I think--for anybody out there who looks at  this--it does give them pause.   If you look at Merriam-Webster, the definition of socialism is: ``Any  of various economic and political theories advocating collective or  governmental ownership and administration of the means of production  and distribution of goods.''   So rather than an individual saying: Hey, listen, I have got an idea.  I am willing to risk my resources. I am willing to put everything I  have into this to succeed under a system of capitalism. Under a system  of socialism it would be: No, no, no, sorry. The government is going to  be in control of this, and if the government sees this as a good thing,  then it will allow it to go forward.   Another definition: ``A system of society or group living in which  there is no private property.''   Think about that. I want everybody out there to think about this,  millennials and otherwise, a system where there is no private property.   Think about what your life would be if there were no private  property--your home, your automobile, all this idea of collectivism is  the underpinnings of socialism.  [[Page H10009]]    Another definition: ``A system or condition of society in which the  means of production are owned and controlled by the State.''   So if you have a business and you are very good at what you do, just  as Mr. Johnson pointed out, that business in Louisiana that the man was  very good at building a company that met the needs of folks that needed  building supplies. Sorry, if it is under socialism, the production  there at that company is going to be controlled and owned by the State.   Now, think about that. Think about those elements and what has made  this Nation great. This Nation has not been made great by having things  under government control. It is the innovation, it is the creation, it  is the willingness to take risks by individuals across this Nation that  have provided for the Nation we are today, and I believe it is the  greatest provider of human needs. In fact, our system of capitalism  which operates in a free market system, in what we know as the free  enterprise system, is the most productive supplier of human needs and  economic justice.    You hear a lot today about economic justice. Oh, my gosh, there has  to be economic justice. Economic justice is provided by the will and  creativity of individuals in being able to pursue what falls within  their realm of talents. How can they take what they have as  individuals, whether it is resources or talents and make the most of  those? That is what has made our Nation great. That is the system of  government that beyond all others has shown through history to be  extraordinarily successful.   It has made us the Nation we are today. And it is our job as  legislators to point that out, to make sure we enable this system of  government to do even more. We look at our economy today, and we  understand that government needs to get out of the way. Government  needs to be an enabler, government needs to make sure that we allow for  the creativity and innovation that again makes this Nation great. It is  our job to encourage those businesses to thrive instead of subjecting  them to additional regulations.   You know the element of deregulation has been phenomenal. And if you  talk to businesses today, they love it because they say, Listen, you  unleash that entrepreneurial spirit. You unleash the willingness for us  to take a risk. You unleash us being innovators and creators and doing  things that otherwise wouldn't be possible under a system of socialism.   We just saw here recently the jobs report. We have a record  unemployment rate being at record low levels. We look at employment in  all sectors of our society being at record highs. We look at wage  growth increasing--all of those things happening under our system of  free enterprise.   I will go to Virginia and look at what is happening in Virginia.  Virginia was named as one of the top places to do business in 2019, and  it is because the State legislature has enabled businesses to prosper.                                time  1830    They have created the right mix of leveling the playing field through  regulation for businesses, not being over regulatory but making sure  that we create a fair and level playing field. That is, indeed, the  role of government.   That will not happen under a system of socialism where a government  is in complete control. That is counter to what made our Nation great.   We know that the proposals being made by the other side that espouse  these elements and underpinnings of socialism include things like  Medicare for All, which is a taxpayer-funded, government-run healthcare  system that, by conservative estimate, would cost tens of trillions of  dollars and would force 158 million Americans off their private or  employer-based healthcare plans.   As I talked to folks, they said, ``Listen, give me the choice. I want  that individual liberty and freedom,'' that which comes to them under  our Constitution. They want to be able to choose. They don't want the  government in control. Yet, under socialism, the government is in  control.   Other measures that include the Green New Deal and a plan to require  taxpayers to subsidize Federal elections put the government in control,  the government in the driver's seat.   So, the ability to self-determine, the ability to say, ``Listen,  there are some things that I can do if the government would just make  sure that, in the regulatory realm, they level the playing field, make  sure they don't take too much of what I earn in order to run the  government,'' so that they can, indeed, be successful.   Those are the underpinnings of a successful government, a successful  system of free enterprise, a system of capitalism that provides for the  needs of citizens of our Nation.   The Green New Deal would dictate what Americans can eat and where  they can travel and how they can power their homes and what they can do  to make a living and what they can buy and so much more. It controls  that.   Again, the idea under the Green New Deal is the government is in  control.   Let me tell you, if we are going to be a nation where we have energy  independence, where we look at having cleaner air, where we look at  making sure that we do things that are environmentally responsible, it  is unleashing the innovation and creation that comes to us under a  system of free enterprise that will do more than, I argue, any  government-dictated system.   So the Green New Deal, saying government is going to mandate this and  mandate that, actually, I think, takes us longer to get to the place  where we need to be to make sure that our environment is clean and we  are doing the best job possible in using our energy resources.   In total, the cost to the taxpayer is unbelievable: $93 trillion, or  $600,000 per family, across the Nation. That is not the highest and  best provider of human needs, and I understand human needs.   Socialism threatens to destroy the very foundation of our great  Republic, the foundation that men and women, since our birth, have  fought and died for, that idea. That idea that has made our Nation  great and will continue to make our Nation great is an idea about  individual liberties and freedoms, that is, unleashing the power of  individuals to pursue their dreams, to take their innovative and  creative skills and do more.   And they have made this Nation what it is today. It is through this  capitalist idea of limited government, of limited regulation, of  unlimited opportunity that creates economic prosperity.   As all of us look at where this Nation goes, we ought to be looking  at enabling individuals, and the system of capitalism does that.   Our Constitution, the greatest governing document ever put together,  is the roadmap for that continued greatness. You won't find anywhere in  the Declaration of Independence, anywhere in our U.S. Constitution any  mention of any principle of socialism.   You will find throughout that, though, preserving individual  liberties and freedoms, making sure that we are meeting the needs of  individuals and making sure the government is there to protect those  individual liberties and freedoms that we received from our Creator.   That is what has made our Nation great. That is what will continue to  make it great. That is what we all need to make sure that we  communicate so that we can continue what is and will continue to be the  greatest Nation the world has ever known.   I thank Mr. Barr so much for the opportunity this evening to speak  about what truly is a contrast between the principles of our Republic  that operates within a democracy, that system of capitalism versus  socialism, and why we know it has made and will continue to make this  Nation great.
