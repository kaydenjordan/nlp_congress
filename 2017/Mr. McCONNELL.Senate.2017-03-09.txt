 Mr. President, this week, the House unveiled its plan  to repeal and replace ObamaCare and began consideration through the  committee process. It is an important step toward keeping our promise  to the American people. It not only repeals and replaces ObamaCare, it  includes the most significant entitlement reform in a generation and  provides needed tax relief to American families as well as healthcare  consumers.   Here in the Senate, we can take another critical step toward  stabilizing the healthcare market with consideration of the nominee to  lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, more commonly  known as CMS. We have the opportunity today to advance an extremely  qualified nominee to oversee some of our Nation's most important  healthcare programs.   Seema Verma has a deep health policy background. She is a reformer  with a proven record of success. Not only does she have an unparalleled  grasp of the complex fiscal and policy challenges facing the agencies  she will be charged with overseeing, she also understands the States  and consumers she will be serving.   She will be the first to tell you that the sooner we can fulfill our  promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare, the sooner CMS can get out of  the ObamaCare business and back into the Medicare and Medicaid  business. She understands that ObamaCare's raiding of Medicare was  wrong, and her experience in developing creative solutions will help  protect Medicare for generations to come. She knows the burdens that  ObamaCare placed on State Medicaid Programs remain unsustainable, and  her experience in reforming and modernizing State-level Medicaid  Programs will help lower the staggering costs that the Obama  administration shifted onto the States.   Medicaid expansion has been devastating to Kentucky's State budget,  costing Kentucky taxpayers nearly $74 million this year. That is more  than double the amount originally projected. Even worse, we have seen  little improvement in health outcomes. The current system is too  expensive and fails to address the real health problems in Kentucky.   Ms. Verma has been instrumental in helping States like mine navigate  these incredibly difficult challenges. The proposed Medicaid waiver she  helped craft for Kentucky, along with our Governor, if approved, is  expected to ensure quality care for those who need it while saving  Kentucky taxpayers more than $360 million. So her expertise is going to  be invaluable as we continue fulfilling our promise to the American  people.   As we move to repeal and replace the unworkable, partisan ObamaCare  law and return authority to the States, my hope is that Ms. Verma will  be able to focus more time and attention than her recent predecessors  to the core functions--the core functions--of the agency, which are  strengthening Medicare and Medicaid. She is particularly well qualified  to lead this agency. She has a proven record of success. She has the  skill and the drive to make positive reforms too. I can hardly think of  anyone better for the job.   I urge colleagues to join me in voting to advance her nomination  later today.  [[Page S1704]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, since his nomination to the Supreme  Court was announced, Judge Neil Gorsuch has received extensive praise  from former colleagues, the legal community, and editorial boards,  among many others. It is praise that has come from across the political  spectrum. Even many on the left can't help but compliment Judge  Gorsuch's credentials, including former President Obama's own legal  mentor, who called him ``brilliant,'' and his former acting solicitor  general, who applauded Gorsuch's ``fairness and decency.''   This week we add to that lengthy list of supporters more than 150 of  Judge Gorsuch's former classmates at Columbia University. As they note,  these alumni have followed an array of postgraduate pursuits: They are  CEOs and stay-at-home parents, professors and lawyers, entrepreneurs  and scientists. They come from different socioeconomic and ethnic  backgrounds, practice different faiths, reside in different parts of  our country, and hold very diverse political views.   Even so, each of these Columbia grads can agree on at least one  thing: Neil Gorsuch's fitness to serve on the Supreme Court. Let me  share the letter they just sent to the Judiciary Committee:         At Columbia, Neil Gorsuch notably distinguished himself       among his peers. He was a serious and brilliant student who       earned deep respect from teachers and students alike. With an       encyclopedic knowledge on a staggering array of subjects, he       could be counted on for his insightful, logical and well-      reasoned comments. He carried a full and challenging course-      load, finishing in three years and graduating Phi Beta Kappa.    The letter continues:         The hallmark of Neil Gorsuch's tenure at Columbia was his       unflagging commitment to respectful and open dialogue on       campus.        Despite an often contentious environment, Neil was a       steadfast believer that we could disagree without being       disagreeable. To be sure, he could deliver a devastating       argument, laden with carefully researched facts and presented       in a crisp and organized manner. Yet he was always a       thoughtful and fair-minded listener who would not hesitate to       re-evaluate his own beliefs when presented with persuasive       arguments. His amiable nature, good humor and respect for       differing viewpoints was admired and appreciated by all.    So it was clear even years ago that the ``intellect, academic record,  and character'' of their classmate Neil Gorsuch was ``so special''-- ``so special'' that ``there was a shared sense that he was poised for a  meaningful and purposeful future.''   How right they were. Neil Gorsuch is exceptionally qualified to serve  on the Supreme Court. He has, as I just noted, an ``encyclopedic  knowledge on a staggering array of subjects . . . with insightful,  logical and well-reasoned comments.'' He is a ``humble man with no  appetite for self-promotion.'' Let me say that again: a ``humble man  with no appetite for self-promotion.'' He is ``an upstanding person''  with ``unyielding integrity, faith in our institutions and unfailing  politeness.'' These are the words of his former classmates, and they  are the qualities we expect in a Supreme Court Justice.   Regardless of political leanings, we all should understand the  importance of confirming Justices who will interpret the law as  written, not misuse their office to impose their own views as to what,  in their mind, should have been written instead. We should understand  the importance of confirming Justices who will apply the law equally to  all Americans, not rule based on their empathy--empathy--for certain  groups over others.   I am confident that Judge Gorsuch is more than prepared to meet these  critical standards. It is the type of judge he has been on the Federal  court of appeals. It is the type of Justice he will be on the high  Court as well. That is why we continue to see recommendations for  Gorsuch flooding in from people of all backgrounds and all political  views.   In the coming weeks, I am sure the support for Judge Gorsuch will  continue to grow, and I know we are all eager to hear from the judge  himself when he goes before the Judiciary Committee later this month.  When he does, I hope colleagues on both sides will show him the fair-- fair--consideration that he deserves, the same fair consideration we  showed to all four of the Supreme Court nominees of President Obama and  President Clinton after they were first elected--a respectful hearing  followed by an up-or-down vote.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today it is my honor to congratulate  retired MSgt Keary Miller of the Kentucky Air National Guard's 123  Special  [[Page S1739]]  Tactics Squadron. On January 17, 2017, the U.S. Air Force awarded  Master Sergeant Miller, of Goshen, KY, its highest honor, the Air Force  Cross. This award is presented ``for extraordinary heroism while  engaged in military operations against an opposing foreign force.'' It  is second only to the Congressional Medal of Honor.   In March 2002, Miller served in the Battle of Takur Ghar as part of  Operation Anaconda in the Paktia province of Afghanistan. Their mission  was to defeat Taliban forces hiding in on the Takur Ghar Mountain.   During the mission, two MH-47E Chinook helicopters took enemy fire as  they attempted to land. The helicopter lurched in an attempt to evade  taking damage. The quick maneuvering caused PO1 Neil C. Roberts to fall  from the rear ramp out of the vehicle. Miller, a pararescuman, was in a  third helicopter to rescue Roberts. However, his vehicle was hit with  automatic weapons fire and rocket propelled grenades when it was 20  feet above the ground.   The enemy fire damaged Miller's helicopter and forced them to touch  down on Takur Ghar. After a hard landing, Miller and his team formed a  defensive posture despite five critical casualties. Through rocket  propelled grenade, mortar, and small arms fire, Miller dragged the  wounded helicopter pilot to safety. For the next 17 hours, Miller and  his team engaged the enemy in intense fighting, and he displayed  astonishing bravery as he helped the wounded and resupplied his  comrades.   Through his heroic actions, Miller successfully brought 10 seriously  wounded soldiers to medical treatment and recovered seven Americans  killed in action.   For his service, the Air Force awarded Miller the Silver Star on  November 1, 2003. However, as part of the Department of Defense's  review of combat medals, the Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee  James upgraded the award to the Air Force Cross.   In a statement, James said ``These are people whose lifestyle  includes going above and beyond the call of duty and exemplifying the  Air Force core values of integrity first, service before self and  excellence in all we do.''   To further commemorate Miller's extraordinary service, the National  Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force  Base has included his actions in the Battle of Takur Ghar in a  permanent exhibition on battlefield airmen.   On behalf of a grateful nation, I want to extend my sincerest thanks  to Master Sergeant Keary Miller for his service to the United States  and the Kentucky Air National Guard. I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring this distinguished Kentuckian. He has earned this prestigious  award, and he is a true American hero.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today it is my honor to celebrate  former Pulaski County circuit clerk George Flynn. Although he began his  retirement last year, his community is still recognizing him for his  three decades of public service. The Somerset-Pulaski County Chamber of  Commerce presented the ``Distinguished Community Service Award''--its  top honor--to Flynn in recognition of his dedicated work to the people  of Pulaski County.   In both his personal life and professional work, Flynn tirelessly  tried to make his community a better place. He was first elected in  1987 because he ``is [the] personification of a `one of us' attitude  necessary to attract votes in Pulaski County.'' Because of his  exemplary work as circuit clerk, the people reelected him four times.  In his tenure, he worked with five circuit court judges and oversaw the  modernization of all court records.   After a proud career of public service, Flynn said he is ready to  spend his days sleeping in, enjoying time with his wife, Resa, his  grandchildren, and his dogs. He has earned a relaxing retirement. I  would like to extend my warmest congratulations to George Flynn for a  notable career of public service and this much deserved award.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of  William Holeman. Preacher Bill, as he was known, came to eastern  Kentucky in 1953 and almost immediately made a lasting impact.   For over 60 years, Bill travelled throughout eastern Kentucky,  teaching around 40,000 schoolchildren each year about bullying, drug  abuse, and his Christian faith with the Youth Haven Bible Camp.  Although his family described him as a humble man, Bill had a real  passion for his vocation.   To help teach the kids, Bill employed ventriloquist dummies named  Henry and Homer. He developed their personalities and spread his  message with laughter and fun.   Bill dearly loved eastern Kentucky and its people. He devoted his  life to them, and many children were forever changed by his work.   Preacher Bill will surely be missed, and Elaine and I send our  condolences to his wife, Joyce, and their children Susan, Gail, Gary,  and Eddie.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to remember the life of  the longest serving county sheriff in the history of Kentucky, Pike  County Sheriff Charles Edward Keesee. After more than 40 years of hard  work, ``Fuzzy,'' as he was affectionately known, passed away at the age  of 89.   A veteran of the Second World War, Fuzzy became a lasting icon in  Pike County. Deputy Judge/Executive Brian Morris said ``You can't serve  for more than four decades and not personally touch every household in  Pike County.'' He was a compassionate public servant, a dedicated law  enforcement officer, and a good man. The community will surely remember  Fuzzy's impact and miss him deeply.   Elaine and I send our condolences to Sheriff Keesee's wife, Easter,  his brother, Alben, and his sister, Nancy Jo.                            ____________________
