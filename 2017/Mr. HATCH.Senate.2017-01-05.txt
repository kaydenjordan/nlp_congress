 Madam President, I rise today in support of S. Con. Res. 3  and the ongoing effort to repeal the most harmful elements of the so- called Affordable Care Act.   While our friends on the other side of the aisle have been trying to  convince the American people that there is nothing to see here and that  this poorly named law is working according to plan, the vast majority  of our citizens know the truth: ObamaCare just doesn't work.   According to the results of a recent Gallup poll, 80 percent of  Americans want Congress to either change the Affordable Care Act  significantly or repeal and replace it altogether. Let me repeat that.  Eight out of every 10 people in this country agree that the status quo  is unacceptable and that we need a major change in what is going on  around here.   We need a major course correction in our health care system. It is  not hard to see why this is the case. After all, under ObamaCare, the  cost of health insurance has increased dramatically and will continue  to do so well into the future. Under ObamaCare, individuals and  families are being left with fewer and fewer choices when it comes to  buying health insurance. Under ObamaCare, patients have fewer options  and reduced access to health care providers. Under ObamaCare, the  American people have been hit with steep taxes, burdensome mandates,  and a health care system that simply does not meet their needs.   This year alone, premiums in the benchmark plan for the ObamaCare  exchanges have gone up by an average of 25 percent, and in some parts  of the country, the increases have been significantly larger than that.  In addition, over the past 2 years, insurance plans have been dropping  out of markets all over the country. As a result, it is estimated that  more than half of the counties in the United States will have two or  fewer available health insurance plans on the exchanges--and that is  this year--and about a third of them have only one available option.   I am quite certain that every single Member of this Chamber has heard  from a number of their constituents about these problems, about the  problems they have faced as the Affordable Care Act has been  implemented. I know I have. A number of Utahns have written to me to  express their concerns about the increases in their insurance premiums.  For example, last month, Austin from Provo, UT, told me that due to the  growing cost of his insurance plan, ``I'm going to have to drop the  insurance and face the penalty next year. I'm worried because, as a  young husband and father, I'm barely making ends meet, and I'm not sure  I can afford to pay the penalty for not having insurance.'' Similarly,  Eryn from Spanish Fork, UT, noted that because her family's previous  insurer dropped out of the Utah marketplace, the remaining plan that  best met her family's needs was ``a plan with a small list of in- network providers and no coverage for out-of-network providers.'' She  continued, saying that under this new plan, ``We will have a higher  deductible ($13,000 for the family), we will have to pay the full cost  of any visit to the doctor . . . and we will not be able to save as  much money in our Health Savings Account each month because of the high  premiums, which add up to $11,000 a year. . . . The premium is  basically another mortgage payment for us, only we have no property to  show for it. This is too much.''   No family should have to choose between paying their mortgage and  paying for their health insurance. Yet, with all of ObamaCare's  failures and broken promises, families throughout the country are  currently having to make those kinds of choices.   Unfortunately, it does not get any better from here, not without a  major change to the status quo. In fact, I think it is safe to say that  if we fail to act, the worst is yet to come. Therefore, it is only  fitting that we begin this new Congress by repealing ObamaCare and  setting the stage for workable reforms that will actually bring down  costs, provide more options, and let the American people--and not  Washington bureaucrats--make their own health care choices. The budget  resolution before us is the first step in this effort.   As we all know, the resolution contains reconciliation instructions  to the relevant committees, including the Senate Finance Committee,  which I chair, to draft legislation to repeal ObamaCare. So after  approving this resolution, the next step will be for the Finance  Committee, the HELP Committee, as well as the Ways and Means and Energy  and Commerce Committees over in the House, to get to work on putting  together a repeal package. This process will be more difficult than it  sounds. We don't want to be reckless, and we don't want to inflict more  harm on the American people or our health care system; therefore, in  addition to repealing ObamaCare, the legislation we draft pursuant to  this budget resolution will have to include a stable transition period  to give us the time and space we need to provide more sensible reforms.   Under the budget resolution, the legislation to repeal ObamaCare and  provide that transition period will need to be reported to the Budget  Committee by January 27. Then both the House and Senate will debate the  legislation, hopefully passing it by simple majority votes and sending  it to the desk of the incoming President. Once we pass this repeal  legislation, we will come to the most important step in the process:  replacing ObamaCare with a health care system worthy of the American  people.   This will not be a simple endeavor. It is going to take a great deal  of work, and it will almost certainly require the efforts of people  from both parties. The Finance Committee is going to have a  [[Page S92]]  major role to play throughout this process of repealing ObamaCare,  providing for a secure transition, and replacing the law with more  effective reforms. Our committee has jurisdiction over all the major  Federal health programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition,  we will have jurisdiction over the tax provisions, which include all of  ObamaCare's harmful taxes as well as the premium tax credits provided  to purchase plans in the ObamaCare exchanges.   I have spoken at length to my Republican colleagues on the Finance  Committee about these issues, and all of them are ready and willing to  do whatever is necessary to put our Nation's health care system on a  more responsible path. We are going to get it done. In that I have no  doubts.   To be sure, the first few steps in this effort are going to happen  quickly. Once again, the plan is to produce repeal legislation before  the end of this month. This, of course, is how it has to be. The  American people don't have the time for us to wait around on these  issues, and we don't have the luxury of sitting back and watching the  problems get worse over time. The problems facing our health care  system are growing by the day. We need to take the swiftest possible  action.   We intend to act quickly and methodically to begin providing relief  for the millions of Americans who are currently suffering as a result  of ObamaCare and the unworkable system it has created. As I noted, if  that effort is going to be successful, it should be bipartisan. Both  Congress and the incoming administration will need to work together.                             Cabinet Nominations    On that point, Madam President, I do want to note that my friends on  the other side of the aisle have as recently as this morning made a  number of statements and issued several demands with regard to the  process for considering and confirming the President-elect's Cabinet  nominees. According to my colleagues' statements, they want multiple  rounds of hearings on every nominee, which, by the way, is  unprecedented. This morning, they even went further, issuing demands  that certain preconditions be met before hearings could even be held on  a particular nomination. These tactics are, to put it bluntly,  preposterous. My colleagues are certainly free to oppose any nominee  and to try to convince others to do the same. It is unfortunate that  they have decided to go further by politicizing the process by which we  consider nominations.   Speaking for the Senate Finance Committee, I have to say that we have  an established set of vetting procedures for all executive branch  nominees. Republicans and Democrats alike have those particular  procedures. That process has been in place for decades and has  traditionally been bipartisan.   By all accounts, the Finance Committee's longstanding vetting process  is exceptionally thorough and fair, and it is deeply regrettable that  some of our colleagues would try to undermine that process and not  provide the incoming Trump administration's nominees the same respect  and regard our committee has provided for nominees in the Obama  administration and prior administrations as well. As chairman, I take  this process very seriously. I have made no efforts to abbreviate or  short-circuit our procedures for any nominee and have no intention of  doing so in the future. I am certain all of our chairmen here in the  Senate can say the same thing.   My hope is that my colleagues will stop politicizing this process at  every step and allow the Senate to function as it has under both  Republican and Democratic administrations. My friends on the other side  may not like the results of the recent election, but their  disappointment of the outcome is no justification for reinventing the  way we do business here in the Senate.   I hope we will all take this into consideration and we will start  cooperating with each other and get this government moving again and  that we will support and sustain these people who are qualified and  good people who are being chosen by the Trump-elect administration. I  think it is important that we do these things and do them carefully and  that we treat each other with the respect that is well deserved in this  body. I hope that the petty, cheap politics will be discontinued.   Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, in the final hour of our legislative  business early last December 10, we passed a remarkable bill. It had no  ideological division, did not cost the taxpayers a dime, and will  benefit Americans in every part of the country. And, like the House  did, we passed it unanimously.   This bill had the somewhat unwieldy title of the Foreign Cultural  Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act. While not lending  itself to a catchy acronym, it is accurately descriptive. For more than  50 years, a Federal law has provided legal protection for art loaned by  foreign governments for exhibition in the United States. Confidence in  that protection is an essential piece of the complex arrangements that  can take years to complete in order to bring wonderful exhibits to  American museums for everyone to enjoy.   America has hundreds of museums of all sorts. The art museum at  Brigham Young University, for example, is one of the largest and best  attended in the Mountain West. When it began working on a major  exhibition of art from Islamic countries, some of its loan requests  were unexpectedly denied. It turns out that a 2007 Federal court  decision had made such loans risky, rather than secure. After that  court decision, the act of lending, even after State Department review  and approval, could actually lead to a new category of lawsuits against  the foreign lenders.   This legislation, now signed into law, reverses that court decision  and clarifies that lending art after State Department review does not  raise the possibility of new litigation. Foreign governments can once  again have confidence that lending art for exhibition will improve  cultural understanding and enrich people's lives without the threat of  new lawsuits.   The bill has two narrow exceptions. I want to thank Dr. Wesley  Fisher, director of research at the Conference on Jewish Material  Claims against Germany, and Rabbi Andrew Baker, director of  International Jewish Affairs at the American Jewish Committee, for  their help in drafting the exception for Nazi-era claims. The second  exception covers comparable state-sponsored coercive campaigns of  cultural plunder. Art that was looted in such a campaign should not be  given protection for exhibition in the United States.   The senior Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, was my principal  partner in this effort. She and her staff have been patient,  thoughtful, and dedicated; in particular, I want to thank her chief  counsel, Eric Haren, and counsel Lartease Tiffith for working so  diligently with my own chief counsel, Tom Jipping. The problem to be  solved was clear, but it was challenging to find the right language to  solve that problem without unintended consequences.   I also want to thank the Association of Art Museum Directors, their  director of government affairs Anita Difanis, and their special counsel  Josh Knerly. They have been committed to this goal from the start, and  their effort began with educating many of us about this unique area of  law and policy. They mobilized hundreds of art institutions and  associations to support this bill. And they were flexible about many  things while staying focused on the essentials.   I gratefully acknowledge the consistent support for this legislation  from the BYU Museum of Art, the Utah Fine Arts Museum, and the Utah  Museums Association. We have a vibrant art community in Utah, and this  legislation means that these fine institutions have additional  opportunities to bring new experiences to the people in our great  State.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  following my remarks a letter from James S. Snyder, director of The  Israel Museum in Jerusalem. He writes that the risk of new lawsuits has  been ``a disincentive to lend works to American museums,'' but that  this legislation ``will ensure that museums worldwide can continue to  lend to American museums in the precise spirit of international  cultural cooperation that U.S. Immunity from Seizure protection was  intended to provide.'' That, in a nutshell, is the problem and the  solution we are enacting today.   This legislation restores the confidence that foreign governments  need to lend art for exhibitions that Americans across the country can  enjoy. That is something we can all be proud of.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                              The Israel Museum,                                          Jerusalem, March 17, 2013.      Hon. Orrin Hatch,      U.S. Senate,      Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Hatch: I am Director of The Israel Museum,       Jerusalem, an encyclopedic museum embracing the history of       material world culture from pre-historic archaeology of the       ancient Holy Land through the rise of Judaism, Christianity,       and Islam; Jewish world culture; and the fine arts of the       Western and non-Western traditions. Our collections comprise       over 500,000 objects, and our 600,000 sq. ft. campus sits on       a signature 20-acre site in Jerusalem. We are internationally       active as producers of temporary exhibitions in Jerusalem and       internationally and as major borrowers and lenders from       sister institutions worldwide.        Our international museum community, which enjoys a close       and collegial relationship with our American counterparts, is       concerned about the trend toward a weakening of the Immunity       from Seizure protection customarily offered by U.S. museums       when they request loans from foreign museums. These concerns       are two-fold:        First, that foreign museums risk being sued in connection       with works loaned to an American exhibition if there is a       question that works on loan are held by their lending       institutions in violation of international law. The act of       lending can therefore be used as the basis to seek damages in       a U.S. court, which is counter to the premise that Immunity       from Seizure protects works on loan from legal action while       they are on loan; and        Secondly, foreign museums that loan works with clear       provenance to an American exhibition may nonetheless be sued       with regard to other works in their collections that may lack       full provenance. In this regard, the simple act of lending,       in the spirit of international exchange, opens us to possible       claims with regard to any and all works in our collections.        Each of these potential circumstances raises troubling       concerns, and, taken together, they are a disincentive to       lend works to American museums, given the potential risk of       suit in U.S. courts. And this prospect is exactly what U.S.       Immunity from Seizure was originally established to avoid.        Anything that you can do to strengthen Immunity from       Seizure in the U.S. will ensure that museums worldwide can       continue to lend to American museums in the precise spirit of       international cultural cooperation that U.S. Immunity from       Seizure protection was intended to provide.        Please let me know if I can answer any further questions in       this matter.            Sincerely,                                                   James S. Snyder,      Director.                            ____________________
