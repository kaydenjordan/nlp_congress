 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the rule, which would  deem and pass a resolution condemning great replacement theory and  white supremacy.   The recent mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, that claimed the lives  of 10 Americans was committed by a self-described white supremacist who  referenced great replacement theory in a manifesto.   The perpetuation of xenophobia, racism, and anti-Semitism by  rightwing extremists who believe in a grand conspiracy theory that  minorities, somehow facilitated by Jews, are actively seeking to  diminish the political and cultural power of White voters must be  condemned.   Notably absent is the condemnation of our leaders on the right, who  refuse to speak out against this senseless violence and call it what it  is: hate speech meant to divide us and not unite us.   This departure from logic and reason, and cozying up to fear, is  leading people to violence and extremism in communities all across this  country, and it must be stopped.
