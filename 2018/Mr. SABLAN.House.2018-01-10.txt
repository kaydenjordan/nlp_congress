 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to S. 140 because it  includes H.R. 986, the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of 2017.   The effect of this legislation would be to strip employees who work  at businesses owned and operated by an Indian Tribe and located on  Indian lands of the protections afforded by the National Labor  Relations Act.   I am a Chamorro, one of the native people of the Northern Marianas,  and I fully appreciate the importance of Tribal sovereignty for Native  Americans. However, this legislation does not properly reconcile the  competing interests between sovereign rights and the rights of workers.   At least 75 percent of employees at Tribal casinos are not Tribal  members. In some cases, as few as 1 percent of the employees are  members of the Tribes operating the casino. These workers have no say  in the decisionmaking of Tribal governments.   Workers have the right to organize, to collectively bargain, and to  protect their right to fight for a safe workplace, fair pay to provide  a living for themselves and their families, and good benefits. They  should not be stripped of these rights simply due to the geography of  the workplace.   Federal law and Tribal sovereignty should be able to coexist at  Tribal casinos without stripping workers of their rights under the  National Labor Relations Act.
