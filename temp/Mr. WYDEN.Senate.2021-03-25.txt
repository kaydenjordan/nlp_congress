 Mr. President, 30 seconds' worth.   First of all, we are protecting the lifeline for senior citizens by  delaying the sequester cut to Medicare. We would have extraordinary  problems if this cut were to be allowed to take effect.   Second, we have defeated the Scott amendment which, if adopted, would  have set a horrible precedent by refusing to fix Congress's mistake and  forcing hospitals in one Senator's State to take on draconian Medicaid  cuts.   I urge an ``aye'' vote.                              Vote on H.R. 1868     Mr. President, the Senate is debating the nomination of  Wally Adeyemo to serve as the next Deputy Treasury Secretary. I expect  his nomination is going to pass with a big, bipartisan margin, but I  want to take a few minutes to lay out a few reasons why every Senator  ought to support this nominee.   First, you hear a lot these days about how Members of the Senate are  looking for unity. Three weeks ago, the Finance Committee approved the  Adeyemo nomination unanimously by voice vote, and you can't get more  unified than that.   That unanimous vote followed an excellent hearing, in which Mr.  Adeyemo demonstrated his command of all the various issues the Treasury  is confronting today. A severe jobs crisis. Worsening inequality. A  dangerous shortage of domestic manufacturing in critical areas of our  economy. Intense economic competition with China, including job rip- offs and trade cheating that have undermined American workers for too  long. And many other big challenges.   Members understand that there will be policy disagreements with the  other party, but Mr. Adeyemo made it clear that he wants to work on a  bipartisan basis to confront these challenges. Members take him  seriously on that and trust him because he has done it before at the  Treasury as a member of the Obama administration.   Second, the pandemic economic crisis is far from over, and it is  essential that the Treasury Department has its leadership team in  place. COVID cases and deaths are still tragically high. Jobless claims  are still incredibly high--they spent an entire year above the previous  peaks. So millions of families in Oregon and around the country are  still walking an economic tightrope, and that is one of the key reasons  why Senate Democrats passed the American Rescue Plan earlier this  month.   The Treasury is right at the center of the enormous effort to  implement that legislation. It is extraordinarily challenging work.  Getting relief payments out to tens of millions of Americans in a  timely way. Saving millions of jobs at the State and local level,  particularly teachers, firefighters and municipal workers. Launching a  landmark expansion and reinvention of the child tax credit to cut child  poverty in half. This is difficult work. It requires the kind of strong  and committed leadership that Wally Adeyemo will bring to the Treasury  Department.   I am also looking forward to working with him on the issue of shell  companies. Late last year Congress passed landmark legislation to end  the use of anonymous shell companies in the United States. Several  members of the Finance Committee had spent years working to get that  legislation passed. Now that it has become law, it is up to the  Treasury Department to write strong rules and implement it. This is a  vital challenge, and it is a long time coming. So I am very much  looking forward to working with Mr. Adeyemo once he is confirmed. He is  as highly qualified as they come. He is also a history-making nominee  because he will be the first African American Deputy Treasury  Secretary.   I support his nomination 100 percent. He got 100 percent of the  Finance Committee's support a few weeks ago. I believe he will have  strong bipartisan support from the Senate, and I urge all Members to  vote to confirm this nomination
