 Mr. Speaker, for 14 years, the Texas Department of  Transportation has been attempting to build I-45, which would literally  destroy large aspects of my community.   In this past appropriation, I am delighted to have had amendments  that have indicated that you cannot use 106 funds without looking  closely at the historic preservation impact.   I provided $1 million extra to help impoverished communities fight  against such construction that removes buildings like homes,  businesses, and culturally significant structures. That is what is  happening in Independence Heights, where  [[Page H4206]]  churches, buildings, homes, and condominiums are all being lost.   We have to realize that people control this Nation and not  governmental institutions that would do harm when people can lose their  homes, their churches, and their businesses.   Finally, I am glad that as we move into the negotiation of the HEROES  Act, we will not have the liability issue. We cannot have the liability  issue; block the $600 that people are supposed to have; the testing  that people are supposed to have; hospital compensation.   We need to move quickly to vote on this HEROES Act because our people  in Houston, Texas, and across the Nation are suffering from COVID-19,  and I will continue to fight so they can continue to survive and live.   Tomorrow, we open another testing site in Houston, Texas.                            ____________________
