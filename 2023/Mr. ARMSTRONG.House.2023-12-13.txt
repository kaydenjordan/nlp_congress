 Mr. Speaker, here is what we know.   We know that President Biden's transition team ran interference for  Hunter Biden and obstructed law enforcement's attempts to interview the  President's son.   We know that somebody in the FBI decided not to investigate bribery  allegations against Hunter Biden and Joe Biden provided by a  confidential informant. That source is so important and the FBI has  deemed him so credible that they oppose the release of the report and  only agreed to a review in a classified setting.   We know that IRS investigators were not allowed to follow leads that  had the potential to implicate President Biden in Hunter Biden's  alleged financial crimes.   We know that recommendations for prosecution of Hunter Biden were  denied or delayed until the statute of limitations had run.   We know that a plea deal was offered to Hunter Biden by the DOJ that  offered him global immunity for crimes outside the scope of the charged  conduct and that that plea deal only fell apart after whistleblowers  came forward to Congress.   Set aside for a minute the $24 million, the 20-plus shell companies,  the payments to President Biden, and the changing narrative from this  White House every time a new bad fact comes to light. Set that aside.                                time  1345    These instances alone should concern all Americans because it appears  that people in the highest echelons of our government were running  interference for the President's son.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have an innocent  explanation for every single incident. The problem is, it is very  difficult to see an innocent explanation for all of the incidents.   The FBI, the DOJ, the IRS, and the President's political operation  have all frustrated attempts to investigate the Bidens.   Obstruction is a crime, and it is no less of a crime if it is being  used within the highest powers of government to perpetrate that  coercion.   Take all of the politics out of this, there is no investigator in any  jurisdiction in the world that would not continue this investigation  with these facts.   The purpose of the impeachment inquiry is for the House to authorize  impeachment and strengthen its ability to compel testimony and document  production in response to Congressional subpoenas. This will allow the  House to continue its investigation into whether President Biden  changed U.S. policy due to payments received by the Biden family  members from hostile foreign powers; or whether he knowingly allowed  foreign powers to believe that the payments were being made and to  employ the Biden family members would result in access and the ability  to alter U.S. policy; or whether the President and the President's  administration were using government agencies to obstruct  investigations into Hunter and Joe Biden.   This inquiry is warranted. It would put the House of Representatives  in the best legal position possible to uncover the facts, and the  American people deserve nothing less.
