 Mr. President, I rise to honor and pay tribute to our  Senate colleagues who are departing at the end of this Congress. I was  able to work with all of them in different ways, and we are going to  miss them.   Before that, I did want to mention the importance of the continuing  negotiations on end-of-the-year pandemic relief. I have been involved  in those, and I want to thank those Members who have been at the  forefront of this all through the weekend, all through the last few  weeks.   I cannot stress how important it is right now. My State just got  through a spike in COVID. We lost so many people. We have so many small  businesses, like so many States in this country, that are closed down.   While we see the light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccine, I  talked to a friend of mine whose husband is an infectious disease  doctor, and she said when she saw those trucks rolling out in Michigan,  she just started to sob just seeing it on TV. I think that is how a lot  of people in this country feel, but it is on us right now to make sure  we get the funding so that vaccine gets distributed as it should and to  also ensure that our economy is in a place that when we start going  back into the workplace--not just virtually--we will be able to bounce  back as we should, and that means pandemic relief at the end of this  year.
