 Mr. Speaker, in his last month in office, President Obama  fired one last shot in his war on coal. By finalizing the so-called  stream protection rule, the Obama administration made it more difficult  for an already distressed industry to provide a reliable and affordable  energy source for our economy.   In reality, the only thing President Obama tried to protect was the  jobs of bureaucrats at the expense of hardworking Americans. This rule  adds no new environmental protections. It only duplicates what Federal  and State regulators are already doing to protect the environment.   Additionally, this rule could close off as much as half of the U.S.  coal reserves for mining. The bureaucrats writing this rule did not  truly understand the impact of this because, in the 7 years they took  to write it, no one bothered to visit an actual mine.   We cannot allow out-of-control bureaucrats to regulate an industry  that employs thousands of Americans out of existence simply to save the  radical liberal agenda. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  this resolution of disapproval of yet another regulatory overreach by  the Obama administration.
