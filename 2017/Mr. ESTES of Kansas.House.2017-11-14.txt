 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  Colorado holding this Special Order hour tonight.   Serving my fellow Kansans for a little over the last 6 months has  been a very humbling experience. I can't help but walk onto the House  floor and feel the weight of history in this hall.   I am often reminded of Jesus' words in Mark chapter 9: ``Anyone who  wants to be first must be the very last, and the servant of all.'' This  verse touches on why each of us should be here not for our own gain,  but in service to others.   Throughout our country tonight, people are in Bible study classes. We  are all attempting to seek how we humble ourselves before the Lord.   When I consider our Founding Fathers' vision for this Republic, I  think they set in motion with a servant's heart. The Founders made  clear that religious liberty was to be cherished, and so they enshrined  it in our Constitution. From the time of the Puritans crossing the  Atlantic in search of freedom to practice their faith to today,  millions of Americans have taken the Bible as the cornerstone of their  faith.  [[Page H9251]]    Our President's have chosen to take the oath of office on their  Bibles. President Lincoln chose his Bible to be open to Matthew 7:1,  ``Judge not, that ye be not judged.'' President Reagan chose to have  his Bible open to II Chronicles 7:14, ``If my people, which are called  by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face. . . .  ''   With the Bible as our guiding compass, these leaders chose to serve  their fellow Americans with humility and strength.   As we honor National Bible Week, I hope that individuals across this  country, regardless of their faith background, will take a moment to  reflect on the gift of religious liberty and their role to serve others  around them. The future of our great Nation rests in the servant hearts  of her people.
