 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3304) to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize  the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide or assist in providing an  additional vehicle adapted for operation by disabled individuals to  certain eligible persons, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3304         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Advancing Uniform       Transportation Opportunities for Veterans Act'' or the ``AUTO       for Veterans Act''.       SEC. 2. ELIGIBILITY FOR DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS                     PROVISION OF ADDITIONAL AUTOMOBILE OR OTHER                     ADAPTED EQUIPMENT.         Section 3903(a) of title 38, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``paragraph (2)'' and       inserting ``paragraphs (2) and (3)''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(3) The Secretary may provide or assist in providing an       eligible person with an additional automobile or other       conveyance under this chapter--        ``(A) if more than 25 years have elapsed since the eligible       person most recently received an automobile or other       conveyance under this chapter; or        ``(B) beginning on the day that is 10 years after date of       the enactment of the AUTO for Veterans Act, if more than 10       years have elapsed since the eligible person most recently       received an automobile or other conveyance under this       chapter.''.       SEC. 3. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TREATMENT OF CERTAIN                     VEHICLE MODIFICATIONS AS MEDICAL SERVICES.         Section 1701(6) of title 38, United States Code, is amended       by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:        ``(I) The provision of medically necessary van lifts,       raised doors, raised roofs, air-conditioning, and wheelchair       tiedowns for passenger use.''.       SEC. 4. MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN HOUSING LOAN FEE.         (a) Extension.--The loan fee table in section 3729(b)(2) of       title 38, United States Code, is amended by striking       ``January 14, 2031'' each place it appears and inserting       ``May 16, 2031''.       SEC. 5. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3304, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3304, as amended, the AUTO  for Veterans Act.   I was proud to join Representative Lizzie Fletcher in introducing  H.R. 3304, and I thank her for her tireless work with the veteran  community, which has led to this bill being considered on the floor  today.   Currently, disabled veterans are only allowed a single grant to  modify a vehicle to provide them mobility. This means there are cars  that are 25, 30, or even 40 years old on the road because the veteran  has no other option.   When you consider that the average life of an automobile is less than  12 years, we are asking veterans to incur additional costs and risks by  driving excessively old cars for decades.   The AUTO for Veterans Act finally expands eligibility for disabled  veterans to obtain vehicles modified for their disabilities more than  once in their lifetime.   Upon passage into law, H.R. 3304 would immediately allow veterans who  have waited decades to acquire a new vehicle and, after giving those  veterans priority, would eventually expand the benefit to cover those  veterans who updated their vehicle 10 years ago.   This legislation also expands the definition of ``medical services''  to include certain vehicle modifications so that veterans can attend  medical appointments.   This legislation has long been a priority for veterans and is  supported by DAV, VFW, PVA, and countless other veterans organizations.   This legislation is fully paid for and delivers for disabled veterans  who gave us so much.   I thank the ranking member for his support of this legislation. I  know we have both wanted to fix this longstanding problem.   Madam Speaker, I wholeheartedly support this bill, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 3304, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8888) to amend title 38, United States Code, to establish in  the Department of Veterans Affairs an Office of Food Security, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Food Security for All       Veterans Act''.       SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS                     OFFICE OF FOOD SECURITY.         Chapter 3 of title 38, United States Code, is amended by       adding at the end the following new section (and conforming       the table of sections at the beginning of such chapter       accordingly):       ``Sec. 325. Office of Food Security         ``(a) Establishment.--There is in the Department an office       to be known as the `Office of Food Security'. There is at the       head of the Office a Director, which shall be a career       position.        ``(b) Responsibilities.--(1) The Director of the Office of       Food Security shall carry out the following responsibilities:        ``(A) To provide information to veterans concerning the       availability of, and eligibility requirements for Federal       nutrition assistance programs.        ``(B) To collaborate with other program offices of the       Department, including the Homeless Programs Office and the       Office of Tribal Government Relations, to develop and       implement policies and procedures to identify and treat       veterans at-risk or experiencing food insecurity.        ``(C) To collaborate with the Secretary of Agriculture and       the Secretary of Defense on food insecurity among veterans,       including by collaborating with the Secretaries to develop       materials related to food insecurity for the Transition       Assistance Program curriculum and other transition-related       resources.        ``(D) To develop and provide training, including training       that may count towards continuing education or licensure       requirements, for social workers, dietitians, chaplains, and       other clinicians on how to assist veterans with enrollment in       Federal nutrition assistance programs, including the       supplemental nutrition assistance program and the special       supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and       children established by section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act       of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1786).        ``(E) To issue guidance to Department medical centers on       how to collaborate with their State and local offices       administering the supplemental nutrition assistance program.        ``(2) In carrying out the responsibilities under paragraph       (1), the Director shall consult with and provide technical       assistance to the heads of other Federal departments and       agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Department       of Defense, Department of Interior, and Department of Labor.        ``(c) Annual Report on Food Insecurity.--The Secretary of       Veterans Affairs, in consultation with the Secretary of       Agriculture, shall submit to the Committees on Veterans'       Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives an annual       report on veteran food insecurity. Each such report shall       include data on the following:        ``(1) The socioeconomic, ethnic, and racial characteristics       of veterans experiencing food insecurity, disaggregated by       State in which the veteran is located.        ``(2) Native American veterans experiencing food       insecurity.        ``(3) Specific interventions for veterans who screen       positive for food insecurity.        ``(4) Eligibility screenings for participation in the       supplemental nutrition assistance program completed by       personnel of the Department of Veterans Affairs.        ``(5) The number of applications for participation in the       supplemental nutrition assistance program completed with       assistance from personnel of the Department.        ``(6) Changes, as a result of participation in the       supplemental nutrition assistance program, in the number of       food insecure veteran households.        ``(7) Coordination efforts between State agencies and       Department facilities located in that State regarding       outreach to veterans to participate in the supplemental       nutrition assistance program.        ``(d) Definitions.--In this section:        ``(1) The terms `Native American' and `Native American       veteran' have the meanings given those terms in section 3765       of this title.        ``(2) The terms `State agency' and `supplemental nutrition       assistance program' have the meanings given those terms in       section 3 of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C.       2012).''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 8888, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8888, as amended, the  Food Security for All Veterans Act.   This bill establishes an office dedicated to ending veteran hunger at  the VA that will collaborate with internal and external groups to  develop and implement policies and procedures to identify and treat  veterans at risk of or experiencing hunger.   Food insecurity can create or exacerbate other health maladies and is  one of many contributing factors that has led to increased suicide  rates, diabetes, heart disease, and depression. Addressing veteran  hunger is critical to this committee's suicide prevention efforts.   Madam Speaker, I thank our newest Member from Alaska, Congresswoman  Peltola, for taking up this important issue and prioritizing veterans.   The VA has made tremendous strides in its work to end veteran hunger.  The VA leads an interagency working group and regularly collaborates  with its Federal counterparts on this issue. The VA also instituted a  clinical reminder that screens every veteran who receives their care at  VA for food insecurity and connects those in need with resources.   However, until recently, these tasks were carried out by VA employees  as ancillary duties. There was no staff dedicated solely to addressing  veteran hunger. The VA has started the process of building a team that  works exclusively on this issue, and Congresswoman Peltola's bill gives  the VA the infrastructure and resources to ensure those efforts  continue for years to come.   Before the pandemic and still now, Black, Latino, Native American,  and Alaska Native veteran families experienced disproportionately high  rates of hunger. This bill requires the VA to coordinate with the VA  Office of Tribal Government Relations and the Department of the  Interior to focus on these communities.   A critical issue this bill intends to affect is the disparity between  the VA and USDA data on veteran hunger. The USDA reports about an 11  percent rate of food insecurity among veterans versus the VA, which  reports a roughly 2 percent rate among veterans using VA healthcare.   The bill requires VA, in consultation with the USDA, to issue an  annual report to Congress on the prevalence of veteran hunger. It also  requires the VA to track its progress and success in connecting more  veterans with resources like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program, or SNAP.   Importantly, the Food Security for All Veterans Act mandates the VA  collaborates with the Departments of Agriculture and Defense to develop  materials for the Transition Assistance Program to help increase access  to food resources for families in need as they navigate the military- to-civilian transition.   September is Hunger Action Month, and today, the White House hosted  the Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health that will catalyze the  public and private sectors around a coordinated strategy to accelerate  progress  [[Page H8182]]  and drive transformative change in our country to end hunger.   This legislation is endorsed by numerous veterans service  organizations and hunger advocacy organizations, including Student  Veterans of America, MAZON: A Jewish Response to Hunger, Food Research  & Action Center, Disabled American Veterans, American Federation of  Government Employees, National Coalition for Homeless Veterans, Iraq  and Afghanistan Veterans of America, and Blue Star Families.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the following letters from  MAZON: A Jewish Response to Hunger and the Food Research & Action  Center.                          [MAZON, Sept. 23, 2022]  Statement for the Record in Support of H.R. 8888 Submitted by MAZON: A                         Jewish Response to Hunger         A Jewish Response to Hunger is pleased to share this       statement for the record in support of H.R. 8888, the Food       Security for All Veterans Act. This bill, which would       establish an Office of Food Security at the U.S. Department       of Veterans Affairs, represents a helpful step forward in the       effort to achieve a more comprehensive and lasting solution       to the preventable problem of veteran food insecurity.        Inspired by Jewish values and ideals, MAZON takes to heart       our collective responsibility to care for the vulnerable in       our midst, without judgement or precondition. In the United       States, this responsibility to prevent and respond to hunger       lies centrally with our federal government. The charitable       food sector is in no way equipped to respond to the scope of       food insecurity in America--all of the charitable and faith-      based organizations in this country combined contribute less       than ten percent of all food assistance in this country and       have extremely limited capacity to respond to more than       emergency needs. The food insecurity crisis in our country is       the purview of the federal government and it is impractical,       inefficient, and immoral to abdicate this responsibility and       attempt to outsource the response to a charitable sector that       is already overburdened.        For over 37 years, MAZON has been fighting to end hunger       among all people of all faiths and backgrounds, and for       nearly ten years, we have prioritized addressing the long-      overlooked issue of food insecurity among veterans and       military families. Jewish text and tradition compel us to       honor the dignity of every person, especially those who are       struggling. No matter a person's circumstance, no one       deserves to be hungry. Those who have bravely served to       defend our country especially should never have to be       subjected to the cruel and painful experience of hunger.        The establishment of the Office of Food Security at the       Department of Veterans Affairs that is empowered to       coordinate efforts among VA program offices, provide       information about and help connect veterans to available       nutrition assistance benefits and resources, collaborate with       USDA, Department of Defense, and other federal agencies, and       develop and provide training for professionals who work with       veterans, would be an extremely helpful step forward in the       national effort to address the crisis of veteran food       insecurity.        MAZON has testified before Congress and shared our insights       and recommendations about food insecurity among veteran       households numerous times over the years. Unfortunately, too       little progress has been made during the intervening time.       There have been some positive steps, both programmatically       and through policy change, that have helped; most notably,       the recent adoption of the Hunger Vital Signs screening tool       at all VA outpatient facilities (MAZON has long advocated for       mandatory food insecurity screenings and SNAP eligibility       screening, and application assistance across the VA system;       much more still remains to be done on this front to connect       food insecure veterans with SNAP) and increases to SNAP       benefits through the temporary boost included through COVID-      19-relief legislation and the recent update to the Thrifty       Food Plan by USDA.        It should be noted that, while the temporary boost to SNAP       benefits and other COVID-19 assistance provided by the       federal government helped to alleviate some material hardship       and prevented food insecurity and poverty rates from       dramatically spiking due to the pandemic and associated       economic downturn, the American population--including       veterans--experienced exacerbated challenges that compounded       food insecurity rates and more severe impacts.        These challenges include elevated rates of unemployment       (particularly within the service sector and       disproportionately impacting female employees and people of       color), widespread school closures and the loss of subsidized       school meals, medical emergencies and the associated       financial costs for treatment and lost income from time out       of work), and mental health distress.        We are particularly concerned about the impacts of racial       inequities on veterans and the ongoing tragedy of heightened       suicide rates among veterans. While there is growing public       awareness and concern about both issues, there remains a need       for viable policy proposals to address them. The       disproportionate impact of food insecurity on households of       veterans of color highlight racial inequities that are       perpetuated through public policies and program       implementation. Closing the SNAP participation gap for       veterans and improving the program to better reach and serve       food insecure veterans of color will not only signal a       commitment to meaningful efforts to address racial justice--      it will concretely contribute to those efforts to achieve       greater racial equity in federal policy.        As noted by Dr. Thomas O'Toole during his testimony before       the House Veterans Affairs Committee on January 9, 2020, a       growing body of research sheds light on the relationship       between food insecurity and risk factors for poor mental       health and suicide. A new study on ``Association between Food       Insecurity, Mental Health, and Intentions to Leave the U.S.       Army in a Cross-Sectional Sample of U.S. Soldiers'' by       researchers at the USDA Economic Research Service and the       U.S. Army Public Health Center offers additional insight       about linkages between food insecurity, mental health, and       military service. Contributing to the VA's stated top       clinical priority to end veteran suicide and implement a       comprehensive public health approach to reach all veterans,       the VA must step up to provide leadership around a robust       effort to address veteran food insecurity by proactive SNAP       outreach to veterans both within and outside of the VA       system.        A recommendation made by Dr. Colleen Heflin during her       testimony at the May 27, 2021 House Rules Committee       roundtable examination of the hunger crisis among veterans       and military families holds great promise to decrease the       risk of food insecurity during the transition from military       service to civilian life, when many households are more       likely at risk of food insecurity. MAZON urges Congress to       explore this suggestion for the federal government to provide       a targeted transitional benefit to all families leaving       military service below a certain rank. Such a benefit would       act as a stabilizing mechanism and provide much-needed       additional assistance to veterans and their families during a       time when they may experience a greater level of financial       need. Such a transitional benefit, especially one that       utilizes innovative new technologies for benefit delivery and       personalized communications, opens up opportunities to       proactively assess and respond to the whole-person needs of       veterans by building trust and facilitating connections to       other available resources and comprehensive services. In       addition, MAZON supports the distinct, yet often related,       recommendations by Dr. Heflin to better protect veterans with       disabilities from food insecurity.        MAZON was proud to recently sign a Memorandum of Agreement       with the Veterans Health Administration to work       collaboratively to address veteran food insecurity. While       MAZON is excited about this opportunity to provide input,       contribute resources, and collaborate on innovative program       ideas and solutions, the limited commitments to date by the       VA and slow pace of response to a preventable crisis with       multiple negative consequences is deeply distressing.       Additionally, the sporadic oversight by Congress and the lack       of urgency that has been demonstrated in holding federal       agencies accountable to a proactive, robust, and measurable       solution to ending veteran food insecurity must be rectified.       There is great bipartisan concern in Congress about veteran       food insecurity, but the commitment to mandate and provide       funding for proven solutions has unfortunately not matched       the lofty rhetoric.        It is time to recenter the VA's goals and priorities in the       effort to provide a comprehensive response to veteran food       insecurity. The implicit abdication of responsibility by the       federal government to the charitable sector is unsustainable       and dangerous as it shifts attention away from the need to       strengthen and improve access to SNAP and other federal       programs that serve as the frontline response to veteran food       insecurity.        Success should be measured not by how many food pantries       open at VA centers, but rather by how many food pantries       become unnecessary due to veteran households receiving the       support they need and are entitled to through programs like       SNAP. MAZON urges Congress to step up its leadership as a       vital part of this effort by prioritizing the protection and       improvement of SNAP, supporting innovative and effective ways       to better connect food insecure veterans with federal       nutrition assistance programs (including mandating that VA       facilities conduct on-site SNAP eligibility screenings and       application assistance in addition to the food insecurity       screenings currently conducted), bolstering nutrition       assistance support during transition from active duty to       veteran status, strengthening the supports and removing       barriers for food insecure veterans with disabilities, and       centering the experiences and perspectives of veterans with       lived experiences with food insecurity.        The establishment of the Office of Food Security at the VA       as proposed in H.R. 8888 promises to make a substantial       contribution to coordinating and improving agency efforts and       deepening the impact of the federal response to veteran food       insecurity. This progress is long overdue and should       represent just the next step forward among additional       commitments to come.        Veteran food insecurity--indeed, all food insecurity--is a       solvable problem, and the solution lies in mustering the       political will to prioritize and address it. MAZON welcomes       the opportunity to continue to work with  [[Page H8183]]       Congress, with all relevant federal agencies, and with VSOs       and other community partners, to build this political will       and do right by those who have bravely served our country. No       veteran should ever have to worry about being able to feed       themselves or those in their family. We owe them much more       than the half-measures and broken promises of our policies       and programs to date.        Hungry veterans cannot eat another report or hearing       transcript. MAZON urges Congress to enact the recommendations       included in H.R. 8888 and identify additional concrete steps       that Congress and the Administration can take now to end the       crisis of veteran food insecurity. We stand ready with       suggestions and with resolve to work in partnership.                                   ____              [From Food Research & Action Center, May 18, 2022]           House of Representatives, Committee on Veterans' Affairs,             Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity  Statement of Support For the Establishment of a Department of Veterans                      Affairs Office of Food Security         The Food Research & Action Center (FRAC) supports the       ``Discussion Draft, to amend Title 38, United States Code, to       establish in the Department of Veterans Affairs an Office of       Food Insecurity, and for other purposes'' set for hearing on       May 18, 2022, before the House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee       on Economic Opportunity. This critical legislation will       amplify the Department of Veterans Affairs efforts to address       food insecurity among veterans and their families.        FRAC works to improve the nutrition, health, and well-being       of tens of millions of people struggling against poverty-      related hunger in the United States through advocacy,       partnerships, and by advancing bold and equitable policy       solutions. FRAC has championed work to address food       insecurity among veterans and participates in the Military       Family Advisory Network and Veterans Health Administration       (VHA) efforts to screen and intervene to address food       insecurity among patients.        Food insecurity, even marginal food insecurity (a less       severe form), is detrimental to the health, development, and       well-being of people and is associated with some of the most       common and costly health problems in the U.S. A 2021 Economic       Research Service Report, Food Insecurity Among Working-Age       Veterans, found that 11.1 percent of veterans between the       ages of 18 to 64 lived in households reporting food       insecurity, while 5.3 lived in households experiencing very       low food security. After controlling for demographic       characteristics that normally predict food insecurity, such       as age, educational attainment, and income, the risk of food       insecurity is 7.4 percent higher among veterans than       nonveterans ages 18-64.        By creating an Office of Food Security, this legislation       represents a critical step to prioritize, accelerate, and       sustain the Department of Veterans Affairs' work to address       food insecurity among those who have sacrificed so much for       our nation. Of note, the Veterans Health Administration has       screened millions of patients for food insecurity and       connected veterans and their families to crucial federal       nutrition programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition       Assistance Program (SNAP), the Special Supplemental Nutrition       Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), school meals,       child care meals, summer meals, and emergency food sites,       such as food banks and pantries. By providing funding to       build out these efforts to screen and intervene veterans at       risk for food insecurity, this legislation will enshrine the       importance of this work, identify gaps in services, and       connect veterans to available federal nutrition programs and       other resources.        This legislation recognizes the critical role the federal       nutrition plays in addressing food insecurity among veterans       and their families. The federal nutrition programs are among       our nation's most important, proven, and cost-effective       public interventions to not only address food insecurity but       also to improve health, nutrition, and well-being. A growing       body of research links these programs to a wide range of       positive outcomes for families and the nation. Federal       nutrition programs improve dietary intake and nutrition       quality; support healthy growth of children; boost learning       and academic achievement; reduce poverty and increase family       economic security; and lower health care spending.        Ensuring access to SNAP, in particular, is a critical step       in supporting food security among veterans. Nationwide,       according to the USDA, 1,174,027 veterans (6.6 percent of all       veterans) received SNAP benefits, improving veterans'       purchasing power necessary to buy food in a dignified way at       military commissaries and other food retail outlets that       accept SNAP. A recent survey estimated that only 59 percent       of eligible veterans were enrolled in SNAP. The USDA has       identified veterans as a priority population for state SNAP       outreach plans, including partnership with local VHA       facilities. Accessing SNAP not only helps veterans everywhere       put food on the table, it reduces poverty, supports economic       stability, and improves health outcomes.        FRAC looks forward to supporting the Department of Veterans       Affairs work to address food insecurity. Alongside increasing       veteran participation in SNAP and other federal nutrition       programs, eradicating food insecurity and hunger among       veterans and their families will require a national response       that addresses underlying causes (e.g., a lack of well-paying       jobs and a lack of affordable housing). This draft       legislation is an important step in the right direction.                                   ____     Madam Speaker, I urge the rest of my colleagues to  support this legislation and ensure no veteran goes hungry, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Alaska (Mrs. Peltola), my new friend who is a newly elected Member of  Congress. I think this is her first piece of legislation to be brought  to the floor, and we are proud it is coming out of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee.                                time  2000     Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 8888, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8875) to amend title 38, United States Code, to expand  eligibility of members of the National Guard for housing loans  guaranteed by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8875         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Expanding Home Loans for       Guard and Reservists Act''.       SEC. 2. EXPANSION OF ELIGIBILITY OF MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL                     GUARD FOR HOUSING LOANS GUARANTEED BY THE                     SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         Section 3701(b)(7) of title 38, United States Code, is       amended by striking ``full-time National Guard duty'' and       inserting ``active service''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 8875, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8875, as amended, the  Expanding Home Loans for Guard and Reservists Act.   One of the most valuable benefits veterans earn is the VA home loan  benefit, which can provide them a head start in their transition to  civilian life.   That is why 2 years ago we passed into law an expansion to grant  National Guard members credit for the days they serve on Active Duty.  However, through oversight and case work we have learned how some  veterans are missing out on this benefit.   This legislation makes a technical fix, which updates the law to  define eligibility by counting Active Duty for training when guard and  reservists are training for things like Special Forces, Aviation, or  Linguistics.   These servicemembers deserve eligibility because they are going  through the same courses and training as their Active Duty  counterparts, taking the same risks, and passing the very same  requirements.   Guard and reservists are at a greater disadvantage because they are  removed from the civilian workforce for extended periods of time. After  their training is complete, they transition back to civilian life, move  back home from the base where they were training, find employment, and  find a place to live.   This technical fix makes sure that guard and reservists don't miss  out on using a great benefit from the VA home loan guarantee service.   I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Ryan), our newest Member,  for taking up this issue and making veterans a priority. As an added  bonus, this fix actually saves the Federal Government money by bringing  more borrowers into the attractive low rates of the VA home loan  program.   Madam Speaker, I wholeheartedly support this bill, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, again, I ask all my colleagues to join me  in passing H.R. 8875, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5918) to amend title 38, United States Code, to ensure that  the Secretary of Veterans Affairs repays members of the Armed Forces  for certain contributions made by such members towards Post-9/11  Educational Assistance, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5918         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REPAYMENT OF MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES FOR                     CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARD POST-9/11 EDUCATIONAL                     ASSISTANCE.         (a) In General.--Section 3327(f)(3) of title 38, United       States Code, is amended by striking ``together'' and all that       follows through ``(as applicable),''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall take effect on August 1, 2023.       SEC. 2. MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN HOUSING LOAN FEES.         The loan fee table in section 3729(b)(2) of title 38,       United States Code, is amended by striking ``January 14,       2031'' each place it appears and inserting ``January 28,       2031''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 5918, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5918, as amended,  legislation to ensure veterans can recoup the money they paid into the  Montgomery GI Bill.   Under current law, veterans who do not fully access their Montgomery  GI Bill can lose out on the payments they made into the program, in  some cases totaling up to $1,200.   The Montgomery GI Bill is in the process of being phased out for the  more generous Forever GI Bill. Many veterans may not remember the  $1,200 they paid into the program in the early days of their service or  even be aware that they are entitled to a refund of the unused funds.   The process to reclaim that $1,200 can be difficult, and there are  times when the veteran can simply lose out on the money because they  waited too long. This legislation eliminates that cumbersome process by  making it so the veteran is repaid, no questions asked.   The bill is fully offset and supported by the veterans service  organization community, including by Student Veterans of America.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Banks) for his  work on this legislation and the VSO community for bringing this issue  to our committee. I urge the rest of my colleagues to support this  legislation to ensure no veteran loses out on what is owed to them.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 5918, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7589) to amend title 38, United States Code, to prohibit the  imposition or collection of copayments for certain mental health  outpatient care visits of veterans, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7589         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Reduce and Eliminate Mental       Health Outpatient Veteran Copays Act'' or the ``REMOVE Copays       Act''.       SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON COLLECTION OF COPAYMENTS FOR FIRST                     THREE MENTAL HEALTH CARE OUTPATIENT VISITS OF                     VETERANS.         (a) Prohibition on Collection.--Chapter 17 of title 38,       United States Code, is amended by inserting after section       1722B the following new section (and conforming the table of       sections at the beginning of such chapter accordingly):       ``Sec. 1722C. Copayments: prohibition on collection of         copayments for first three mental health care outpatient         visits of veterans         ``(a) Prohibition.--Except as provided in subsection (b),       notwithstanding section 1710(g) of this title or any other       provision of law, the Secretary may not impose or collect a       copayment for the first three mental health care outpatient       visits of a veteran in a calendar year for which the veteran       would otherwise be required to pay a copayment under the laws       administered by the Secretary.        ``(b) Copayment for Medications.--The prohibition under       subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to the imposition       or collection of copayments for medications pursuant to       section 1722A of this title.        ``(c) Mental Health Care Outpatient Visit Defined.--In this       section, the term `mental health care outpatient visit' means       an outpatient visit with a qualified mental health       professional for the primary purpose of seeking mental health       care or treatment for substance abuse disorder.''.        (b) Applicability.--The amendments made by subsection (a)       shall apply with respect to mental health care outpatient       visits occurring on or after the date that is 180 days after       the date of the enactment of this Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 7589, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, as we all know, September is Suicide Prevention  Awareness Month. I hope everyone has the new crisis hotline number,  988, saved on their phones. If you or a veteran you care about is in  crisis, please dial 988, and press 1 to reach trained responders at the  Veterans Crisis Line. Again, let me repeat the number. Dial 988 and  press 1 to reach trained responders at the Veterans Crisis Line.   One component of a public health approach to veteran suicide  prevention is ensuring that all of our Nation's heroes have access to  timely, high-quality, effective mental health care.   Madam Speaker, I am so pleased to bring up my bill, H.R. 7589, as  amended, the Reduce and Eliminate Mental Health Outpatient Veteran  Copays or REMOVE Copays Act. We reported this bill favorably out of the  Veterans' Affairs Committee last week on a bipartisan voice vote. I  thank Ranking Member Bost for his support of this bill.   H.R. 7589 turns a legislative proposal from the Department of  Veterans Affairs into a law that will make every enrolled veteran's  first three outpatient mental health appointment at VA free every year.  We know that what may seem like low copays can, in fact, be significant  financial barriers for many veterans. Our goal is to knock down all  barriers for veterans seeking and accessing mental health care at the  VA.                                time  2015    VA strongly supports this bill, as do veterans service organizations  and  [[Page H8186]]  mental health groups. If we can enact this into law, VA will be the  first of hopefully all Federal healthcare programs to eliminate copays  for mental health care every year in this way and get people the help  they need.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  vital piece of legislation, H.R. 7589, as amended, the REMOVE Copays  Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, again, I ask all my colleagues to join me  in passing H.R. 7589, as amended. I do thank my colleague, the ranking  member. It is an example of standing our ground where we must and  finding common ground where we can.   Lastly, I close by saying, please dial 988 and press 1 to reach  trained responders at the Veterans Crisis Line.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 1198) to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve and  expand the Solid Start program of the Department of Veterans Affairs,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1198         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Solid Start Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. SOLID START PROGRAM OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS                     AFFAIRS.         (a) In General.--Chapter 63 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new       subchapter:          ``SUBCHAPTER II--OTHER OUTREACH PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES       ``Sec. 6320. Solid Start program         ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall carry out a program,       to be known as the `Solid Start program', under which the       Secretary shall--        ``(1) build the capacity of the Department to efficiently       and effectively respond to the queries and needs of veterans       who have recently separated from the Armed Forces; and        ``(2) systemically integrate and coordinate efforts to       assist veterans, including efforts--        ``(A) to proactively reach out to newly separated veterans       to inform them of their eligibility for programs of and       benefits provided by the Department; and        ``(B) to connect veterans in crisis to resources that       address their immediate needs.        ``(b) Activities of the Solid Start Program.--(1) The       Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense,       shall carry out the Solid Start program of the Department       by--        ``(A) collecting up-to-date contact information during       transition classes or separation counseling for all members       of the Armed Forces who are separating from the Armed Forces,       while explaining the existence and purpose of the Solid Start       program;        ``(B) calling each veteran, regardless of separation type       or characterization of service, three times within the first       year after separation of the veteran from the Armed Forces;        ``(C) providing information about the Solid Start program       on the website of the Department and in materials of the       Department, especially transition booklets and other       resources;        ``(D) ensuring calls are truly tailored to the needs of       each veteran's unique situation by conducting quality       assurance tests;        ``(E) prioritizing outreach to veterans who have accessed       mental health resources prior to separation from the Armed       Forces;        ``(F) providing women veterans with information that is       tailored to their specific health care and benefit needs;        ``(G) as feasible, providing information on access to State       and local resources, including Vet Centers and veterans       service organizations; and        ``(H) gathering and analyzing data assessing the       effectiveness of the Solid Start program.        ``(2) The Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of       Defense, may carry out the Solid Start program by--        ``(A) encouraging members of the Armed Forces who are       transitioning to civilian life to authorize alternate points       of contact who can be reached should the member be       unavailable during the first year following the separation of       the member from the Armed Forces; and        ``(B) following up missed phone calls with tailored       mailings to ensure the veteran still receives similar       information.        ``(3) In this subsection:        ``(A) The term `Vet Center' has the meaning given that term       in section 1712A(h) of this title.        ``(B) The term `veterans service organization' means an       organization recognized by the Secretary for the       representation of veterans under section 5902 of this       title.''.        (b) Conforming Amendments.--Chapter 63 of such title, as       amended by subsection (a), is further amended--        (1) by inserting before section 6301 the following:                ``Subchapter I--Outreach Services Program'';       and        (2) in sections 6301, 6303, 6304, 6305, 6306, and 6307, by       striking ``this chapter'' each place it appears and inserting       ``this subchapter''.        (c) Clerical Amendments.--The table of sections at the       beginning of chapter 63 of such title is amended--        (1) by inserting before the item relating to section 6301       the following new item:                ``subchapter i--outreach services program'';       and        (2) by adding at the end the following new items:           ``subchapter ii--other outreach programs and activities  ``6320. Solid Start program.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on S. 1198.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise to support S. 1198, the bipartisan, bicameral,  Solid Start Act.   This bill is led by Senator Hassan, and in the House, this  legislative effort is led by my Veterans Affairs' Committee colleague,  Representative Slotkin.   Now, we know that the transition from Active-Duty service to veteran  status can bring not only new opportunities, but also substantial  adjustment and stress. For some veterans, it can pose serious mental  health challenges. In fact, the first year of transitioning out of  military service is a very high-risk period for veteran suicide.   VA initiated its Solid Start program to address the challenges new  veterans may face during this period. VA now  [[Page H8187]]  contacts veterans at three different periods in that first year to  check in, remind veterans of benefits and services for which they are  eligible, and connect them to resources.   Women veterans, like all veterans, deserve to know about all of the  benefits and services they have earned with no exceptions. I have heard  today that some Republican Members of this House are suddenly looking  to oppose this veteran suicide prevention bill, and all because it has  16 words that simply ensure women veterans are told about the range of  benefits and services for which they are eligible; 16 words, when we  are talking about 16 veteran suicide deaths a day.   We are talking about benefits like the GI bill, and compensation for  toxic exposure presumptions, breast cancer screening, treatment for  military sexual trauma, and, yes, the freedom to discuss their options  around pregnancy.   All benefits they have earned through their service because they  chose to serve our Nation. Well, I would say to my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle to take your fight against women veterans  elsewhere.   Criminalizing, infantilizing, and denying women veterans--take your  fight elsewhere.   There is no bar that prevents VA providers from discussing a single  benefit with male veterans, but my colleagues want a double standard  for women veterans. This is about two lines in an entire bill meant to  help veterans who have recently left Active Duty. All veterans.   Republicans won't pass this bill unless we delete women from it. I  refuse to do that. Women veterans are veterans.   A conversation with a woman veteran about coming to the VA could  prevent her death from suicide. It could also prevent needless  suffering and possible death from health conditions, including  pregnancy.   Republicans have gotten so extreme with their fear of women having  autonomy over their own bodies and lives that they are willing to play  political games with veterans' lives and tank a veteran suicide  prevention bill.   I would also remind those considering blocking this bill that this  very same language has already passed in the House. Back on June 23 of  this year, this Chamber passed the STRONG Veterans Act of 2022. It  passed under a simple voice vote.   The Senate unanimously passed the Solid Start Act after VA's new rule  on abortion counseling and services had been announced.   September is National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, and this  legislation would help us better connect veterans with the resources  needed to save lives. Sadly, each day, we are losing roughly 16  veterans to suicide.   I am not willing to let 16 words about women's freedom to discuss  their own benefits contained in this legislation prevent us from saving  the lives of 16 veterans who die by suicide each day. I thank Senator  Hassan and Representative Slotkin for their work on this important  issue, and I am pleased we could take up this bill during Suicide  Prevention Month.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on S.  1198, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me just respond, that every day my colleagues are making threats  to file a lawsuit to stop the interim final rule. Like the ranking  member believes, as do many on his side of the aisle, that the interim  final rule is illegal based on the 1992 law. I will remind him that in  1996, Congress authorized the VA Secretary to define the medical  benefits package. So I disagree with his interpretation of this interim  final rule as being illegal.   Let me mention one thing further, that I have not seen any lawsuit  yet filed, even though he asserted that he would seek to have this rule  stayed. I am assuming that the delay in filing, since the hearing that  we had, is because he is still looking for a perfect judge to hear it.   In the meantime, they are highjacking this opportunity to once again  blind and gag women veterans under the premise that veterans should not  be allowed to know the healthcare options and benefits that are  available to them.   This is not only an insult to veterans but to the veterans service  organizations that have endorsed and supported this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan  (Ms. Slotkin), my good friend who serves on the Disability Assistance  and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains.    Madam Speaker, before I yield an additional 3 minutes to  the gentlewoman from Michigan, let  [[Page H8189]]  me just say that if the minority is so insistent and is fervent in  their belief that this interim final rule is illegal, I do not  understand why there has been no lawsuit filed to enjoin the rule.   This is very peculiar that with such passion and with such fervor  they argue that this rule is illegal.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan  (Ms. Slotkin).    Madam Speaker, what the gentleman from Texas is  suggesting that we do is delete women from S. 1198. That, I will not  do.   Yes, I strongly believe in Article I. The accusation that Secretary  McDonough issued a radical rule, well, what is this so-called radical  rule he is mentioning that he has issued? The rule that Secretary  McDonough issued, the interim final rule, says that abortion is  available based on the 1996 law, which gave him the authority to define  medical benefits available at the VA. That is very clear what Congress  did.   It is under that authority that this Secretary has made not a radical  rule but simply a rule which allows veteran women to enjoy the same  rights that they had when they were serving in the military as Active- Duty servicemembers. Women serving in the military have access to  abortions when they have been raped, when they are victims of incest,  and, yes, when their pregnancies pose a danger to their life.  [[Page H8190]]    Who is trying to play God here are the Members on the other side of  the aisle who wish to deny women who have worn the cloth of this  country, who have served our country, who fought for all of our  freedoms, to deny them the freedom to be able to consider the full  range of medical procedures that they need in order to preserve their  own life.   What is extreme here is that they want to deny women to even be able  to access abortion counseling, counseling which may save their lives.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, again, I ask for my colleagues to join me  in passing S. 1198.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8510) to amend title 38, United States Code, to make certain  improvements to the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower  Protection of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8510         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthening Whistleblower       Protections at the Department of Veterans Affairs Act''.       SEC. 2.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 8510, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 8510, as amended, the Strengthening Whistleblower  Protections at the Department of Veterans Affairs Act, is an important  bill that will protect and support VA employees who report wrongdoing  within the Department.   I commend Representatives Chris Pappas and Tracey Mann, the chairman  and ranking member of our Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations,  for their work over the past few years on this issue.   The subcommittee has been tireless in its examination of VA policies  and procedures for protecting whistleblowers and disciplining those who  retaliate against them. When retaliation occurs, VA must make whole a  whistleblower who was unfairly punished for speaking truth to power.  This is not only the right thing to do; it is the law.   During the subcommittee's hearings on this issue, we heard firsthand  accounts from several individuals who experienced long waits for  justice despite confirmed findings of retaliation. VA can and must do  more to protect whistleblowers.   I support Chairman Pappas and Ranking Member Mann's bipartisan  legislation. It would promote independence and strengthen the mission  of VA's Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection.   It would also streamline duplicative investigations and send a clear  message that retaliation against those who report wrongdoing will not  be tolerated.   This bill has the support of several national organizations that  advocate on behalf of government whistleblowers and was favorably  reported by the full Veterans' Affairs Committee last week.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  New Hampshire (Mr. Pappas), the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations for the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, I am prepared  to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 8510, as amended, the Strengthening Whistleblower  Protections at the Department of Veterans Affairs Act, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2794) to amend title 38, United States Code, to increase  automatic maximum coverage under the Servicemembers' Group Life  Insurance program and the Veterans' Group Life Insurance program, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2794         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Supporting Families of the       Fallen Act''.       SEC. 2. INCREASE IN AUTOMATIC MAXIMUM COVERAGE UNDER                     SERVICEMEMBERS' GROUP LIFE INSURANCE AND                     VETERANS' GROUP LIFE INSURANCE.         (a) In General.--Section 1967(a)(3)(A)(i) of title 38,       United States Code, is amended by striking ``$400,000'' and       inserting ``$500,000''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall take effect on the later of--        (1) the date that is 60 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act; or        (2) the date on which the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       determines that--        (A) the amount for which a member will be insured pursuant       to the amendment made by subsection (a) and the premiums for       such amount are administratively and actuarially sound for       the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance program under       subchapter III of chapter 19 of title 38, United States Code,       and the Veterans' Group Life Insurance program under section       1977 of such title; and        (B) the increase in such amount carried out pursuant to the       amendment will not result in such programs operating at a       loss.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 2794.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, life insurance is designed to offer protection from  loss and serves as a death benefit. For a veteran or servicemember,  VA's Veterans' Group Life Insurance offers security and confidence that  loved ones will be covered and made financially whole in the event a  source of income is lost.   While no amount of money can replace the life of a beloved family  member, VA's Servicemembers' and Veterans' Group Life Insurance exists  to provide an affordable option to provide a fiscal shield for  survivors.   Neither insurance program has experienced a coverage limit increase  since 2005. This bill increases the maximum amount of coverage for  Servicemembers' and Veterans' Group Life Insurance by $100,000, which  means expanded coverage of up to $500,000 for each option.   Madam Speaker, I support this bill, I urge all of my colleagues to do  the same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, I am prepared  to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank all the folks that came together  for this bill, and I ask all my colleagues to join me in passing S.  2794, which upon passage today will be sent on to the President's desk  for signature.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
