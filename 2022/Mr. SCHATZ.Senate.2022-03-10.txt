 Madam President, I respect my colleagues' desires to take  care of the people and the needs of their State, and I agree there is a  need--not just in this State but for a number of States that have been  impacted by disasters in recent years.   We must pass a disaster supplemental to provide funding for States  fairly and based on need. We wish that the supplemental were in this  bill, but it was not agreed to by Republicans in the House and the  Senate. Looking ahead, we ought to pass a bill to provide $2 billion  and permanently authorize the CDBG-DR program.   As for pay-fors--this is an important point--the spectrum sale funds  that my colleagues suggested as a pay-for are already spoken for. That  has already been used as a pay-for in previous bills, so we can't  double count; and so, unfortunately, I urge my colleagues to vote no.  Thank you.    Mr. President, I have seven requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                         committee on armed services    The Committee on Armed Services is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Thursday, March 10, 2022, at 8 a.m., to  conduct a hearing.                  committee on energy and natural resources    The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources is authorized to meet  during the session of the Senate on Thursday, March 10, 2022, at 10  a.m., to conduct a hearing.                        committee on foreign relations    The Committee on Foreign Relations is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Thursday, March 10, 2022, at 9:30 a.m., to  conduct a hearing.           committee on homeland security and governmental affairs    The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is  authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on Thursday, March  10, 2022, at 10:15 a.m., to conduct a hearing on nominations.                          committee on the judiciary    The Committee on The Judiciary is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Thursday, March 10, 2022, at 9 a.m., to  conduct an executive business meeting.                       select committee on intelligence    The Select Committee on Intelligence is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Thursday, March 10, 2022, at 12 p.m., to  conduct an open hearing.                       select committee on intelligence    The Select Committee on Intelligence is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Thursday, March 10, 2022, to conduct a closed  hearing.                            ____________________
