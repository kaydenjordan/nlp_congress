 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dave and  Jenny Marrs of Bentonville, AR, on being named National Angels in  Adoption honorees by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute,  CCAI.   The CCAI is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, and I was  honored to nominate Dave and Jenny for their work to support and  promote adoption and other critical services for children in Arkansas  and around the world.   Since 2001, the CCAI has played a vital role in eliminating barriers  standing between orphaned and foster children becoming part of a loving  family. As the CCAI's signature public awareness program, Angels in  Adoption annually recognizes outstanding individuals, families, and  organizations that have made extraordinary contributions to adoption  and child welfare.   Dave and Jenny are the parents of five children, including Sylvie  whom they adopted from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They had  always known they wanted to adopt and, in 2012, began the process to  make Sylvie part of their family. It only took a few months for Sylvie  to legally became their child, but the couple had no idea how difficult  it would be to bring her home to Arkansas when international challenges  brought the process to a halt. Shortly after their visit to the Congo,  the Congolese Government shut down adoptions. Dave and Jenny were  devasted, but the hardships only strengthened their resolve to rescue  their daughter. It was during that process that my office first met the  Marrs family, and I am pleased we were able to advocate for them with  the U.S. State Department and Embassy officials. After more than 600  days, their Sylvie finally arrived home.   Inspired by their newest addition to the family, Dave and Jenny  developed a passion for orphan care, family preservation, and adoption.  The family started a nonprofit blueberry farm in northwest Arkansas as  a way to help fund a program to educate orphaned and at-risk teenage  boys in Marondera, Zimbabwe. They also advocate for children in need,  including working closely with the philanthropic organization Help One  Now to empower families in developing nations through capable local  leaders.   The Marrs family has traveled the world to see firsthand the extreme  poverty and truly dark circumstances facing parentless children around  the globe. While visiting the Congo, the couple witnessed extreme  starvation in the orphanage where their daughter Sylvie was living.  This shocked Dave and Jenny, launching them into action. They organized  an online raffle to raise money to feed the kids and their program was  so successful it was able to feed three orphanages for an entire month.  The Marrses have also used their platform on their hit HGTV show  ``Fixer to Fabulous'' to help spread awareness about adoption and share  their journey with viewers.   It was a privilege to nominate Dave and Jenny for their exemplary  work that led to this well-deserved national honor, and I believe I  speak for all Arkansans when I say they have made our State incredibly  proud. They join influential and deserving members of this community,  including Mohammed Ali and First Lady Laura Bush, as recipients of this  important recognition. I am grateful for the life-changing efforts Dave  and Jenny Marrs, as well as  [[Page S6941]]  their wonderful children Nathan, Ben, Sylvie, Charlotte, and Luke, have  contributed to shine a light on this truly worthy and necessary  cause.                            ____________________
