 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because, after 6 months, it  is clear that tax reform is working for the American people.   Since President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law in  December, we have seen Americans reap the benefits of a growing  economy. The numbers don't lie.   Here are just a few of the things that we have seen in the last 6  months: 1 million jobs have been created; the unemployment rate is at  its lowest point in 18 years; and consumer confidence is at its highest  point in over 17 years.   The naysayers can continue to claim that tax reform isn't working for  everyday Americans, but, given these numbers, I find that hard to  believe. In reality, tax reform is helping America be the best place in  the world to do business, and I look forward to continuing to work here  in the House with my colleagues to give all Americans the opportunity  to succeed in this thriving economy.                            ____________________
