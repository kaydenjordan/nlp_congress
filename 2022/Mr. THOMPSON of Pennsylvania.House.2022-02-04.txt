 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember  the life of Martha Banda, a lifetime resident of Johnstown,  Pennsylvania, who passed away in January surrounded by family. She was  87 years old.   One of Martha's biggest accomplishments was serving the Johnstown  community as the first Democratic woman to be elected to the Johnstown  City Council. From there, Martha was an elected member of the  Democratic State Committee and served as an appointed member and  chairperson of the Johnstown Housing Authority and secretary of the  Cambria County War Memorial Authority.   Martha's role as a public servant continued when she was elected by  council to serve as deputy mayor of Johnstown for 4 years.   Outside of Martha's role in politics, Martha was a faithful member of  St. Benedict Parish, where she served in a variety of roles.   Martha was always giving back to the community, serving as a member  of the Salvation Army Advisory Board as well as president of the Moxham  Citizen's Association in 1979. Martha also served on the Bottle Works  Board and was a member of the American Association of University Women,  Quota Club, the Chrysanthemum Society, and the Pennsylvania Association  of School Retirees.   Martha's impact on the greater Johnstown community will not be  forgotten. My prayers are with Martha's family and her friends.                            ____________________
