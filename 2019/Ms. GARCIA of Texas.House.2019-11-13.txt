 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1773) to award a Congressional Gold Medal,  collectively, to the women in the United States who joined the  workforce during World War II, providing the aircraft, vehicles,  weaponry, ammunition and other material to win the war, that were  referred to as ``Rosie the Riveter'', in recognition of their  contributions to the United States and the inspiration they have  provided to ensuing generations, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1773         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Rosie the Riveter       Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Over 70 years ago there was a call to action, a demand       for workers to fill the vacancies left by the men who went to       fight in the war.        (2) More than 6 million women answered the call then,       entering the workforce during World War II and providing the       equipment, weaponry and ammunition to achieve final victory       and end the war.        (3) These women left their homes to work or volunteer full-      time in factories, farms, shipyards, airplane factories,       banks, and other institutions in support of the military       overseas.        (4) They worked with the United Service Organizations and       the American Red Cross, drove trucks, riveted airplane parts,       collected critical materials, rolled bandages, and served on       rationing boards.        (5) Our ``Rosie the Riveter'', the women who worked and       sacrificed to strengthen this country during World War II,       are among the greatest living heroines in the United States.        (6) These women persevered, despite often facing harassment       from their male colleagues and disapproval from their male       family members, and all the while continued to maintain their       ``other jobs'' as caretakers of children and their       households.        (7) Minority women also overcame long-held policies of       discrimination and made significant contributions to the war       effort.        (8) Because of the ``Rosies'', Federal, State, and local       agencies coordinated with business owners to develop       childcare programs and other supports for working mothers.        (9) The example that these women set during World War II       continues to inspire us and blaze a path for the working       women and young girls of today.        (10) Specifically, the images of ``Rosie the Riveter'' and       the phrase ``We Can Do It'' continue to symbolize the       empowerment of women today, representing patriotic women who       want to serve and strengthen their country, and to inspire       young girls to become ``21st Century Rosies'' by aspiring to,       and attaining positions of leadership in all walks of life in       America.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         (a) Rosie the Riveter.--The term ``Rosie the Riveter''       includes any female individual who held employment or       volunteered in support of the war efforts during World War       II.

DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   During World War II, American women entered the workforce in  unprecedented numbers. More than 6 million women answered the call to  duty, filling jobs in factories, farms, shipyards, airplane factories,  banks, and other institutions left vacant by the men who went to fight  overseas.   These women, despite facing harassment and disapproval from their  male colleagues and family members--and, in the case of minority women,  long-held policies of discrimination--nonetheless persevered to provide  critical equipment, weaponry, and ammunition  [[Page H8810]]  to the war effort, all while continuing to serve as primary caretakers  for children and as heads of household.   The hard work and sacrifices of these women during the war also paved  the way for the development of childcare programs and other Federal-,  State-, and local-level policies to support working mothers and  families.   Today, the iconic image of Rosie the Riveter, first popularized as  part of a wartime recruitment campaign for female workers, continues to  be a symbol of female empowerment and inspiration for women who wish to  serve and strengthen their country.   H.R. 1773 recognizes the brave, patriotic women who stepped up to  serve their country in its time of need and whose leadership and spirit  of empowerment continues to inspire ensuing generations.   I thank Ms. Speier for joining me in introducing this bill this  Congress, and I urge Members to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. DeSaulnier).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I am pleased to bring forward a bill celebrating women from all walks  of life who, in difficult, dark days chose to rise to the occasion and  serve their country. They did not let themselves be confined to archaic  notions of what women can or cannot do, nor did they let others dictate  what a woman's place is in society.  [[Page H8811]]    Let me remind my colleagues that these Rosies were also Rositas, who  came from all parts of our country, including our Hispanic community.   I would like to read from an interview with Aurora Orozco, one of the  Rositas from Cuero, Texas, who laid out how so many Latinas  contributed.   ``In the valley there were these packing sheds where they packed  tomatoes and lettuce . . . there were not enough men to work, so they  started hiring women. So that is when it started to change a little  more in women's lives. They were calling from the government for women  to go and work in the factories . . . then they started calling women  into the Army.   ``And first it was like, oh, my goodness, `dios mio,' how can these  women go over there by themselves? Everybody was shocked because we  were not used to seeing women leave the house. You didn't leave the  house until you were married. With senoritas, everything was so strict  and then came this change . . . and I think that was wonderful because  it opened a new world for women. It showed that women can be  independent. This was a real break for women.''   So let us honor the example these women set and continue to blaze a  path for the working women of today and future leaders of tomorrow.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Speier), the sponsor of this legislation.                                time  1400     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I send to the desk a concurrent  resolution and ask unanimous consent for its immediate consideration in  the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.
