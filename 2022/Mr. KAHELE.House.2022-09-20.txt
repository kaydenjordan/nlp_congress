 Madam Speaker, I rise today to continue to honor  September as Hawaiian History Month in my home State of Hawaii. Today,  I am honoring Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalaniana'ole. Prince Kuhio was the  second Native Hawaiian to represent Hawaii in Congress, when he was  elected in 1903, and he served for two decades until his death in 1922.   He is best known for the establishment of the Hawaiian Civic Club of  Honolulu in 1918 and the passage of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act  in 1920. Throughout his life, Prince Kuhio, revered by Native Hawaiians  as Ke Ali'i Maka'ainana, a prince for the people, was a tenacious  leader and used his  [[Page H7978]]  voice to preserve and strengthen the Hawaiian people.   Prince Kuhio championed the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, which was  signed into law by President Warren G. Harding in 1921. The Act enables  Native Hawaiians to return to their lands in order to support self- sufficiency and self-determination. This Act created a homeland to  build homes, farms, ranches, and otherwise engage in economic  activities.    This legacy of championing Native Hawaiian causes and preserving  Native Hawaiian history is what Prince Kuhio is most remembered for,  and I am proud to continue that legacy here in the United States House  of Representatives.                            ____________________
