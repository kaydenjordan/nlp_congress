 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 230.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call be waived.    Mr. President, this week the Senate will continue to  promptly and reasonably consider a number of well-qualified nominees  for important positions.   Several weeks ago we put an end to 2 years of unprecedented,  systematic partisan obstruction that had kept abundantly qualified  nominees on the sidelines for no substantive reason. The Senate took a  modest but important step to turn back toward the institutional  traditions that had shaped our work in nominations throughout our  history. We put in place a reform to speed up the postcloture floor  time that we spend debating on lower level nominations--or, in many  cases, I should say, supposedly debating them.   Since then we have been able to fill several important posts in the  executive branch, along with seats on the bench, at a more reasonable  pace. In many cases, these unobjectionable candidates have received the  overwhelming support they deserve--90 to 8, 90 to 8, 95 to 3.   Over the next few days, four more will receive consideration on the  floor. We will begin by processing the first of two more well-qualified  nominees to our Nation's district courts, such as Michael J. Truncale,  of Texas, to serve as U.S. district judge for the Eastern District of  Texas.  [[Page S2777]]    Mr. Truncale is a graduate of Lamar University, the University of  North Texas, and the Southern Methodist University School of Law. Over  more than three decades of private practice, he has amassed a  distinguished record in both litigation and appellate law. In addition,  Mr. Truncale has served on the board of regents for the Texas State  University System and the Texas Prepaid Higher Education Tuition Board  in the Texas Comptroller's Office.   His nomination has earned a well-qualified rating from the ABA and  has twice been favorably reported by our colleagues on the Judiciary  Committee. So I hope each of our colleagues will join me and add Mr.  Truncale's nomination to the growing list of uncontroversial nominees  passed in an orderly, bipartisan fashion.   Following consideration of the Truncale nomination, we will vote on  Kenneth Lee's nomination to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and  Wendy Vitter's nomination to serve as U.S. District Judge for the  Eastern District of Louisiana.   Then we will consider the nomination of Brian Bulatao, of Texas, to  serve as Under Secretary of State for Management. This is, effectively,  the COO job at the Department of State, responsible for such critical  things as embassy security. His nomination was first submitted to the  Senate in June of 2018, nearly a year ago.   Following those four individuals, the Senate will also consider this  week the nomination of Jeffrey Rosen to serve as our next Deputy  Attorney General. Mr. Rosen is a graduate of Northwestern University  and Harvard Law School. He built a strong record in private practice as  a litigator before entering public service in 2003. Prior to his  current position, he has served as the Deputy Secretary at the  Department of Transportation and at the Office of Management and Budget  and as an adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Law Center.   The American people deserve that their Department of Justice be fully  staffed, fully operational, and fully committed to upholding our  Nation's laws. So I hope that each of my colleagues reviews this  impressive nominee and then votes to confirm him this week.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all  postcloture time on the Truncale nomination expire at 10:45 a.m.,  Tuesday, May 14. I further ask unanimous consent that, if confirmed,  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 202, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 203, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1436, submitted earlier  today.    I further ask unanimous consent that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  May 14; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour  be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  morning business be closed, and that the Senate proceed to executive  session and resume consideration of the Truncale nomination; finally,  that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the  weekly conference meetings.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:29 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, May 14, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
