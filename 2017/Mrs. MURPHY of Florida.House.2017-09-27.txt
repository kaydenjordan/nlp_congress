 Mr. Speaker, September is Suicide Prevention  [[Page H7569]]  Month, and I rise to bring awareness to the pressing issue of veteran  suicide.   When our servicemembers go overseas, they bravely and selflessly risk  their own lives for the greater good. But when they return home, our  veterans face new adversities. Many are confronted by intense emotional  distress, including depression and post-traumatic stress. Others  struggle to readjust to civilian life or to reintegrate into their  families and their social networks.   Unfortunately, too many veterans succumb to their mental anguish.  America loses 20 Americans every day to suicide. It is time we step up  and be there for them and provide them the support they deserve.   I encourage anyone who knows a veteran--whether a family member, a  coworker, or a friend--to reach out. A simple gesture of kindness can  make all the difference in the life of a veteran going through a  difficult time.   I will do my part in Congress, fighting for more and better resources  to support our veterans. Veterans fought for us. Now it is time we  fight for them.
