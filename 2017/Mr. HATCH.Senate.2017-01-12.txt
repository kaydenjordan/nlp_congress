 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                               ObamaCare Repeal     Mr. President, several years ago, Democrats in Congress  pulled out all the stops to pass the so-called Affordable Care Act and  force the system we now call ObamaCare on the American people. They  passed the law on a purely partisan basis and without any regard for  public opinion. Quite simply, it was one of the most blatant exercises  in pure partisanship in our Nation's history. It deepened partisan  divides in Washington and around the country and contributed to the  cynicism many have about whether their government is actually paying  attention to their needs. Worst of all, in the years since the passage  of ObamaCare, the American people have been paying the price in the  form of skyrocketing costs, fewer choices, burdensome mandates, and  unfair taxes.   For 7 years, many of us in Congress--virtually all of us on the  Republican side--have been working to right what has gone wrong under  the Affordable Care Act. We have pledged to our constituents that,  given the opportunity, we would repeal ObamaCare and replace it with  reforms more worthy of the American people. Those promises are among  the biggest reasons why we Republicans are now fortunate enough to find  ourselves in control of Congress and, very soon, the White House.   Last night we took a big step in the effort to repeal and replace  ObamaCare. With the budget resolution passed, many in Washington and in  the media are talking about what happens next. We are hearing a lot of  discussion about the timing of our repeal-and-replace efforts, with  some arguing that we should hit the brakes and solve every problem in  advance of taking another vote. My view is that the repeal of ObamaCare  cannot wait. The American people need us to act now. While there is  still some debate as to what our replacement plan should look like, a  majority of Senators voted last night to give us the tools to take the  next steps to repeal and replace ObamaCare. The American people have  entrusted us with the power to do just that.   We could spend the next several months coming up with more slogans  and analogies, but this is not a campaign. The elections have been won,  and it is time to do what our constituents have sent us here to do. I  am not saying we need to put off the replacement effort. On the  contrary, I think it is important that the legislation we draft  pursuant to the budget reconciliation instructions include as many  sensible health reforms as possible, keeping in mind the limitations  that exist with our rules and the necessary vote count.   We should definitely work on making the largest possible downpayment  on the ObamaCare replacement with the budget reconciliation bill. That  downpayment should include measures that give individuals and families  more control over their health care decisions and empower States to do  more of the heavy lifting when it comes to regulating health care. In  addition, we need to provide for a smooth transition period so we can  maintain some stability in the health insurance markets and ensure that  we are not leaving Americans who have insurance under the current  system out in the cold.   As chairman of one of the primary committees with jurisdiction over  these matters, I have been working closely with my House counterparts-- Chairman Kevin Brady of the House Ways and Means Committee and Chairman  Greg Walden of the House Energy and Commerce Committee--to develop  proposals on the matters that fall within our purviews. We have been  talking with stakeholders throughout the country and working through  the various problems that exist. That work will continue unabated as we  work on the immediate repeal effort and into the future. I am quite  certain that my friend who chairs the Senate HELP Committee has been  similarly engaged in addressing the draconian insurance regulations  that were imposed under ObamaCare, as well as the other parts of the  law that are within that committee's jurisdiction.   In other words, the work to replace ObamaCare is ongoing, and we hope  to have some initial elements ready to include in the budget  reconciliation package. That work will continue once the repeal has  been passed and signed into law so that we can help ensure that  affordable health care options exist for Americans. We do not need to  wait until every single replacement measure is drafted and agreed upon  before moving forward. Instead, we need the incoming administration to  add to our current efforts and work with us to produce a full  replacement plan and then to execute it. I look forward to continuing  to work with President-Elect Trump and his team.   The path forward on replacing ObamaCare could end up taking many  forms. We could draft and pass a series of limited reforms to replace  ObamaCare piece by piece or we could pull together a full and  comprehensive replacement package that puts all the necessary changes  into law at once. I think there are merits and potential pitfalls with  either approach. That is something we need to consider as we move  forward, but it is not a decision that needs to be made before we can  keep the promises we all made to our constituents to repeal ObamaCare.   To be sure, replacing ObamaCare is going to be a difficult process;  however, with a new and more cooperative administration in place, I  have every confidence we can accomplish these important objectives  without imposing artificial deadlines or goalposts or putting the  repeal process on hold. All of this is possible so long as we remain  committed to the principles that have guided most of our efforts thus  far. For example, in my view, the new reforms need to be patient- centered, not government-driven. They need to recognize the reality of  the marketplace and the benefits of competition. Perhaps most  importantly, any suitable reforms need to put the States back in charge  of regulating and overseeing health care policy. If the ObamaCare  experience has taught us anything, it is that when the Federal  Government gets a hold of something that is as consequential as health  care, it will overpromise results, overstep its authority, and  overregulate the subject matter.   As I have said a number of times, Utah is not California or  Massachusetts, and California and Massachusetts are not Utah. All of  our States face different challenges and have different needs. There is  no reason to begin with the premise that any single approach to health  care policy is what is best for the entire country. That is why I,  along with several of my colleagues, have been engaging with  stakeholders at the State level for quite some time as we work to craft  reforms and to put them in place. For example, next week the Senate  Finance  [[Page S304]]  Committee is hosting a roundtable discussion on Medicaid with some of  the most prominent Governors in the country. I am pleased that Energy  and Commerce chairman Greg Walden will join us for the discussion as  well. This meeting and others like it will give States the opportunity  to detail the challenges they face and how we can empower them to meet  those challenges instead of dictating solutions from offices here in  Washington, DC.   I believe all of my colleagues want to be judicious and methodical  with this undertaking. No one wants to act recklessly and do even more  damage to our Nation's health care system. Discussions and debates over  the substance of our ObamaCare replacement should continue. As I said,  they have been going on for some time now, and they are not going to  stop. But after last night, we have the tools we need to take the first  major step in this effort by repealing ObamaCare. In my view, we need  to take that step now.   Republicans are united in our desire to repeal ObamaCare. We have the  support of the American people to do just that, and I personally will  do all I can to deliver on that promise. I hope our friends on the  other side will work with us. If they will, I think we can come up with  an approach toward health care that not only will work but will be  better for our country but most importantly, better for our citizens,  better for the States that will manage a lot better than we will here,  and better for our citizens within those States.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from Rhode Island.
