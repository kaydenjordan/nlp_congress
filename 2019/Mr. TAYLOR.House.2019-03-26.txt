 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize two great  constituents of mine, Mason Daugherty and Eli Scott from McKinney,  Texas, on winning the 2019 C-SPAN Video Documentary Competition.   Their documentary, ``What It Means to Be an American: Citizen  Accountability in Government,'' highlights how the United States  Constitution intended to instill power with the American people and how  corruption in our system of government diverts power away from those  very individuals.   Like these impressive 11th graders from Imagine International Academy  of North Texas, I, too, believe power must rest with the people.  Working together, we can bring real change in Washington.   Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House of  Representatives join me in congratulating Mason Daugherty and Eli Scott  on their achievement.                            ____________________
