 Mr. President, I rise today to voice my concern about  attempts to undermine American institutions.   There is a difference between constructive efforts to ensure public  institutions are accountable and trying to cut down these foundational  institutions at their core.   Recently, our country commemorated National Police Week, and it was  an opportunity to show our gratitude and appreciation to the men and  women who put their lives on the line to keep our people and our  communities safe. Yet we continue to see those on the left trying to  villainize all law enforcement in this country.   President Biden and Speaker Pelosi, scared about their party's  dropping poll numbers, can keep trying to muffle their colleagues'  destructive comments, but what the Democrats have already said has  harmed our Nation's law enforcement.   We heard ``defund the police'' from many--too many--Democratic  elected officials.   During a CNN interview in June 2021, a Massachusetts Congresswoman  said:         I support a radical re-imagining of community safety and       public safety, which means reallocating and not further       investing in a carceral state.    A New York Congresswoman has called for the Federal Government to  apply pressure to disrupt the system in reference to police  departments.   Others have said time and time again that we must ``completely re- imagine what policing looks like in our country.''   What affect is this antipolice rhetoric having on those who swear to  serve and protect? Not surprisingly, we are seeing a drain on law  enforcement agencies. Numbers of law enforcement officers rose from  2014 to 2020; however, over the past 2 years, retirements and  resignations are climbing while recruitment numbers are down. Many of  our law enforcement agencies are receiving far fewer applications.   This is something that I directly discussed with Sergeant Tony  Conner, the president of the Omaha Police Officer's Association, when  we met recently. Application numbers for some Nebraska law enforcement  agencies are down 75  [[Page S2565]]  percent or more compared to just a few years ago.   Contributing to these challenges, police officers' jobs have also  become increasingly dangerous. Last year, we saw surges in violence and  aggression towards officers. Three hundred and forty-six police  officers were shot in the line of duty, and 130 of them were targeted  and shot in ambush-style attacks. In a recent CBS ``60 Minutes''  interview, FBI Director Christopher Wray said there had been a 59- percent increase in the murders of police officers, with 73--73-- officers killed in 2021. That is a rate of about one officer killed  every 5 days.   Without a doubt, Democrats' antipolice rhetoric has diminished morale  and eroded public trust in law enforcement. Maybe that was the goal.   But dwindling application numbers to join the force also are  contributing to rising crime all across this country. A report by the  Council on Criminal Justice found that the national violent crime rate  increased 44 percent from 2019 to 2021.   A recent Wall Street Journal editorial discussed efforts to address  rising crime in one of our Nation's cities--Seattle. According to the  editorial, Seattle city attorney Ann Davison's office found that 118  individuals were responsible for more than 2,400 crimes in Seattle over  the past 5 years. Yet, her efforts to hold repeat offenders accountable  are being stymied by some.   Because of a 2019 agreement signed by Davison's predecessor, certain  classes of misdemeanors in that community go to the community court,  and this court releases the accused after referring them to certain  support services.   The editorial states:         Seattle criminals get four tries in the Community Court       before they flunk out. Each can encompass multiple charges.       Repeat offenders see the lack of consequences as an       invitation to commit more crimes.    Davison is currently trying to renegotiate that deeply flawed 2019  agreement, but despite the rise in crime in Seattle, these negotiations  are at an impasse.   Problems like these aren't confined to the Emerald City. In L.A.,  Minneapolis, Chicago, Washington, DC, and other cities, liberal  prosecutors often fail to hold violent criminals accountable.   The impact on public safety is clear. CNN reports the following about  the increase in carjackings: In New York City, the number of  carjackings has quadrupled in the last 4 years. In Chicago, more than  1,800 carjackings were reported in 2021. Here in the Nation's Capitol,  Metropolitan Police confirmed that carjackings have tripled since 2019.   The administration's efforts to address the rise in this violent  crime are weak. I am supporting a resolution led by the senior Senator  from Louisiana that actually gets at what we should be doing. It  demands that the President work with Congress on a comprehensive  strategy that encourages the Department of Justice, the Department of  Homeland Security, as well as State and local law enforcement officers  to counter the rise in violent crime by reinforcing strong criminal  justice policies. The Senate should pass this.   Our law enforcement officers who wear the badge deserve our gratitude  and our support. The sacrifices they make and the sacrifices their  families make, keep us safe. We stand with our men and women in blue.   I yield the floor.                           Vote on Leaf Nomination
