 Madam President, the Republican leader knows I am a huge  fan of his. Every Thursday, we gather, along with Senator Gillibrand,  we gather in a Bible study, bipartisan Bible study. Most people think  we would never pray together, read the scripture together, much less  agree on anything, but we do that every week. We agree on a lot of  things. In this one area, I am afraid we don't see eye to eye, as he  knows.   As a leader prepared to lead the floor, I just want to remind us all  of this: Two weeks ago, the United Kingdom broke its record for the  highest recorded temperature multiple times, reaching a high of 105  degrees Fahrenheit. How high is that? They don't  [[Page S3844]]  have air conditioning in most places of England. They don't have air  conditioning--105 degrees. Airport runways that week were melting in  the United Kingdom. Railways in the United Kingdom were buckling from  the heat, with riders warned to stay home.   Over 1,100 people that week died in Spain and Portugal from heat- related causes. Wildfires in France forced about 30,000 people to  evacuate. Organizers planned to pour--listen to this--tens of thousands  of gallons of water on the course of the Tour De France big bicycle  race in order to keep the road from melting. And more than 40 million  people in the United States are under extreme heat warnings across, in  our country, the Great Plains and California.   Something like 60 million Americans will likely see temperatures at  or above 100 degrees. Last week, they actually did, as I understand it.  Nearly 60 percent of California has been dealing with excessive drought  while 20 percent--20 percent--of Texas experiences exceptional drought,  the most extreme level on the drought scale. Firefighters continue to  battle huge wildfires across the United States--12 States, no less-- wildfires as big as my State of Delaware.   The reason why we have put together legislation that actually  addresses these tale of horribles is because it is getting worse. The  scientists and people who we look to for advice on stuff like this say  it is not going to get better any time soon; it is going to get worse.   In Louisiana, you know what they lose from sea level rise every 100  minutes? They lose a piece of land the size of a football field. I will  say that again. In Louisiana, they lose a piece of land to the sea the  size of a football field--not every 100 days, not every 100 weeks-- every 100 minutes.   Something is happening here, and I think what it is, is exactly  clear. There is way too much carbon in the air. The question is, What  are we going to do about it? And there is something that we can do  about it that not only addresses the climate crisis so these young  pages sitting down here will not only have a planet to live on, but  some day, they will have kids and grandchildren, and there will be a  planet for them as well. That is why we have to do something.   Here is the good thing about the PACT Act that we will be voting on  later this week. It is paid for. Larry Summers--the former Secretary of  Treasury, former president of Harvard, renowned economist--basically  says this package is not only balanced in terms of its budgetary  effect, but in terms of its effect on inflation, it is actually  counterinflationary.   The idea that somehow the IRS would get more money to do their job,  let me say this: I have been on the Finance Committee for a number of  years here in the Senate. Every couple of years, we have the  Commissioner of the IRS come before us. I don't care if it is a  Democrat or Republican administration. They beg us to provide resources  for the IRS so they can do their jobs.   The people that actually get audited the most are actually poor  people. Folks that get audited the least are wealthy people, maybe the  big corporations. The IRS needs resources. They need human beings; they  need folks with the right skills; they need the kind of technology-- they want to do their jobs. If they do that, they can collect hundreds  of billions of dollars, not by raising taxes but by making sure people  are paying their fair share of taxes. That is what we are really trying  to do with this legislation. It is paid for. It actually works against  inflation.   It helps people, particularly people who happen to be older and  actually need access to pharmaceuticals. The legislation we have  actually says if you happen to be a senior citizen and you are on  Medicare Part D for the drug program, there is no way you are going to  pay over $2,000 in a year--no way. Today, you pay a lot more than that.  We put a cap on that.   But by the same token, as a Senator from a State where we actually  have a big interest in biopharmaceuticals--our whole area, including  Philadelphia, New Jersey, and so forth--we don't want to kill the goose  that lays the golden egg. We want to make sure they are still  successful. We don't want to stifle innovation in the biopharmaceutical  world. This legislation does not do that. It does not do that.   It does say with the jobs for which there is no competition, there  has to be some cap on the ability to raise the price of those drugs. I  think it is common sense. I think it is common sense.   Some of us have heard the term ``unforced error.'' My detractors have  sometimes said: I am guilty of making an unforced error. If truth were  known, we all make unforced errors. Our Republican friends made an  unforced error here. What they have done is they chose--because of  their anger or unhappiness with the agreement with Senator Manchin and  Senator Schumer to move forward and address climate change in a way  that is paid for and actually adds to economic job creation--they were  unhappy and, unfortunately, they, apparently, took their anger out on  the ability for us to move to legislation that actually helps the  veterans deal with injuries they suffered in their lives from being  exposed to toxic substances from these burn pits around the world.   I know a little bit about the military. I am the last Vietnam veteran  serving in the U.S. Senate. We had a bite out of this apple in  Southeast Asia in the Vietnam war. It was called Agent Orange. It was  called Agent Orange, and hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese were  exposed to Agent Orange. But a lot of folks in American service, men  and some women, as well, were exposed. They had all kinds of maladies.  And later on, they had questions that we are thinking about: Are we  going to make sure you are eligible for care from the VA and don't have  to pay for all of it out of their pocket? We have done that and, I  think, in a very appropriate way. We did it decades ago. I am  privileged to be a supporter of that, as were many of our colleagues,  Democratic and Republican.   We have a different kind of situation, but it is a similar situation  in that we have a bunch of veterans who served in places like  Afghanistan and other places where they breathed air that was toxic. It  is not their fault. And later on, they became sick. The question is,  What do we do about it?    The veteran service organizations have been very angry at our  Republican colleagues. I am glad our Republican friends have come back  and said: We realize we voted to derail the PACT Act to help veterans  from these burn pit injuries. We realize we maybe shouldn't have done  that. We all make mistakes. Everybody makes mistakes.   I am the only Democrat I know in this body who ever quotes Richard  Nixon. Richard Nixon used to say that the only people who don't make  mistakes are people who don't do anything. Think about that. That is  pretty good, huh? The only people who don't make mistakes are people  who don't do anything.   They made an unforced error. They voted in a way that was not  consistent with their interests and not consistent with the interests  of veterans, of which I am one.   They have an opportunity here--I will say this in a spiritual tone  here--they have an opportunity to atone for their sins, and my hope is  they are going to do that.   I hope at the same time as we do that, we will keep in mind this list  of horribles that just went down--going on in the face of the Earth  just a week or 2 ago. We have to do something about it. It is real. We  have to do something about it. Time is not on our side. Time is not on  the side of these young people here who are like 16, 17 years old.   I have one last point here. I am going to go back to what some people  say--I am privileged to chair the Committee on Environment and Public  Works. We have jurisdiction over clean air, clean water, climate  change, roads, highways, bridges, water, sanitation--a bunch of stuff,  good stuff. As a result of that, we have the opportunity to write  legislation that hopefully addresses a real cause, a real problem.   One of the problems we found in climate change is the biggest source  of carbon dioxide, the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions comes  from the cars, trucks, and vans that we drive, the vehicles that we  drive. That is the biggest source. There used to be--as Senator  Gillibrand knows--a bank robber, Willie Sutton. He used to rob a lot of  banks. He finally got caught. He was dragged into court, and  [[Page S3845]]  at trial, the judge said: Mr. Sutton, why do you rob banks?   Your Honor, I rob banks because that is where the money is.   One of the reasons why we want to encourage people in this country to  buy vehicles that don't spew out a lot of greenhouse gases is because  that is the biggest part of where our emissions are. Thirty percent of  greenhouse gases in this country come from cars, trucks, and vans. We  want to encourage people, as they are ready to buy a new vehicle, to  consider an electric vehicle.   One of the things that I really like about the bill that we are going  to be debating later this week is, we actually encourage people to buy  not just the new, expensive vehicles, but to buy used electric  vehicles. So the middle- and lower-income people who may not be able to  afford a new electric vehicle, they can buy one. If they want to be  good to the planet, kind to the planet, they can buy a used one. We  provide a modest tax cut for them.   The tax cuts, I might add, in the bill that we will take up later  this week are a lot more modest than they were originally. I think that  is a good thing.   Again, we all make unforced errors. I know I have, and I believe--I  say this lovingly--our Republican colleagues made a big one, and I  think they regret it. They have the opportunity to do something about  it and to do the right thing.   Let's do that. Let's do the right thing by veterans, and let's move  on. And then later this week, we will take up another challenge, and  that is, how do we save this planet and make sure that my kids, my  grandchildren, our grandchildren, have the opportunity to have a planet  that is worth growing up on?   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to extend my  congratulations and best wishes to Kim Brinkman on the occasion of her  retirement from the Senate disbursing office. For 34 years, Kim has  served this Chamber, its Members, and its staff with decency and grace.  We are lucky and grateful that Kim--some three decades ago as a recent  graduate from the University of Iowa--ventured to the library in Ames,  IA, and answered an ad placed in a newspaper to travel to our Nation's  [[Page S3859]]  Capital and begin work in the U.S. Senate.   Kim represents all that is great about public service--not just in  aspiration to serve our Nation, but in aspiration to change it, too.  When she first started at the disbursing office in October of 1987,  there were just two female Senators. Today, there are 24, in addition  to our first female Vice President. In the disbursing office itself,  Kim was one of only 10 women on staff when she began her decades of  service; she is now one of 45 women out of the office's 58 staff.   The journey to Washington, DC, was a long one for Kim--geographically  speaking. She comes from the town of Nevada, IA--the State where her  parents Harold and Jan Brinkman still reside. She has been sure to make  the trek and visit home, bringing along her daughter, Maya Caceres, a  recent graduate of the University of Kentucky. An active member of her  church and a frequent volunteer, she has managed to lay deep roots here  in our Nation's Capital.   Kim has been a kind, giving presence in the Senate for the past three  decades. A compendium of Capitol knowledge, we will surely miss her  sage advice and dutiful support. While her departure is a profound loss  for this institution, Kim deserves a restful and fulfilling retirement  following her years of extraordinary service.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have four requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
