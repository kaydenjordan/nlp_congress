 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  designation of South Lebanon as an Official City in Ohio. In accordance  with section 703.06 of the Revised Code of the State of Ohio, a  municipality that reaches 5,000 residents in the State of Ohio,  automatically becomes a city. Since 2000, the municipality of South  Lebanon has grown 151 percent and has reached a population of 6,384.   The growing population of South Lebanon also comes with a rich  history. South Lebanon is the oldest town in Warren County, OH, and was  also deemed one of the most important towns on the Little Miami River  in the late 1700s. In its early days of settlement, it was a stopping  place for many pioneers who were venturing across the country in search  of a new life. Today, that same town that was a place of possibility  and refuge to so many early pioneers has become a booming economic  power, bringing new jobs, good schools, and a strong sense of  community.   I am proud to see South Lebanon be recognized for its growth and  perseverance as it continues to expand, making Ohio a great place to  live and work.                            ____________________
