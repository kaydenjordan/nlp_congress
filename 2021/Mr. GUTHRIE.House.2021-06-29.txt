 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of  Jeffery Robert Halter. Not only was he my neighbor and a family friend,  but he was also a devoted husband to Kim, and director of constituent  services for my congressional office. Additionally, Jeff was a loving  father to Katherine Chelsey and Laura Leigh and supportive father-in- law to Andrew Smith and Austin Lowe.   Jeff was a proud Bowling Green, Kentucky, native. He graduated from  Bowling Green High School in 1983 and attended Samford University  School of Pharmacy where he graduated in 1989. As a prominent  pharmacist and owner of two community pharmacies, Jeff served many  patients in the local community and was always happy to help his  customers. He was also a member of Broadway United Methodist Church.   Jeff's contagious laugh and kindness will be remembered by all who  knew him. He loved the outdoors, but above all, he loved his family. In  addition to his wife and two daughters, Jeff is survived by his  parents, Charles Robert and Scottie Ann Halter; brother, Timothy Alan  Halter; and many other loving family members. Jeff left a positive  impact on our community and is greatly missed.                            ____________________
