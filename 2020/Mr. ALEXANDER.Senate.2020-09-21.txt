 Madam President, congratulations to my friend, Bill  Brock, who is celebrating his 90th birthday.   When I think of Bill, I think of a Tennessean who has served our  State and our country honorably for over a half century. Bill grew up  in Chattanooga and started his lifetime of service in the U.S. Navy. He  was then first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1962.  Bill served for three terms before being elected to the U.S. Senate in  1971, replacing Democrat Senator Albert Gore. After his distinguished  tenure in the Senate, Bill went on the serve as U.S. Trade  Representative and U.S. Secretary of Labor.   Bill was a force in the Republican Party, both nationally, serving as  chairman of the Republican National Committee, and in the State of  Tennessee. In fact, he was a pioneer in the transformation of our  Tennessee Republican Party; turning Tennessee from a Democratic  stronghold to a two-party State simply would not have happened without  Bill. He laid the foundation for a long lineage of Tennesseans that  include Howard Baker, Jr., Winfield Dunn, Fred Thompson, Bill Frist,  Bill Haslam, Bill Lee, and others who have served our State proudly and  left legacies of exceptional service to those who elected them.   It has been a pleasure to know Bill over the years; he has been a  champion of the principles that united us as Americans and has a strong  record of working with others to get results. I wish my friend the best  on the celebration of his 90th birthday and hope that his legacy serves  as an example to future Tennesseans seeking to represent our State in  public office.                            ____________________
