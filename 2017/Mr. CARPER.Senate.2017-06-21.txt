 Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to  adjust the boundary of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, CBRA, map  unit for North Bethany Beach, Delaware. I am pleased to be working in  this effort with the junior Senator from Delaware, Mr. Coons, who joins  me as an original cosponsor.   This map change implements a recommendation made by the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service. The Service discovered during its recent digital  mapping pilot project that a portion of the North Bethany Beach unit  encompassing the South Shore Marina development was included by mistake  when the map was created in 1990. The Fish and Wildlife released a  report to Congress in November of 2016 on the results of the mapping  pilot project required by the 2006 Coastal Barrier Resources  Reauthorization Act (PL 109-226). Delaware was part of the pilot  project, and the report contains the recommendation for this map  change.   This map change can occur only through an act of Congress.   CBRA is a map-based law enacted in 1982 recognizing that certain  actions and programs of the Federal Government subsidize and encourage  development on coastal barriers. This coastal building contributes to  the loss of natural resources and threatens human life, health and  property. The CBRA system currently contains 859 geographic units in 23  States and territories along the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Great Lakes,  U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico coasts. The CBRA units are  depicted on a set of maps that is maintained by the Secretary of the  Interior through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.   While CBRA does not prohibit or regulate development, it removes the  Federal incentives to build on these undeveloped, unstable and  environmentally sensitive areas. CBRA seeks to save taxpayers' money,  keep people out of harm's way, and conserve natural resources by  restricting most new Federal expenditures and financial assistance  (e.g., beach nourishment, disaster assistance, and flood insurance) in  areas designated within the CBRA system. That is why Mr. President, it  is important to make sure these maps are accurate and that they do not  include previously developed property. This bill will achieve that  objective for the North Bethany Beach area.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1395         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REPLACEMENT OF JOHN H. CHAFEE COASTAL BARRIER                     RESOURCES SYSTEM MAP.         (a) In General.--The map subtitled ``Delaware Seashore Unit       DE-07P, North Bethany Beach Unit H01'' and dated December 6,       2013, that is included in the set of maps entitled ``Coastal       Barrier Resources System'' referred to in section 4(a) of the       Coastal Barrier Resources Act (16 U.S.C. 3503(a)) and       relating to certain John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources       System units in the State of Delaware, is replaced by the map       entitled ``Delaware Seashore Unit DE-07/DE-07P, North Bethany       Beach Unit H01'' and dated March 16, 2016.        (b) Availability.--The Secretary of the Interior shall keep       the replacement map referred to in subsection (a) on file and       available for inspection in accordance with section 4(b) of       the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (16 U.S.C. 3503(b)).                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Heitkamp):   S. 1402.

Russell National School Lunch  Act to require the Secretary of Agriculture to make loan guarantees and  grants to finance certain improvements to school lunch facilities, to  train school food service personnel, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.
