 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I need to begin my remarks today by  acknowledging two solemn anniversaries.   Yesterday marked 25 years since a deranged gunman shattered the calm  of a summer afternoon here at the Capitol, 25 years since two brave  members of the United States Capitol Police--Jacob Joseph Chestnut and  Detective John Michael Gibson--paid the ultimate price to keep us safe.   The senseless tragedy of July 24, 1998, robbed two families of  beloved husbands and fathers. It deprived fellow officers of devoted  colleagues and friends. But that day, the sacrifice of Officer Chestnut  and Detective Gibson saved lives. They protected the lawmakers and  staff who come here to work, the tourists who come here to encounter  the heart of our democracy, and the institutions of Congress  themselves. And they reminded an entire nation of the vital service the  men and women of the Capitol Police render honorably every day.   Time will not heal the pain of losing these fine men, but in a  special way today, I know my colleagues join me in extending our  sympathies to the families of Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson and to  their comrades in the Capitol Police. America will never forget their  service and sacrifice.                              Kentucky Flooding    Mr. President, tomorrow will mark 1 year since the brave people of  Eastern Kentucky endured some of the worst flooding in the  Commonwealth's history. Heavy rains and rising water caused mass  evacuations and over 40 deaths, including a number of children. Roads  turned to rapids, neighborhoods were swept away overnight, and families  were left stranded.   In communities like Lost Creek, where I stood with Jackson Mayor  Laura Thomas, not a single home was left untouched. From Lost Creek to  communities and counties like Pike, Letcher, Knott, and Breathitt, I  saw similar scenes of devastation and heard the painful stories of  families displaced by the floods. But in the face of devastation,  Kentucky's first responders rushed to help neighbors in their time of  need.   As the full scope of the disaster became clear, I worked with leaders  at FEMA to cut through redtape and encouraged a rapid Federal response.  I made sure that Eastern Kentucky received big investments in recovery  and that local leaders got more autonomy to restore communities,  rebuild homes, and revitalize the economy.   Last year's tragedy tested Eastern Kentucky's resolve, and today,  there is still work to be done. But Kentuckians are resilient. We rise  up to the big challenges. I will continue to work with folks in Eastern  Kentucky to build their communities back even stronger than before.                              U.S. Supreme Court    Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, Democrats on the  Judiciary Committee spent last Thursday considering the best way to  reach from article I of the Constitution into article III and tell a  coequal branch of government how to conduct its business.   The pretext for this latest chapter in Democrats' war on the  institution of the Supreme Court was ``ethics and  [[Page S3505]]  transparency.'' They had a supposedly urgent legislative bone to pick  with Justices who take vacations and publish children's books. But for  all our colleagues' heartburn over a textualist Court that won't  reliably affirm their political preferences, for all of the baseless  commotion about undue outside influence, Senate Democrats have proven  themselves to be quite thoroughly influenced by the far left's most  notorious dark money advocates and discredited causes.   Here are some of the recent marching orders our colleagues have  received from the activist left:   ``Start taking on the court rhetorically as a political villain.''   ``We'd like to amplify anyone who uses this corruption/legitimacy  messaging.''   ``Restrain MAGA justices immediately.''   ``Rip the veil off.''   Well, Mr. President, Senate Democrats have dutifully followed their  orders. In their words:   The Supreme Court is ``MAGA-captured.''   We have a ``stilted, illegitimate'' Court.   ``We need to expand the Court.''   One Senator let the cat out of the bag, saying that this supposed  ``ethics'' inquiry is just a predicate to Court packing. Quote: ``I  don't think we should foreclose that in an amendment.''   Our colleagues understand what the far left expects of them. They  know that their party's base has long since discarded any desire to  achieve its goals from within our institutions. So last week, they  rammed a blatant power grab through the Judiciary Committee as part of  their effort to tear down a branch of government they can't control.   Well, Senate Republicans are going to keep fighting this dangerous  campaign at every step of the way, and in the meantime, our Nation's  highest Court should continue to pay it no mind.                                   Ukraine    Mr. President, now on one final matter, Russia's violence against  civil infrastructure in Ukraine continues, but the consequences of this  unilateral destruction extend far beyond Ukraine's borders.   Just a week has passed since Vladimir Putin pulled out of the  agreement that had allowed critical Ukrainian grain shipments to  transit the Black Sea unharmed. But already, Russia has expanded from  threatening vessels carrying the world's grain supply to attacking  grain storage in Odessa and other coastal cities.   Yesterday's attacks are the latest in the wave of violence against  agricultural infrastructure that will punish the world's poorest and  hungriest nations. Leaders in the developing world who have hesitated  to cast blame in this conflict should take a careful look at Russia's  unprovoked behavior.   But Russia hasn't limited its nonmilitary targets to grain supplies.  On Sunday, Russia struck Odessa's largest Orthodox cathedral with a  deadly missile barrage. So much for Russian propaganda efforts to  present the Kremlin as a defender of the faithful. Of course, Putin,  like many of his Soviet predecessors, has already done so much to  corrupt and control the Russian Orthodox Church that we should not be  surprised by his disrespect for religious institutions.   So let's be very clear. A regime that exploits the clerics as  propagandists and agents of influence and that destroys historical  houses of worship is not--not--a friend to believers.   Now, as Ukraine's counteroffensive makes slow progress, the United  States and our allies can be sure of a few things.   First, our friends are using the munitions we have sent them,  including the cluster munitions that are now hammering Russian  positions in occupied Ukraine.   Second, at every step of the way, the Biden administration's  indecision and inaction have meant certain key capabilities have  arrived late--late--to the battlefield.   And, third, additional long-range firearms would help Ukraine put  Russian invaders on the back foot as our friends have already  demonstrated by successfully using British Storm Shadow cruise  missiles.   So the Biden administration needs to start moving at the speed of  relevance--at the speed of relevance--and give our friends in Ukraine  the lethal tools they need to finish their fight.   For our part, as we work to provide for the common defense, the  Senate must invest in a defense industrial base that can sustain  America's support for Ukraine while equipping our own forces to deter  further threats from Russia and China.
