 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on  behalf of myself and Senators Crapo, Blunt, and Rubio.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Collins and the other Senators for both  parties:         Are there legitimate circumstances under which a President       could request a foreign country to investigate a U.S.       citizen, including a political rival, who is not under       investigation by the U.S. government? If so, what are they       and how do they apply to the present case?    The House goes first.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice, Senator.   It would be hard for me to contemplate circumstances where that would  be appropriate, where it would be appropriate for the President of the  United States to seek a political investigation of an opponent.   One of the, I think, most important post-Watergate reforms was to  divorce decisions about specific cases, specific prosecutions from the  White House to the Justice Department, to build a wall. One of the many  norms that has broken down in this Presidency is that wall has been  obliterated, where the President has affirmatively and aggressively  sought to investigate his rivals. I cannot conceive of circumstances  where that is appropriate.   It may be appropriate for the Justice Department, acting  independently and in good faith, to initiate an investigation. There is  a process for doing that. We heard testimony about doing that. You can  make a request under the mutual legal assistance treaty, MLAT, process  when a foreign country has evidence involving a criminal case involving  a U.S. person. There is a legitimate way to do that.   That didn't happen here. In fact, when Bill Barr's name was first  revealed, when that transcript was brought to light, the Justice  Department immediately said: We have nothing to do with this--nothing  to do with this. Here, this particular domestic political error was  being done by the President's personal lawyer.   I want to just follow up also while I can, Senator, on my colleague's  comments in terms of mixed-motives. If you conclude the President acted  with mixed-motives--some corrupt and forbidden, some legitimate--you  should vote to commit. That principle is deeply rooted in our legal  tradition. It is commonplace in civil and criminal law going back  centuries.   For example, in describing the standard for corrupt motive for  obstruction, the 7th Circuit rejected any requirement that a  defendant's only or main purpose was to obstruct the due administration  of justice and, instead, the court explained a defendant is guilty if  his motives included any corrupt, forbidden goals. That case, United  States  [[Page S707]]  v. Cueto, which I cited earlier, is not only relevant here, but that  case was argued by Professor Dershowitz and he lost. He made the  argument he has made and the President's lawyer have made today. They  lost that case and for a good reason. It is contrary to the history of  our legal traditions. If someone, and this is--the Founders were  concerned, for example, that a President might be charged with bribing  managers of the electoral college.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S707, January 30, 2020, first column, the following  appears: . . . v. Cueto, which I cited earlier, is not only  relevant here, but that case was argued by Professor Derschowitz  and he lost. He made the argument he has made and the President's  lawyer have made today.

They lost that case and . . .    ========================= END NOTE =========================      The CHIEF JUSTICE. The President's counsel.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for that  question.   I would like to start by pointing out that the question sort of  assumes that there is a request for an investigation in a foreign  country of a United States person.   I would just like to bring it back, though, here, to the transcript  of the July 25 call, where President Trump didn't ask President  Zelensky, specifically, for an investigation or investigation into Vice  President Biden or his son Hunter. There is a lot of loose talk in sort  of shorthand reference to it that way.   What he refers to is the incident in which the prosecutor was fired.  The first thing that he says in that whole exchange is talking about  the prosecutor being fired--and he says it sounds horrible to him--and  the situation with Burisma. And all the President says is: ``So if you  can look into it. . . . It sounds horrible.'' It sounds like a bad  situation.   That is not calling for an investigation, necessarily, into Vice  President Biden or his son, but the situation in which the prosecutor  had been fired which affected anti-corruption efforts in the Ukraine.   President Zelensky responded by saying the issue of the investigation  of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the  honesty. So we will take care of that. He is explaining that he  understands that it is an issue that has to do with, was an  investigation over there, which their prosecutor was handling, derailed  in a way that affected their anti-corruption efforts, and was it  something worth looking into?   It is the President's making clear that we are not saying that it is  off-limits. It sounds bad to the U.S. as well.   Let me get more specifically to the question of, Is there any  situation where it might be legitimate to ask for an investigation  overseas?   Yes. If there were conduct by a U.S. person overseas that potentially  violated the law of that country but didn't violate the law of this  country but there were a national interest in having some information  about that and understanding what went on, then it would be perfectly  legitimate to suggest that this was something worth looking into.   We have an interest in knowing about this, even if it is not  something that would mean a criminal investigation here in the United  States. So that could arise in various circumstances where a person had  done something overseas, but there was a national interest in knowing  what they had done.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Democratic leader is recognized.    Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on  behalf of myself, Senator Rubio, and Senator Risch.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The question from Senators Collins,  Rubio, and Risch is addressed to the House managers:         The House of Representatives withdrew its subpoena to       compel Charles Kupperman's testimony. Why did the House       withdraw the Kupperman subpoena? Why didn't the House pursue       its legal remedies to enforce its subpoenas?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, I thank you for the question.   When we--our practice in the House was to invite witnesses to come  voluntarily; if they refused, to give them a subpoena. In the case of  Dr. Kupperman, he refused to come in voluntarily, and we subpoenaed  him.   Almost instantly upon receipt of the subpoena, a lengthy complaint  was filed in court where he sought to challenge that subpoena.  Interestingly, and contrary to, I think, what you are hearing from the  President's counsel here today, the House took the position that a  witness cannot challenge--does not have standing to challenge a  congressional subpoena.   We were joined, by the way, in that position by the Justice  Department, which also said that Dr. Kupperman didn't have jurisdiction  to challenge or get a declaratory judgment as to the validity of the  subpoena.   So, in that litigation, we were often on the same page as the Justice  Department. But more meaningful to us, we were simply not going to  engage in a yearslong process of delay to get the answers that we  needed.   We proposed to Dr. Kupperman's counsel that if, as you claim, this is  really about just wanting to get a court blessing, there is a  willingness to  [[Page S725]]  come forward, but we just want to make sure that it is appropriate that  we do so, if you are sincere about that, there is already a case that  has been filed, the McGahn case, that is about to be decided. Let's  agree to be bound by what conclusion Judge Jackson reaches in that  case. And their answer was no.   And, indeed, that opinion would come out shortly thereafter. That  opinion said, this claim of absolute immunity is absolute nonsense, and  there is no precedent for it in the 250 years of jurisprudence on this  subject.   So we went back to Dr. Kupperman, and, of course, Dr. Kupperman said:  No, we would like to get our own judicial opinion.   Now, had we gone to fruition, even though we don't believe--and it  would have created a bad precedent that they have standing to challenge  subpoenas that way. Had they lost, they would have gone to the court of  appeals and the Supreme Court. They would have come back to the  district court. And now no longer arguing absolute immunity because  that would have been, we believe, defeated, they would make claims of  executive privilege, and they would litigate those up through the court  of appeals and the Supreme Court.   We knew that course because we are in it with Don McGahn. Nine months  after he was subpoenaed, we are still litigating it. And they are in  Court saying Congress shouldn't do what they are saying that we should  do before this body.   So that is why we withdrew the subpoena. We were not going to go  through that exercise.   You have to ask the question, I think, why did Fiona Hill feel that  she could come and testify? She worked for Dr. Kupperman. Why was she  willing to show the courage to come and testify when her boss wasn't?   There is not a good answer to that question, but I am awfully glad  that she did because, without her, we would be that much less  knowledgeable about this President's scheme.   So that was the history of the Kupperman subpoena. Likewise, John  Bolton, who has the same counsel, told us if we subpoenaed him, he  would sue.   Now, why is it that he is willing to testify now, and he wasn't  willing to testify before the House? You should ask him that question.  But that was the predicament we faced. And in our view, a President  should not be able to defeat an investigation into his wrongdoing by  endlessly litigating the matter in court, particularly when they are in  court saying you can't use the court to enforce your subpoenas.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.
