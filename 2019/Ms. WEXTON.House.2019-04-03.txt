 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, as a former domestic violence prosecutor and advocate for  abused women, I have seen firsthand the impact of the Violence Against  Women Act's legal protections and survivor support services. Because of  this law, survivors can access a national hotline, a network of  shelters, and get protection orders that carry across State lines.   The bill before us today will close the boyfriend loophole by  stopping abusers and stalkers from obtaining firearms.   The NRA thinks this language is too broad. They are wrong. When women  are five times more likely to be murdered if there is a gun present in  the household, it is clear that gun violence is a women's issue.   We have made important progress, but we can't let up, not when a  woman is murdered by a male intimate partner with a gun every 16 hours.   This bill tells survivors: You are not alone. You will always have a  place to go. You will always have people on your side.   Most importantly, it will save lives.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support it.
