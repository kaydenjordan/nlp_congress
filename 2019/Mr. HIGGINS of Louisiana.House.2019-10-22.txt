 Madam Speaker, the Democrats' entire case  against the President is built on hearsay, unverified third-party  accounts, and opinion.   No cop in America could righteously make any arrest with that degree  of evidence, not even a misdemeanor, much less something as sobering as  the impeachment of our duly elected President.   They tread upon the very colors of our flag. Contrary to our  constitutional oath, they are conducting a secret investigation  disguised as an impeachment inquiry, calling forth only prosecutorial  hearsay demonstration, hearsay testimony deemed most likely to condemn  the President, witnesses selected and screened by Adam Schiff.   True investigators interview everyone, not just those who lead to a  predetermined conclusion. Democrats are handpicking witnesses and  selectively releasing information to mislead the American people.   This is dangerous, it is wrong, and we the people grow weary.                            ____________________
