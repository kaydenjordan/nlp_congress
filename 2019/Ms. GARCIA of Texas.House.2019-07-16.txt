 Madam Speaker, today, with this resolution, the  House continues the fight for equality and dignity for every person.   It's not important to us where you came from. It only matters that  you're here now.   Sin embargo vamos a luchar por la igualidad y la dignidad de cada  persona.   No es importante para nosotros de donde vienes. Solo nos importa que  estes aqui ahora.   When I was Harris County Commissioner, I was told, ``Go back to  Mexico and crawl back under the rock you came from.''   When we were debating the anti-immigrant racial profiling bill SB 4  in the Texas Senate, I received a call. ``I've got guns. Lots of  guns,'' the man said. But this credible death threat didn't stop us.   An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us as Americans.   Un ataque contra uno es un ataque contra todos como Americanos.
