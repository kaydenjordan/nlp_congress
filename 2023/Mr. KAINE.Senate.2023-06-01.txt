 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to speak about a provision of the  debt ceiling deal that I will later today offer an amendment so that we  can remove it. It is the provision dealing with the Mountain Valley  Pipeline.   I appreciate the hard bipartisan work that has been done to put  together a deal. And the deal has things I like and things that I don't  like. That is the nature of any deal that is struck between Houses of  Congress controlled by different parties.   It would have been my intention to be a supporter of the deal despite  its imperfections. However, a provision was added to the deal to green- light a pipeline project that goes through two States: West Virginia  and my Commonwealth of Virginia.   It was struck without any consultation with either of the Virginia  Senators. It is a highly controversial project in Virginia that  directly impacts families whose land will be taken for the pipeline  project.   I stand to speak on their behalf about the reasons that I will seek  to remove the Mountain Valley Pipeline provision from the bill when we  vote on it later tonight.   It would be one thing if you could build pipelines in midair, but you  can't. To build a pipeline, you have to take people's land. Sometimes  the land you take might be public land, a national park or a national  forest, but in any pipeline project of size--and the Mountain Valley  Pipeline is about 330 miles long--you have to take a lot of land from  private landowners, most of whom don't want to give up their land. That  means that when you do a pipeline project and you approve it and you  give a private company the right to take people's land, you ought to do  it carefully after significant deliberation.   So since the 1930s, there has been a pipeline permitting process that  has required for an interstate pipeline--first a determination by the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that there is a need for the  pipeline, the gas pipeline, and then once that determination is made, a  separate determination has to be made about what is the best route for  the pipeline.   Once those determinations are made, you are able to take private land  to build a pipeline even though those landowners will never benefit at  all from having a pipeline cross their property.   Then, additionally, the permitting process isn't just about building,  but it is about holding the developer to strict standards so that when  they build the pipeline, they minimally disturb the land, they  minimally affect species, and they minimally affect creeks and streams  and river crossings.   The Mountain Valley Pipeline is proposed to go about 110 miles  through the poorest part of my State--Appalachia. In the Appalachian  region of Virginia, a lot of people don't have very much. For many of  them, their land is what they have, and for many of them, that land has  been in their family for generations. They are entitled to a fair  process that would look at the need for the pipeline and what is the  best route and then would insist that the pipeline be built to a high  standard to maximally protect their property.   Congress has made a decision that this is not to be decided by  Congress. Pipeline routing, pipeline need is not to be determined by  Congress. Instead, you put it in administrative agencies. Why do you do  that? It is because, A, they have expertise, and B, it is less likely  to be abused.   If you were to let Congress do pipeline deals, it would be pretty  easy for somebody to look at a map and say: Well, this county never  voted for me. Why don't we run it through that county and take their  land?   Instead, we remove it from Congress so that professionals can  undertake the right analysis and review.   In this bipartisan debt ceiling deal, there is a provision to green- light one project in the United States, the Mountain Valley Pipeline-- to green-light it--and to say that there will be no more administrative  processes to determine whether it had been fully permitted and no more  ability for the courts to review the administrative Agency's decisions.   I strongly object to that. I don't have an objection to the pipeline  itself. I have been asked again and again and again, and I said: This  is not for Congress to decide. In fact, it would be wrong for Congress  to do this. You should have an administrative process. You should go  through it. A pipeline proponent should have to meet the standard, get  over the hurdles, and when they do, then, OK, they should be enabled to  take land and build a pipeline but only then. We shouldn't shorten it  and give one project a green light.   This is ultimately about Virginians who care about their land. They  don't want to give up their land for this pipeline because they don't  think they will benefit from it.   Sometimes a county will take someone's land to build a road, and even  if you are not happy about that, at least there is a road. You can have  an ambulance get to your house or your kid can go out and catch a  schoolbus on it. But a pipeline of this kind that is transmitting gas  from one part of the country to the other--people can't hook into it to  get low-cost natural gas. Many of the communities in Virginia that this  pipeline will run across don't even have natural gas distribution to  their communities. It might have some effect upon global gas prices,  but that won't affect somebody who doesn't have gas service to their  home.   So my Virginians just want to be sure that if this pipeline is built,  it has met the requisite standards of the review agencies, both State  and Federal, and it has withstood any court challenges.   This is a pipeline project that has been underway for a while. I know  the proponents of this provision will say it has just been going on too  long. But one of the reasons it has been going on for a while is  because the company was slipshod in a lot of its operations and  construction, particularly early in the life of this project. I do  believe the company has better management now, but the project has been  cited for dozens and dozens of Clean Water Act violations and other  construction problems that have led to mudslides on people's property.  That is why my Virginia constituents are so desiring that, let's do  this the right way or let's not do it at all.    The provision in this bill not only frustrates these Virginia  landowners who want to make sure that if their land is going to be  taken, it is done in a fair way after deliberate consideration, but it  also does something that I believe is unwarranted and really historical  in the wrong way. It is a rebuke of the Fourth Circuit of the U.S.  Court of Appeals, which is headquartered in Richmond, my hometown,  which has been the court that has heard cases about the Mountain Valley  Pipeline, challenges to agency decisions in the previous administration  where the court said: Hey, look, the agency didn't do what they were  supposed to do. Go back and do it right this time.   When landowners feel like they are being abused, they have a right to  go to court and present their case, and the Fourth Circuit and the  district courts within it have said: You have shown your case. The  company didn't do it right. The agency didn't do it right. Go back and  do it right.   That has made the company upset.   For 18 years, I tried cases in the Fourth Circuit, and I won some,  and I  [[Page S1880]]  lost some. When I lost, I wasn't happy, but if I lost, I would tell my  client: We can appeal.   We would appeal to the Fourth Circuit. Sometimes I would win my  appeal, and sometimes I would lose my appeal. When we lost, I wasn't  happy, but we would try to get the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the  case. Never once did I tell a client after a loss: What we need to do  is go to Congress and take this case away from the Fourth Circuit and  put it in a court that is more likely to be favorable.   I would never have thought to do that. No one gets that deal. No  individual gets that deal. No civil rights plaintiff gets that deal. No  criminal defendant gets that deal. No small business gets that deal.  Most people would be embarrassed to ask for that.   I lost. I am unhappy. Why don't I get Congress to rewrite the rules  of Federal jurisdiction and take this case away from the court that has  made me unhappy and put it in another court? Yet that is what this bill  will do. It will end further administrative review. It will end  judicial review of any permit. And it will say only this: If someone  wants to challenge what Congress is doing here, saying it is unlawful  or unconstitutional or an overreach, they have to file that challenge  in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. They cannot file it in the Fourth  Circuit where this project is being considered.   Both to protect these landowners, who have a right to a full and  deliberate consideration if they are going to have to give up their  land, and to protect the integrity of both our court system and this  body, I strongly oppose this provision.   I will move later in the day to bring up my amendment, and I would  encourage my colleagues to support me in it.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 101 and ask  that it be reported by number.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the amendment by  number.   The bill clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Kaine] proposes an amendment       numbered 101.    The amendment is as follows:   (Purpose: To strike a provision relating to expediting completion of                       the Mountain Valley Pipeline)         Strike section 324.     I ask unanimous consent that there be 4 minutes equally  divided prior to the vote on my amendment, with Senators Capito and  Manchin each controlling 1 minute in opposition.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, I rise to offer an amendment to strip a  single provision out of this bill: the provision green-lighting the  Mountain Valley Pipeline.   I offer my amendment for three reasons.   First, this provision that would put Congress's thumb on a permitting  scale is completely unrelated to the debt ceiling and should not be  included in this bill.   Second, I object on behalf of Virginia landowners. If you could build  a pipeline in midair, that is one thing. But the only way to build it  is to use eminent domain to take people's land. Virginians don't want  to have their land taken for a pipeline unless there is a thorough  process where they have all the rights accorded to them by law,  administrative agency, and judicial review. Cutting off those rights is  disrespectful to these landowners, who, in this part of the State,  sometimes land is all they have, and it has been in their family for  generations.   Finally, this bill would strip jurisdiction of a case away from the  Fourth Circuit in the middle of the case. That is unprecedented and  historic.   I used to try cases all the time in this circuit. I lost them, and I  would appeal them. But I wouldn't try to get Congress to strip  jurisdiction away from the court because I was unhappy. No everyday  person gets this deal. No criminal defendant gets this deal. No small  business gets this deal. Nobody gets this deal, and we shouldn't give  it to some company just because they are powerful and they have  influence in Congress.   For these reasons I ask for a ``yes'' vote on my amendment.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.
