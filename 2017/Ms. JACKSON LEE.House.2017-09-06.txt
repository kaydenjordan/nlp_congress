 I thank the Speaker, and I thank the gentlewoman  from New York. Having known the devastation of hurricanes just a couple  of years ago, I thank her, and along with her as the ranking minority  member, the chairman as well, both coming from the region where they  faced the same devastation.   We come together united. We come bipartisan. We come as friends. As I  said at the NRG shelter just a few days ago, we have hope. We have  hope. We are grateful that we are beginning the process of recovery  with the over $7 billion now being allotted for disaster recovery, $450  million of that being for small businesses. The need is great.   Twelve days ago, on August 25, Hurricane Harvey hit this coast, and  it hit Texas in a very hard way. To put in perspective the devastation  brought by Hurricane Harvey, the volume of water that fell on Houston  and other affected areas of Texas and Louisiana could fill more than  24,000 Astrodomes. Hurricane Harvey was a thousand-year storm. It  claimed many, many lives. Twenty-one trillion gallons of rainfall fell  in Texas. Sustained winds exceeded 130 miles an hour.   I cannot thank, enough, those who gathered and helped, from the local  officials, from Mayor Sylvester Turner and Judge Emmett, to Mayor Aaron  in Humble, to Mayor Diaz in Jacinto City--cities in my congressional  district--to the many volunteers, the Cajun Navy. And might I thank the  Texas National Guard--they were standing up--the Marines, the Navy,  and, of course, the Army. We traveled with them. I thank the Military  Museum of Armed Forces that traveled with me to give out food. We are  still in need.   Thousands of people without apartments who have been evicted have  been told to go. As I walked the streets of Humble, Texas, in my  district, piles and piles and piles of rubbish, people's homes and  possessions, even though they had their family and lives, all of their  possessions out on the front.   This is a time for us to rise without obstacles. This is a time for  us to ensure that all people can be protected. I would like to  highlight the DREAMer that died, Alonso Guillen, who came all the way  from Lufkin, Texas, just be able to save those who he saw were in need.  We need to be able to ensure that he is not discriminated against or my  constituents in certain parts of my district who are afraid to seek  help simply because they are unstatused.   My friends, I know we can find a pathway forward. I know that we can  find a pathway to reauthorize DACA and to do it as soon as possible in  tribute to Alonso Guillen, who died with friends when he brought his  boat, of his own accord, to be able to come and save those.   Let me tell you what we need. We need housing resources. We need to  ensure that we have housing resources to make sure that the people who  were evicted can make sure that they have a way to have a home. We need  small business resources.   I want to thank the gentlewoman for her time, and I know that we will  be working together and making a difference for those who were impacted  by Hurricane Harvey.   My prayers for those who are impacted by Hurricane Irma.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3672, which provides $7.85  billion in supplemental appropriations as the Congress's initial  response to the massive damaged inflicted on Southeast Texas and  Louisiana by Hurricane Harvey.   The speed with which the bipartisan leadership drafted and shepherded  this legislation to the floor bodes well for the major challenges that  must be met and overcome if Congress if the victims of Hurricane Harvey  are to recover from the storm's awful wrath and rebuild their decimated  communities.   I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Lowey, and Speaker  Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi, for bringing this initial  supplemental funding bill to the floor in a timely manner and which  lets the people of Texas and Louisiana know that the American people  stand in solidarity with them in their moment of heartbreak and  anguish.   Mr. Speaker, just 12 days, on August 25, 2017, Hurricane Harvey made  landfall for the first time in the state of Texas, just north of the  city of Corpus Christi.   Before it was finished, Hurricane Harvey dropped 21 trillion gallons  of rainfall on Texas and Louisiana, most of it on the Houston  Metroplex.   To put in perspective the devastation wrought by Hurricane Harvey,  the volume of water that fell on Houston and other affected areas of  Texas and Louisiana could fill more than 24,000 Astrodomes or supply  the water for the raging Niagara Falls for 15 days.   Whole sections of Houston, Beaumont, Bayou City, Port Arthur, and  other cities were underwater for days.   Hurricane Harvey was a 1,000 year storm that has to date claimed the  lives of at least 30 persons, including a 34-year veteran of the  Houston Police Department and a family of six who perished in Greens  Bayou while trying to evacuate their flooded home and community.   It also claimed the life of a Dreamer, Alonso Guillen, a young  Houstonian who came to Texas from Mexico as a teenager, and who died  when his boat capsized while he was rescuing survivors of the flooding  caused by Hurricane Harvey.   Neither Houston nor any city in the nation has ever experienced  flooding of the magnitude caused by Hurricane Harvey.   The statistics are staggering.   21 trillion gallons of rainfall fell in Texas and Louisiana in the  first five days of the storm.   The estimated maximum sustained winds exceeded 130 miles per hour as  the hurricane made landfall near Rockport, Texas on August 25.   A record 4,323 days, which is nearly 12 years, elapsed since a major  hurricane (Category 3 or above) made landfall in the United States  prior to Hurricane Harvey; the last Category 3 hurricane to hit the  United States was Hurricane Wilma in 2005, the same year Hurricane  Katrina destroyed much of New Orleans.   The city of Cedar Bayou received 51.88 inches of rainfall, breaking  the record for rainfall from a single storm in the continental United  States; my city of Houston received more than 5o inches of rainfall.   More than 13,000 people have been rescued in the Houston area and  more than  [[Page H6664]]  30,000 persons are expected to be forced out of their homes due to the  storm.   More than 8,800 federal personnel were staff deployed to help respond  to Hurricane Harvey, supplying approximately 2.9 million meals, 2.8  million liters of water, 37,000 tarps, and 130 generators.   In the first three days of the storm, more than 49,000 homes that had  suffered flood damage and more than 1,000 homes were completely  destroyed in the storm.   Mr. Speaker, valiant emergency responders are overextended and  citizen rescues have become a critical source of assistance in saving  lives.   Local authorities closed major freeways, airports, and schools.   Emergency shelters are filled to capacity and efforts to rescue  residents continue around the clock.   The anticipated cost of removing debris is expected to dwarf the $70  million spent by Houston removing debris after Hurricane Ike in 2008.   We do not yet know the full cost in human lives exacted by Hurricane  Harvey.   But what we do know is that the costs of recovery and reconstruction  will far exceed any natural disaster in memory; best estimates place  the cost in the range of $150-$200 billion.   Mr. Speaker, there is much work to be done in my city of Houston, and  across the areas affected by the terrible, awesome storm that will be  forever known simply as Hurricane Harvey.   That is why I strongly support the legislation pending before us  appropriating $7.85 billion as the initial response of the Congress to  the damage caused by an epic storm.   I must emphasize that what we are considering here is the initial  response because much more funding will be needed for Houston--the  nation's fourth largest city--and Southeast Texas to recover and  rebuild.   For that reason, I urge all Members to join me in support of H.R.  3672 and to commit to providing our fellow Americans in Texas and  Louisiana all of the help and support they need to restore their  communities to their previous greatness.    Mr. Speaker, to the distinguished gentlewoman, I  come now to just stand on behalf of our delegation to be able to say,  as I said earlier, I acknowledge the pain of Sandy.   But I now come to make sure that we all understand that this first  crunch is only the beginning. We are going to put in legislation that  asks for $180 billion, recognizing the hard work of appropriators, and  letting you know that people's lives, as we walk through the debris  that is in front of every house--it is painful. It is long lasting.   So I just wanted to come to give my thanks and to ask: Will you  please stand with me for the long journey that is going to be needed  for the infrastructure we build; new dams that are 30 years old; and  housing issues that will not end today; and the massive eviction of  people in apartments? Not cruelly, I hope, but they are getting  eviction notices with no place to go.   Mr. Speaker, so I ask that we as Americans join for the long haul,  the long destiny, with prayers for all.   I thank Mrs. Lowey for yielding to me so that we can talk about the  long haul.   God bless America.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up  H.R. 3440, the DREAM Act, to protect Deyanira, a DACA recipient, who is  in my State, who is majoring in neuroscience at the University of Texas  at Austin.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for  his leadership, and the manager of this appropriations process.   I cannot start a discussion of my particular amendment, very  briefly--and I thank my colleagues for the amendment being included in  the en bloc--without again mentioning the devastation in the Gulf Coast  region and the need that we have on all aspects of recovery, and will  look forward to an effective investment for the long haul.   My amendment contributes to that aspect, and that is that the  amendment makes a modest $500,000 increase to the National Institute of  Food and Agriculture's Research and Education Activities account. The  intent of the amendment is to enable the NIFA to increase funding by  $500,000 to 1890 institutions, which are HBCU land grant colleges, to  support education, research, and scholarship at HBCUs.   The amendment is paid for by an offset of $944,000 in the chief  information officer account. The offset is budget neutral and reduces  outlays by $1 million, according to the CBO.   This particular amendment supports the work of the National Institute  of Food and Agriculture by making a modest increase that will help our  land grant colleges. It will help our land grant colleges in the  context of them contributing, one, to a better understanding of food  deserts, better understanding of expanding opportunities for research,  economic analysis, extension in higher education, and it also will be  supportive of colleges that, in many instances, are impacted by natural  disasters. The HBCUs have been leaders in agricultural research.    Some of the colleges that I am speaking of will be  major contributors in the concept of expanded food access for many of  our communities.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank the gentleman for extending the time to  me. The amendment is a good amendment and it would benefit rural,  suburban, and urban areas by maximizing the potential for farming  activity in those areas where green space is limited or land is  underused. Again, the combination of agricultural fighting against food  deserts, which many of my constituents are facing now after Hurricane  Harvey, is an important extended impact that I think will be helpful as  we go forward.   I thank my colleagues for their support of the Jackson Lee amendment  No. 13.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I am reading a headline that says that  experts say it could take Houston years to fully recover from Hurricane  Harvey.   This is not because my local leaders, mayors, county judges, and  Governors are not working as hard as they can, but it is the most  significant, singular, and devastating costly flood in the continental  United States history.   Certainly, we are praying that Hurricane Irma detours away from those  places that it has not yet hit. We certainly pray for Puerto Rico, the  U.S. Virgin Islands, the other Caribbean islands, and certainly our  friends in Florida and up the East Coast. But right now we have that  unlikely and unappreciated position of having the most devastating  flood.   So my amendment has to do with State and local funds being part of  designing their own reconstruction, their own projects, their own  capital projects. Specifically, my amendment says that none of the  funds made available by this act under the heading Federal Transit  Administration--Transit Formula Grants may be used in contravention of  section 5309 of title 49, United States Code.   The identical amendment was offered in the Jackson Lee amendment to  H.R. 2577 and received a positive voice vote.   In particular, this amendment affirms the importance to the Nation of  projects that create economic development, particularly in the  transportation area.   Pursuant to section 5309 of title 49, the Secretary of Transportation  may make grants under this section to State and local governments.    I yield to the gentleman from Florida.    The chairman is very kind. Let me thank the chairman  and the ranking member of the subcommittee. If I might just take one  moment and I will conclude taking your gracious offer.   First, I would like to acknowledge that this amendment is supported  by the trade unions, the TTD. I thank them very much for their support.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record the article about our  rebuilding.                 [From the Washington Post, Aug. 28, 2017]  Nation's Fourth-Largest City Struggles to Get Moving Again After Harvey     (By Ashley Halsey III, Michael Laris, Martine Powers and Luz Lazo)         Cleanup and flooding in Texas continue in wake of Hurricane       Harvey.        Under the threat of more rain and flooding this week, the       regional hub that is Houston faced the daunting prospect of       clearing mud-swept roadways, opening two of the nation's       busiest airports and resuming operations at the country's       second-busiest port.        Many streets remained impassable, with water more than       waist-high. Those highways not flooded too often led to       others that were. And officials said it was too soon to say       when the transit system would resume operations.        Houston is a city that for the past eight years led the       nation in growth, and although transit was considered to have       its place, the city's backbone is the oil industry, which       relies heavily on new highways to get around town. When the       city spread out into Harris County--which has 6.5 million       people to the city's 2 million--the connections were       roadways. The state maintains more than 1,200 miles of them,       including four interstates, three of which crisscross the       downtown area.        Even though the worst of the storm appeared to be over,       transportation officials continued to urge people to stay off       the roads. ``We're expecting more rain,'' Houston Fire Chief       Samuel Pena said.        ``The roads are dangerous. Stay off the roads.''        Once the water clears, it may take weeks or months before       roads are fully ready for travel, said Dave Newcomb, a senior       research engineer at the Texas A&M Transportation Institute.       He said the primary concern will be local streets and       roadways, not the freeway system.  [[Page H7057]]         ``The freeways are probably going to be okay,'' Newcomb       said. ``They're built with lots of support underneath them.       They're built for heavy loads and adverse conditions.''        But local roads built on rain-saturated soil may be left in       a weakened state, he said, taking a month or two before they       stabilize. Bridges that had swift-moving floodwaters around       them must be checked for scouring around their supports, he       said.        The sheer scale of the immediate recovery is daunting.        ``It is really difficult because we're so spread out and       highway-dependent,'' said Kyle Shelton, director of strategic       partnerships at the Kinder Institute, an urban-research think       tank at Houston's Rice University. ``We just have so many       streets and so many roads and so much other infrastructure to       make sure is okay and bring back online. That's going to take       weeks and months.''        Houston's two big airports--George Bush Intercontinental       Airport and the William P. Hobby Airport--will begin to see       traffic on their runways even as the rest of the region       struggles to find its footing. Officials said Hobby will       remain closed until Wednesday; Bush until Thursday.        The magnitude of the backup to the national aviation system       caused when Houston shuts down was evident Monday: 772       flights had been set to depart from the two airports,       carrying close to 94,000 passengers. The two airports had a       record 1.9 million passengers pass through security last       month.        ``You may not even be heading to Houston and still run into       this,'' said Anne McDermott of Farecompare.com. She said that       late Sunday a flight to Dallas landed in Memphis because so       many--Houston-bound flights had been diverted to Dallas.       ``It's going to continue to be a fluid situation.''        The Houston Metro's bus system, three light-rail lines and       paratransit services were shut down Monday, with no word on       when they would resume service. In a statement, Metro       officials said they will monitor the situation to determine       when it would be safe to resume service.        If history is precedent, it may be a while before those       buses are back on the road. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005,       it took weeks to restore bus service in New Orleans--partly       because of the condition of flooded roadways, but also       because hundreds of buses were underwater after the storm.       With the city's bus fleet unusable, the Federal Emergency       Management Agency had to scramble to bring in more than a       thousand private coaches to help with evacuation efforts.        The Houston Metro tried to prevent a similar outcome for       this storm, parking more than 100 buses in the HOV lane on an       elevated section of Interstate 59.        ``This is a city that was built, in large part, in defiance       of nature,'' said Christof Spieler, an urban planner who is       on the board of Metro.        ``Basically, developers just treated this as a big empty       canvas and just spread out across it. We tend to sort of       ignore the natural underpinnings of the city. When this       amount of rain falls, suddenly that natural geography       reasserts itself.''        And in the long run, Houston--like the rest of the       country--has to wrestle with how to become more resilient in       an era when weather hazards are increasing. Over the past       three years, there have been three floods that have ``all       been labeled unprecedented,'' Shelton said. While freeways       and many local streets have major sections that are       underwater, many other areas are not submerged, depending on       their elevation and how much rain there was in that       particular place.        ``Houston is used to flooding. We're not used to anything       on the scale of what just happened,'' Spieler said.        Rapid development over the past two decades--and the       sprawling networks of accompanying roadways, subdivisions and       parking lots have left Houston especially susceptible to       major flooding, said Samuel Brody, a Texas A&M University       urban planning professor who leads the Center for Texas       Beaches and Shores.        Such surfaces leave little return path for floodwaters to       go into the ground or drainage channels.        ``You've got a smearing of pavement all over a flood-prone       region,'' he said. ``You're putting more impervious surfaces       over a large area that is dominated by flood-prone, low-lying       landscapes, so when it rains, there's all this impervious       surface. It increases the volume and velocity of water going       into the bayous which Houston uses as their primary drain       system.''        Between 1996 and 2011, as development boomed, the       percentage of impervious surfaces in Houston grew by 25       percent, Brody said, citing a report he led that examined the       effect of development on flood damage in the Gulf of Mexico       region. And although the extreme rainfall totals from Harvey       probably would have caused flooding no matter what, Brody       said the presence of pavement increases the amount of damage       on the ground.        The 25-mile-long complex of docks and warehouses that make       up the Port of Houston planned to remain closed Tuesday.        Kurt Nagle, chief executive of the American Association of       Port Authorities, said that early indications show there is       ``light to moderate'' infrastructure damage along the Houston       Ship Channel 150 business facilities that generate $617       billion in economic activity per year. At least three vessels       originally headed for Houston have been diverted to New       Orleans, and more may be detoured in coming days from Houston       and other affected ports in Galveston, Victoria, Beaumont,       Port Lavaca and others.        The continuing severe weather may have further effects on       the ports in the region, Nagle said. But even once things       clear up, significant work will need to be done before       shipping channels in the area can reopen. The Coast Guard       will need to perform surveys of the area to determine whether       buoys and navigation aids have been moved or lost, and the       Army Corps of Engineers will need to perform a channel       assessment to ensure that no debris is blocking the shipping       channels under the surface.        Benny Rousselle witnessed the ravages of water during       Katrina from his perch as president of Plaquemines Parish,       south of New Orleans. The priorities for leaders in Houston       are clear, for now: help those who are stranded.        ``The pressure is on the local elected officials to get       this community up and running as quick as possible, so they       can come home and help with the recovery,'' said Rousselle,       who is now on the parish council. ``But you cannot do that       until you have enough utilities and roadways cleared so they       can come in,'' Rousselle said.     Mr. Chairman, I just want to conclude by making this  point to Mr. Diaz-Balart, and it is that local entities should have the  right to direct funds where they believe they are most important,  particularly for transportation projects.   As they do so with Federal dollars, let me also add my support for  Davis-Bacon. It is, in essence, completely opposite with what was  represented. It is a civil rights bill for all people.   I ask my colleagues to join me in making sure the State and local  governments get Federal funds. And as we move forward to restore  Houston and Harris County and all of the Gulf region, this will be a  very important amendment to make sure that we can direct our own  destiny with Federal funds. The Secretary of Transportation has that  authority to give to us to be able to do so.   Mr. Chairman, I ask for support of the Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chair, let me thank Subcommittee Chairman Diaz-Balart and Ranking  Member Price for their leadership on this important legislation and for  the opportunity to explain my amendment.   The Jackson Lee Amendment adds at the end of the bill the following  new section providing that:   Sec.__. None of the funds made available by this Act under the  heading ``Federal Transit Administration--Transit Formula Grants'' may  be used in contravention of section 5309 of title 49, United States  Code.   This amendment is identical to the Jackson Lee Amendment to H.R.  2577, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations  Act for FY2016 adopted by the House on June 8, 2016 by voice vote.   In particular, the Jackson Lee affirms the importance to the nation  of projects that create economic development, particularly in the  transportation area.   Pursuant to section 5309 of title 49, the Secretary of Transportation  may make grants under this section to State and local government the  authority to assist in financing capital projects, small startup  projects, including the acquisition of real property.   This section further supports capacity improvements, including double  tracking, and it specifically relates to work that deals with projects  on approved transportation plans.   That is key; section 5309 of title 49 grants to State and local  governments the authority to undertake capital projects, which means  that when local governments propose their projects, the Secretary has  the authority to go forward on them.   It is instructive to consider what some of the nation's leading  transportation and economic development organization have to say about  the importance and economic impact of investments in local light rail  capital projects.   It is well documented that nothing enhances the competitiveness of a  nation in this increasingly globalized economy, that investments in  transportation infrastructure capital projects.   Whether it is the seaways, dams, highways, or tollways, and whether  it involves other modes of transportation, transportation projects are  major engines driving the economy.   And it is important for the local community to be the drivers of  that.   Metropolitan regions will not be able to maintain its economic  vitality without the ability to create and preserve infrastructure that  supports the movement of people and goods throughout our country.   The Jackson Lee Amendment clearly speaks to the global aspect of the  Secretary of Transportation having the ability to work with our local  and State governments.   Houston is the fourth most populous city in the country; but unlike  other large cities, we  [[Page H7058]]  have struggled to have an effective mass transit system.   Over many decades Houston's mass transit policy was to build more  highways with more lanes to carry more drivers to and from work.   The city of Houston has changed course and is now pursuing Mass  transit options that include light rail.   This decision to invest in light rail was and is strongly supported  by Houstonians by their votes in a 2003 referendum and by their  increased usage of light rail service made possible in part by  transportation appropriations bills.   Specifically, Harris County voters passed a massive referendum  proposal that was to set the stage for transit for the next 20 years.   It included a first stage of four light rail lines, to be complete by  2012, and a master plan for a 65-mile system, to be complete by 2025.   An April 2014 report by the Houston METRO on weekly ridership states  that 44,267 used Houston's light rail service, which represented a  6,096 or 16% increase in ridership from April of the previous year.   This increase in light rail usage outpaced ridership of other forms  of mass transit in the city of Houston: metro bus had a 2.3% increase  over April 2013; metro bus-local had a 1.3% increase over April 2013;  and Metro bus-Park and ride had a 8.o% increase over April 2013.   In a story published February 5, 2013, the Houston Chronicle reported  on the congestion Houston drivers face under daily commute to and from  work.   According to the Chronicle article, in 2011 Houston commuters  continue to enjoy some of the worst traffic delays in the country, and  Houston area drivers wasted more than two days a year, on average, in  traffic congestion, costing them each $1,090 in lost time and fuel.   Today, those figures have increased to 3.5 days a year wasted in  traffic congestion, costing them each $1,850 in lost time and fuel.   To put it in simpler and starker terms: A driver in Houston could see  154 movies this year or purchase 21 tickets to a home Texans game with  the money wasted because of poorly maintained or traffic-clogged roads.   Expanded light rail is critical to Houston's plan to meet its  transportation and environmental challenges, ease its traffic  congestion, and improve its air quality.   Places most likely to see immediate benefit from light rail in  Houston are the 50,000 students that attend the University of Houston  and Texas Southern University.   Funds made available under this deal should be available to support  local government decisions of the Houston Metropolitan transit  Authority and the city of Houston to expand rail service.   When we put our minds to it, we can get things done.   In Houston, we built a port 50 miles from the ocean, created the  world's greatest medical center in the middle of open prairie, and  convinced the federal government to base its astronauts in a hurricane  zone 870 miles from the launch pad.   Each of those achievements shares a common element: elected officials  have advocated, built public support, and brought the agencies  together.   Members of Congress should respect the decisions of state and local  governments when it comes to deciding how they will spend funding made  available for public transportation under this appropriations bill.   I ask my colleagues to again support the Jackson Lee Amendment and  affirm the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to work with  local governments to develop local transit projects that will relieve  traffic congestion, efficiently move people and goods, create jobs and  maintain America's status as the leading economy in the world.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.     Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from  California, and I thank the manager of this bill, Judge Carter from  Texas, for including my amendment in the en bloc amendment. Let me  explain it very simply.   My amendment would help facilitate the Secretary of Homeland Security  from being limited in their discretion for the utilization and  enhancement of the use of Federal air marshals on inbound international  flights considered to be high risk by the Department of Homeland  Security.   My amendment ensures that the Federal Air Marshal Service effectively  uses its funds to deploy personnel on inbound flights that are  considered high risk by the Department of Homeland Security and that  there is no limit on that ability.   I believe that Federal air marshals are the last line of defense in  some instances in defending the cockpit and aircraft cabin against  terrorist attacks. We know that airlines, airplanes, aviation still  remains a very attractive target, as evidenced over the years, by  terrorists.   As the former chairwoman of the Transportation Security Committee, I  have worked over the years and sponsored legislation to ensure we had  enough air marshals who receive all the requisite training to  effectively secure aircraft.   Let me say that all of our individuals are important to the  Department of Homeland Security. I ask my colleagues to support this  amendment. I thank my colleagues for putting it in the en bloc, and I  ask for its support.   Mr. Chair, let me thank Subcommittee Chairman Carter and Ranking  Member Roybal-Allard for their leadership on this important legislation  and for the opportunity to explain my amendment.   Thank you for this opportunity to explain my amendment, which simply  prohibits any funds in the Homeland Appropriations Act from being used  to limit the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security to  enhance the use of Federal air marshals on inbound international  flights considered to be high risk by the Department of Homeland  Security.   My amendment ensures that the Federal Air Marshal Service effectively  uses its funds to deploy personnel on inbound flights that are  considered high risk by the Department of Homeland Security and that  there is no limitation on that ability.   I believe that Federal Air Marshals are the last line of defense in  defending the cockpit and aircraft cabin against terrorist attack.   As the former Chair and a current member of Homeland Security  Transportation Security Subcommittee, I have worked over the years and  sponsored legislation to ensure that we have enough air marshals and  that they receive all the requisite training to effectively secure  aircraft.   To best protect our Nation from terroristic threat it is of extreme  importance that we use the necessary funds to support the use of  Federal Air Marshalls on inbound international flights.   Make no mistake--the threat to our aviation system from aircraft  inbound to the United States from foreign airports is serious and  dangerous.   Following the capture and killing of Osama Bin Laden, intelligence  was gathered that suggests that Al Qaeda still has an interest in  attacking the U.S., likely through transportation modes.   This fact, coupled with the numerous suspicious activities even on  domestic aircraft where passengers were attempting to open cabin doors  in flight or otherwise disrupt flights, is of concern.   While my amendment deals with the threat on inbound aircraft to the  U.S., its ultimate impact will be to ensure that air marshals are  assigned to the highest-risk flights.   It simply prohibits funds from being used to limit the discretion  Secretary of Homeland Security to enhance air marshal coverage on  inbound high-risk flights in accordance with the Department's risk  model.   The terroristic threats are ever changing and we must allow the  Secretary of Homeland Security to make the necessary adjustments to  protect the American people.   This is not a funding issue or people issue, rather a security issue  and this amendment is budget neutral.   Let me thank those who at the Department of Homeland Security and its  component agencies for their service, including my friends at the  Transportation Security Administration.   Let me thank all Federal Air Marshals for their service to our  nation.   I ask my colleagues to support Jackson Lee Amendment No. 89.
