 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1404, the Ghost Army  Congressional Gold Medal Act, the Senate version of H.R. 707, which the  House passed in May 2021.   The Ghost Army, comprised of the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops, is  renowned for creating large-scale deception operations capable of  pulling Axis focus away from the actual movements of the Allied forces.  [[Page H234]]    During the early phases of World War II, the 23rd division mastered  their skill of deception by studying unit atmosphere and collecting  materials for their new special effects tactics.   Knowing that enemy ground agents looked for vehicle bumper markings,  Allied shoulder patches, and well-defined checkpoints, the 23rd  collected shoulder patches for phony major generals, created realistic  inflatable vehicles and artillery, and even recorded the sounds of  heavy machinery movements to sell their deception. They built their own  modern-day Trojan horse, down to the last detail.   The Ghost Army, unlike many other units, was comprised of civilian  soldiers with a proclivity for art, architecture, acting, set design,  and engineering.   As Jack Masey, who was recruited into the Ghost Army at age 18,  remembered: ``We were told we were going to be using inflatable  equipment to try and fool the Germans into thinking that we were a real  army, when we were, in effect, I suppose, a rubber army.''                                time  1245    Anyone who has watched a History Channel World War II documentary has  undoubtedly seen the Ghost Army in action. The historic videos and  herculean photos of four men holding a tank over their heads is a  testament to the Ghost Army's ingenuity and bravery during World War  II.   The 23rd did not limit their deception to the battlefield. In fact,  on numerous occasions Ghosters were dispatched to French cafes near the  front of the war to order some omelets and talk loose among the spies  who might be there. The 23rd would go to great lengths to cause chaos  and confusion, and they succeeded.   Mr. Speaker, recognizing these true American heroes hits close to  home for me, as the 77th Ghost Army veterans originated from the great  State of Kentucky.   There is no doubt that the Ghost Army saved thousands of lives during  World War II. Their unique and highly distinguished service during this  great war should be recognized with a Congressional Gold Medal. I urge  my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Ms. Kuster, for her leadership on  this, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from  Pennsylvania. I thank my friend and colleague from New Hampshire.   I would just reiterate the significance of the Ghost Army. I thank my  colleagues for recognizing these extraordinary members of the Greatest  Generation and their significant contributions to our country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 1404, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of S. 452, the Willie O'Ree Congressional Gold  Medal Act.   Willie O'Ree's story is one of determination and perseverance, one of  the greatest qualities a human being can have.   Willie, born October 15, 1935, was the youngest of 13 children of  parents Rosebud and Harry O'Ree. The O'Ree family was one of only two  Black families that lived in Fredericton, New Brunswick. Willie is a  descendent of Paris O'Ree, a slave who escaped servitude in South  Carolina in the late 1700s at only 15 years old.   When he was 3, Willie fashioned skates out of wooden blocks with  metal blades attached to the bottom and took to his frozen lawn in the  backyard. He had a knack for skating. Two years later at age 5, Willie  began to play organized hockey. Many refer to Willie as the ``Jackie  Robinson of hockey.''   Interestingly, at Dodger Stadium in 1949, 2 years after Robinson  broke baseball's color barrier, a 14-year-old O'Ree had the opportunity  to meet his hero. In one interview, Willie recalls that as Robinson  made his way down to the receiving line, Willie waited patiently. When  his turn arrived, he spoke to Jackie and said, I am a baseball player.  But what I really love is hockey.   Robinson replied, Oh, I didn't know Black kids played hockey.   Nearly 9 years later, on January 18, 1958, Willie put on a Boston  Bruins uniform for a game against the Montreal Canadians and became the  first Black player in NHL history.                                time  1300    From 1958 to 1961, O'Ree played in 45 games for the Bruins, all while  hiding a secret that he was, in fact, blind in one eye.   Willie paved the way for a new generation of hockey players. Wayne  Simmonds of the Toronto Maple Leafs was quoted as stating:         Willie set the table for everyone else to eat, and he did       it all with dignity and class. I used to think about Willie's       story whenever teachers or hockey parents or coaches would       laugh at my dream of making it to the NHL.    Willie's story did not end after he left the ice. Seventeen years  after he retired from professional hockey, the NHL hired O'Ree as their  first-ever diversity ambassador. This role put Willie in a position to  grow the sport by providing access, opportunity, and motivation for  children of all races, ethnicities, origins, and abilities.   In November of 2018, O'Ree was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame,  and just last night, 64 years to the day of his historic entrance into  the league, his number 22 jersey was raised to the rafters in TD Garden  and retired; an act of ultimate recognition of what a player means to a  franchise, a fan base, and a community.   Mr. Speaker, Willie O'Ree forever changed the sport of hockey. His  determination and perseverance should be recognized with a  Congressional Gold Medal.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer). This Member of Congress not only  played collegiate hockey, he is a hockey dad, and spent over 20 years  as a hockey coach, he is one of the best fans of the game of hockey in  the United States Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I would just like to, once again, reiterate  the significance of this Congressional Gold Medal. Willie O'Ree not  only forever changed the sport of hockey, but he truly helped change  the history of this country. His determination and perseverance and his  trailblazing spirit should be recognized with a Congressional Gold  Medal.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
