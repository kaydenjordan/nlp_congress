 Mr. Collins, I had several parents in my  office today. I thought I would talk about a couple of the meetings  that I had.   I had a father there talking about his son Gabe. He had a T-shirt on  with ``H4G,'' which stands for ``Hope for Gabe.'' I listened to him  talk about his son and the life-threatening disease that his son has  and the threat that his son is under because of a U.S. pharmaceutical  manufacturer named Marathon. I would like to read part of an email that  I have from him:         Hope you are well. I just wanted to let you know that my       son Gabe takes a drug called Deflazacort. He has since he was       5 years old. He is now 11. We currently pay $116 for a 3-      month supply of 15-milligram dose for Deflazacort. We were       getting this drug from Europe, as it was not available here       in the United States, and have had no problem with access to       date.    Now, many of you heard about this story. The FDA approved the same  drug for sale in the United States. What did the drug manufacturer do  with the price of it? Well, Marathon took the price from $116 a quarter  to approximately $87,000 a year.   Now, this is what is happening. For drugs that are available  everywhere  [[Page H1455]]  else in the world, it is not that they are being developed with  extensive research and expensive research in our country. People are  simply buying the right to sell the drug in the United States. As soon  as approved and available in the U.S. marketplace, it is no longer  legal for people to import that drug from Europe. Marathon priced the  drug at $89,000 per year.   Reading again from his email, in bold letters:         It is the same drug we are getting today from Europe for       $450 per year, the exact same drug. We need your help here.       The Duchenne community needs your help, and specifically Gabe       needs your help.                                time  1930    As I sit here and look at the American flag, you know, there is no  other country in the world that allows their citizens to be treated  like this. None. I am embarrassed that this Congress hasn't done  anything about this abuse to the American citizens from the  pharmaceutical and the PBM industry.   I know our President, and I am glad that we have a President with the  courage and the boldness that our President has, had the executives to  the White House. I would suggest that a good meeting also would be to  have the parents--have the father of Gabe, have the mother of Gabe come  to the White House. Sit down in the same room with the TVs on with the  executives from those companies that are cheating these people. Let's  let the executives explain on TV in front of the parents, in front of  the child who needs that lifesaving drug why it costs $450 in another  country but should cost $87,000 in America.   Another group of parents that was in my office today was there  representing juvenile diabetes. I had a heart-wrenching discussion with  a mother in my office in Warner Robins about her daughter, insulin- dependent. She has got to have it or she dies. This mother had a job,  actually, in another country and talked about what she paid in another  country to receive that same drug, insulin, for her child. It cost a  fraction of what it cost in America.   I think it would be great for our President to have that mother and  that daughter or the mother who was in my office today talking about  her daughter come and sit down at the White House, and maybe the  president of Eli Lilly could come and sit down. Maybe we could put the  TV on, the cameras on so everybody in America could see the CEO explain  why insulin, which has been around for decades, costs as much in this  country as it does when it doesn't cost anywhere near that in any other  country.   Something has got to give. Something has got to give. The American  families have given enough. I am hopeful that we will move sooner  rather than later. American families can't take it anymore. A drug that  costs $450, that can be imported from Europe, shouldn't cost $87,000 in  America.   On top of the issues with what is happening with the manufacturers,  we have got the issue with the PBMs.   Why shouldn't you know what the PBMs are getting in a kickback?   Everywhere else you go, you get a price sticker. You know what the  rebates are when you go to your local car dealer. They are readily  advertised.   Why shouldn't you know as the American citizen?   My friend Mr. Collins and I have been working on it for years. We  worked on it back in the State legislature. In fact, we passed a bill  back in, I think, 1987, the first transparency act that we passed in  the State legislature in Georgia. I hope that governors and members of  the State legislatures will go back and address this issue as well. The  transparency issues can be done at the State level. That bill came to  the Georgia House floor, and it passed 150-0. Not a single Democrat,  not a single Republican voted against that bill. Every single member  who was there that day voted for the bill.   Mr. Speaker, we know something has got to be done. I just hope that  we take action sooner rather than later.   I would just like to make one last request. Mr. President, I hope you  will invite these parents and their children to the White House. I hope  you will invite the CEOs of these companies to come and sit down at the  same table, and I hope you will even invite the press to come and  publicize the meeting.   I thank Mr. Collins so much for standing up for the American  citizens. I am honored to be a friend of his, and I thank him for  allowing me to be in the fight.
