 Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee and the  entire country heard from one of the most impressive nominees for any  public office in a long time. Judge Amy Coney Barrett demonstrated that  she has the deep legal expertise, dispassionate judicial temperament,  and sheer intellectual horsepower the American people deserve to have  on the Supreme Court. Her nomination prompted an outpouring of praise  from across academia, the legal profession, and, importantly, the  political spectrum. Last week, our committee colleagues saw why fellow  legal scholars called Judge Barrett ``a brilliant and conscientious  lawyer who will analyze and decide cases in good faith'' and say she is  ``tailor-made for this job.'' They heard firsthand why her former law  clerks and students called her ``a woman of unassailable integrity''  and ``a role model for generations to come.''   They heard thoughtful answers that explained why the American Bar  Association--an institution the Democratic leader has called ``the gold  standard''--deems Judge Barrett ``well qualified'' to sit on the  Supreme Court. They heard why the legal professionals behind that  rating call her ``a staggering academic mind.''  [[Page S6050]]    The Chair of the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary  told the committee directly that ``in interviews with individuals in  the legal profession and community who know Judge Barrett, whether for  a few years or decades, not one person uttered a negative word about  her character.''   Of course, there is another way you can tell that Judge Barrett is so  impressive and so qualified. It is the fact that the people who  precommitted to oppose her nomination have completely retreated from  arguing the merits. Virtually none of the politicians, pundits, or  special interests that opposed Judge Barrett from the beginning have  even tried to lay a finger on her qualifications or credentials.   We have seen inaccurate claims that it would be abnormal for the  Senate to fill this seat. We have seen bizarre, barely disguised  insinuations about the nominee's religious faith, and now, this  morning, there was improper press scrutiny of her children. We have  heard Democrats try to take hostage our very institutions of government  to stop this precedent-backed process from moving forward, but none of  the distortions can even begin to cloud the incredible qualifications  of the nominee.   I look forward to the Judiciary Committee's vote on Thursday. The  full Senate will turn to Judge Barrett's nomination as soon as it comes  out of committee. I will be proud to vote to confirm this exceptional  jurist                            ____________________     Madam President, this week the Senate will vote on  more coronavirus relief that Congress could deliver to American  families right now.   Month after month, Speaker Pelosi has held up urgent assistance for  workers, families, schools, and our healthcare system. Month after  month, she has refused to set aside non-COVID-related demands and far- left policy riders that she knows are sabotaging any shot at a deal.  Why? Well, because--and these are her own words--she thinks agreeing to  a bipartisan compromise might make the Democrats seem like ``a cheap  date''--her words. The Speaker said over and over again that she does  not believe it is better for workers to get something rather than  nothing.   Thus far, Senate Democrats have gone along with it. We could have  passed hundreds of billions of dollars in relief more than a month ago,  but our Democratic colleagues voted in lockstep to filibuster relief  and kill the bill. Unless Democrats got every single non-COVID-related  wish-list item they were after, American families would get nothing.  Every single Senate Democrat voted to filibuster hundreds of billions  of dollars of noncontroversial assistance, except our colleague who is  running for Vice President. So she wasn't here at all.   This has been the position for months: all-or-nothing obstruction. It  has to stop. The Speaker's Marie Antoinette act needs to end. Zero  dollars for working families but a whole lot of television time for the  Speaker of the House is not a good trade for the American people.   Speaker Pelosi's supposed leverage is not putting food on the table  in households where one or both parents have lost their jobs. Speaker  Pelosi's so-called leverage is not helping schools reopen safely or  struggling small business to avoid layoffs. The Democrats' talking  points are not doing a single thing to fund more testing, more tracing,  or double down on Project Warp Speed so we can produce and distribute a  vaccine.   Tomorrow and Wednesday, the Senate is going to vote. We will see  whether our Democratic colleagues in this Chamber agree that families  deserve nothing rather than something, or whether they are ready to let  the Senate make law across the huge areas where we do not even  disagree.   Tomorrow, we will have a stand-alone vote on creating a second round  of the historic Paycheck Protection Program for the hardest hit small  businesses. The PPP has saved tens of millions of American jobs and  kept main streets across America from turning into permanent COVID-19  ghost towns.   The program is as bipartisan as it gets. Not only did it pass  unanimously in the first place, but we also added funding and made  tweaks several times without a single objection in either Chamber.   So tomorrow, Tuesday, every Senator will cast an up-or-down vote on  establishing a whole second draw of these emergency loans for the small  businesses that need it the most--no more all or nothing, no more  endless posturing, just one clear vote on one clear good thing that  nobody even says they oppose. It would make a huge difference for  workers who may otherwise be laid off.   Then, on Wednesday, the Senate will vote again on a larger bill. It  will pour hundreds of billions of dollars into the PPP expansion, plus  more Federal unemployment insurance, more money for safe schools, more  money for testing, more money for vaccines, and many other important  priorities.   Nobody thinks this proposal would resolve every problem forever. What  it does contain is half a trillion dollars of good that Congress can do  right now through programs that Democrats do not even say they oppose.  American families deserve for us to agree where we can, make law, and  push huge amounts of money out the door while Washington continues  arguing over the rest. It is common sense. It is what the country  needs. I hope our Democratic colleagues will finally let it happen.   Madam President, what is the pending business?                            ____________________     I withdraw amendment No. 2673.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk  for the motion to concur with amendment No. 2652.    I have a second-degree amendment to the motion to  concur with amendment.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.  [[Page S6051]]     I move to proceed to Calendar No. 554, S. 4675.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, ``It would have been really hard for us  to get through without it.'' That was the coowner of Apollo Pizza,  which has a handful of locations throughout Kentucky.   ``It touches my heart just knowing that I can bring folks back and  gainfully employ people who need to work.'' That was a restaurateur in  Fayetteville, NC.   ``It's pennies from heaven as far as our business is concerned.''  That was one small business owner in Highlands Ranch, CO.   ``It just made sense to us that if we're going to be able to get  money from the government . . . spend it on our employees.'' That is  from a fourth-generation owner of a bagel shop in Ferndale, MI.   Those are just four of the millions and millions of hard-working  Americans who have had an economic lifeline to help them endure this  crisis year. That lifeline is the Paycheck Protection Program, the PPP.   About 7 months ago, our Nation's top medical experts recommended we  do something without precedent--shutter whole sectors of the economy to  protect Americans from the pandemic. Congress needed a historic plan to  help workers, and our colleagues Senator Rubio and Senator Collins  stepped forward. They realized we could not simply let Main Street go  under. We could not simply tell millions and millions more workers to  forget about their jobs and join the unemployment lines. We couldn't  just let every storefront except the biggest corporate retailers turn  into permanent pandemic ghost towns. We had to give small businesses  and their workers a fighting chance.   The senior Senators from Maine and Florida found the solution. They  literally invented the PPP. It would fund emergency loans to employers,  and those loans would be forgivable so long as the money would be used  to keep paying their people. As far as emergency government rescues go,  their idea was actually a bold, free-enterprise policy. Don't just sign  everyone up for welfare; fight to save jobs. Keep workers connected to  their jobs and their paychecks.   As we wrote the CARES Act, Senators Rubio and Collins got together  with Senator Cardin and put the finishing touches on the program. Soon,  the PPP had become law without a single dissenting vote in either  Chamber.  [[Page S6304]]  The program proved so popular that it quickly committed all its  funding. So, in April, we refilled it with more money. That was  unanimous in the Senate as well. Then, in June, we tweaked the program  on the fly to help small businesses even more. Once again, it was  unanimous--no objection from any Republican or any Democrat here in the  Senate. This program has had the most bipartisan pedigree possible, and  those bipartisan beginnings have led to a major policy success story.   For millions of Americans from coast to coast, the PPP has made all  the difference in the world. It has kept paychecks coming into their  mailboxes and bank accounts where there otherwise would have been pink  slips. Every State, every town, every city knows the difference it has  made.   So where are we today?   That historic first draw of the PPP has wound down; the program has  closed to new applications; many firms have run through their funds,  but, clearly, our economic recovery remains a work in progress. For  many workers, business has not come roaring back to normal, and it  won't until the health situation allows it.   Fortunately, Senator Rubio and Senator Collins have stepped up again.  Our colleagues have legislation that will refund and reopen the PPP. It  will establish a whole second round for the hardest hit small  businesses that need help the most, and thanks to the efforts of  several colleagues, the legislation will also streamline the program  and strengthen oversight.   I would submit that, even for a Congress this divided, even in the  year 2020, reopening the PPP really ought to be a no-brainer. There is  bipartisan agreement that American workers still need help, and there  is already bipartisan infrastructure in place to provide that help, but  there is a problem. The PPP has been taken hostage. Just like the  funding for safe schools, more funding for testing, more funding for  vaccines, more funding for Federal unemployment benefits, and  commonsense legal protections that charities and university presidents  have been pleading for, the PPP has been taken hostage by Speaker  Pelosi and Leader Schumer.   The Democratic leaders have spent months holding out for a long, far- left wish list of non-COVID-related priorities and obstructing any  additional aid until they get it. All or nothing--that has been their  position. Either Democrats get every unrelated policy they want or  American families get nothing. So, for months, they have blocked  bipartisan aid at every single turn. The Democratic leader even tried  last night to adjourn the Senate so we could do nothing at all for 3  weeks--nothing at all for 3 weeks. That is how urgent he thinks it is  to help working people. He wanted to go home for 3 weeks.   Because President Trump will not just cave to the entire Democratic  Party's platform--for example, the President won't simply hand out  endless sums of cash to chronically mismanaged State and city  governments out of proportion to COVID needs--Speaker Pelosi has seen  to it that working families have gotten nothing rather than something.   So, look, every Senator in this body knows this is not how people act  if they actually want an outcome. American families, working families,  have waited months and months for Speaker Pelosi to end her ``Marie  Antoinette'' act and let Congress find common ground. There is no  reason this second round of the Paycheck Protection Program should wait  another single day. So we are going to vote on this legislation today-- one clear vote on one clear program that all in this Chamber say they  want to pass.   Well, I will let you in on a secret. There is something Senators do  when we want something to pass. Here is what we do when we want  something to pass: We vote for it. It is no counterargument to complain  that the PPP legislation does not also contain 100 other things. The  entire point is to agree where we can and make law while we keep  arguing over all the rest.   If my Democratic colleagues oppose the job-saving PPP, they should  come to the floor and say why they oppose it. Otherwise, this afternoon  should bring another unanimous vote.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess until 2:15 p.m. today.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I withdraw the motion to proceed to  Calendar No. 554, S. 4675.    Madam President, I move to table amendment No. 2680  and ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 554,  S. 4675.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 866.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.
