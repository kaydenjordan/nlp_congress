 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Jose  Ornelas, who passed away on July 19. Jose was a friend and a dedicated  public servant, serving as a council member in San Joaquin, California.   The son of farmworkers, Mr. Ornelas earned many academic degrees and  was a successful small business owner.   But his passion was community service, public service. Always a  fierce advocate for rural communities, Jose believed deeply in the  attainability of the American Dream for all Central Valley families.   He spearheaded the group Nueva Ali-anza, an organization composed of  farmworker families dedicated to fighting for workers' rights and  environmental justice.   He was also a founding member of the influential Central Valley  Leadership Roundtable that advocates for expanded opportunity in rural  communities throughout the Valley.   As a mentor to many young people, Jose was a youth soccer coach. He  promoted civic engagement and tirelessly worked to expand access to  clean drinking water for our families.   He is survived by his parents, siblings, his lovely wife, Nadia, and  their six children: Jose Jr., Gustavo, Angel, Oscar, Giselle, and  Shayla. He will always be remembered for his generous spirit and always  as a steadfast champion for rural farmworker families.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to advocate for  amendment No. 33 to H.R. 7608, the Department of State, Foreign  Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year  2021. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle have come together to  support this amendment, which should appropriate $1.4 million in  foreign aid for ongoing humanitarian demining in Nagorno Karabakh-- Artsakh.   USAID's demining program has eliminated nearly 4,000 landmines and  over 57,000 items of unexploded ordnance, saving many lives from these  remnants of war. The program has also transformed over 62,000 acres of  former minefield and battlefield into land that can be used  productively.   However, we know that significant landmine contamination remains.  Nagomo Karabakh has suffered from one of the worst mine accident rates  in the world, with nearly 400 civilian casualties since 1994--a quarter  of which have been children. Just last month an 11-year old boy named  Hovannes found a submunition while digging in his family's garden.  Because Hovannes had received U.S.-funded mine risk education about how  to identify the weapon and stay safe, he told his family about the  item, who contacted the U.S. demining program. The submunition was  safely removed the next day.   Continued funding for the demining program will unquestionably save  lives and generate peace and stability in the region. The United  States' demining program in Nagomo Karabakh represents the only source  of U.S. support in the region, and the only demining assistance  available to the families of Karabakh. Without an appropriation of $1.4  million, the U.S. demining program will close, and families in the  region, who are still waiting for their land to be made safe, will  suffer indefinitely--families that are of utmost importance to the many  Armenian American communities in my district and throughout our nation.   Landmine clearance is a bipartisan U.S. priority that will provide  critical humanitarian relief to countless families in Nagomo Karabakh  who continue to live in constant threat of danger. I urge my colleagues  to support this amendment and help provide much needed stability to  this region, while continuing to support a constructive relationship  between the U.S., Nagomo Karabakh, and Armenia.
