 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Henry Mack, a  blue water Navy veteran and our Central Virginian of the Week.   Mr. Mack served in the U.S. Navy and completed five combat tours in  Vietnam.   After attending Virginia Union University and settling in  Chesterfield County, he witnessed the difficulties facing fellow  veterans as they returned home. Unemployment and homelessness were  prevalent, and former servicemembers faced extreme delays when trying  to access their earned pensions and benefits.   He decided to take action, and in 1998 Mr. Mack founded the nonprofit  Veterans Helping Veterans Now. By intervening early and walking  alongside veterans through each step of an often tedious process, Mr.  Mack's organization helps our neighbors gain employment, secure their  benefits, and overcome challenges like PTSD and addiction.   Today, Veterans Helping Veterans Now has assisted more than 4,000  Americans in Virginia and across the country.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Mack for his selfless service both in  uniform and as an advocate for his fellow veterans.                            ____________________
