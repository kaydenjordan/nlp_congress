 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the service and  sacrifice of hometown hero and Medal of Honor recipient PFC Garfield M.  Langhorn from Riverhead, New York, who, 50 years ago today, saved the  lives of his platoon members, at just 20 years old, by throwing himself  on a live grenade in Pleiku province in Vietnam on January 15, 1969.   PFC Langhorn served as a radio operator with Troop C, 7th Squadron,  17th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Aviation Brigade, when his unit attempted to  rescue the crew of a downed American helicopter. Finding no surviving  crew, PFC Langhorn and his unit were returning the fallen aviators when  they came under heavy fire from North Vietnamese forces.   Under the cover of darkness, the North Vietnamese began to advance,  throwing a hand grenade in front of PFC Langhorn, who threw himself on  the grenade. The grenade was just a few feet from a few of his injured  comrades.  [[Page H549]]                                     time  1015    It was in that moment, PFC Langhorn was so selfless, he chose a  courageous act that President Lincoln once referred to as ``the last  full measure of devotion.'' It was an act for his brothers, his fellow  soldiers, and his country. In that moment, he ``unhesitatingly threw  himself on the grenade, scooped it beneath his body and absorbed the  blast,'' according to the Medal of Honor Citation and the firsthand  accounts of his fellow soldiers he saved.   For his extraordinary act of bravery, PFC Langhorn received a series  of awards, including the highest, most prestigious personal military  declaration, the Medal of Honor. Most recently, the Riverhead Post  Office was named in his honor. There is no doubt PFC Langhorn has  earned these commendations, but they mean little if we forget to look  beyond the declarations and forever remember and honor the actions of  the 20-year-old man who earned them.   In saving his fellow soldiers, PFC Langhorn's life was extinguished  too soon, but as President Lincoln continued, ``we here highly resolve  that these dead shall not have died in vain.''   Today, we must challenge ourselves as Americans to pick up that  torch, to embody the bravery, selflessness, and commitment to our great  country. There is no memorial, no medal, and no post office that can  bring back PFC Langhorn, but he can live eternally in all of us, in our  actions and in our hearts.                            ____________________
