 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak  about an organization that is near and dear to my heart, the Lions  Clubs International. I am a member of my hometown organization, the  Howard Area Lions Club. I am proud that for many years it has been the  largest Lions Club in Pennsylvania, despite being in a very rural area.  Last year marked our club's 40th anniversary.   The Howard Area Lions Club has consistently earned the recognition as  the largest Lions Club in Pennsylvania. There are probably many factors  that have led them to this title, but none more significant than their  commitment to the Lions Club motto: We serve. The members of this club  have served as the chartering organization for the Howard Scout Troop  353. I have been honored to serve as a Scoutmaster of that troop since  they first assumed this responsibility.   The idea of the Lions Club began 100 years ago in Chicago. A 38-year- old businessman named Melvin Jones told members of the local business  club that they should reach beyond their business issues and address  the betterment of their communities and the world, and they agreed.  Three years later, the Lions Club became an international organization.  Melvin Jones inspired generations of people to become civic-minded  individuals dedicated to using their talents and their ambition to  improve their communities without financial reward. Melvin Jones had a  personal code: ``You can't get very far until you start doing something  for somebody else.''   Well, the Lions Club redoubled its commitment to help others when a  young advocate for the disabled spoke at the 1925 Lions Clubs  International convention. This woman challenged the Lions to become  ``knights of the blind in the crusade against darkness.'' Of course,  this woman was Helen Keller.   Helen Keller developed a fever at 18 months of age that left her  blind and deaf. After working with an exceptional teacher, Helen Keller  learned sign language and braille, and a few years later she learned to  speak.   The Lions accepted Helen Keller's challenge and ever since have  worked on several projects to prevent blindness, restore eyesight, and  improve eye care for folks all around the world. Sight became one of  the Lions' defining causes. Many are familiar with its eyeglasses  recycling program where individuals can donate reading glasses they no  longer need.   Mr. Speaker, service to others is what makes Lions Clubs  International such a powerful force of good in the world. I am grateful  that Lions Clubs around the globe serve millions annually. I am so  proud to be a member of an organization that not only lives up to its  remarkable ideals but exceeds them time and time again.   Congratulations to the Lions Clubs International on their centennial  anniversary.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud  member of the Foster Youth Caucus, and also as part of a family that  was involved in the foster care system.   Today I have the opportunity to spend time with Britni Burlingham as  part of the Annual Foster Youth Shadow Day.   Britni is a social work major at Edinboro University in Pennsylvania.  She is also a case aide for the Bair Foundation, a nonprofit  organization that focuses on foster care and adoption.   This profession is rewarding for Britni because she has a firsthand  experience. She entered the foster care system when she was just 7  years old.   Britni has said that being able to work with children who have had  similar experiences to hers is life-changing. She and her husband also  provide a loving home to their two foster daughters.   I am grateful that I can spend time today with Britni and hear about  her positive experience with foster care. Her adoptive family built a  strong foundation for her to achieve success in her own life.   Mr. Speaker, this is what foster care is all about.   I thank Britni for being here today, sharing her story and helping so  many children overcome similar obstacles.   Congratulations, Britni. We are all very proud of your success.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, many of us in this House will attend Memorial Day  ceremonies over the weekend as we honor those who have died in the  service to this great Nation.   Certainly, in this office, one of the more difficult but one of the  most honored opportunities is to be at the grave site of our fallen  heroes as they are laid to rest and that American flag, which flies  over our Capitol, is draped over their coffin.   On this Memorial Day, I really want to highlight my brother-in-law,  Larry Emerman, who in the fall of 1980, in the service of this country  as a pilot in the United States Navy as a lieutenant commander, lost  his life in the service of our Nation.   Memorial Day is observed on the last Monday of May. Memorial Day is  one of America's most solemn occasions. The tradition of Memorial Day  dates back to 1864 in Boalsburg, Pennsylvania, which is considered to  be the birthplace of Memorial Day. Three ladies decorated the graves of  fallen Civil War soldiers, and the custom has continued every year  since then.   It was an early fall day, in 1864, when Emma Hunter and her friend,  Sophie Keller, picked flowers and went to the old cemetery to lay them  on the grave of Emma's father, Reuben Hunter. Dr. Hunter was a young  Boalsburg doctor at the time of the Civil War. When he volunteered to  serve with the Army of the North, he was assigned to the hospital in  Baltimore. In addition to attending the wounded soldiers, he also cared  for the men who had contracted yellow fever while fighting in the  southern swamplands. Dr. Hunter became ill. He died of yellow fever,  and his body was buried in the Boalsburg Cemetery.   On their way that day in that early fall, the two girls met Mrs.  Elizabeth Myers, whose young son, Amos, had been killed the last day of  the Battle of Gettysburg and was also buried in the old cemetery.  Learning where the girls were going, Mrs. Myers asked to join them.  They shared the flowers, and they placed them on both graves. It was  decided then and there that they would meet the following year with  flowers for all who had died in the Civil War. The three young women  told their friends of the plans, and when the day came around, most of  the villagers joined them.   From that simple beginning came the observance of Memorial Day in  Boalsburg, Pennsylvania. Every year since then, the people have met on  the Diamond in Boalsburg Square for the walk to the old cemetery to lay  flowers on the graves of all the soldiers dead.   They are led by a hometown band. All ages join in the walk and  participate in the simple service of remembering. I have been proud to  participate in that tradition which has spanned more than 150 years.   Boalsburg still puts on a traditional Memorial Day celebration  complete with a parade, a community walk to the cemetery, speeches,  military reenactments, and much more.   On Memorial Day, communities across the country will pay tribute to  our fallen veterans who never returned home. Many of us will gather  with family members, friends, and neighbors as we keep those we lost in  our hearts.   Unfortunately, for many of our Nation, Memorial Day has become a day  of picnics and family gatherings, which is not a bad thing, but we must  always remember truly where Memorial Day came from and its purpose,  that we not forget those sacrifices.   So as we raise the Stars and Stripes and as we lay wreaths at the  monuments, memorials, and cemeteries, let us remember that our freedom  is thanks to those who have died in sacrifice. We celebrate Memorial  Day in honor of so many who are no longer with us. May God bless them,  and certainly God bless the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for his leadership  and putting this opportunity today for us to gather on the floor to  speak on the topic of not just Memorial Day but the service and the  sacrifice that warranted its origination.
