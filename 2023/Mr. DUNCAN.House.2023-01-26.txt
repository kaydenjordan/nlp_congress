 Mr. Chairman, I thank the Chairwoman for the time. She  has done a great job. We look forward to big things on the Energy and  Commerce Committee.   Mr. Chairman, I have been watching this debate, and the Democrats are  having a hard time defending the administration's drawdown of a  strategic asset for the political reasons to lower gas prices during an  election year. I mean, it is obvious. The ranking member has been down  here on the floor, pretty much left alone to debate this piece of  legislation.   Even the Biden administration understands that House Democrats will  have to support this sound energy policy that facilitates oil and gas  development and has preemptively threatened to veto this legislation.   The Biden administration has said time and again that there is  nothing prohibiting energy production in the United States. But we, the  people, we know better because we lived it. We saw when energy  production was high in this country under the past administration, gas  prices were lower.   Once the Biden administration came in and started stopping oil and  gas leasing and drilling, gas prices went up, and they felt the  political pressure. The Biden administration and the House Democrats  felt the political pressure.   So what did they do? They tapped into a strategic reserve for  America. The SPR, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, is set aside for  emergencies like Hurricane Katrina, for a time of war, for emergencies,  not for a political maneuver to lower gas prices in an election year.   I will tell you what: Put your money where your mouth is. Support  this measure instead of hiding behind the excuse that this bill ties  the President's hands, which we know isn't true.   The SPR should never be tapped to offset high consumer prices caused  by irresponsible energy policies. H.R. 21 calls out what we know:  Draining the SPR, as it has been drained over the last 15 months,  acknowledges that getting prices down is about having more supply on  the market.   It was a blip. It was a temporary price reduction at home. We need to  produce here. We need to produce now.   We have been blessed in this Nation with abundant natural resources,  but we have been cursed by liberal politicians who don't want us to tap  into those abundant resources.   How could anyone believe this administration supports oil and gas  production when President Biden literally campaigned on ending the  industry?   So prove us wrong. Show support for this legislation. Show America  you support sound energy policy, and vote in support of H.R. 21. Take  the first step in unleashing American energy production and allow  America to become energy dominant once again.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, H.R. 21 is about strengthening the SPR by  requiring any nonemergency use to be accompanied by a plan to produce  American oil resources.   Energy security, based on energy abundance, leads to reliable, clean,  and affordable delivery of energy. This is fundamental for our jobs,  our economic health, for communities striving for better opportunities.  It reduces energy poverty and improves health and welfare.   This amendment really is an unnecessary messaging exercise. There is  no reason to delay implementation of this, so let's focus on results  for Americans.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, H.R. 21 is really about strengthening the SPR  by requiring nonemergency use to be accompanied by a plan to produce  American oil resources. Increased supply of  [[Page H403]]  American-produced energy lowers costs for all Americans.   Energy security provides all communities with reliable, clean, and  affordable energy. This is fundamental for our jobs, economic health,  and for communities to strive for better opportunities.   It reduces energy poverty. Lower-income households pay a higher  percentage of their income for energy. Lower costs help everyone.  Greater supplies lower costs, and create jobs here in America with  American-produced energy resources.   This amendment misses the point. It is an unnecessary messaging  exercise. Let's focus on results for Americans, American jobs, American  energy.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this is a messaging amendment. We saw the  President draw down the SPR in order to lower gas prices. That is not  the purpose of the SPR. The SPR is not a political tool to be  implemented with a drawdown right before an election.   This was a blip on the radar for lowering gas prices for our  constituents.   The SPR was designed for emergencies for this Nation, whether there  is a hurricane hitting Louisiana or a war. That is the purpose of the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is not just a reserve that the  President can tap into to influence elections and lower gas prices for  folks. The way to do that is to increase American energy production in  this country.   We are blessed in this Nation with abundant natural resources, but  apparently, we are cursed by liberal politicians who don't want us to  tap into those abundant resources that will help the quality of life of  people not only in America but by exporting some of those resources to  people across the globe, you can improve the quality of lives for  people around the world.   Yet, we saw a drawdown of the SPR to temporarily lower prices. That  was wrong. Emergencies only.   When we draw it down, we ought to produce American energy and refill  it, not buy oil from OPEC or adversaries using American resources,  again, that we are blessed with in this Nation.   This amendment will allow the Department of Energy, the  administration, to continue abusing something that wasn't intended for  that, and that is the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We use SPR; we can  call it SPR. We can try to downplay the intended purpose, strategic  purposes, to help Americans at a time when it is needed. That is in a  time of emergency.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this is just another distraction and delay  tactic, nothing more than a stunt.   The Secretary of Energy had culpability in drawing down the SPR to  lower gas prices just before a midterm election. She would certainly  delay the implementation of this bill without making that certification  that is included in this amendment.   If we really want to protect consumers, let's prioritize them instead  of radical climate policies. Let's produce American energy here at  home--safe, reliable, deliverable--lowering prices at the pump for  transportation fuels, lowering prices at homes in heating, lowering  prices for manufacturers that need natural gas, reliable electricity  produced by fossil fuels in many instances.   The intent of this bill is protecting the SPR. Let's take the first  step in reducing the price to consumers by unleashing American energy  production, lowering costs here at home.   Let's take care of the SPR for its intended purpose. That is the  purpose of this bill.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve a point of order.    Mr. Chair, I insist on the point of order.    Mr. Chair, the amendment violates clause 7 of rule XVI of  the House rules because it is not germane to the underlying bill.   Specifically, the bill limits the drawdown of petroleum from the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve until the Department of Energy develops a  plan to increase the percentage of Federal lands leased for oil and gas  production. The amendment limits the drawdown of petroleum in the SPR  until the Department of Energy certifies to Congress that the U.S. is  meeting the Paris climate accord's targets to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions and the recommendations of the Justice40 Initiative.   The amendment also requires a report outlining how funds made  available under Public Law 117-169 ``are being used to confront decades  of underinvestment in disadvantaged communities that bear the burden of  climate change and environmental hazards.''   All of this is well outside the scope of H.R. 21, which simply asks  for a plan to increase oil and gas production on Federal lands.   Mr. Chair, for that reason, the amendment is not germane, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, H.R. 21 is about strengthening the SPR by  requiring nonemergency use to be accompanied by a plan to produce  American energy resources.   We have witnessed the tremendous benefits of energy security from the  shale revolution, the amazing technological advancements and  innovations from American companies, private companies, companies that  have ownership in equities markets.   America does not have State-owned oil companies like OPEC and Russia.   This amendment not only undermines the important purpose of this  bill, it undermines American innovators who thrive on the capital  markets. Capitalism.   I understand the gentlewoman across the aisle doesn't like  capitalism, but capitalism provides benevolence. In so many ways, this  amendment is anti-free market.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, let me state again that H.R. 21 is about  strengthening the SPR by requiring nonemergency use to be accompanied  by a plan to produce American resources.   Mr. Chair, I invite the Members across the aisle to actually go out  and talk to oil and gas producers, understand leases, understand that  every square acre out in the ocean or on land doesn't have oil or gas  under it. They have got to find it.   They have got to start drilling, exploring, and producing. And once  they produce, they have got to pipe that either to the beach or put it  on a ship to be taken to refineries.  [[Page H406]]    They have a permitting process for pipelines that do that, permitting  processes to get the well actually permitted once they discover  resources. Go and learn. Go and learn for yourself about this. Educate  yourself on how America attained its low emissions.   If you care about the air quality, you care about climate change-- natural gas is what got America there. Educate yourself on that, and we  can have a better debate about future resources and future energy  production.   This debate tonight is not about any of that. It is about the SPR. It  is about the fact that the Biden administration drew down on the SPR  for one purpose: to lower gas prices for Americans right before an  election. That is influential politics.   This is about efficient, clean American energy production. Efforts to  reduce our production means the world relies more on nations that do  not impose state-of-the-art controls on emissions. Think Russia. Think  China. Think about what America has done.   This amendment would limit clean energy, American-produced clean  energy, and increase emissions-heavy foreign energy.   It hurts me when I see an American LNG tanker in the Boston Harbor  when we have the natural gas here in this country, cleaner burning  natural gas. This is about the SPR.   As chair of the Energy Subcommittee, I look forward to a lot of  debates on energy resources, American energy production, and clean  energy, and what works to make America energy dominant once again--but  we are not doing it tonight.   We are going to talk about the SPR. We are going to talk about  replenishing it. We are going to talk about American resources. This  amendment is counterproductive to energy security and addressing  climate risk.   American oil production is the cleanest in the world; where it is  produced and where it is used.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, the last time I checked, I don't think the  United States of America signed onto or ratified the Paris accords.  This is a messaging amendment.   If we are serious about addressing global climate risk and preserving  and expanding the prosperity of the American people, we should focus on  American energy security and American energy resources.   When you bring in the Paris climate accord, or Kyoto, the United  States, to my understanding, has actually achieved the carbon emissions  goals set forth in those agreements, and we have done it through  American energy resources, like clean burning natural gas.   This bill is about protecting our strategic resources and ensuring  American energy production, which we do more cleanly than most any  other Nation. I mentioned Russian natural gas in Massachusetts. It  burns dirtier than American-produced gas.   I have got a solution. How about we permit pipelines from the  Marcellus up to New England and allow New England to burn cleaner  burning, less carbon-emission-emitting natural gas produced here at  home.   This amendment is unnecessary. It is a messaging amendment.  [[Page H407]]    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1930
