 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  Emergency Supplemental bill. I commend the bipartisan leadership of the  Appropriations Committee for bringing this critically needed bill to  the floor so quickly.   Time is of the essence for my constituents. Why? Because in my  District, we already have 3 confirmed cases of Coronavirus.   I just finished 2 days of in-depth meetings with front-line medical  experts at both the Doctors Hospital and Sarasota Memorial Hospital.   The message I have today for my colleagues in the House is crystal  clear. We need to dramatically ramp-up the supply of test kits,  increase the number of locations where people exhibiting symptoms can  easily get tested, and accelerate the process of getting results back-- hopefully in less than 24 hours.   It is imperative that Congress quickly pass this bill so that key  state and local public health agencies and officials, who are on the  front-line of this pandemic get all of the resources they need. This  will help them to identify potential patients and treat confirmed  patients while working to keep everyone else safe from further exposure  to this dangerous viral agent.   Today is no time for partisan games.   Congress should rise to the occasion by working together to approve  this bill so that President Trump can sign it into law and provide  vital funds and assistance to my part of southwest Florida and the rest  of the Nation.
