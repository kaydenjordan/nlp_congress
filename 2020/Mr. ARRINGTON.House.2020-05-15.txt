 Mr. Speaker, Democrat leadership has established in  this piece of legislation a new pandemic protocol for the United States  Congress: the practice of reality distancing. Reality distancing is the  unhealthy distance between politicians and their policies and the  people they were elected to serve.   While tens of millions of working families have lost their  livelihoods and millions more are struggling to survive, Members of  Congress won't miss a single paycheck and are wasting precious time on  a partisan bill that is going nowhere.   Furthermore, Speaker Pelosi and many of her colleagues are so anxious  to appease the left, and so zealous to advance their ideology, they  didn't even attempt to disguise this parade of horribles that is  completely out of touch with the American people.   Some will suggest, Mr. Speaker, that this legislation is so extreme  and absurd we can't take it seriously. I would submit that we can't  take it seriously enough. When someone tells you who they are, believe  them. This isn't just the Democrats' plan for America's recovery; this  is their vision for America.   I oppose it, and I pray to God none of these policies see the light  of day.
