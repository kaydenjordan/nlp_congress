 Madam Speaker, I rise today to mark the 100th anniversary  of this Chamber's passage of the 19th Amendment guaranteeing women the  right to vote.   The battle for the 19th Amendment was long and hard-fought. It was 72  years from the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848 to the affirmation in  our Constitution that women were owed the right to vote.   But the ultimate goal was not just the vote. It was what the vote  means: that American women, all women, could enjoy the same rights and  freedoms as American men.   In the last 100 years, we remain well short of that goal. In fact,  this past week's latest assault on women's bodily autonomy is proof of  that. The fact that women make 80 cents on the dollar compared to men,  and much less for women of color, shows that we have a long way to go.   When there is so much work left to do to realize full equality for  all American citizens, we cannot afford to move backward.  [[Page H4016]]    It is clear we need women's voices now more than ever. I am very  proud of the fact that 40 percent of the Democrats in Congress are  women, but we need more.   I am proud to serve with the largest group of women in Congress in  U.S. history and to call these incredible Congresswomen my friends,  colleagues, and Speaker of the House. I look forward to working with  them toward full gender equality.   We will not wait another 100 years.                            ____________________
