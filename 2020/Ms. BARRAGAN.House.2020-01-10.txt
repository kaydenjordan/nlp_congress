 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Too often our communities of color are left behind. Too often, they  are on the front lines of environmental injustice. That is why I am  proud to cosponsor this bill with Representatives Tlaib and Ocasio- Cortez.   Our amendment makes sure that help gets to the people who need it the  most. It requires the newly established PFAS community water systems  grant program to prioritize communities that are disproportionately  exposed to environmental harms and public health impacts from  pollution.   Many of those communities are communities like my very own district.  Communities of color and low-income communities are disproportionately  exposed to PFAS contamination. They often face a variety of  environmental threats, such as: exhaust from congested highways, water  runoff or air pollution from toxic chemical facilities, and close  proximity to landfills.   When a grant application to address PFAS contamination is under  consideration, these communities that have exposure first and worst  should get priority. It shouldn't be an afterthought. That is why this  is a critical first step to ensuring the Safe Drinking Water Act  prioritizes environmental justice.   I reserve the balance of my time.
