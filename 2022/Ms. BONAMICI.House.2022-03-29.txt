 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott for yielding, and  I thank him for his leadership on this and so many important issues in  the Education and Labor Committee.   I rise in strong support of the Securing a Strong Retirement Act of  2022 or SECURE 2.0, which makes important and bipartisan improvements  that will improve enrollment in and access to retirement savings plans.   As employers have shifted from pension plans to retirement plans such  as 401(k)'s, workers have increasingly become responsible for tracking,  managing, and consolidating their retirement accounts when they change  jobs.   There is no standard way for workers to consolidate their accounts,  and many workers actually lose track of their hard-earned investments.   According to a Government Accountability Office report, about 25  million people changed jobs between 2004 and 2014 and left one or more  retirement accounts behind. This problem is only expected to grow as  young workers transition between jobs at greater rates than previous  generations.   The SECURE Act 2.0 includes provisions from my Retirement Savings  Lost and Found Act which will help address the challenge of tracking  retirement savings. My bill creates a national lost-and-found registry  for retirement accounts housed at the Department of Labor.   The lost-and-found registry will provide workers with a centralized  way to track their retirement accounts, and it will also help workers  claim their hard-earned retirement funds regardless of how often they  transition from job to job.   I strongly support the commonsense improvements in the SECURE Act  2.0, including the creation of a retirement savings lost-and-found  registry which will help working families retire with dignity.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of passage of this  important legislation.
