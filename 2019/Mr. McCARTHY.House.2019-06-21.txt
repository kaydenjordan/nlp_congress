 Madam Speaker, last month, I proudly introduced  legislation, H.R. 2695, to name Success Dam, located in Tulare County,  California, after Mr. Richard L. Schafer, a longtime Tule River Water  Master. Last week, I was pleased to see this bill pass the House of  Representatives by unanimous consent.   For decades, Mr. Schafer has demonstrated unparalleled commitment to  ensuring our families, farms, and communities get the water they need  to live and work. A major part of this commitment includes this  yearlong persistence to enlarge Lake Success. Doing so, would increase  flood protection to communities and farmlands that are below the dam.  But as California knows, more water storage means more security for the  inevitable times of a drought that put a strain on our lives.  [[Page H5010]]    The good news for Tulare County is that, in 2018, the Army Corps of  Engineers fully funded work to raise the dam. I stand here today to  state with confidence that, without Mr. Schafer's leadership, this  project might not have been approved.   This is because no matter how contentious water issues can get--and  if you are in California, you know that can be quite contentious--Mr.  Schafer has always been the consummate professional, always remaining  even-keeled, results-focused. It is only appropriate and fitting that  Success Dam be named after Mr. Schafer.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues in this Chamber for  coming together and acknowledging the individuals who work hard and  make our communities better.   Most importantly, I want to thank Mr. Schafer for his continued  leadership and service to our community. This is a much-deserved honor.                            ____________________     Madam Chairwoman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 3055, which is  included in the en bloc amendment.   The intent behind my amendment is straightforward. It is to encourage  the VA to complete construction of medical clinics that the Congress  authorized 10 years ago in public law. Unfortunately, veterans in my  district have now patiently waited for the new community-based  outpatient clinic in Bakersfield to be built for more than a decade.   Of the 15 new clinics authorized in 2009, a decade ago, the  Bakersfield clinic is the only facility that has not been built or  opened. That means that thousands of veterans in California's 23rd  Congressional District must continue to depend on a very outdated  clinic. This is unacceptable.   In 2015, our constituents and I were informed that a new VA clinic  was set to be built, only for that to be derailed by the now-failed  California high-speed rail project, condemning the property the new  clinic was supposed to be built on.                                time  0930    This forced the VA to start all over again, further delaying building  our new clinic.   Now, last October there was this great excitement in the community. I  welcomed it. It was the long-awaited news that the VA announced that it  finally awarded the contract for a new 30,000-square-foot medical  clinic in Bakersfield on Knudsen Drive. This new clinic would be state  of the art, and it would be able to care for the rise in female  veterans and the homeless veterans out there as well. It was the  modernization that we have all been yearning for.   Unfortunately, something happened. The new clinic has been subject to  several, what I would call, dilatory actions. Most of them have been  resolved or dismissed, which only furthers the delay.   Now, you can protest. Here is a dirty little secret we should all  learn: You can have the lease on an outdated clinic, bid for the new  one and lose it, but then you can protest.   Do you get punished for protesting? No.   Do you know what happens? Our government rewards you. Because you go  beyond the lease, they now pay the outdated clinic more money than they  paid before, and, lo and behold, they are the ones protesting because  they didn't win the contract.   That is unacceptable. Our veterans have fought too hard to wait too  long to get this job done. So the VA must move forward and be  consistent with the application of law and regulation.   Let's build this clinic on Knudsen Drive that won the award, and  let's treat our veterans to a new, modern facility that works for those  who really are in need of care, from mental health to a new growth in  women veterans, to, even, veterans who are homeless. Let's show that we  will never forget the acts that they did for us and how they worked so  hard for all of us.
