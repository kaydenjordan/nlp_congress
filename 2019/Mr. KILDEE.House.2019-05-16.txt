 Mr. Speaker, this week, the Head Start program turns 54.  Since this life-changing education program was created in 1965, it has  served millions of children, giving them and their families a brighter  future.   Head Start and Early Head Start provides comprehensive early  childhood  [[Page H3853]]  education, health, nutrition, social services to low-income children  and their families. It is one of the most important investments that we  can make to make sure our children have the greatest opportunities to  succeed.   It is particularly important and crucial to my hometown of Flint,  Michigan, where early childhood education is the most important thing  we can do to help children mitigate the effects of lead exposure.   I am really proud of the school districts in Michigan who host this  incredible program and provide wraparound services to children and to  their parents.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the teachers, the workers, and the volunteers  who support our Head Start kids every day.   To keep Head Start working, we have to fully fund this program in  Congress. Support for Head Start is bipartisan. We need to continue  that. We need to make sure that we fully fund this program.   I celebrate the success of Head Start. We ought to make sure that  every child that seeks that sort of early childhood education has an  opportunity to have it.                            ____________________
