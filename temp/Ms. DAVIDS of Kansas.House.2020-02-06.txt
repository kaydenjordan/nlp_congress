 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share my support  of three important bills that were considered by the House on  Wednesday: H.R. 4044, the Protect and Restore America's Estuaries Act;  H.R. 4031, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act; and H.R. 2382,  the USPS Fairness Act.   Regrettably, I was unable to cast my votes for this legislation, but  had I been able to, I would have voted to pass all three.   I had the pleasure to support Mr. Malinowski's and Mr. Joyce's bills  in the full Transportation and Infrastructure Committee markup and  would have gladly voted for them on the House floor as well.   I am particularly disappointed to have missed the vote on the USPS  Fairness Act, offered by Chairman DeFazio, which I cosponsored.  Importantly, it would repeal the 2006 mandate that the U.S. Postal  Service prefund future retiree health benefits.   My mom has had a long civil service career at the U.S. Post Office,  and so the issue really hits home for me.   No other industry is so unfairly burdened with prefunding benefits in  this way, and this bill would help stem the financial losses faced by  the USPS. What is more, it would have no effect on the Federal budget.   This legislation is not the end of the discussion for how we protect  this vital industry and its workers; it is merely the beginning.                            ____________________
