 Mr. President, I join my colleagues here on the floor  tonight to honor and pay tribute to a remarkable legal mind, an  incredible American, an icon, an inspiration, and a wonderful human  being: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, known to the younger generation as  the ``Notorious RBG.''   RBG was born into a world in which few, if any, opportunities existed  for women beyond the role of wife and mother. She helped build a world  in which the doors were opened; the doors of opportunity were blown  wide. It was a powerful, powerful undertaking, and she was  extraordinarily successful in it.   She graduated from high school at 15. She went on to college. She  went on to law school. She graduated in a class of 500 students, and  she tied for first in her class in 1959. I was 3 years old at that  point.   Then she applied for jobs, and she faced the discrimination of ``You  are a woman, so we cannot hire you at our corporate law firm.''   Then she applied for clerkships with the Supreme Court, and the  Supreme Court Justices said: You are a woman, and our doors are closed  to you.   Perhaps this was a fortuitous moment because she went on, therefore,  to take on a job as professor at Columbia University and from that to  lead the Women's Rights Project at the ACLU. As director of the ACLU  Women's Rights Project, she argued six landmark gender discrimination  cases before the Court. Plain language, great heart, brilliant logic,  and considerable legal tactics went into winning five of those six  cases--an incredible record for anyone who has appeared before the  Court.   One of the tactics she undertook was to argue cases where men were  being discriminated against because they were men, and by winning those  cases, she established a principle where neither men nor women could be  discriminated against.   There is the Frontiero v. Richardson case in 1973, where a female Air  Force lieutenant sued to get the benefits for her husband that a male  member of the military would normally get for his wife. By winning that  case, she opened the door to the concept, the principle, that gender  discrimination is not acceptable under our Constitution.   She put forward and argued the case of Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld in  1975 just 2 years later, again, arguing for a man who, as a spouse, was  denied Social Security benefits that were available to a woman as a  spouse and, by winning that case, more deeply established the premise  that under our Constitution, you cannot discriminate on gender.   She went on to the Court and had many momentous decisions that she  wrote and dissents that she wrote. One of the cases that she wrote the  majority opinion on was an 7-to-1 case to overturn Virginia Military  Institute's men-only policy, arguing that it violated the 14th  Amendment's equal protection clause.   She wrote the following: ``Women seeking and fit for a VMI quality  education cannot be offered anything less, under the State's obligation  to afford them genuinely equal protection.''   She continued: ``Generalizations about `the way women are,' estimates  of what is appropriate for most women, no longer justify denying  opportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the  average description.'' And a law that ``denies to women, simply because  they are women, full citizenship stature--equal opportunity to aspire,  achieve, participate in and contribute to society,'' violates the equal  protection clause. Eight to one, that is a massive victory.   I thought it was very interesting, the point she often made in her  dissent. The Supreme Court decided in the 2007 case of Ledbetter v.  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.--the majority said: Do you know what? If you  have been discriminated against in pay in your job, and you learn about  it years later, you can no longer appeal for redress because you would  had to have come to the Court at the moment the discrimination first  occurred. Of course, that was a catch-22, an impossible situation. If  you didn't know about it, you couldn't possibly come to the Court. She  addressed this, and she said: The majority does not ``comprehend, or is  indifferent to, the insidious way in which women can be victims of paid  discrimination.'' So she called on Congress to act to address, really,  this mistaken opinion of the Court. And we did so in 2009, the first  year I came to the Senate.   There is another dissent that I think was powerful: Shelby County v.  Holder.  [[Page S5762]]  The majority struck down Voting Rights Act protections against voter  suppression and intimidation, arguing that those things no longer  exist. It is as if you have a penalty for robbery that is so effective  that everyone quits robbing, so you get rid of the law; the Supreme  Court strikes down the law that says that robbery is an offense. It  made no logical sense. However, in her dissent, she described it in a  way we can all understand. She said the ruling was ``like throwing away  your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.''   The foundation she laid on gender discrimination created the  foundation for similar arguments to end LGBTQ discrimination. They came  to play in Romer v. Evans, where the Court overturned laws around the  country that criminalized gay sex, or Obergefell v. Hodges, the case  that established marriage equality, or the case of Bostock v. Clayton  County, decided this year, that banned employment discrimination  against LGBTQ workers. So her arguments reverberate in continuous ways.   Losing her is a very powerful and difficult moment because of her  championship of opportunity in this country. So on Sunday night, I went  down to the Supreme Court. I had thought about it on Friday night when  word passed of her dying. On Friday night, I thought: It is going to be  a scene of confrontation, of people with bull horns yelling at each  other and confronting each other. That doesn't fit how I want to honor  her. And I thought on Sunday night: I need to go and be at the Supreme  Court. I was so relieved to find that there was not a scene of  confrontation; there was a scene of hundreds of people coming to honor  her championship of opportunity in our country, the role that she  played for so many so often as an advocate and as a Justice.   This is a piece of what it looked like, although you have to kind of  multiply the flowers and everything you see over a huge expanse. This  is just a small portion of it.   I was very struck by watching people kneel down to write with chalk-- women, men, boys, and girls--to say what she meant to them, what she  meant to this country, and what she meant to striking open the doors of  opportunity.   Then I started reading some of the things that were being written.  This is one of them. This says: ``We can because she did. Thank you,  RBG.''   In another written sign, there was a quote:         ``I ask no favors for my sex. . . . All I ask of my       brethren is that they will take their feet off our necks.''       Give us opportunity.    This is actually Ruth Bader Ginsburg quoting Sarah Grimke of South  Carolina, born in 1792. Sarah became the country's first female  abolitionist and early pioneer of the women's movement. When Ruth Bader  Ginsburg quoted her in the ``Notorious RBG'' documentary, it made this  quote famous for a generation.   I was struck by this sign, which I thought basically summed up her  entire efforts on women's rights. It is a quote of hers that says:  ``Women belong in all places decisions are being made.'' You can see at  the end the massive number of flowers and signs people have left in  front of the Supreme Court.   Then I saw this, which summed up a young woman's commentary on that  principle:         I grew up never knowing there was a glass ceiling because       of you. Thank you, RBG.   So we mourn her loss. She was a champion for opportunity for all. She  was a champion for so much that goes to making this world a better  place for ordinary people--ordinary people--which brings us to the  challenge we have before the Court because realize that the Supreme  Court has become a very powerful, nine-member, appointed-for-life  superlegislature.   It is not calling balls and strikes any longer--no. It is a setting  for a pitch battle between the original vision of our country--``we the  people'' government or, as Lincoln said, government of, by, and for the  people--and a different vision for our country; a Federalist Society  vision for our country; a vision of, we the powerful minority want to  control the government for our own benefit. That is the battle that is  being waged on the Court. Is it government by and for the people or  government by and for the powerful?   This has been a battle that has been waged since our 1787  Constitution. In 1781, we had our first Constitution, the Articles of  Confederation, and the minority view of the White, wealthy, powerful  South was protected by a requirement for a supermajority in that first  Constitution, the Articles of Confederation.   The Founders said: This isn't government by and for the people. This  is not government by and for the people--no. The majority will is the  power of government by and for the people.   So that was embodied in the Constitution we have now, that vision of  ``we the people.''   That minority from the South, wanting to protect slavery, said: We  need strategies to prevent the majority from eliminating slavery, and  we have to make sure that there are no civil rights granted to  individuals of color in our Nation who might undermine our complete  control of the governments at the State level.   That minority said: We are very wealthy, and we don't want any laws  that undermine our wealth, so we need a strategy to control and prevent  the people from getting fair wages and fair working conditions because  that means we make less money ourselves.   So they pursued a strategy called nullification, a strategy that said  no Federal law will have any impact on our State unless we endorse it  at the State level.   Eventually that fell before the Court, so then they pursued the  development of the supermajority blockade of decisions being made in  this very Chamber, on behalf of racism. The supermajority was forged in  the fires of racism. For 87 years, no law was blocked by this Chamber,  by the supermajority, except civil rights.   Then this battle expanded. It expanded to issues of corporate power  versus consumer rights, corporate power versus working conditions. This  is where we come to the current battle between the Federalist Society  weighing in on behalf of government by and for the powerful versus  those who believe in the vision of our Constitution of government by  and for the people.   So we have lost Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who honored our constitutional  vision, and we have a President and a majority in this Chamber who are  intent in packing the Court on behalf of the wealthy and powerful.   There is at this moment just tremendous damage being done to the  integrity of this body because the same party in the majority 4 years  ago said: We have a principle--the McConnell rule--that if a seat  becomes vacant during an election year, we must listen to the people  and let them decide whether the current President or a different  President decides. Will it be the Republican nominee or the Democratic  nominee?   They took that vote, and they went with it. Many spoke out in favor  of it, of the principle. Many said: This is the absolute right thing to  do--even though it was the first time in U.S. history that this body  did not debate the nomination or vote on the nomination, breaking the  protocol of our entire history in order to steal a Supreme Court seat  from President Obama and pass it on to the next President   So here we are, 4 years later, much deeper into an election year. In  fact, the election has already started, with many absentee ballots  having been delivered, having been voted, having been returned. So any  form of integrity would be to honor the McConnell rule from 4 years ago  and say: What we did 4 years ago was principled. We said we believed in  it. It helped out the Republicans enormously, but, you know what, we  are principled individuals, and so we are going to stick with the same  frame that we argued before the public 4 years earlier.   So I ask my colleagues, are there not a whole number of you who will  come together--together--and say: Yes, we have integrity with the  decision we made 4 years ago, the McConnell rule we argued 4 years ago,  the rule that gave a Supreme Court seat to President Trump and took it  away from President Obama, for the first time stealing a Supreme Court  seat in our history? But we are going to honor that same principle  today.   I ask my colleagues, search your hearts. I ask, do you want to be  remembered in this role of so fiercely advocating a principle that  benefited you  [[Page S5763]]  then and so fiercely violating it now, to your own benefit once again,  doing so much damage to the integrity of this Chamber and so much  damage to the vision and principle of government of, by, and for the  people?   Let that not be the case. Let every Member come here to the floor and  together actually hold a debate.   We see no Members on the floor today--Republican colleagues. Having-- many of them--stated that they are quite ready to violate the principle  they argued so strongly 4 years ago, we don't know where they went.  They are gone. They are not here.   So let the American people call attention because the American people  love our Constitution. The American people love ``we the people.'' The  American people love the principle of government of, by, and for the  people and do not want to see it trampled in an effort to sustain a  massive amount of corporate power against the consumer, wealthy power  against the worker, and racist power against civil rights.
