 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the life of Charles  ``Red'' Farmer. Mr. Farmer was born on October 15, 1932, in Nashville,  Tennessee. He began racing cars in the 1940s and is still competing  today at the age of 90, having recently raced on the dirt track at  Talladega Short Track in Alabama.   Following military service in Korea, and having obtained his NASCAR  license, Red competed in his first Daytona Beach race in 1953 and went  on to  [[Page H9708]]  compete in the Daytona 500 a total of eight times. In 1962, he moved to  Hueytown, Alabama, and became a core member of the famous ``Alabama  Gang''.   Red won a total of four NASCAR championships, winning the modified  division championship in 1956 and proceeding to collect three  consecutive championships in NASCAR's Late Model Sportsman division  from 1969 to 1971, including the 1971 Permatex 300 at Daytona. He has  won so many times on various tracks and across different divisions that  the exact number of wins is unknown, but it is in excess of 750.    In addition to driving, Red served as crew chief for NASCAR Hall of  Famer Davey Allison. Red is recognized as one of NASCAR's 50 greatest  drivers. He is in the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame and the NASCAR Hall  of Fame.   Red married his late wife, Joan, in 1950 and has three children:  Bonnie, Cindy, and Mike.   Red's passion for racing and his determination to never retire, but  to continue doing what he loves--even at the age of 90--is an  inspiration to all of us.                            ____________________
