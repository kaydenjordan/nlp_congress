 Mr. Speaker, I am here to congratulate the LSU Fighting  Tigers for winning the national championship last night, the fourth  national championship, a record-setting year, 15-0, 726 points. Joe  Burrow is the Heisman Trophy winner, a record-breaking quarterback with  60 touchdowns this year.   LSU alumni are especially proud of what they did last night in the  national championship.   I was honored to fly down with President Trump to attend the game.  The cheers and standing ovation he got in the Louisiana Superdome was  just phenomenal and well deserved, the fifth time the President has  been to Louisiana this past year, and rightly so. Our State leads with  seafood, oil and gas industry, forestry, and agriculture. You name it,  we have got it in Louisiana, and we are very, very proud.   This football team, our baseball team, and our other sports lead the  Nation and will continue to do so.   Please join me in congratulating the LSU Fighting Tigers football  team for winning the national championship last night.                            ____________________
