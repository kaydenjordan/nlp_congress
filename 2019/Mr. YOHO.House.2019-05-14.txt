 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues for being  here, and I want to start tonight out.   We are going to spend an hour highlighting what many of us on Capitol  Hill view as one of the largest threats in the 21st century, and that  is a China that has grown wealthy in building their military might.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin), my  good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs.  Hartzler).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Missouri for her  comments. Those are very well pointed-out facts that the American  people, if they knew this was going on, would stop buying ``made in  China.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs), my  good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Arizona, who pointed  [[Page H3777]]  out some great things. We are going to talk about the South China Sea,  or the East Sea, and what China has done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Pennsylvania, who  is a brigadier general, and he has been on the front lines, for those  remarks.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to continue on the rise of China  and why it is important.   I think we have heard some great ideas today and some great dialogue,  but this is something the American people need to pay attention to.  This is something that our legislators need to pay attention to. This  is something that we hear over and over again.   I have had the pleasure of being in Congress for 7 years, chairing  the Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation Subcommittee in the last  Congress, and I am the lead Republican in this Congress. The  information we hear over and over again doesn't get better. In fact,  what we find out is a more aggressive China that has raised all  pretenses of the past, and I will talk about that.   Before I go into this too much, I want to start with this: China has  an amazing history that spans thousands of years. Its culture has  stayed, for the most part, intact until the 19th century.                                time  2000    At one point, China and most of Eurasia was under the control of  Genghis Khan and the Mongolian Empire for over 100 years before the  Khan dynasty lost to the prevailing emperors in the 19th century. I  bring this up to counter China's nine dashed historical lines that they  are making claim in the South China Sea and now their claim that they  are now making near Arctic territory.   Later on in this dialogue, I want to talk about that because China  predicates everything by saying: ``Well, we historically have sailed in  the South China Sea; therefore, it is ours.'' Now China is saying they  are near the Arctic, so being near that, they want to claim that as  theirs when international law says it is not so.   In fact, the Philippines took China to court over the South China  Seas, and I will have some maps here that we will discuss later.   China went from a major economic power in the 18th century to a  nation addicted to opium and taken over by European colonial powers and  Japanese imperialism. During the 19th century, China's ruling class  allowed their country to be taken over by European colonial powers  while over 90 percent of their male population became addicted to  opium.   And I want to highlight that because we are going to talk about the  fentanyl and the opium that are coming into this country and what  country they are coming from.   The cultural heritage and social fabric of China decayed, and China  entered into a peasant state isolated from the world, for the most  part, during the next 70 years. This truly was a century of shame.   The PLA, the People's Liberation Army, emerged in the twenties, in  fact, in 1927. They will have a 100-year anniversary highlighting that  in 2027.   Mao Zedong was a favored member of the PLA. He later became the  Chairman of the Communist Party of China. He promised communism would  be the savior of China, but, unfortunately, for the 70 to 80 million  people who died under Mao's policy, for them, it was a disaster.   Mao did set a 100-year plan, though, for China to regain their  stature lost. Maoism became a belief for many, which seems bizarre,  knowing that history records millions of people's deaths were credited  to his policies.   Then, a foreign policy by President Nixon and then-Secretary of State  Henry Kissinger invited China into the modern 20th century. Many today  look back and realize that this was a massive misstep in foreign  policy. The hope was that China would become a responsible partner in  the modern world, but, unfortunately, China thrived at the expense of  the United States and many other nations with heavily lopsided, one-way  favored trade deals that favored China but nobody else. In the process,  China became very strong and very wealthy.   Maoism gave way to the era of Deng Xiaoping, who realized at the time  China could not compete with the U.S. or Japan in intellectual capacity  or in manufacturing, but he had the foresight to corner the market in  rare earth minerals. Deng Xiaoping's saying was: Bide your time and  hide your strength. Today, China has virtually cornered the rare earth  market that Deng Xiaoping spoke of in the 1980s.   In fact, the F-35s today, our highest tech fighters, the highest tech  in the world, have been copied by China via intellectual theft. And the  rare earth metals, the weight of an F-35 is approximately 10 percent.  This is approximately 4,000 pounds.   Now, get this. Ninety percent of these metals come directly from  China. The other 10 percent come from countries that get these metals  from China. So Deng Xiaoping fulfilled a promise he made.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr.  Fortenberry).    Exactly.    It is.    All right. You are singing a great song that I have shared  with the AmChams, I have shared with other countries, and it is our  philosophy of ABC. When you go to manufacture, it is anywhere but  China.    That is exactly right.    Exactly.   Can I get you to yield?    You are leading into where I was going.   In 1990, President Clinton recommended China's entry into the WTO on  a developing nation status. Yet today, they are the second largest  economy in the world--second to the U.S.--and they are still a  developing nation status. Yet they have a blue-water navy.    And they have a Moon program.    Why do we allow it?    Right. I don't buy into that either, and I am glad you  brought that up.    It is.    That is right.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman coming out.   I see this as a series of Special Orders on China, because the  American people need to know this. When they go to a  [[Page H3780]]  shelf and buy something that is cheap, and they look at that and it  says, ``made in China,'' they are feeding this trade imbalance. So they  are partly responsible for that.   As the gentleman well pointed out, if I fast forward to Xi Jinping,  to the current era right now, the estimate is that there is a $300- plus-billion--I heard it was $400 billion--trade imbalance, I can't  blame China for that. I blame our leaders since President Nixon.   For the last 40 or 50 years, somebody has dropped the ball or taken  their eye off the ball. If you allow a trade imbalance of $400-billion- plus, and then add to that the theft of intellectual properties that we  have heard up to $600 billion--I am sure you saw the DHS as they  brought in products made by our manufacturers that went to China that  are now coming from China, and it looks identical, yet, it is made by  China. So it is robbing that profit and the jobs from American  manufacturers that should go here, and it has to stop.   I commend the Trump administration for standing up to that. I think  the gentleman brought this out.    The reckoning is here.    Mr. Speaker, it is, and I hope the gentleman participates  in these. Because that day of reckoning is here, and if we don't do it  today, it is only going to get worse. So this is something that we have  to come together as Americans. It is not President Trump out there. It  is not some of the businesses that are bold enough to stand with him.   We, the American people, need to stand behind him, and I think the  gentleman brought this up that this is not a fight with the Chinese  people. It is the system that is running unfair trade balances.   Mr. Speaker, what I would like to bring up, going back to my notes  here is, we are in the era of Xi Jinping. I don't think our  disagreement is with the Chinese people, but it is with the policies of  Xi Jinping and the Chinese or the Communist Party of China.   The 2017 Congress of the Communist Party of China was held in October  of 2017. During that time, Xi Jinping kind of came out and was very  bold in his statements. He said: The era of China has arrived. No  longer will they be made to swallow their interests around the world.  It is time for China to take the world's stage.   The gentleman brought this up. There is plenty of room on the world's  stage if you want to be fair and balanced, and you want to play like  everybody else, but you have to honor international law. You have to  honor the rule of law, honoring contracts, honoring the beliefs that we  have to be a respected trading partner.   We penned an editorial that talked about Xi Jinping is leading--along  with the Communist Party which is 90 million members--is leading China  into a second century of shame, and it is because they are losing face.  They are losing honor that the Chinese culture, over millennials, built  up. They were respected. But they are getting ready to enter into the  second century of shame, and I would like for Mr. Fortenberry to  continue.    Yeah.    Right.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his time.   The gentleman brought up a good point about China. If you read about  the Chinese Communist Party, the role of the individual is to serve the  party. There is no higher entity in China other than Xi Jinping.  Whereas in our government, we are so blessed in this country because we  have a government that empowers their people. China suppresses their  people, and that is why I want to talk about this.   This comes from a 2012 House Intelligence Committee report where they  deemed Huawei and ZTE to be a U.S. national security threat. I have got  the results of that right here. So we want to talk about that.   Huawei and ZTE, from 2012 until today, they have been a national  security threat, but they have been able to do business in this  country. This is something we need to bring to an end.   Other speakers brought up how universities were falling prey to  China. We had our own university in Florida that Huawei came in and  offered to set up a cybersecurity program, and they were going to fund  it. And we said: No way. And so we got them to stop that.   If you just go to the headlines and you can hear how China is ramping  up in intellectual property theft. They are paid to do this. This is  something they want to go after, and they are doing it.   They rail against the United States on GMOs, yet, they go to Iowa and  steal corn seeds so that they can grow GMO and be in competition with  us.   The trade war with China and the problems with intellectual property  rights, this is something that goes on every day. And as we buy cheap  products made in China, this is benefiting them, not us. You can see  the headlines here.   What I want to do is move on to Hong Kong with Xi Jinping. Back when  Great Britain gave Hong Kong back to China in 1997, under the rulers of  China at that time, there was a 50-year agreement that Hong Kong would  be an autonomous, self-ruled nation. Twenty-two years into the program,  China has put their heavy foot down. China has disrupted the autonomous  rule of Hong Kong to the point where Xi Jinping had the nerve to say  this on the world stage; as far as he was concerned, that agreement was  null and void.   I want to bring that up because if we talk about if that agreement is  null and void with Hong Kong, if we go back to the agreement of Taiwan  under Nixon and Kissinger when they said that Taiwan is recognized as  one country, two systems, and autonomous rule, if China and Xi Jinping  can discount that agreement with Great Britain, does that give us the  right to discount one country, two systems?  [[Page H3781]]    Is it time to recognize Taiwan as an independent country, a thriving  democracy, our eleventh largest trading partner?   I want to bring up the South China Sea.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I will try to tighten this up.   Mr. Speaker, China, in the South China Sea, has started claiming  property that is not theirs. It goes off to nine historical lines that  come from antiquity, from 300 or 400 years ago. And they said: Well, we  used to sail here, so this is our property.    So they started building these islands, and they went off the coast  of the Philippines, and the Philippines took them to the Court of  Arbitration in The Hague, and China lost the lawsuit. China ignored the  ruling of The Hague, an international norm that we are all supposed to  follow. They ignored it, and here you have the Spratly Islands that  were little atolls sticking shallowly out of the water at low tide.   China has gone in there, and it is probably the biggest environmental  insult to this world, where they have dredged up over 4,000 acres of  land and they have built these land masses. I refuse to use the word  ``island'' because that gives credibility to China.   What they have done is built--illegally, against the environment,  against the ruling of international law--land masses in the East China  Sea.   President Xi Jinping had the gumption to come here to the United  States during President Obama's era in 2015, he went to the Rose Garden  and claimed: We will never militarize these islands.   Yet, today, there are runways on there that can accommodate military  planes. Our satellites show that there are military barracks, offensive  and defensive weapons, and radar systems. I think it is pretty well  militarized. They are doing that again and again and again. There are  four islands they have done now.   Their goal is to go to the next chain of islands which is closer to  our mainland. This is something the world has to stand up to. If not,  they are going to keep continuing to march forward.   This is a photo of when they started, and this is more of the  dredging. We don't have the one that shows them completed, but you can  find it on the internet.   Now we are at the China of today. China has perfected 5G technology.  China today has over 800 million CCTV cameras, closed-circuit  television cameras, and they have put a system in place where they  monitor their systems.                                time  2030    Today in China there are over 24 million citizens being monitored,  and they get issued by the Communist Party a good citizen score. But,  Mr. Speaker, you don't know what your score is. So when you show up to  travel, if your score is not high enough, then you get denied travel.  If you go to borrow money or use your banking system, you are denied  your banking system. Your kids can't go to the colleges you want them  to go to because you are denied because you are a bad citizen. They  have extended this and offered this to Russia; they have extended this  and offered it to Maduro in Venezuela; and Iran wants this technology.   What better way for a despotic or authoritarian or Communist regime  to control their citizens than the CC technology?   China uses technology to suppress their citizens to fall in line so  that they serve the Communist Party. Our government empowers our people  to reach their full potential.   I will close with this last thing, Mr. Speaker. China has interned  over 2 million Muslim Chinese ethnic people, the Uyghurs, in what they  call reeducation camps.   I want to show you this poster here, Mr. Speaker. This is a  reeducation camp. That means they just go there because they want to  learn new skills. This is what China is doing with the Uyghurs, the  Muslim population. Not only that but they have armed crematoriums that  are in place in these camps.   I've got to ask you, Mr. Speaker, when you have got a place that  looks look a prison, I don't believe it is there for education. We went  through World War II and the Holocaust. This Nation and all other  nations said: ``Never again.''   Mr. Speaker, it is happening right now in China. We need to pivot  away from China buying stuff, and we need to encourage our  manufacturers to go anywhere but China.   I don't want a conflict with China. Nobody does. But if we stand up  collectively together and we encourage manufacturers to go, then we can  get China's attention via their pocketbook and we can change the course  of the history of this world.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your patience, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
