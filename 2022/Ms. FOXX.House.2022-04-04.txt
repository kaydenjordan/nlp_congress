 Mr. Speaker, President Biden's recently submitted budget  for fiscal year 2023 is a literal dumpster fire.   His budget confirms what we have known all along: He does not have  the slightest clue what fiscal responsibility means.   Right now, families are facing a $3,500 yearly inflation tax, but  President Biden wants to spend a whopping $73 trillion over the next  decade, a 66 percent increase over the previous 10 years. Over the next  5 years, inflation rates would increase by 2.8 percent.   In fact, this scheme would be the highest sustained government  spending endeavor in American history.   Mr. Speaker, President Biden has failed to read the room yet again.  The American people do not want another Biden budget bust.                            ____________________
