 Madam Speaker, today feels like a little deja vu.   It feels like we are sitting back--was it February of last year?   America is on a brink. The world is warning the majority party if  they follow through with more of their spending they could create  inflation in America.   It wasn't just on our side of the aisle that warned you. No. The  former Secretary of the Treasury warned you that if you went through  with that $2 trillion that inflation would rise and America would be  harmed. But nobody listened on the other side.   They were proud. They were going to cheer. They were going to get  elected. They were going to win based upon this. They went ahead and  they passed that bill with one-party control in the House and in the  Senate, and the President signed it.   If you listened to Steve Rattner, a Democratic adviser to Obama, he  called it the original sin of inflation.   Listen to the American public.   Madam Speaker, I hope every single Member asks their constituents:  Could they give 1 month's salary up?       Could they afford to give a month's salary up?   I would love it, Madam Speaker, if the Members would come back and  tell me anyone who says ``yes'' to that.   But the sad part about it, Madam Speaker, is everybody in America who  is paid on a salary just lost more than 1 month because it was deja vu  all over again. It was exactly that vote that took more than 1 month's  salary from every American that is paid monthly.   We have got a President, Madam Speaker, who thinks that inflation is  zero. I guess that is why we are back to where we are again.   Today the people's House should be working to answer our country's  call to address the rising prices of gas, groceries, and just about  anything else that Americans buy. I haven't heard one debate on this  floor today about how we are going to lower the gasoline price. I am  not sure, but I guess, Madam Speaker, on the Democratic side they think  if they raise taxes then somehow that will make the price go down and  not up. They have been proven to be wrong.   Instead, Madam Speaker, moments from now we will take up this  misguided, tone-deaf bill. I believe it is the largest tone-deaf bill I  have ever seen in this Chamber in 232 years.   Democrats more than any other majority in history are addicted to  spending other people's money regardless of what we as a country can  afford.   Madam Speaker, I almost see glee in their eyes. I know there are not  a lot of them here because they can vote by proxy. It is the only  Chamber in the history of America that has ever allowed that--not even  on the Senate side, not even during war, and not even during plague,  but this body has, and this body continued it. They just extended it.  This bill wasn't debated here. It wasn't talked about. But a lot of  people are going to phone it in.   They started this Congress with trillions in wasteful spending that  caused runaway inflation.   Their answer was to blame everybody else.   Now, their answer is just to deny there is inflation and just say it  is zero. But today, now they are choosing to end the session by  spending half a trillion dollars more of your money, raising taxes on  the middle class, and giving hand-outs to their liberal allies.   Madam Speaker, unlike most of the Democrats, I have read this bill  past the title. The facts about this bill are just astonishing. It  sends $27 billion to a fraudulent national climate bank. Put that in  perspective: that is triple the size of the EPA's current annual  budget.   Madam Speaker, as I go across the country I look to the gas stations  and see people cry about how much it is costing them.   You chose to raise it higher but not to give relief to the American  public by lowering the gas price.   Along with that slush fund, it hands out tax credits like candy with  no accountability. But when it comes to natural gas, which heats our  homes and cooks our food, it raises taxes to fund their Socialist  scams.   Madam Speaker, your energy prices will now go through the roof.  [[Page H7691]]    Madam Speaker, I look forward to hearing how every Democrat who votes  for this bill--be it in person or how they phone it in by proxy-- explain it to their constituents this winter when they are making a  choice about whether they pay the energy to heat their homes or they  cut back on the gas to fill their tank or they no longer even buy the  food at the grocery store because it just comes too high, they have to  change.   Madam Speaker, as they continue to raise trillions after trillions,  when everybody warns them what they do is wrong, they don't care. They  just want to double down on the mistakes they have already made.   Don't expect drug prices to come down either. This bill would cut  treatments and hinder new cures by giving bureaucrats the power to  decide what drugs seniors can access. It reduces your options and  raises your costs.   That is okay because that is their philosophy. They know best. Just  like they knew best when they thought $2 trillion would help. They  called it the American Rescue Plan.   You now have time to see what you have done.   Explain to me in the American Rescue Plan when it raised inflation  and that took 1 month's salary from the American public, what did it  rescue?                                time  1545    Who did it help?   Answer me this question: Is America better off today than they were 2  years ago? Is the price of gasoline lower? It is?   The price of gasoline is lower today than it was 2 years ago? I guess  you believe inflation is zero, too. I am not quite sure about your  math.   Is grocery lower than it was 2 years ago? Are the car prices lower  than it was 2 years ago? Are your food prices?   I would love a natural debate right here. Why don't we have that?  Because the American people are having a challenge.   You know, one of the most successful businesses in America is  Walmart. When Walmart wants to look at where the economy is in America,  they don't go hire economists. You know what they do? They just check  the data of Americans and what they buy. And for those who answered  yes, you ought to study it, too.   You know what? They just look at four products. They look at  hamburger buns, hotdog buns, whole wheat, and white bread. And you know  what? If the hamburger buns sales go down and the hot dog buns sales go  down and the whole wheat sales go down, but the white bread sales go  up, you are in an economic crisis. You know why? Because people no  longer can make the decision to have hamburgers with hamburger buns.  They have to put the white bread there.   For all of you who said yes, why don't you get out of Washington for  a moment and go ask your constituents if they are better off today than  they were 2 years ago; because no, gas is not lower. Gas is higher. And  no, the car prices are higher, and their food prices are higher, and  they are going up each and every day.   I can't believe you would say yes. You probably believe the American  Rescue Plan was a good bill. You probably believe it is Putin's fault,  too.   Passing this bill today means more expensive bills for Americans  tomorrow, and everyone who says otherwise isn't telling the truth.   But of all the bad parts of this 700-page bill, the massive expansion  of the IRS is the most chilling.   Madam Speaker, I wonder if we could ask the same question and, oh,  boy, I imagine America will ask that in just roughly 87 more days. They  won't just ask it, they will answer the question, even if it is not  asked; if they are better off than they were 2 years ago.   But they will probably ask the question: Is America better off with  87,000 more IRS agents?   Currently, the IRS has almost 80,000 employees. So you are going to  smile; you are going to vote for it. A lot of you are going to mail it  in because you are just going to vote by proxy. You are going to pass a  bill you never debated by people voting by proxy.   You are going to double the size of the IRS. They have 80,000  employees. You know what the IRS also has? 4,600 guns, 5 million rounds  of ammunition. Why?   Democrats want to double its already massive size. You are going to  spend $80 billion of hard-earned American taxpayer money to hire an  army of 87,000 new IRS agents.   Why would you even propose that? Because you say, oh, it pays for the  bill.   Madam Speaker, I have got plenty of time.   I think I will. I appreciate the encouragement because I think  America needs the encouragement, because you know what? America  actually needs a plan that works.   Why, if you passed an American Rescue Plan that caused inflation that  we haven't seen in 41 years--why, if you went after the fossil fuel of  America that raised the price of gasoline that Americans haven't seen  before--why do you keep harming the American public? And you think  doing the exact same thing is your answer to save it?   But while this bill doubles the number of IRS personnel, it does not  expand due process protections for the American people. Worse, it  includes no income floor for who can be audited.   Some of the same people on the other side of the aisle, Madam  Speaker, who say we are better off than we were 2 years ago, that  somehow--I don't know where they get their gas, but they said their gas  price is lower. Let me know, because I need to fill my tank up.   So when you say that you are not going to go after every American to  audit, you are not being honest, just like you are not being honest  about what you did to cause the pain to this country. And you have no  plan to solve it. You simply double down to the exact same thing you  did before.   Based upon the past numbers, we know this would mean 710,000 new  audits for people who make under $75,000. So someone who makes under  $75,000, you think they need to pay for this. So what you are going to  do is not trust them.   Madam Speaker, you say you don't trust the American public, but you  are not going to hire all these people for the IRS so they could be  there to help people fill out their tax returns. No, these people are  going to audit them. We are going to double the size, and they are  going to go after you.   You see, there is a philosophy here, Madam Speaker. One side of this  aisle believes in the American people. One side thinks they know best.  Even when the gas prices have risen, you think it is lower.   I am sorry to tell you, Madam Speaker, the President even admitted  the gas price is higher, but he thought it was a good thing. It was a  good thing. Because you think everybody can go out and buy a new car.   Well, we are going to audit you because we need to go after you  because we think you are not fair, you are not honest, and we are going  to make you pay for something else. Just pay for the things we care  most about.   It costs individuals thousands of dollars in attorneys' fees and  compliance costs just to be audited by the IRS.   Imagine what you would do with an extra $10,000 a year. Imagine how  much better you could have used it than the Federal Government.   And somehow you think it is best. You think it is best.   That is how Democrats pay for their pet projects. Your pocketbook is  their plan to fund more inflationary spending.   This is just a train wreck just waiting to happen. And with this new  power, the IRS will snoop around in your bank account, in your Venmo,  your small business, and then the government will shake you down for  every last cent.   You know, in light of this week's events, let me ask: Do you really  trust this administration, the IRS, to be fair, to not abuse their  power?   I hope that I am wrong, but history doesn't lie.   Madam Speaker, as I travel the country, a lot of people know  different names of people who work at the IRS, Lois Lerner, and others.  And even when it comes to light, government is powerful, government is  big, government can take, as you have proven. You have taken so much  from the American public. But now you want to intimidate them.   I have watched Democrats weaponize the government before, and I don't  trust them now.   Madam Speaker, mark my words. Long after the headlines of this week  [[Page H7692]]  fade, we will look back on this very day and on this bill as the one  that broke the camel's back.   I am sure, Madam Speaker, as the months progress, there will be new  blame, there will be new problems. It will be those who own the gas  station. You will probably blame the small families that had to buy the  natural gas for their price going higher.   Somehow you will blame Putin again, and somehow you will tell the  American public, no, your price isn't higher; you are actually better  off, there is zero inflation, even though you take home less and  everything costs more.   Let me tell you about the future the Democrats want for America, the  future that we can expect if this bill passes, much like the one  before.   When wealthy Americans are getting tax breaks to buy luxury cars but  you can't afford to even fill up your tank, blame this bill, blame the  Democrats.   When store shelves are empty because more American manufacturers have  gone under, blame this bill, blame the Democrats.   When government agents are knocking at your door and threatening your  business, blame this bill, blame the Democrats.   And when your loved ones are left without the cures they need to  fight a rare disease, blame this bill, and blame the Democrats.   My friends, that is the exact choice for us today. Now, I know a few  Democrats showed up. And, hopefully, all those who are voting by proxy  are watching on TV, because they must be home sick, because that is  what they said. I hope they spent the time to read it.   I don't know if they read the American Rescue Plan, but they know the  damage they have done. America feels it each and every day.   Madam Speaker, I guess the next question would be--it will be  interesting to hear the answer from the other side. If you think gas is  cheaper than it was 2 years ago, if you think the prices at the grocery  store are lower than it was 2 years ago, do you think the border is  more secure than it was 2 years ago?   Someone said yes.   Madam Speaker, I am going to introduce a bill to rename this place  fantasyland. I hope when you go home, I hope you take the smirks off,  and I hope you actually read your obituaries because fentanyl has now  become the number one killer of Americans between the ages of 18 and  45. It is not something to smirk about.   I am sure you got power; you are in the majority. But you abuse the  power, Madam Speaker. When you abuse power like that, people die. Every  walk of life, we are seeing it day in and day out.   I remember the headline of six college kids down in Florida this  summer. They weren't in a fraternity. They weren't in a sorority. They  were in the military academy. Six of them OD'd. Four of them took the  drug; two did not. Two simply gave them mouth to mouth.   You think it is important to double the size of the IRS, but you are  not going to do one thing for the border?   I remember right after you took the power, you took over the House,  the Senate, and the White House, and you decided to change the  policies. We watched what has come across the border. I took a trip  down there.   I remember going, talking to the agents. They were telling me they  have never seen anything like this before. I said: What do you mean?   They said: We are catching people on the terrorist watch list. I  said: What? On the terrorist watch list? Really? I didn't know there  was that many people on the terrorist watch list just from the triangle  of Central America.   No, no, no, no, no. We are catching them from Yemen. People come from  160 different countries across this border now. They bring their  fentanyl from China.   I went and did a press conference, and I talked about that.   Madam Speaker, I thought people from both sides of the aisle would be  very concerned about hearing people on the terrorist watch list are  coming into America, knowing what has happened in this country before,  and we would want to keep it safe.   I was shocked. They didn't ask me for more information. They just  simply called me a liar.                                time  1600    We provided the proof. Nobody apologized. That is okay. You don't  need to apologize, but I wish you would do something about it. They  continued to stay silent. Then they fought to even get more  information.   But I fear to tell you that that is happening each and every day.  There is not one new piece of money in here to secure that any more.  That will stop as colleges open back up and as college students on the  weekend go to their Snapchat, think they are buying a Xanax, and they  don't wake up the next morning. But that is okay because you just gave  a break to one of your big donors who makes a lot of money and is going  to buy an electric car. It is okay because you feel good about what you  are going to do. I guess that is why you don't show up to vote; you  just vote by proxy.   A vote for this bill is a vote to help the well-connected get further  and further ahead while leaving needs of hard-working American families  behind. Yet, you could be forgiven for not understanding the gravity of  today's vote. For such a supposedly historic occasion, few Democrats  even bothered to show up.   Look around this Chamber, Madam Speaker. The floor is nearly empty.   If Democrats really, truthfully want to raise taxes on Americans  during a recession, that is their choice. That is the power they have.  They have proven it time and again, and they will do it.   The very least you can do, Madam Speaker, is show up in person if you  are going to vote ``yes.'' Show up in person to the American public.  For those who chant: ``Yes, gasoline is lower than it was 2 years ago;  yes, the border is safer than it was 2 years ago,'' don't say it when  the cameras are off. Don't say it when people can't see who is saying  it. Go to the mikes. If you believe it, go to the mikes and say it.   Better yet, tell your district about it because they know  differently. America knows differently.   But if you want to vote ``yes,'' you should have the courage and the  decency to show up and do that in person. Yet, Madam Speaker, Speaker  Pelosi extended proxy voting again on Wednesday, allowing Democrats to  hide their faces and vote to take your money from the comfort of their  summer vacations.   ``Absolute power corrupts absolutely,'' Madam Speaker. That is a  famous quote.   There are lots of lessons people learn. Normally, the lesson you  learn the most is when you cause the most pain. I guess creating  inflation you haven't had in 41 years, creating shortages where there  is no baby formula, gas prices that we haven't seen since Jimmy Carter  was in office, a border that is wide open, a government, Madam Speaker,  that had an Attorney General call parents terrorists because--what did  they do?   They went to a school board meeting.   Why would they go?   Why would parents go to a school board meeting?   Because they wanted to know what was happening in their kids'  education, the lost learning of the years of the pandemic.   If you question authority, you are going to be called a terrorist.   How far would we go to be able to have the rights to do that?   We are going to find an organization, a union, that will send us a  letter so we can do it. But when the public finds out why, the union  pulls their letter back. But the AG doesn't pull back their power  because they have power, they should use it.   Is that why you want to double the size of the IRS?   Is that why you want to double the size of the IRS, to go after  Americans, to use it?   Earlier today, we had 80 Democrats use a proxy vote. As we approach  this final vote on this bill, depending on how long I speak, I expect  that number might increase.   If you think about it, that is the story of this Democrat majority.  They will destroy our economy and mortgage your future but can't be  personally bothered to show up, to make the trip to D.C. to do their  jobs.   What a disgrace. What a disgrace.   I will promise the American public that that will all change. If you  run for  [[Page H7693]]  office, if you are going to ask them to lend their vote and to lend  their voice to go to Washington for 2 years to represent them, you are  going to show up.   And do you know what? The bills are going to be in committee. The  bills are going to be read. They are going to be debated on the floor,  and you are not going to hide in your vacation home and raise taxes on  the American public.   I will even go further. We will lower your gas prices. We will make  America energy independent. We won't punish natural gas. If you care  about the environment, American natural gas is 41 percent cleaner than  Russian natural gas. We will make an abundance of it.   So those people who are living on a $75,000 income who have watched  it get dwindled under your leadership, under your American Rescue Plan  that simply took a whole month's salary away from them, and where they  had no say, you celebrated it, you cheered it, and then you blamed  everybody else for what you created. We will tell you it will cost  less.   For the parent that wakes up that morning--maybe it is a phone call  or maybe their kid is home, who doesn't wake up because they went out  and purchased something that wasn't fentanyl but it was laced with  fentanyl, we will make sure that stops.   It is August. Right now is normally the time people have barbecues,  but now the price is high. Now people question whether to even get the  hotdog buns.   They are going to turn on the TV, they are going to watch an empty  Chamber, and they are going to read online that 80 Democrats took that  vacation and voted to raise more taxes, voted to spend more of their  money, and looked into the camera and smiled and said:         We know best. We want to take more of your money because we       have got to hire and double the size of the IRS because we       want them to knock on your door because we think you are not       honest and because we think you can pay more.        And if you don't, we have got an AG that will come after       you. If you go to that school board meeting, we will look in       your eyes, we will take your name down, and we will wonder       why you care about your kids' education.    Madam Speaker, that will end, too, because we are going to provide  the American public with a parents' bill of rights. We think that  parents should have a say in their kids' education. We think that  parents should know what is being taught at their children's schools.   Madam Speaker, I even watched, under this leadership, a Democrat who  voted by proxy who wasn't even in America.   So I wondered: Were they in another country to get healthcare? Were  they sick?   No, no, no. They were in France at a wedding when they phoned that  vote in. I wasn't quite sure.   Do you think at the wedding the Member was reading the bill on the  phone so that Member knew how to vote?   I am not sure it came through committee. I don't know how much debate  they had on this because the Senate did this bill. What a disgrace.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to reject this out-of-touch  bill, reject the crushing new taxes, reject the ballooning of  government, and reject the spending on things that we don't need with  money we don't have.   Madam Speaker, I can wait, if you need to continue.   But most of all, I urge my colleagues to remember this day. Remember  this day because it will be the last time the House will operate so  recklessly and irresponsibly.   A new day is coming with a new plan to put America back on the right  track. It will be a commitment to America that there will be fiscal  responsibility and there will be energy independence where your  gasoline price will be lower and plentiful, that your home heating  costs will lower and not rise; and that we won't pick one energy over  the other. It will be all of the above so America can be stronger. Your  border will be secure because fentanyl and terrorists will not be  coming across. This border is a national security issue.   We will focus on bringing the supply chain from China back to  America, which is not what this bill does. This bill takes American  taxpayer money and sends it to China. You triple the size of the EPA. I  imagine China is cheering, because they see their economy is going to  rise. Their government doesn't have to vote for a stimulus, because  that is exactly what you are doing here.   What is even greater, China will look and say: Well, can we make sure  America can send all that money here?   Don't worry, the Democrats doubled the size of the IRS. They will get  that money and make sure it comes.   In the commitment to America, we believe people show up to go to work  and that you earn your paycheck. You don't phone it in.   Madam Speaker, when I handed the gavel to Speaker Pelosi last year, I  said that a House distracted could not govern. Today, as this majority  jams through yet another partisan spending spree, it is clear to me  that an absent House cannot lead.   I trust the American people. I know it is the people who will render  the ultimate verdict on today's actions. When they do 87 days from now,  my Democratic colleagues will have only themselves to blame.   Madam Speaker, I am not sure what is happening on your side of the  aisle that Members actually believe gasoline is less than it was 2  years ago.   Madam Speaker, I am not sure what is happening on your side of the  aisle that your colleagues believe the border is more secure than it  was 2 years ago.   Madam Speaker, I am not sure what is happening on your side of the  aisle that your colleagues believe the price of groceries is less than  it was 2 years ago.   Madam Speaker, I am not sure what is happening on the other side of  the aisle that your colleagues believe doubling the size of the IRS is  a positive thing.                                time  1615    Yes, I come from a different party, and yes, I have a different  philosophy, but we are all Americans. Madam Speaker, you are going  inflict this pain on every single American.   Madam Speaker, I am not sure if your side of the aisle thinks this is  going to do anything to lower the price of inflation. I do know, Madam  Speaker, one person on the other side of the aisle in the other  Chamber, Bernie Sanders, spoke the truth and said it won't.   I know on your side of the aisle, Madam Speaker, not everybody  believes the same. The former Secretary of the Treasury warned you  before you did the American Rescue Plan that it would bring inflation,  and he was right. Even the current Secretary of the Treasury finally  apologized and said they were wrong.   The President said it was going to be transitory. He said it had  peaked. He said it was everybody else's fault, but now he says it is  zero.   Madam Speaker, I guess I do understand why your side of the aisle now  believes all that. I just know America doesn't. Because every day  America goes to the grocery store, the price has increased. Every week  when they fill up their gas tank, the price is higher. Every month when  they cash their check, it doesn't go as far.   Madam Speaker, if the border was really more secure than it was 2  years ago, why is the D.C. mayor now asking for the National Guard when  she wouldn't even ask for it when there were riots in the streets?   Madam Speaker, my colleagues on the other side can lie to me, but  they can't lie to America. Eighty-seven days from now it doesn't matter  how you try to answer those questions. The American people will.   I remember when we were at this stage once before. We had somebody in  the White House that put a sweater on and told us to turn the heater  down, that the best days were behind us as Americans.   I watched another person walk to the podium and say no pastels, fly  the bold colors, and go to that shining city on the hill.   We know what America is. And we are more than a country. We are an  idea, an idea so powerful that we can overcome all the pain that you  have caused.   It won't be easy. And I will offer this invitation. For all the bad  votes you have taken, when the change comes, we will welcome you to  correct the mistakes you have made. Because you will be in committee.  Maybe you will learn that gas prices are higher. Maybe you will learn  that groceries cost more. You will be here to vote so you will  [[Page H7694]]  hear the debate. Maybe I can't blame you for thinking that if you don't  have to show up.   Madam Speaker, there are a lot of days on this floor that change the  course of history. In the last 2 years, that history has not been  bright. Inflation, a 41-year-history high. Do you understand what that  does to the American public? Do you understand the pain that it causes?  Do you understand the choices that people have to make?   I heard the story of a young family, their daughter has cancer. For  her treatment they have to drive a long way. She was crying one day  because she heard her parents talking about making the decision to take  out loans they cannot afford to pay for the gasoline that your side of  the aisle thinks costs them less but costs them more, the choices they  had to make because you titled a bill ``American Rescue Plan'' that  only inflicts pain, and you just doubled down.   Madam Speaker, I would respect the other side of the aisle much  greater if they would at least do exactly what Secretary Yellen did,  apologize for your mistake and change course.   Don't double down. Don't make the same mistake three, four times like  you are going to do today. At the very least--at the very least, if you  are going to vote ``yes,'' do it in person. Do it in person. Read the  bill. Put it through committee.   Madam Speaker, I have watched this body take on big issues. We have  got some of the biggest issues before us today. You continue to make it  just a partisan action, one that even your side of the aisle has warned  you against. But somehow you want to celebrate it.   Madam Speaker, in my office in a conference room, I have this  painting of Washington crossing the Delaware. You all know the famous  painting. It sits 8 feet by 16 feet. If you study history, you will  know that it happened Christmas 1776. The artist who painted that  famous painting wasn't even American. He wasn't there. He had no iPhone  that day to take a photo. The person who painted the painting is a  German immigrant who lived in America but went back to Germany. His  name is Emanuel Leutze.   Do you know why he painted that painting? Because he understood  America was more than a country, that America was an idea. He wanted  Germany to have a revolution based upon the values of America, of  freedom, of individual rights, of a stand against tyranny, that  government would be of the people, by the people, for the people.   His talent was art, so he thought he would paint this painting to  inspire the Germans to have this revolution. Now, historians will tell  you he gets it incorrect. He puts 13 people in a rowboat. Why would he  pick the number 13? Thirteen colonies. But he only shows you 12 faces.   If you look at the painting, he puts Washington in a rowboat, but  historians will tell you Washington probably crossed in a Durham boat.  If you look at the Delaware, it kind of looks like the Rhine. But he is  German. We will give him a break for that. He puts Washington in a  ceremonial uniform with his hand on his chest standing up in a rowboat  crossing the Delaware in the middle of winter. He looks so stoic.   If you look at Washington in that painting, you would almost say you  would follow this man anywhere. You would think he had never lost a  battle or a fight. But for the students of history, they understand at  that moment in time, Washington had never won a battle. We had never  won one fight as a country. But that was our first victory, as we  surprised the Hessians.   But what I would like you to see next time is who is in the boat. The  second person is wearing a beret. He is Scottish. The person directly  across from him in the green jacket, he is African American. You come  down the boat, and in the middle of the boat, the person who almost  looks the strongest, rowing in the red, is a woman. In the very back,  the very last person, is a Native American.    I cannot tell you from a historical point of view if they were in the  boat that night. But to this young immigrant who had lived in America,  that is who he believed would be in the boat.   Now, the second to last person in the boat, he has a hand across his  face. It is the hand of the 13th person nobody sees. What this artist  was saying--Emanuel, I believe--Here we are, not a country but an idea,  having lost every battle before but willing to create a Nation. Why? To  go against the tyranny of a government that will tax you with no say, a  government that became so big it can inflict pain upon you, tell you  what to do, that we would risk it on our holiest of night.   Here is a hand. Would you get in and join us?   That is as true today as it was then. The challenge that we face  right now is you are making that government big. You are doubling the  size of the IRS. You are going against every single reason people were  in that boat willing to risk their lives for a government of the  people, by the people, for the people, a government that was created in  a country that was conceived in liberty and dedicated to the  proposition that we are all equal, because you think you know what is  best.   I can only imagine what those individuals would think today, that you  would put a bill on the floor that didn't go through committee. You put  a bill on the floor that would double the size of the IRS, that could  go after the American public, that has no set on an income, that  710,000 people under the income of $75,000 are now going to be audited  because you want them to pay for what you think is best, that you're  going to tax, with no limit on income, some family that already lost a  month's salary based upon your past actions because of inflation.   You are going to make them choose how cold. You are going back to  Jimmy Carter. You are simply telling the American public to put that  sweater on, turn that heater down. But to your elite donors, you are  going to give them the tax credit from those IRS agents so they can go  buy a new Tesla. That is what you are doing in this bill.   But 4 to 6 months from now, you will blame somebody else for it. The  good news is, there will be a new Congress with a new ability to change  all that, that will provide the American public a commitment to  America, a new plan to put this country back in the right direction.   Madam Speaker, with whatever happens today--and I can only guess, if  you have all the votes in your pocket that people don't have to show  up, one or two people can determine the outcome. But, Madam Speaker, I  implore upon you--I don't know what happens in your conference--please  allow the American public to come in to simply tell you and explain to  you that, no, gas is not lower, groceries do not cost less, and the  money does not go as far as it did before.   Maybe that is why I can only understand, if you truly believe that,  that you would vote ``yes.'' For everybody else that is living in the  real America, they will vote ``no.'' And 87 days from now, I believe  most of America will have the answer to that question, too, with a new  Congress and a new plan.
