 Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with  the junior Senator from Nevada, regarding sections 2861 and 2862 of  title XXVIII of the National Defense Authorization Act that was  recently considered by the Senate. These two sections of the bill  include complex, intertwined history of public lands, Nevada's cultures  and economy, Native American Tribes, and the Silver State's proud role  in hosting and training our men and women in uniform.    Mr. President, I thank the junior Senator from  Nevada for her partnership on these important questions. This year's  annual defense authorization bill is more than 1,000 pages long, but  sections 2861 and 2862 together take up less than one page. As the  Senator knows, while the legislative text seems quite simple,  significant and historical public policy questions underpin these two  sections of the bill.   Section 2861 provides for a 20-year extension of the public land  withdrawals specific to Fallon Range Training Complex which is utilized  by the U.S. Navy. Section 2862 provides for a similar 20-year extension  of the public land withdrawals specific to the Nevada Test and Training  Range, otherwise known as NTTR, which is utilized by the U.S. Air  Force. The reality of what this legislation means to our constituents  in Nevada, our Nation's public lands, and its potential impact for  current and future generations is far more complex. Given the  importance of the public lands, Native American Tribes, Nevada's  culture and economy, and our Nation's military, can the junior Senator  from Nevada provide more detail on that history with respect to NTTR?    Mr. President, I thank the junior Senator for her  question and would begin by noting that the mountains of southern  Nevada are sacred lands, where Native Americans carved their stories  onto its mountains and cliffs and left artifacts which detail how they  lived and thrived. The bighorn sheep which are central to this area are  sacred to Nevada's Native American Tribes, including the Moapa Band of  Paiutes, who are among the most acutely impacted by these public policy  questions raised by Senator Rosen. The creation story told by the Moapa  Band of Paiutes include references to bighorn sheep, and the Las Vegas  Paiutes also regard the Desert National Wildlife Refuge as culturally  significant. With the history of the Refuge properly established, can  my colleague, a former member of the House Armed Services Committee,  help provide history on NTTR?    Mr. President, I appreciate that question, because  the process by which we find ourselves considering this legislation  began on August 25, 2016, when the Air Force published a notice in the  Federal Register to notify the public that it would begin preparing a  legislative environmental impact statement related to the NTTR. This  process, pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act, kicked off  public, Native American, and government agency engagement on any  potential expansion of the NTTR.   The outreach and scoping process on the proposed update to the  legislative environmental impact statement was flawed from the  beginning. For instance, in a letter dated March 8, 2018, Nevada's  former Governor Brian Sandoval, a Republican, wrote to the Air Force  that ``during the preparation of the legislative environmental impact  statement, there was little interaction with our state agencies'' and  that ``better coordination with the Nevada Department of Wildlife would  have led to a more complete analysis and an opportunity to develop a  compromise alternative that would both enhance training opportunities  for the Air Force and continue to provide essential protections for  Nevada's wildlife and outdoor recreational experiences.''  Unfortunately, the process for incorporating concerns expressed with  the Air Force's plans for the NTTR have not improved over time. All  told, more than 30,000 comments were submitted to the Air Force during  their consideration of the legislative environmental impact statement,  but these concerns were largely ignored by the Air Force and left  unaddressed in the final documents released by the Air Force in October  2018.   The issue was considered by the 80th session of the Nevada  Legislature which, on a nearly unanimous basis, passed Assembly Joint  Resolution 2--AJR 2. AJR2 strongly urged Congress to ``reject any  proposal by the United States Air Force to expand its use of land or  exercise of jurisdiction within the Desert National Wildlife Refuge  beyond that which it currently possesses and to limit any proposal to  extend the Air Force's authority over the Nevada Test and Training  Range to not more than 20 years.'' The legislature further urged  Congress ``to work collaboratively with all interested parties to  develop a compromise alternative that would both enhance training  opportunities for the United States Air Force and continue to provide  essential protections for Nevada's wildlife and outdoor recreational  experiences for Nevadans and visitors.''   The inability for the legislative environmental impact statement to  yield a consensus, compromise proposal was a major factor in my  decision to begin developing my own legislation on this subject with my  colleagues in the Nevada congressional delegation. My goal was to find  a solution that would allow the Air Force to modernize its training  while also respecting and preserving one of the country's largest  wildlife refuges. This process included extensive discussions and  engagement with Nevada stakeholders including Tribal  communities, conservationists, sportsmen and hunters, private  landowners, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the United States  Air Force.    Among other items, our legislation, S. 3145, firmly establishes  public access to the Desert National Wildlife Refuge, provides that the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service maintain primary jurisdiction over the  entirety of the Refuge, preserves Fish and Wildlife Service  jurisdiction on Refuge lands east of the historic Alamo/Old Corn Creek  Road, creates several Wilderness areas, and establishes an interagency  committee for resolving management conflicts between the U.S. Air Force  and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. It also allows for the Air Force,  in consultation with the Department of the Interior, to place up to 15  threat emitters to maximize and enhance realistic pilot training,  provides a buffer zone west of the historic Alamo/Old Corn Creed Road,  and provides a modest expansion of the NTTR to facilitate increased  training activity on an additional 86,000 acres.    Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's  partnership on this matter and share the Senator's commitment to  ensuring an effective answer to the previously noted public policy  questions. While the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2021 that was approved by the Senate on July 23, 2020, does not address  the breadth of issues covered in our legislation, I hope it will  provide an impetus for continued engagement so that we can build  momentum within Congress, the Department of Defense, the Department of  the Interior, and in Nevada for our bill. I will, and I am sure I speak  for my colleagues in the Nevada delegation on this matter, commit to  work with any and all reasonable parties on this matter. I hope that we  can solve this matter with an eye towards its history in Nevada, our  commitment to Native American Tribes, our precious public lands, our  men and women in uniform, and our national security.   In addition, I would like to recognize Congressman Horsford and the  other members of the Nevada congressional delegation for their efforts  in the House to ensure that impacted Nevadan stakeholders will be  properly engaged and have a voice in the management and of the Federal  lands on which the Air Force operates in southern Nevada. His efforts  will help guarantee improved decision making and collaboration amongst  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Air Force as it  pertains to the joint use of the Nevada Test and Training Range and  Desert National Wildlife Refuge. I welcome his contributions in a final  product approved by the full Congress.   Would the junior Senator also care to comment on section 2861?    Mr. President, I thank the junior Senator for the  question. To begin, as before, it is important to understand the larger  history in this area of Nevada before one can reasonably understand the  magnitude of historical issues at play.   The military's history in Fallon dates back to 1942 when the Civil  Aviation Administration and Army Corps of Aviation began construction  of an airfield as part of the Western Defense Program. The Navy assumed  control in 1943, and the following year, Naval Auxiliary Air Station  Fallon was commissioned. In the early 1950s, additional training ranges  were established  [[Page S5862]]  under Public Land Order 898 which withdrew 56,011 acres of public land  for military use. In 1986--P.L. 99-606--and 1999--P.L. 106-65--Congress  enacted legislation on this general subject by withdrawing additional  public lands for military activities. The law passed in 1999 was  especially noteworthy. This law represented a major change to the local  customs, culture, and economy because it withdrew approximately 201,933  acres of land for military use for 20 years. The Fallon Range Training  Complex now encompasses more than 230,000 acres of public land because  of numerous map revisions and land surveys by the BLM since 1999. These  land withdrawals, which took effect on November 6, 2001, expire on  November 5, 2021, absent congressional reauthorization.   While this history is important, it is also important to understand  that the history in this area did not begin when the military became an  integral part of the community. One such example is the Walker River  Paiute Tribe, a federally recognized sovereign nation. One range, Bravo  19, of the larger Fallon Range Training Complex, is located directly  adjacent to WRPT reservation land and the Navy, as far back as 1942,  has conducted military testing and training on lands adjacent to the  WRPT reservation. The National Congress of American Indians--NCAI--go  into more detail on the close physical proximity between these entities  in Resolution No. ECWS-19004. The NCAI notes that the Walker River  Paiute reservation land is ``south and adjacent to Bravo 19, which is  one of the training areas for Naval Air Station (NAS) Fallon'' and that  the ``Navy has encumbered tribal land (est. 6,000 acres), which has  been contaminated with live ordinance, caused historical damage to  range wells and facilities and has left such land useless as this land  cannot be totally cleaned up of ordinance and bombs.''   The Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe has an equally important mark on the  history of this unique area in northern Nevada. As detailed by the  Inter-Tribal Council of Nevada in Resolution 06-ITCN-19, the Fallon  Paiute-Shoshone Tribe is federally recognized and have lived, hunted,  and prayed on their ancestral lands which encompass many significant  areas in this region of the Silver State. This has resulted in a range  of issues for the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe, including, but not  limited to, access to traditional lands, including spiritual and  cultural sites. These impacts are not trivial to the Fallon Paiute- Shoshone Tribe, but it should be noted that the current Chairman of the  Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe, Len George, published a piece in their  March 2020 Tribal newsletter expressing his support for reauthorization  of the existing withdrawn lands, but not for the expansion as proposed  by the Navy   The broader community in and around NAS Fallon also has a long  history with this military base. Churchill County and the city of  Fallon are the proud home of NAS Fallon, and both want to remain the  proud home of NAS Fallon. That being said, this military base and  training range is only one part of a larger community which each have  to work together to balance its activities on public land against a  range of other interrelated activities such as agriculture, clean  energy development, hunting, outdoor recreation, and mining.   Given these factors, it is easy to understand the amount of attention  the Department of Navy received in August of 2016 when it published its  notice in the Federal Register that it was initiating its process under  the National Environmental Policy Act to ``assess the potential  environmental consequences of maintaining and modernizing the Fallon  Range Training Complex (FRTC) in Nevada, which would include land range  expansion through additional land withdrawal and land acquisition,  airspace modifications, and public land withdrawal renewal.'' Scoping  meetings drew hundreds of attendees, and the Navy's Draft Environmental  Impact Statement resulted in the submission of nearly 1,500 unique  comments. Unfortunately, the robust scoping meetings and good-faith  efforts to work together ultimately has not fully resolved some of the  fundamental issues with the Navy's proposal. The shortcomings of this  process have been apparent and was captured in 2018 by our former and  our current Governor in letters sent to the Navy in December 2018 and  November 2019. Since then, the Navy has undertaken a serious effort to  understand local concerns through a series of ongoing discussions and  pledged commitments.   The National Environmental Policy Act process was subsequently  completed in March of 2020 with a signed Record of Decision from the  Navy. The Navy's ROD proposes an expansion that includes approximately  600,000 acres of public land and approximately 66,000 acres of private  land located primarily in Churchill County, but affecting a total of  five counties. When considering associated airspace modifications, the  Navy's proposal will affect over half of all Nevada counties. While  affected counties, Tribes, and State agencies worked with the Navy to  identify key assurances in the ROD, which reflected the Navy's serious  engagement, the ROD could not and did not alleviate all concerns.   Shortly before the Navy made their decision in March of 2020, Senator  Rosen, Congressman Horsford, and I wrote a letter to the Senate and  House Armed Services Committees where we noted that the lack of  consensus left us with ``no choice other than to initiate our own  process to gather input from as many of our constituents as possible.''   With regards to both sections of the National Defense Authorization  Act, we continue to seek that consensus, and I would note in particular  that Governor Sisolak and his administration have been helpful with  this effort, especially in working with affected counties and the  Nevada Association of Counties to bring State agencies, local  governments, and Tribes together. I would also like to acknowledge the  efforts of Churchill County which also worked with the State and the  aforementioned stakeholders to collaboratively compile a list of  outstanding concerns and suggested means of addressing those concerns  with the Navy's proposal. The combined efforts from stakeholders in our  State has been an invaluable resource.   In the meantime, I appreciate that this bill does not attempt to  force a solution upon the Silver State which has virtually no support  from my constituents. Rather, by authorizing new 20-year extensions of  the public land withdrawals, it removes uncertainty by reinforcing the  critical mission of the U.S. military in Nevada and its efforts to  modernize while enabling Federal, State, local, and Tribal stakeholders  to continue their dialogue to find the right way forward.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her  partnership.                            ____________________
