 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 60th  anniversary of the beginning of the Dockum Drugstore sit-in.   In 1958, 20-year-old Ron Walters and his cousin, Carol Parks-Hahn,  were inspired by a California campus restaurant sit-in, the Little Rock  Nine, and the Montgomery bus boycott. Bravely seeking to challenge the  status quo of segregation in Wichita, they planned a sit-in at a  downtown drugstore with a lunch counter for White customers only.   On July 19, 10 students walked into the Dockum Drugstore and sat  down. They were described as well dressed and polite, and sought only  to be served a soft drink at the counter.   For 3 weeks, the students entered the drugstore every day, boldly  sitting through cursing, questioning, and even threats. Finally, on  August 11, the store manager declared: ``Serve them. I'm losing too  much money.''   Following their success, similar efforts became a hallmark of the  civil rights movement. And today, on this 60th anniversary, their  actions continue to inspire.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful these young men and women took action to  end segregation in their community.                            ____________________
