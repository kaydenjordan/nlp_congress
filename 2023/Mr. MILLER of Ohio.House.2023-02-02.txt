 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Mississippi for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs has broad  jurisdiction over national security and foreign policy, peacekeeping  and peace enforcement, international law, and the promotion of  democracy, and many other critical issues that require its members to  be both objective and credible.   Members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs represent the United  States abroad and are regarded as credible emissaries of American  foreign policy. Their words have significant weight in guiding our  relations with other countries and are relied upon by world leaders,  most importantly, our allies such as Israel, the forever home of the  Jewish people.   But what happens when a committee member is no longer viewed as a  credible emissary of our foreign policy?   What if a Member is barred from visiting one of our allies because of  their prejudiced comments?   How can Members who are unable to engage with our allies in a  constructive manner be considered credible members of the committee?   Well, the gentlewoman's discriminatory comments disqualified her from  traveling to Israel in 2019. Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin  Netanyahu would not allow Representative Omar to enter, saying, ``We  respect all political parties in the United States equally; however, we  also respect ourselves. Whoever comes to impose boycotts on us and to  deny the legitimacy of the State of Israel, we will not allow them  entry.''   Yes, the gentlewoman disqualified herself from entry into one of the  most important countries allied with the United States.   Over the past 75 years, Israel has been a steadfast ally of the  United States. Israel has stood by us through the volatility in the  Middle East, and this alliance has been critical to our own national  security.   How can someone not welcomed by one of our most important allies  serve as an emissary of American foreign policy on the Foreign Affairs  Committee?   Given her biased comments against Israel and against the Jewish  people, how can she serve as an objective decisionmaker on the  committee?   Let's take a look at some of the gentlewoman's comments.   In February of 2019, barely more than a month after becoming a Member  of this body, Representative Omar suggested that the Jewish people and  the American Israel Public Affairs Committee were buying political  support, writing on Twitter, ``It's all about the Benjamins baby,''  clearly amplifying an anti-Semitic stereotype about the Jewish people  and money.   In response, Congressional Democratic leadership, her own party,  immediately released a statement by saying, ``Anti-Semitism must be  called out, confronted, and condemned whenever it is encountered,  without exception.''   Not long after Representative Omar trivialized the terrorist attacks  of September 11, 2001, by describing that day of infamy as ``some  people did something.'' That is horrific.   ``Some people did something.'' Yes, Mr. Speaker, some people did do  something. Some people committed evil acts of terrorism and killed  nearly 3,000 Americans, and, in response, some thousands of our fellow  citizens, myself included, enlisted in our Armed Forces to defend the  gentlewoman's right to make her prejudiced remarks. Many went off to  combat and even died to defend that right.   But they did not die fighting to have their bravery and love of  country undermined by a member of the House Foreign Affairs committee.   Mr. Speaker, I have no words to describe just how utterly  unacceptable these comments are. But that is not all.   In 2021, the gentlewoman referred to Israel, which has the absolute  right to defend itself against terrorism and attacks on its very  existence, as an ``apartheid state.''   She even equated the United States and Israel, countries that have  stood as beacons of democracy, to the Taliban and Hamas, organizations  that impose terror on their regions and the world.   Once again, even her Democrat colleagues swiftly condemned her  comment. Twelve Democrat Members of this body released a statement  which noted, ``Equating the United States and Israel to Hamas and the  Taliban is as offensive as it is misguided. Ignoring the differences  between democracies governed by the rule of law and contemptible  organizations that engage in terrorism at best discredits one's  intended argument and at worst reflects deep-seated prejudice.'' That  is from her own party.                                time  1115    Some have decried this effort as a political game. Mr. Speaker, I  assure you this is no political game. This resolution is not about  engaging in a tit for tat with my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle. This is about keeping someone with a long record of anti-Semitic  and anti-Israel bias off the Foreign Affairs Committee, which needs  objective emissaries for our foreign policy.   Even the Democrat former Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee, Eliot Engel, said that Representative Omar's anti-Semitic  comments have ``no place in the Foreign Affairs Committee or the House  of Representatives.''  [[Page H646]]    That was in addition to the previously mentioned joint statement from  12 of the gentlewoman's Democrat colleagues.   The facts are clear: Representative Omar has espoused anti-Semitic  and anti-Israel rhetoric time and time again. She cannot be an  objective contributor to the work of the committee, and she has brought  dishonor to the House of Representatives.   This body's committee, which is viewed by nations around the world as  speaking for Congress on matters of international importance and  national security, should not have a seat for a Member who would bring  such dishonor to that committee.   I encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this resolution to say with one voice that the United States  House of Representatives does not condone hate and to reaffirm that we  will always condemn anti-Semitism.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
