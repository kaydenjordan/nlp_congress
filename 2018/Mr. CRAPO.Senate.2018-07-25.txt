 Mr. President, today I wish to honor Jim Grant. Describing  him as a longtime, dedicated member of my staff does not adequately  reflect his committed service. As of last week, Jim has worked 35 years  in the U.S. Senate, in the offices of three Idaho Senators, through  numerous Congresses and countless technological, State, and national  changes.   The people of Idaho and our Nation have been far beyond well served  by this dedicated and thoughtful public servant. Jim came to my office  after working for two of my predecessors, Senator Steve Symms and  Senator Dirk Kempthorne. Both have, not surprisingly, praised Jim's  great work and dedication. I continue to feel blessed to benefit from  Jim's extensive experience and work ethic over the past more than 19  years.   As a Caldwell, ID, native, Jim has a deep understanding of the State,  and he has a profound sense of the pressing issues on the minds of many  constituents. Jim reads and processes constituent mail. He is  responsible for the timely response to the insight Idahoans have taken  the time to share with me, and he carries out this responsibility with  great care. This is an essential role in any congressional office, and  Jim's work reflects a clear understanding of the importance of his  work. He reliably ensures that their communications are wisely routed  and that Idahoans are responded to effectively and promptly. As means  of communication constantly change and speed up, this is no small  undertaking, but Jim has taken on these developments and increased  volumes with great proficiency.   Thank you, Jim. You have served our State and Nation admirably for a  remarkable 35 years. During this time, you have helped ensure that  Idaho voices are heard in this important legislative body and that what  we do here in these halls is effectively communicated into countless  households. This is such an important duty, and we have greatly  benefited from your careful, hard work all these years.   Congratulations on this extraordinary milestone in your Senate  service. I honor you, and thank you for your exceptional work.                            ____________________
