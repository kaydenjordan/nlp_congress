 Madam President, since President Biden took office, we  have seen historic job growth and a dynamic economy. Wages are rising,  and they are rising fastest for working-class Americans.   But despite this significant economic progress, today, too many  American families are still facing pressing economic challenges: a  global pandemic now entering its third year, ongoing disruptions to  international supply chains that result in rising prices, and now the  economic shocks caused by Putin's aggression, his invasion of Ukraine  and the response by the West--a united effort to impose sanctions on  Russia, which will also have consequences for the global economy.   The Federal Reserve exists, in part, to address issues just like  these. The Fed doesn't just set interest rates and control our money  supply; it oversees banks, ensures efficient and reliable payments,  promotes consumer protection and community development.   When our economy is facing such foundational challenges like the ones  we are up against right now, it is crucial our institutions are at full  strength.   The Fed is at its strongest with a full Board of Governors, and  President Biden has nominated five of the finest economic and legal  minds our country has to fill its vacancies: Jerome Powell, to serve as  chair; and Lael Brainard, to serve as Vice Chair--both folks who have  ably guided our economy in the years they have served at the Fed; Sarah  Bloom Raskin, whom I know from college, has been nominated to serve as  Vice Chair for Supervision and has demonstrated through a long career  in public service at both the State and Federal level to be a highly  competent regulator who has advanced the financial system that would  work for all Americans; Philip Jefferson, nominated to serve as a Board  Governor, has deep expertise in how monetary policy impacts employment  and economic growth and an important understanding of inequality and  poverty in America today; last, my good friend, Lisa Cook, whom I have  known for decades. We knew each other as young Truman Scholars, folks  who were volunteering a week of our time to help mentor and encourage  younger Truman Scholars--a federally funded memorial to President Harry  Truman.   I have known her since a stage in her life where neither one of us  might have guessed that someday I would be on this floor speaking as a  Senator, and I would be speaking in support of her nomination to the  Federal Reserve.   She would bring a valuable new perspective to the Fed Board. Lisa,  from her time growing up in a small rural town in Georgia, going on to  earn advanced degrees from our Nation's finest institutions, and now as  a teacher at one of our great public universities, she has built world- class expertise in economics, innovation, and banking. She understands  not just abstract economic theory but how those theories impact  Americans and their families in all walks of life.   Lisa served under President Obama at the White House Council of  Economic Advisers, where she dealt with financial crises both here in  the United States and abroad, and she has studied the macroeconomics of  foreign markets in Europe and in Africa, including the way central  banks have dealt with  [[Page S964]]  high inflation--one of the issues right before us.   She has expertise in an emerging area of the economy that is  increasingly important for our central bank regulators to understand:  digital currencies and financial technology. She has supported sensible  regulation of cryptocurrencies that enables innovation and allows more  people to access secure and low-cost financial services.   Her data-driven approach would help the Fed navigate our continued  economic recovery, and her focus on financial inclusion will be a  critical perspective on the Fed Board that would help ensure all  Americans can see the benefit of continued economic growth and job  gains.   Overall, these are five nominees to the Fed Board with sterling  credentials and strong character. All of them, on their merits, deserve  the seats to which they have been nominated.   I respect the desire on the part of my Republican colleagues to  conduct a full evaluation of these nominees, and all five of them have  responded repeatedly, fully, and with transparency to the hundreds of  questions that have been pressed to them. They have answered all the  questions put to them.   The time has come to advance and confirm these nominees, and I call  upon my Republican colleagues to allow a vote to proceed. To block a  vote in the Banking Committee of this Senate by simply denying a quorum  is no way for this allegedly greatest deliberative body in the world to  conduct itself. If we are, in fact, facing the crisis of inflation and  rising prices, the Federal Reserve Board must have its full membership.   So my colleagues, please, stop blocking these capable and qualified  nominees and allow them to proceed.                     Nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson    Madam President, I serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee. And in my  dozen years here, I have had the honor of participating in, and even  presiding over, confirmation hearings for Federal District Courts,  Circuit Courts, and the Supreme Court.   We have before us now President Biden's first nominee to our Nation's  highest Court. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is an exceptionally well- qualified jurist whose experience, whose credentials, and whose  evenhanded approach to the administration of justice make her an  outstanding nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court.   This is an important step forward toward making our Supreme Court  look more like and reflect more the diversity of people in our Nation  and the diversity of experience of those who serve in the bar.   Last year, Judge Jackson was confirmed by this Senate on a bipartisan  basis to serve on the DC Circuit Court, one of the most complex and  significant of the circuit courts of the United States. Before that,  she was unanimously confirmed to the U.S. District Court for the  District of Columbia where she has honorably served for 8 years. She  has issued over 500 opinions, so we have a very clear idea of her  approach to judging and her interpretation of the law; and she brings  great professional diversity of experience to the Bench as well.   If confirmed, she will be the only Supreme Court Justice to have  served as a Federal public defender. That kind of perspective on our  highest Court is critical. Her work as a public defender is just one  example of the breadth of experience Judge Jackson will bring to the  U.S. Supreme Court.   She has also served as Vice Chair and Commissioner on the Sentencing  Commission that interprets and applies criminal law and as a lawyer in  private legal practice for some of our Nation's leading law firms. And,  most importantly, she clerked for the Justice for whom she has been  nominated as the successor, Justice Stephen Breyer.   Our President has promised to nominate someone in the mold of Justice  Breyer; and Judge Jackson--in temperament, in ability, and approach-- certainly fits that bill. It is my hope, it is my expectation, that  this Senate and the Senate Judiciary Committee will meet this historic  moment by swiftly, appropriately, and respectfully questioning this  nominee in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, bringing her to a  vote on the committee, and then voting to confirm her nomination here  on the floor of the U.S. Senate.                        Executive Calendar Nominations    Madam President, if I might, the last topic I come to speak to on  this floor today is the critical need for us to be as attentive to the  advice and consent role for nominees as ambassadors, as senior members  of the State Department, and USAID positions.   There are so many positions that have been held for months and  months; and many of them are being held by my colleague from the State  of Texas because of a disagreement over sanctioning the Nord Stream 2  pipeline. Today, finally, we stand in a place where the policy of this  administration, the policy of our close and valued ally in Europe,  Germany, and the positions of folks in the Senate are all aligned.  There are now sanctions on Nord Stream 2. It has been stopped.   Thankfully, my colleague has lifted his holds. Yet there still remain  holds from other Members of this body on other nominees, all of them  well-qualified. Eight of them would serve under the jurisdiction of my  Foreign Relations Committee subcommittee on economic and energy policy  multilateral organizations.   So while I respect the right of my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to hold a nominee for a specific, relevant policy issue, we have  to provide advice and consent in a timely and respectful manner of the  President's nominees.   President Biden has been President more than a year now. We have  crises all over the world--whether it is in Ukraine, the violence and  the aggression carried out by Putin's Russia or its competition with  China or its dealing with North Korea or its advancing our interest  with respect to Iran and their proliferation--we have places all over  the world for which we need qualified nominees.   That is why, in a few moments, I hope to take action on the floor;  but I am not yet going to take that action unless it is clear we are  all prepared.   Let me briefly, in conclusion, if I might, speak to some of the folks  who should be confirmed.    The Ambassador to Botswana, Howard Van Vranken, career foreign  service officer in a country I have visited, a country that is an  important partner to allies in Southern Africa, and where the absence  of an ambassador means an absence of American leadership.   Eric Garcetti, mayor of Los Angeles, ready to serve as our Ambassador  to India, a country that is a continent-wide, multifaith, multilingual,  multiethnic democracy--a vital partner and ally to the United States  where we currently have no ambassador.   Marcia Bernicat to be Director General of the Foreign Service. If we  are to recruit, retain, motivate, and place the greatest diplomats  possible in the world, we need a Director General--a DG--who leads the  Foreign Service from a human resources perspective.   Julieta Noyes to be Assistant Secretary for Population, Refugees, and  Migration. A million refugees have fled the violence in Ukraine; and  yet PRM has no Senate-confirmed Assistant Secretary. Think about that  as a dereliction of duty by this body.   Oren Whyche-Shaw to be Ambassador to the African Development Bank. If  we want to see inclusive development on the continent of Africa, how  can we have no ambassador for this multilateral development bank?   Enoh Ebong to be Director of the United States Trade and Development  Agency, the USTDA. TDA plays a critical role in bringing into the  United States opportunities for trade and development--again, a  critical vacant seat.   Christopher Hill to serve as Ambassador to Serbia. There are  developments in the Balkans too complex and concerning for me to take  this body's time with right now. But let me simply say, any seat, any  ambassadorial post in the Balkans vacant is a missed opportunity for  American leadership.   Laura Holgate to be Ambassador to the Vienna Office of the United  Nations and Representative to the IAEA. We are engaged in critical  final-stage negotiations, I am told, in Vienna about whether or not we  will be able to further constrain and better understand Iran's  dangerous conduct with regards to enrichment. We have no ambassador to  the IAEA. Think about how irresponsible that is.   If I might, we cannot confront our global challenges alone, and we  need these diplomats in place so we can successfully address these  threats from  [[Page S965]]  Russia, climate change, COVID-19, from Iran, from terrorism.   It is my hope that my colleagues who have holds reportedly on many of  these nominees will relent, and I look forward to continuing to press  that case today.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
