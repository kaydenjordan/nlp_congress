 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the month of April as the Month of the Military Child.   I have always said that when someone joins the military, it is not  just a job; it is a family commitment to our country. This is  especially true for the more than 1.6 million children who have a  parent on Active Duty serving our Nation, including nearly 2,000 who  call Fairchild Air Force Base in eastern Washington home.   Over the next few weeks, I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring  the thousands of brave men and women who demonstrate their courage and  commitment to freedom, selflessly serving our country around the world.  Let us take this time to say thank you to those in uniform keeping us  safe and remind them that while they are taking care of us, we are  taking care of their children.   To all the children of Active-Duty servicemembers, we salute you. We  recognize your commitment to our country. We share in your struggles of  not seeing your mom and dad. We support you unconditionally. Just  like your parents, you are a hero in your own way, and in April, we  celebrate you.    Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the  incredible sacrifices of military children across the country and  invite my fellow Americans to help us honor them with unwavering  support and appreciation today and every day.                            ____________________
