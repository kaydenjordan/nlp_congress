 Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with the  senior Senator from California, Senator Feinstein, the Smithsonian  American Women's History Museum Act. This bill would establish an  American women's history museum in our Nation's capital.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S3862, June 29, 2017, in the first column, the following  appears: S. 1498. A bill to establish in the Smithsonian  Institution a comprehensive American women's history museum, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.  Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with the senior  Senator from California, . . .      The online Record has been corrected to read: S. 1498. A bill to  establish in the Smithsonian Institution a comprehensive American  women's history museum, and for other purposes; to the Committee  on Rules and Administration.  Mr. President, I am  pleased to introduce, along with the senior Senator from  California, . . .    ========================= END NOTE =========================     American women have made invaluable contributions to our Country in  diverse fields such as government, business, medicine, law, literature,  sports, entertainment, the arts, and the military. Telling the history  of American women matters, and a museum recognizing these achievements  and experiences is long overdue.   In 1999, a Presidential commission on commemorating women in American  history concluded that an ``appropriate celebration of women's history  in the next millennium should include the designation of a focal point  for women's history in our Nation's capital.'' In 2014, Congress took  an important step toward realizing this goal when it passed legislation  creating an independent, bipartisan Commission to study the potential  for establishing such a museum in Washington, DC. Following 18 months  of study, the bipartisan Commission unanimously concluded, ``America  needs and deserves a physical national museum dedicated to showcasing  the historical experiences and impact of women in the country.'' Mr.  President, I could not agree more.   The bill we are introducing today is the next step toward creating  this national museum. Incorporating the recommendations of the  bipartisan Commission, the bill would establish a national museum to  collect, study, and create programs incorporating and exhibiting a wide  spectrum of American women's experiences, contributions, and history.  Although the Smithsonian Institution would be the governing body, the  bill requires that the construction of the museum be financed entirely  with private funds.   Mr. President, nearly 100 years ago, American women won the right to  vote after a decades-long fight for suffrage. The story, leaders, and  lessons of women's suffrage are among the most powerful in our Nation's  history. As the centennial celebration of that historic moment nears, I  can think of few better ways to honor those women and that momentous  achievement than by passing this legislation. A museum dedicated to  women's history would help ensure that future generations understand  what we owe to those American women who have helped build, sustain, and  advance our society. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Menendez):   S. 1507. A bill to amend the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to  allow the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to  provide capitalization grants to States to establish revolving funds to  provide funding assistance to reduce flood risks, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.
