 Mr. Speaker, during Women's History  Month, we honor American women whose exemplary lives have shaped the  country we love.   In 1945, Private First-Class Elizabeth Johnson of Elkin, North  Carolina, answered the call to serve our country, becoming one of 855  women to form the 6888th battalion, the first and only all-female and  all-Black battalion in World War II.   They were given the task of delivering, in 1 year, a backlog of 1  year's worth of servicemembers' mail waiting to be delivered. But with  their strong dedication, in just 6 months, all letters were delivered  to servicemembers waiting to hear from loved ones.   After a tour of duty in England and France, Ms. Johnson became the  first woman to attend Winston-Salem State University on the GI Bill and  dedicated over 30 years to teaching in Virginia and North Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, I commend and thank Ms. Johnson for her legacy of  lifelong service to fellow Americans.                            ____________________
