 Mr. Speaker, as an opponent of the  failed Iran deal, I am grateful that President Donald Trump and his  administration remain focused on combating the dangerous conduct of  Iran.   Iran's aggression has only increased with the windfall of newly  accessible funds from the Iran deal. They have used the funding to  upgrade missile technology, force terrorism worldwide, and fuel  conflict around the Middle East.   Last week, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin announced that Iran had  developed an Iran-Russia network to send oil to Syria. This oil is then  used to fund murderous terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and  Hamas. Sigal Mandelker, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for  Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, explained: ``The Iranian regime  continues to prioritize spending money on fomenting terror over  supporting its own people.''   President Trump has made the correct decision to impose sanctions on  individuals related to this scheme, as he continues to fulfill  ``promises made, promises kept.''   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
