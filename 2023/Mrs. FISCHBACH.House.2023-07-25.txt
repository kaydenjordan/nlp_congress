 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Officer Jake  Wallin, a brave young veteran from Saint Michael, Minnesota.   On July 14, while responding to a crash in south Fargo, a gunman shot  [[Page H3907]]  and killed Jake and wounded two of his fellow officers and one  civilian.   Without hesitation, to protect those whom he served, Officer Jake  Wallin made the ultimate sacrifice.   My prayers go out to the Wallin family. Please know that the people  of western Minnesota share your loss and we pray for Jake's family and  for his law enforcement family.   Mr. Speaker, let us never take for granted the heroes who walk among  us.                            ____________________
