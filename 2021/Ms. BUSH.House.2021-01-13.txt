 Madam Speaker, St. Louis and I rise in support of the  Article of Impeachment against Donald J. Trump.   If we fail to remove a white supremacist President who incited a  white supremacist insurrection, it is communities like Missouri's First  District that suffer the most.   The 117th Congress must understand that we have a mandate to  legislate in defense of Black lives. The first step in that process is  to root out white supremacy, starting with impeaching the white  supremacist in chief.
