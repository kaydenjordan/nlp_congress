 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the desk  that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    Madam President, I suppose we were all shocked when  Customs and Border Protection announced that more than 103,000 people  illegally crossed our southern border in March. In April, we couldn't  believe it when that number jumped to more than 109,000, and now we are  in complete disbelief that in May more than 144,000  [[Page S3274]]  people illegally crossed our southern border.   I found it interesting that in comments by one of the Presidential  candidates running on the other side of the aisle, Bernie Sanders, who,  according to Axios, is running second to Joe Biden in the 2020  Democratic primary polls, called what is happening at the border now a  ``serious problem'' but not a crisis. When asked what more urgent  crises there may be, he said: Well, that is an issue we have to deal  with, but the issue of climate change is a more serious crisis.   He mentioned that, among other items.   Senator Sanders finds himself in disagreement, I suppose, with  President Barack Obama, who, in 2014, called what was happening at the  border, when the numbers were far lower, a humanitarian and security  crisis.   President Obama's Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security,  Jeh Johnson, disagrees with Senator Sanders. He said: ``There is a  crisis at the southern border that needs [the] urgent attention [of]  Congress.''   As it turns out, it is something that Congress itself is capable of  addressing but so far has refused any efforts to try to come up with a  compromise piece of language that would deal with this ongoing  humanitarian and security crisis.   Vice President Pence's Chief of Staff said: As opposed to bellyaching  about the actions the President is taking to actually secure the  border, it would be nice if they put as much energy into actually  fixing the problem legislatively.   I couldn't agree more with the Vice President's spokesman, or Chief  of Staff, in the remarks that he made.   In May of 2019, this was the third month in a row in which the number  of individuals who crossed the border illegally was in six figures, a  trend that we haven't seen since 2006, when the yearly total topped  more than 1 million. I wouldn't be surprised if we hit that annual  total again this year.   Since the beginning of October, Customs and Border Protection has  encountered more than 667,000 illegal border crossings, making this the  first time in a decade that we have exceeded half a million  apprehensions in a year. Don't forget, we still have 5 months to go.   The government's spokesman said last week: ``We are experiencing a  systemwide emergency that is severely impacting our workforce,  facilities, and resources.''   ``A systemwide emergency,'' he called it. This isn't a manufactured  crisis, as we heard a few months ago from some of our Democratic  friends and colleagues. This is not a political stunt. Our Democratic  colleagues continue to pretend that there is not a problem.   In the face of rapidly dwindling funds and resources to manage the  thousands of people in the custody of Customs and Border Protection,  our Democratic colleagues will not even provide additional funding to  help the officers and agents who are working day and night to safeguard  our border and to care for the migrants in their custody. I hope this  recent data will force our Democratic colleagues to recognize the  reality that this crisis is happening and it is growing.   Even the editorial board of the New York Times, never quick to agree  with President Trump or Republicans--they say it is time to do  something about it. In an editorial in today's paper, they said: ``When  Will Congress Get Serious About the Suffering at the Border?''   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record a New York Times editorial dated June 9, 2019, following my  remarks.   An excerpt from the editorial of the New York Times editorial board  said:         Unequipped to deal with the crush, border facilities and       migrant shelters are dangerously overcrowded, and the staff       is overburdened. Dysfunction, disease and even death are a       growing reality.        ``We are in a full-blown emergency, and I cannot say this       stronger: The system is broken,'' the Acting Commissioner of       Customs and Border Protection, John Sanders, said.    The editorial goes on to say:         In short, it is time for Congress to stop dithering and       pass emergency funding to deal with this nightmare.    When the President announced his intention to impose new tariffs on  Mexico, trying to bring them to the bargaining table to make sure that  it stood up its efforts to try to prevent this flow of humanity from  Central America, there were many people who questioned the use of that  negotiating tool. I, for one, was concerned that it would certainly  have unintended effects, but this is something the President would  never have had to do if Members of Congress on the other side of the  aisle would simply work with us to provide a legislative solution and,  certainly, if Democrats would work with Republicans to provide the  emergency funding that is so urgently needed for this humanitarian  crisis.   Thankfully, the President was successful in his negotiations with the  Mexican Government, and now we will see whether that 144,000 number in  May actually begins to come down. That will be the best evidence of  whether Mexico's agreement with U.S. negotiators actually is providing  concrete results.   It is time to put politics aside and start discussing real solutions.  We know there are no quick fixes when it comes to improving the  situation at the border. It is going to require a long-term commitment  by Congress and the administration, as well as our Mexican and Central  American counterparts. Part of that commitment involves making physical  improvements along the border and investing in infrastructure,  personnel, and technology. It is the three-pronged approach that  experts have repeatedly told me is needed to be successful, and it is  exactly what Congress ought to be all about providing. We can't just  put up a strong physical defense and call it a day. We need to devote a  great deal of time and effort to making improvements to reduce both the  push factors from these Central American countries and the pull  factors, which encourage these migrants to come to the United States in  these kinds of incredible numbers.   My friend and colleague Henry Cuellar, who happens to be a Democrat  in the House of Representatives, and I have introduced a bill called  the HUMANE Act, which would help us begin to reduce the pull factors  and improve the way we process people who seek asylum in the United  States. The HUMANE Act would close a major loophole, the Flores  settlement agreement, which is often abused and exploited by the human  smugglers. This well-intentioned agreement was made so unaccompanied  alien children could not be detained for more than 20 days, but a  flawed court ruling subsequent to that imposed the same 20-day time  limit on families traveling together.   Let me tell you, the people who are illegally entering our country  are not fools. They know our laws, and they know how to get around  them, as do the people getting rich by moving people from Central  America across Mexico into the United States--the human smugglers.   These criminal enterprises know that if individuals travel alone,  they will be detained and eventually returned to their home country,  especially if you are a single adult. But if you are traveling with a  child, the situation unfolds quite differently. After 20 days, they are  released from detention and told to return for a court date that is who  knows how many months or years in the future. Guess what. Many of them  disappear into the great American landscape and never show up for their  court date.   Of the more than 144,000 people who illegally crossed our southern  border last month, 69 percent were either unaccompanied children or  part of a family. We don't know if these are legitimate families or if  a child is traveling with a human smuggler or human trafficker. What we  do know is that children are often abused or sexually assaulted on the  way here, and many arrive at our border in critical health. It is our  responsibility to protect all of the children in our custody whether  they are alone, with a legitimate family member, or with a criminal.   The HUMANE Act would clarify that the 20-day limit would apply only  to those children. Family units would no longer receive the same  treatment, which would deter criminals, smugglers, and traffickers from  exploiting children as a free ticket into the United States. There  simply has to be some sort of deterrence, and the only deterrence in  this context is to detain these individuals until they can appear in  front of an immigration judge and make their claim for asylum.  [[Page S3275]]    The vast majority of claimants for asylum are not ultimately  successful, but if they are released into the great American  countryside, they never show up again for their court hearing and  essentially circumvent our laws and exploit those loopholes.   In addition, the HUMANE Act would provide protections for children,  such as DNA tests, to ensure that they are actually traveling with a  biological parent. It would prevent children from being released into  the custody of a sex offender or a human trafficker.   I know these seem like commonsense reforms, ones that could protect  vulnerable children and ensure that our laws are not abused and finally  begin to reinstate the integrity of our legal immigration system. But  that is not what is happening right now in the absence of congressional  action. There are additional commonsense measures in the HUMANE Act,  such as streamlining the processing of migrants, adding more Customs  and Border Protection personnel, and training for those who work with  these migrant children.   As I said earlier, it is important to note that this is the only bill  that has bipartisan support. It is not a sweeping reform that will  immediately fix every problem along our border, but it is an important  place to start.   I believe there is more we need to do here at home to stem the  crisis, but the truth is, we can't do it alone. We need to work with  Central American countries, where the vast majority of these migrants  are coming from, to help them build stronger and safer governments and  countries. We can't do it for them, but we can help. We also need  additional support from our southern neighbor, the country of Mexico.   I agree with President Trump that Mexico must do more to prevent the  mass migration of Central Americans traveling across their countries en  route to the United States. I commend the President, the  administration, and the Mexican Government for working together to come  up with a solution that will help stem the flow of migrants at our  southern border, as well as avoid the costly economic mistake of  additional tariffs. The fact is, we can achieve border security without  compromising our economic security. The two are not mutually exclusive.   Let me say that one more time. We can achieve border security without  compromising our economic security. The two are not mutually exclusive.   I am eager to continue our work in Congress to improve our  immigration system in a way that prioritizes both physical and economic  security. I hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will  join me and join us in that effort.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, June 9, 2019]     When Will Congress Get Serious About the Suffering at the Border?    It's time to cut the squabbling and pass an emergency relief package.                          (By the Editorial Board)         Last week, as American and Mexican officials haggled over       how to address the migrant crisis at their countries' shared       border, United States Customs and Border Protection released       its monthly migration statistics. They tell an alarming       story.        In May, 144,278 migrants were taken into custody. It was       the third consecutive month in which apprehensions topped       100,000 and the highest one-month total in 13 years.        Unequipped to deal with the crush, border facilities and       migrant shelters are dangerously overcrowded, and the staff       is overburdened. Dysfunction, disease and even death are a       growing reality.        ``We are in a full-blown emergency, and I cannot say this       stronger: The system is broken,'' the acting commissioner of       Customs and Border Protection, John Sanders, said.        Also last week, officials said that the Office of Refugee       Resettlement, the agency assigned to care for unaccompanied       migrant children, would begin cutting services ``not directly       necessary for the protection of life and safety.'' This       includes English classes, legal aid and recreational       programs.        Democrats and other administration critics called the move       ``cruel'' and ``illegal,'' but the financial reality is that       the agency is overwhelmed. So far this fiscal year, it has       taken charge of nearly 41,000 unaccompanied children--a 57       percent increase over last year. The entire program could run       out of funding by the end of June.        In short, it is time for Congress to stop dithering and       pass emergency funding to deal with this nightmare.        It has been more than a month since the administration sent       Congress a request for $4.5 billion in additional border       assistance. A large portion of the money, $3.3 billion, was       earmarked for humanitarian aid--which most lawmakers agree is       sorely needed. But a relatively modest piece of the request       aimed at shoring up border security operations, roughly a       quarter of the total, has tied negotiators in knots.        Early on, Democrats were opposed to funding additional       detention beds for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.       Republicans had problems with Democrats' demands for changes       in the administration's asylum policies. At one point,       negotiators thought they were close to resolving these       conflicts, only to have other issues snarl the process.       Beyond the money for security, one of the remaining       disagreements is how much data sharing will be allowed       between the agencies responsible for caring for migrant       children and those that handle border enforcement.        The broader problem is that many Democrats have come to       view the Trump administration as untrustworthy, and they are       loath to hand over one more penny for anything to do with       immigration. Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and       the Congressional Progressive Caucus have been particularly       adamant, insisting that their leadership take a hard line in       negotiations. In part, they fear that the administration,       despite its promises, will spend any additional funding on       enforcement rather than humanitarian needs.        There is much to despise about this administration's       immigration policies, which are exacerbating this crisis, but       there should be no ambivalence about the urgency of       addressing the humanitarian needs. While lawmakers wring       their hands and drag their feet, tens of thousands of migrant       children are suffering.        Congress needs to get serious about dealing with that       suffering.     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Bernadette  Roberts, a State Department fellow in Senator Collins' office, be  granted floor privileges through August 2, 2019.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Kevin  Deibler, a Defense fellow in Senator Rounds' office, be granted floor  privileges through December 13, 2019.
