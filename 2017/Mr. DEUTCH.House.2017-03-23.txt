 Mr. Speaker, the GOP health repeal bill rips coverage  from 24 million Americans.   So I ask my colleagues: Can you imagine what it is like to gasp for  air, your chest tightening and your lungs burning from asthma, worrying  that you might black out because you cannot get enough oxygen?   This week a constituent of mine from Fort Lauderdale told me: Thanks  to the Affordable Care Act, I am finally able to breathe.   The ACA dropped her asthma medicine costs from $600 per month to $10.  Without the ACA, she cannot afford to breathe.  [[Page H2353]]    Can you imagine your medication within reach but you can't afford to  use it? If you take your medicine when you need it, if you help  yourself breathe now, you can't afford it next month.   As you jog up the Capitol steps for this vote today, as you take for  granted every easy breath you take today, think about your constituents  who rely on their health care for their next breath and vote ``no.''                            ____________________
