 Mr. Speaker, our policemen and -women wake up every day and  do a job that is dangerous and often thankless. They are truly servants  of the public and protectors of those who cannot help themselves. If  that weren't enough, I wanted to speak briefly today to highlight  officers who have gone even further.   Mr. Speaker, the Iredell County Fraternal Order of Police recently  held a Cops and Kids event in Mooresville, North Carolina. Through  their generosity, more than two dozen families got around $100 worth of  toys, clothes, and gifts for their loved ones. The stories of struggle  for these families, brightened by a moment of generosity, are the  stories we see around the country this Christmas.   I am awed and humbled by the efforts of these officers. I want to  especially congratulate Tommy Chipman, president of the Iredell County  Fraternal Order of Police; Duck Wyatt, the second vice president; and  all those who participated to help make this Christmas a better one for  families in the community.                            ____________________
