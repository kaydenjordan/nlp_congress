 Madam Speaker, this week the House will consider the Fiscal  Year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act, otherwise known as the  NDAA.   The NDAA primarily authorizes the spending levels for our military  and the Department of Defense, but it also serves as the legislative  vehicle for how our military ought to operate.   That is why I was proud to submit numerous amendments to this year's  NDAA to ensure our military is focused on fighting our enemies and  deterring our adversaries and that Congress is well-informed of the  Department of Defense's goals and initiatives to ensure stringent  oversight and accountability and to push back on wokeness in the  military being advanced by President Biden.   One of my amendments would require that all Members of Congress  receive a briefing on the joint multiyear plan to fulfill defensive  requirements for Taiwan. The underlying bill only makes this briefing  available to appropriate congressional committees, but my amendment  would make this briefing available to all Members because I think it is  important that all of the people's Representatives are included in this  important process.    I also filed two additional amendments, one to require a briefing,  and the other to require a report on the People's Republic of China's  actions in Africa that pose a threat to U.S. national security and the  Defense Department's plan to counter such threats.   We can all agree that we must continue to do everything in our power  to assess the threat that China poses to our national security, which  includes its actions in Africa.   On that same note, I also proposed another amendment that would  prohibit the Department of Defense's Office of Strategic Capital from  investing or facilitating investments in Chinese-owned firms. As we  continue to counteract China's aggression, including their use of  stolen intellectual property and U.S. trade secrets, we must ensure  that U.S. taxpayer dollars are not being invested or facilitating  investments in Chinese-owned firms.   Lastly, I joined a number of my colleagues in cosponsoring a  bipartisan amendment that would establish the United States-Israel  Artificial Intelligence Center to leverage the experience, knowledge,  and expertise of our two countries to develop more robust research and  development cooperation in the field of artificial intelligence.   I believe that all of these amendments I mentioned today would  strengthen the NDAA and help provide for a stronger national defense. I  urge the Rules Committee to make all of my amendments in order.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, a little over a week ago, the Supreme Court of  the United States handed a victory over to the American people when it  struck down President Biden's obviously unconstitutional and egregious  student loan giveaway plan.   The High Court held that President Biden and his administration  needed Congress' authority on this matter before pursuing this costly  program for American taxpayers. Of course, Republicans in Congress,  like me, have been calling Mr. Biden's student loan plan  unconstitutional from its inception. Even some Democrats, including  former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have joined us in standing up for the  American people as their elected Representatives.   This is just one of many examples of how House Republicans are  demanding accountability of the Biden administration and doing  everything in our power to conduct proper oversight on the President's  out-of-touch, liberal, and sometimes unconstitutional agenda.                            ____________________
