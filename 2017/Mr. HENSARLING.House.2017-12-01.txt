 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 635, I call  up the bill (H.R. 1699) to amend the Truth in Lending Act to modify the  definitions of a mortgage originator and a high-cost mortgage, to amend  the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 to  modify the definition of a loan originator, and for other purposes, and  ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and submit  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 1699, the  Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act. It is an important bill  that is cosponsored by a bipartisan--I repeat, bipartisan--group of  members, and it was approved by the Financial Services Committee with a  strong bipartisan vote of 42-18.   In fact, this proposal has a long track record of bipartisan support  with a similar bill having passed the last Congress with votes from  both Republicans and Democrats.   I want to thank my colleague, Representative Barr, the chairman of  our Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee for his leadership in  introducing this legislation and for leading congressional efforts to  help Americans, particularly those of lower and moderate incomes, to  help them achieve a greater level of financial independence and being  able to achieve their American Dream of homeownership.   Here is the problem, Mr. Speaker. Under the CFPB's regulations, many  small-balance manufactured home loans are now being considered ``high  cost.'' This means that many people, particularly those with lower and  moderate incomes who want to buy a manufactured home, aren't able to  buy that home.   Their access to credit is being unfairly restricted through no fault  of their own. Lenders are leaving the market. Five County Credit Union  in  [[Page H9574]]  Maine, Zia Credit Union in New Mexico, Manhattan Bank in Montana, and  the list goes on and on and on. Lenders are leaving the market.   As we know, many consumers who live in rural areas, including those  in the Fifth District of Texas who I have the pleasure and honor of  representing, they just don't have access to rental options or other  affordable housing. So the CFPB rules are unfairly penalizing rural  residents and working families, many of whom happen to be retirees,  single moms, working families, veterans, and they simply want to buy a  manufactured home that they can live in. They are being denied that  opportunity.   So here in Washington, inside the very elite beltway bubble, there is  simply not an appreciation for manufactured housing and the role that  plays in our vital affordable housing component.   But let's listen to what the American people tell us outside of the  beltway. A 75-year-old retiree from Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, said  he purchased a manufactured home because ``it was affordable, and it  was in a desirable location.''   A 57-year-old single mom from Albuquerque, New Mexico, purchased a  manufactured home. She said: ``It provided the best value for the  money. There were no other housing options available. I searched for  over a year to find affordable housing. All of the site-built homes in  the area were over $100,000, which was out of my price range.''  Manufactured housing is within the price range of many working  Americans.   A 28-year-old single mom of two from Jenera, Ohio, she had been  renting. She wanted her own home. And when she purchased it, she said,  she ``found this, allowed us to own a home for less than we would have  to pay to rent another.''   Stories like this are commonplace all over America, Mr. Speaker. And  it is why it is so important that we recognize the rights of our fellow  citizens to give them the opportunity of affordable housing. You can't  protect consumers by protecting them out of their homes. Manufactured  housing is affordable housing.   So we have a regulation from an agency that is supposed to be  protecting consumers, but, instead, it is preventing families from  purchasing affordable housing. We must change that.   We have to pass this bipartisan bill, H.R. 1699. With just a few  minor clarifications to the definition of mortgage originator, loan  originator, and high-cost mortgage, this bill will ensure that  consumers of small-balance mortgage loans have access to the mortgage  credit they need. These minor technical clarifications will help  preserve consumer choice and financing options for those seeking to buy  a manufactured home.   Now, some on the other side of the aisle will say: Well, this  eviscerates important consumer protections. Well, number one, loans  under this bill will still be covered by the Truth in Lending Act, the  Fair Housing Act, the ability to repay rules, Equal Credit Opportunity  Act, and all of the consumer protection laws passed by the various  States.   So let's support working Americans. Let's support affordable housing.  Let's support Mr. Barr's H.R. 1699.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, before the morning is over, I hope to  have some additional time to yield to the ranking member so she can  continue her diatribe against President Obama's favorite billionaire  and Democrat financier, Warren Buffett.   Until then, Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), who is the sponsor of the legislation and the  chairman of the Financial Services Committee's Subcommittee on Monetary  Policy and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 20 seconds to the  gentleman from Kentucky.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New Mexico (Mr. Pearce), chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from New Mexico an  additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the vice chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  [[Page H9581]]  from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), the land of moose, maple syrup, and lobster,  a distinguished member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), a distinguished member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), another distinguished member of the House  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), a distinguished member of the Financial  Services Committee.  [[Page H9582]]         Mr. Speaker, regrettably, I don't have enough time  for the ranking member. On this side of the aisle, we are fully  subscribed. I have lots of Members who wish to speak in favor of this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Budd), yet another distinguished member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff), a member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman), a member of the Small  Business Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, what we have heard this morning, unfortunately, is an  assault on affordable housing from too many people on the other side of  the aisle. We have Washington elites who are deciding that low-income  people are too stupid to make decisions for themselves. We have too  many people on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, who want to  take them out of their affordable homes--manufactured homes--and are  saying: No, go rent, go find someplace on the street.   Here is the reality: when Washington elites at the Orwellian named  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau decided to make these manufactured  housing loans ``high cost,'' we saw a 22 percent drop in these type of  loans being made. But what we know is that this is vital for so many  working Americans.   I heard from one consumer in Windsor, New York:         I was falling behind on my own site-built mortgage       payments. I was drowning in debt. I needed a cheaper housing       alternative that would meet the needs of my family. The       manufactured home payment cut my overall housing expense by       57 percent.    Mr. Speaker, that is just one example. I have story after story from  consumers who this is their only option for affordable housing. But too  many of my friends on the other side of the aisle say: No, no, we can't  allow you to do that. You might pay a little higher interest rate.   Well, here is a news flash, Mr. Speaker: their monthly payment is  lower and they get to own their own home.   Washington elites have tried price controls before. They have been  tried since the dawn of man, and it always leads to shortages.   We don't want to shortchange working Americans for affordable  housing. We want to protect the vulnerable in society and we want to  allow them to have affordable housing. That is why it is so important  that today we pass H.R. 1699. Protect affordable housing, protect  freedom, and let's vote this in today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, this is a vaguely worded and unneeded  MTR.   We continue to hear from our friends from the other side of the aisle  that we don't have sufficient consumer protections in place, but I  wonder how denying a low-income family access to credit to buy an  affordable home is somehow construed as consumer protection. I wonder  how denying a low-income family the ability to own a home at a lower  cost with a lower monthly payment somehow can be construed as consumer  protection. I wonder how a policy that has led to a 22 percent drop in  the availability of manufactured housing credit can somehow be  construed as consumer protection.   Only in Washington could you have such an absurd result, but I have  good news for all Members of the House. After the passage of H.R. 1699,  guess what. Manufactured housing loans will still be subject to the  Equal Credit Opportunity Act. They will still be subject to the Fair  Housing Act. They will still be subject to the Fair Credit Reporting  Act. They will still be subject to the Truth in Lending Act. They will  still be subject to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. They will still  be subject to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. And the list,  Mr. Speaker, goes on and on and on.   What we have heard is an attempt again by Washington elites to take  away affordable housing. No one who votes against H.R. 1699 ought to be  able to look themselves in the mirror and claim they are an advocate  for affordable housing, not when they take it away, not when we have  seen a 22 percent decrease after the actions of the elites at the so- called Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It shouldn't be done.   It is time to reject this motion to recommit. It is time to stand for  low- and moderate-income Americans. It is time to stand for affordable  housing. It is time for us to vote for H.R. 1699.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
