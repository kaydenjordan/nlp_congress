 Madam Speaker, when it comes to the economy,  the Biden administration continues to insist that all is well. His  press secretary claims the economy is in a better place than it has  been historically.  [[Page H5745]]    Historically? Perhaps she needs to read a history book. Inflation is  at a 40-year high in this country. President Biden himself makes the  false claim that inflation is worse elsewhere in the world than here.   Mr. President, the United States has worse inflation than Germany,  France, Japan, Canada, India, Italy, Saudi Arabia, and the list goes  on. What is this explanation?   The Biden administration blames the pandemic and Putin, but each of  those countries has also had to deal with the same problems we have  dealt with. Why is their inflation not like ours?   Mr. President, the answer is easy: Quit overheating the economy with  government spending. Cut red tape and regulations hampering our  industries. Let the American people keep more of their hard-earned  money.   Conservatives once warned against our economy turning into Europe.  Unless we change course, Europe will be worried about becoming us.                            ____________________
