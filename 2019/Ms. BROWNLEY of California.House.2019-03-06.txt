 Mr. Speaker, my favorite three words in  our Constitution are the first three words, ``We the people.''   The will of the people is the basis of our entire democracy. But for  far too long, special interests and big money have rigged that system  against everyday Americans.   This week, we take a major step to change that. We are voting on H.R.  1, transformational legislation that will finally put the power back in  the hands of the American people, by toughening Federal ethics laws,  fixing the broken campaign finance system, and strengthening voting  rights, including two bills that I have worked on with my colleagues to  end partisan gerrymandering and requiring same-day voter registration.   I encourage everyone to support H.R. 1 this week, because it is long  past time we return our government to one that is of the people, by the  people, and for the people once again.                            ____________________
