 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a model American and  South Carolinian, and let me add, a very good friend of mine, Raymond  G. ``Jerry'' Strawbridge, who passed away Monday.   Jerry was chairman of the Saluda County Council, and epitomized what  it meant to be a public servant and a true patriot, as he did so much  to serve his church, his country, Saluda County, South Carolina's Third  District, the State of South Carolina, and our great Nation.   Jerry was a family man, a business owner, a veteran, chairman of  Saluda County Republican Party for 8 years, chairman of Saluda County  Water and Sewer Authority, a 32nd degree Mason, and very involved in  his lodge. He was also a sergeant major for the South Carolina National  Guard where he served for 40 years, and that is quite a feat.   His accolades include: National Defense Service Medal, Army Reserve  Component Achievement Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, the Army  Commendation Medal, NCO Professional Development Ribbon, Army Service  Ribbon, Armed Forces Reserve Medal, U.S. Meritorious Service Medal, and  the South Carolina Guardsman Retirement Medal.   My heart goes out to Jerry's wife, Denise, and his children and  grandchildren. I am praying for them as they mourn the loss of a truly  incredible person who served so well. He will surely be missed by his  community and his legacy will continue to have an impact on Saluda  County and South Carolina for many years to come.   Mr. Speaker, during these times we are comforted by Scripture and the  words of Jesus. ``Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be  comforted.''   May God bless the Strawbridge family, and may God continue to bless  the United States of America.
