 Mr. Speaker, thousands of unnecessary amputations are  conducted each and every year as a treatment for those who have  peripheral artery disease.   PAD patients suffer from poor blood circulation, which often results  in amputation, higher mortality rates, and the other complications that  come with it. It doesn't have to be this way.                                time  1015    Minnesota is the epicenter for groundbreaking innovation in new PAD  treatments. Dr. Osama Ibrahim of Minneapolis' North Memorial Hospital  is helping spread the word about revascularizations instead of  amputations. The University of Minnesota and the Mayo Clinic are also  at the forefront of these new procedures.   I am working now with Congressman  Donald Payne to raise PAD  awareness, increase screening for at-risk patients, and improve access  to care to different therapies so patients don't have to undergo  unnecessary amputations. This means better healthcare outcomes, as well  as a higher quality of life for thousands of Americans coping with PAD  every year.                     Support the American Innovation Act     Mr. Speaker, I speak in favor of H.R. 6756, the American  Innovation Act, which will spur innovation by helping startups survive  the first few years of their existence and access the capital they need  to grow and expand.   This bill also includes a key provision that I authored to help  entrepreneurs not only survive, but thrive. Entrepreneurs and startups  are a key source of innovation and job creation, particularly in  Minnesota.   But the tax code today puts them at a disadvantage. It makes it  harder for them to access new capital, and it disadvantages them as  they struggle through the hardest part of their existence, which is the  very first few years of profitability. This bill changes that. It  brings tax regulations for governing startups now into the 21st century  so that entrepreneurs and capital intensive sectors, like medical  devices, can make the necessary investments in research, development,  and manufacturing to grow and hire more people.   Ultimately, this means more jobs and more flexibility for Minnesota  entrepreneurs to not just come up with the next big idea, but to  actually make it a reality. I hope my colleagues will join me in  supporting this legislation.                        Support the Family Savings Act     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6757, the Family  Savings Act, which includes a provision that I authored that improves  529 college savings plans.   Now, we all know that 529 college savings plans are a popular saving  tool to help families save for college costs tax free. But today,  student loan payments are not a qualified expense. Withdrawing any  funds from the 529 for any other reason results in those funds being  taxed as ordinary income, as well as a 10 percent penalty.   That is why I authored legislation to solve and address this problem,  and it was included in the Family Savings Act. By expanding the list of  529 qualified expenses to also include student loan payments, this will  allow a 529 savings plan to be used to pay up to $10,000 in student  loans. It will certainly help make it easier now to pay off loans and  mitigate the anxiety that comes for a new graduate who is starting a  career.                            ____________________
