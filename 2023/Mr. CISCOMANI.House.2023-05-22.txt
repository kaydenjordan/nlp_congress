 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Bost for yielding me  time to talk about this important bill.   I am grateful that my bill, H.R. 1669, the VET-TEC Authorization Act,  is being considered today on the House floor. This bipartisan effort  would extend the invaluable program for our veterans, the Veteran  Employment Through Technology Education Courses, or VET-TEC program.   The VET-TEC pilot program allows eligible veterans to gain experience  and training in high-demand tech jobs. Since the start of the VET-TEC  program in 2019, introduced by Speaker McCarthy, over 12,000 veterans  have completed the program in areas like computer programming, software  development, data processing, and other in-demand careers. This is  crucial to strengthening our American workforce, while enabling our  vets to have a clear shot at the American Dream, a dream they have  fought to protect for so many of us.    Of the veterans that completed the program, roughly 62 percent were  offered a job related to the training they received, with an average  salary of around $65,000 a year. These results show that the program  works, and by extending the program, we will ensure veterans will be  able to participate in the program in the coming years. Not only has  this program been beneficial for our veterans, but it is crucial for  our employers, as well. We need a skilled workforce working in the tech  industry, and our veterans are the perfect fit.   I am proud to have partnered with Chairman Bost and Congressman  Khanna on this legislation, and I look forward to working with my  colleagues to ensure the men and women who served our country can  continue to grow in the civilian workforce, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill  today.
