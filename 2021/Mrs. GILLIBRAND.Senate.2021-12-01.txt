 Thank you. Thank you so much, Senator.   Madam President, I rise to join my colleagues in calling for the  Build Back Better bill to include provisions that will solve the  problems that working people are facing every day because of the  magnitude of the problems caused by the COVID pandemic.   Paid leave is a perfect example of this. Today, nearly 8 in 10  workers in America don't have access to paid leave. Those numbers are  even worse for lower wage workers, just 12 percent of whom had access  to paid leave before the pandemic.   But we know nearly every single worker will need paid leave at some  point in their lives, whether they are dealing with another pandemic or  a personal emergency.   We have to recognize that workers are people first, people who get  sick, have babies, adopt children, who need care for their children  when they get sick, who have parents who will age and die.   They work to provide for those families, but providing for your  family means, first and foremost, being able to care for that family  member when they need you. Without paid leave, most people can't. They  are forced to make the impossible choice of either providing for their  family by going to work or leaving their job to meet that need. And  nobody should have to make that choice between earning a living and  providing for an urgent family need.   We send new mothers back to work when they are literally still  bleeding, while they have stitches and they are still healing, before  they can even recognize that they have postpartum depression. We force  them to leave their infants when they are just days old. They can't  nurse their infant. They can't bring them to work with them. They can't  bond with them. They can't even put them in a childcare or a daycare  center because most require an infant to be at least 6 weeks old.   Right now, many women get less time with their babies than dogs get  before they are separated from their puppies. That is how we are  valuing women workers right now, less than we value dogs.    This issue extends far beyond new moms. New dads should also be able  to have time with their new children. Parents with sick children should  be able to care for them without fear of losing their job. And workers  who need to move a parent to a memory care facility or take them to  chemotherapy or take them to doctors' appointments or nurse them when  they are in very urgent care need--those are choices that families are  making every day, and in this era of COVID, it is happening far more  often. You shouldn't have to risk your job or professional future to  meet those urgent needs. Without paid leave, far too many workers have  to make that very choice and either risk losing their job or having to  quit or not meeting that family need. It is inhumane.   Not having a paid leave program also leaves us vulnerable to future  health crises. If we had paid leave in place before the pandemic,  millions of people could have stayed home from work when they got sick,  limiting the spread of COVID, or they could have stayed home with their  children when they were forced to learn remotely, limiting the number  of people who have lost or had to leave their jobs when a child had to  stay home.   I heard from one New Yorker named Amir whose son's health and special  needs were becoming significantly complex and required his or his  spouse's full time attention around the clock for weeks. At a time of  great stress, they were not only worrying about how they could best  care for their son but also how they could maintain their livelihoods.   Luckily, they were able to turn to New York State's paid leave  program. He told me it saved their family. They were able to focus on  being good parents without harming their ability to earn a living and  be good professionals.   Your ability to access that kind of support should not be dependent  on where you live, but right now just nine States and DC have enacted  paid leave legislation, leaving far too many Americans vulnerable. The  numbers prove that paid leave keeps people employed, providing  stability to their families and the companies they work for.   A study in the Journal of Population Economics found that women who  take paid leave are 40 percent more likely to return to work after  having a new child than those who don't take it. And, in general,  workers who can take paid leave return to their job up to 97 percent of  the time. That makes paid leave a good business investment. It helps  ensure that the time and money companies invest into an employee  doesn't walk out the door when the employee gets sick. Furthermore,  when paid leave was implemented in California, nine out of ten  employers said it either did not change or improved  [[Page S8854]]  their profitability, employee productivity, and morale, and many said  it decreased turnover.   Major corporations already know that offering paid leave helps them  attract and retain the best talent. By making this program universal,  we can level the playing field and allow small businesses to compete  with them and hire the best of the best. In fact, the same survey of  California employers found that small businesses were actually more  likely to report seeing no change or an improvement in their  productivity and profitability when paid leave was implemented. So it  is not surprising to see that 70 percent of small business owners and  operators support the creation of a national paid leave program--70  percent of small business owners.   State programs have also shown us that the programs are not targets  for fraud. In California, 91 percent of employers said that they were  unaware of any instances where their employees abused the State leave  program. And in a study of New Jersey employers, none were aware of any  instances of employees abusing the State's paid leave program.   Creating a national paid leave program makes economic sense. Every  year that we go without paid leave costs American workers and their  families $22.6 billion in lost wages. That is $22.6 billion that could  be going back into our economy, helping families get groceries, pay  bills, buy homes, start families, and live their lives. And it is  estimated that the mass exodus of women from the workforce during COVID  could have long-term costs as high as $64.5 billion in lost wages and  economic activity every single year.   We can stem those losses now if we take action.   I would also like to note, for those who are worried about the  pricetag of this bill, that paid leave was included in the House  version of the bill, which CBO found essentially pays for itself. There  is a reason every industrialized nation in the world has this kind of  system. It has paid leave because it works. Most of them offer far more  leave than this bill would, and their economies are proof that it is  net positive. We cannot be a global economic leader when we are not  even in the game.   Beyond all of that, this is what the American people, the people who  send us here, actually want. Seventy percent of all voters support paid  leave, including 81 percent of Democrats and 58 percent of Republicans,  who have said that paid family medical leave should be included in this  reconciliation bill. This is an up-to-date survey. The bill is designed  to help the American people, and this is what they are actually asking  for.   This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape the workplace.  We shouldn't squander it.   To my colleagues who say we should not proceed on paid leave until we  can do so in a bipartisan manner, I say the American people cannot wait  for us to have the same conversation for another year that lead us to  the same result--offers of a plan that is not universal or mandatory. A  voluntary plan is not what the American people want or need. They need  a plan that covers all workers for all life events.   There is good bipartisan work that can be done, and I will do that.  But I believe this is a moment in time, if we want to have a universal  plan that can cover low-wage and medium-wage workers in small States,  in rural States, and in States that don't have their own paid leave  plan.   This is that one chance--that one chance in a generation. It is now  in this reconciliation bill. We should not miss this chance. We should  include a national paid leave plan.                           Remembering Abe Schumer    Madam President, I rise to include one additional thought into the  Record, and it is to recognize the life of Abe Schumer, Majority Leader  Chuck Schumer's father and a lifelong New Yorker, who passed away on  November 24, 2021, at the age of 98.   Abe grew up in Utica, NY, and most recently resided in Queens. He was  a devoted husband to Selma, a wonderful parent to Chuck, Fran, and  Robert, and a loving grandparent and great-grandparent.   Abe Schumer represented the values and service that he instilled in  his son. He served in World War II in Burma as a radar operator in  planes that flew over the Himalayan Mountains. As a child of the  Depression, Abe knew what it meant to work hard and deal with financial  struggles. When he returned to Brooklyn, NY, he took over a small  exterminating business from his father in order to support his mother  and younger brothers, and then his own wife and three children.   As Senator Schumer has said, Abe ``personified the greatest  generation.''   We are thankful for Abe's devotion to his country and his family.  Learning about Abe's background and life, it is clear where my friend  and colleague Chuck got his devotion to family, his commitment to  service, and his work ethic.   I send my deepest condolences to his wife of 72 years, Selma, and to  his entire family. May his memory be a blessing.   With that, Madam President, I yield to my colleague from  Pennsylvania.                              Build Back Better
