 Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge support for my amendment that  will take an important step towards restoring congressional war powers.  This amendment will bring our unauthorized military presence in Syria  to a long overdue debate in Congress so we can ultimately vote to  authorize or reject military action.   Members on both sides of the aisle have long recognized the  Constitution and the War Powers Act of 1973 grant Congress the  exclusive power to send our servicemen and -women into war.   I represent parts of the Bronx and Westchester County, New York, and  in my district I am humbled to represent so many veterans who have  sacrificed so much for our country. Hundreds of thousands of brave men  and women have spent years away from their families, missing precious  moments in their families' lives. Many have seen their brothers and  sisters in arms be injured and killed in battle. Many have suffered  life-changing injuries themselves. Others have made the ultimate  sacrifice. On a daily basis, more than 17 veterans die by suicide every  single day. A study from Brown University's Costs of War project  estimates that more than 7,000 servicemembers have been killed in post- 9/11 operations, and a suicide epidemic has claimed more than 30,000  Active Duty servicemembers and veterans.   Given the unimaginable sacrifice our troops make for our country, we  owe them the respect of holding a debate and a vote on deploying them  into harm's way. I hope that no one serving in this body would oppose  honoring their service and their sacrifice by debating and voting on  these life and death matters.   We haven't shown that respect in my view. Washington is known for  military contractors lobbying for endless wars and a bloated Pentagon  budget while our investments in schools, healthcare, and jobs at home  are neglected. Our military footprint extends across dozens of  countries far from public scrutiny and accountability. In Congress we  find out about drone strikes after they occur in the news.   My amendment--which I am honored to be joined by Representatives  Khanna, DeFazio, Schakowsky, Tlaib, Levin, Cohen, and Ritchie Torres in  offering--is a fundamental next step toward breaking that cycle.   This is a question of war and peace that should be answered with a  recorded vote in Congress.   This amendment does not take a position on substantive Syria policy  questions. It merely requires this body to follow the Constitution and  hold a debate and vote to authorize military action. I hope that my  colleagues will agree that our troops and the American people deserve  to see this body  [[Page H4937]]  hold that debate and then cast their vote.   Under the last administration, President Trump made it clear that  U.S. military troops in Syria were there to secure the oil, but an  explicit authorization from Congress was never obtained for that  purpose.   I disagree with claims that the 2001 AUMF--which was about responding  to the September 11 attacks--authorized our troops to engage in  hostilities against these forces which nobody argues had anything to do  with those attacks or to guard oil fields.   My colleagues who believe that the President does not need specific  authorization to deploy U.S. military forces to seize Syria's oil in an  unconstitutional war should just admit that to their constituents. They  don't care about the duty of Congress, the Constitution, or the War  Powers Act.   I agree with what President Biden said yesterday at the United  Nations where he called for a new era of relentless diplomacy and that  U.S. military power must be our tool of last resort, not our first, and  should not be used as an answer to every problem we see around the  world.   One step in the right direction would be to restore war powers, which  is the solution put forth in this amendment.   After U.S. troops clashed with armed Syrian villagers last year, now- senior Biden NSC advisor Brett McGurk wrote on Twitter last year that  American soldiers with an ill-defined mission in Syria are forced to  navigate roads controlled by Russian and Syrian regime forces. He said  that this is too much to ask of our brave warriors.   I agree. And that is why I am seeking a vote to show them the minimum  respect of doing our constitutional duty and either authorizing a  mission with clear goals and a timeline or bringing our troops home to  their families.   I honor and respect the incredible sacrifices made by our Kurdish  allies. Nothing in this amendment supports abandoning the Kurdish  people, nor do I personally support that. The current unauthorized U.S.  military presence of indefinite duration is disrespectful to the  Kurdish people as it does not provide them the clarity that they need  to make their own sovereign decisions about how best to protect their  people and advance their own interests.   I want to have a transparent and vigorous debate in front of the  American people on the role of the U.S. military in Syria.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of my  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise as the designee of the gentlewoman  from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer a commonsense, good- government amendment that has already passed this House on a bipartisan  basis.   Decades ago, Congress recognized that there is an inherent conflict  of interest when elected officials, who decide how taxpayer dollars are  spent,  [[Page H4957]]  are also allowed to contract with the Federal Government to receive  those dollars. That is why Federal law prohibits every single Member of  this body from contracting with the Federal Government.   At the time, it was thought that there was no need to include the  President, Vice President, or members of the Cabinet in this statutory  prohibition because every recent executive had voluntarily divested of  their financial conflicts of interest. Unfortunately, that trend of  presidential transparency was broken by the last administration. If we  have learned anything from Donald Trump, it is that we can no longer  rely on norms and tradition to ensure our elected officials do the  right thing.                                time  1730    In 2014, the General Services Administration awarded The Trump  Organization a contract to operate a hotel in the taxpayer-owned Old  Post Office Pavilion. A provision in that contract specifically stated  that no elected official of the Government of the United States shall  be admitted to any share or part of this lease or to any benefit that  may arise therefrom.   Despite this clear and unambiguous prohibition, the GSA shockingly  declared that the President of the United States could continue to  operate this hotel on Federal Government property and personally  benefit from the proceeds of that operation.   As a result, it was easier than ever for foreign governments and  special interests to put money directly into President Trump's pocket.  Just ask Saudi Arabia, which reportedly spent $270,000 at the Trump  Hotel in 2017, or the island nation of Cyprus, which hosted a ``Justice  for Cyprus'' conference there, or the Iraqi sheikh who spent tens of  thousands of dollars staying 26 nights at the hotel.   The solution to this problem is very simple. My amendment simply  inserts ``the President, Vice President, and any Cabinet member'' into  the existing statutory prohibition on Members of Congress contracting  with the Federal Government.   With the addition of these eight words, we can ensure that every  elected official is free from the conflict of interest associated with  both deciding who gets Federal contracts and then benefiting from those  contracts.   The American people deserve to know their President is working for  them, not to line their own pockets.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and hold the  President, Vice President, and members of the Cabinet to the same  standard of conduct we hold ourselves.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, to my colleagues who oppose this amendment,  I ask this simple question: If they think the President should be  allowed to contract with the Federal Government, do they support  repealing the current statute that prohibits every Member of the body  from contracting with the Federal Government?   Of course they don't. That would be outrageous.   My amendment is common sense. It will apply to any President,  regardless of party affiliation. It will help restore integrity to the  Office of the President by closing the door on self-enrichment at the  White House. And it will prevent some of the corruption that defined  the Trump Presidency from ever happening again.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and impose the same  standards of conduct we imposed on ourselves to every federally elected  official.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
