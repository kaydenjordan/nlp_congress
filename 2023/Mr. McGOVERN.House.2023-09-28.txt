 Madam Speaker, current U.S. policy towards Cuba is best  described as continuing the sanctions and policies of Donald Trump.  [[Page H4718]]  Every day, our policies hurt the Cuban people. One thing the United  States can do to provide relief is to remove Cuba from the State  Sponsors of Terrorism list.   There is absolutely no reason for Cuba to be on that list, none. And  its impact affects nearly every global, financial, and economic  institution. Many European nations and U.S. allies want to help relieve  the suffering of the Cuban people, especially in the areas of health  and basic needs. But their hands are tied because of the SST list and  its onerous financial restrictions and punishments.   Our policy is a relic from the Cold War, and quite frankly, it is  cruel. It drives increased migration to our southern border, and it  makes no sense. It is an embarrassment.   Madam Speaker, I voted for Joe Biden, not Donald Trump. The President  needs to do better. He could begin by removing Cuba from the State  Sponsors of Terrorism list today.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma, my  good friend, the chairman of the Rules Committee, for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in 57 hours, this government will shut down. Federal  workers will be sent home. Members of the Armed Forces will defend our  country without pay. Programs that feed hungry moms and newborns will  stop. Travelers will face airport delays. Critical research on diseases  like cancer and Alzheimer's will grind to a halt.   You would think that last night, when the Rules Committee held an  emergency meeting, that it would be on stopping the shutdown. That is  the actual emergency, Mr. Speaker, that is facing our country. You  would be wrong. Instead of a bipartisan CR that can pass, we are back  at the eleventh hour to amend a rule, the first rule this majority  passed in weeks, because, once again, Speaker McCarthy is letting  extreme MAGA Republicans blackmail him.    What we are doing here is absurd. This assistance for Ukraine has  been in the Defense bill for years, well before the latest invasion by  Russia. This isn't even the Ukraine funding that President Zelenskyy  asked for or the funding the administration requested. This shouldn't  be controversial.   First, it was in the bill, then it wasn't, then it was. Then,  yesterday, we had a standalone vote on Ukraine funding, and the House  voted overwhelmingly, 339-93, a majority of the majority, an  overwhelming vote against stripping the Ukraine assistance in this  bill.   Instead of accepting that loss, extreme MAGA Republicans are  blackmailing Kevin McCarthy. Here we are, rigging the rules to undo  that vote.   They want to overturn the will of this House. They refuse to accept  the fact that they lost. What is it with Republicans refusing to accept  when they lose? Why can't you accept a loss? Why can't you respect the  vote?   I guess there is a pattern here. We saw it when they didn't want to  accept the Presidential election. Here on the House floor, we see when  extreme MAGA, rightwing Republicans don't get their way, when they lose  overwhelmingly, they can't accept a loss. They go to the Rules  Committee and say: Rig the process.   Did Trump call them and tell them to do this? I mean, this is so  unbelievably wrong.   The gentleman from Oklahoma has said some Members have very strong  moral objections to assisting Ukraine. Okay. I have strong moral  objections to the billions and billions of dollars of blank checks that  were given to the Pentagon.                                time  1500    I have strong moral objections to the fact that we refuse to ban the  transfer of cluster munitions to other countries around the world, but  guess what? It is our job as Members of Congress to weigh the pros and  cons and vote yes or no. If people do not want to make those tough  decisions, don't run for Congress.   I appreciate that the gentleman from Oklahoma voted for and supports  giving Ukraine the tools they need to defend themselves, but what the  gentleman is doing here is making it exponentially more likely that  this Ukraine funding will not become law.   Because if this doesn't make a difference, if these bills are moving  together and this is all just about giving people yet another chance to  vote on something they already voted on, what is the point?   The rule provides 30 minutes of debate on this sidecar Ukraine  funding bill, 30 minutes, 15 minutes on each side. What a debate that  is going to be.   I will tell you what the point of all of this is. Let me read you the  words of our colleague Marjorie Taylor Greene when she left the  Republican Conference meeting this morning. She told the reporter: ``We  are not funding Ukraine. That is what I heard in there.''   Let me inform the gentlewoman: We all had a chance to vote our  conscience, up or down. Those who voted to strike Ukraine aid can go  home and tell their constituents that they voted to strike Ukraine aid.  It is not that complicated.   What concerns many of us is the signal these extreme MAGA Republicans  are sending to Putin. Putin is an authoritarian thug. What he is doing  in Ukraine is sick. His troops are shelling nuclear power plants,  killing civilians, bombing hospitals, abducting women, massacring  people. My MAGA colleagues want to send him a message, and that message  is: Just hold on a little longer. Wait a little longer and you can do  whatever you want.   This House had a vote, and we are here to overturn it, all because  Speaker McCarthy is letting extreme MAGA Republicans blackmail him  because he cares more about keeping his job than doing his job.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments from my good  friend from Oklahoma, and he knows I have great affection for him, but  I am dizzy from all the spin, quite frankly.   First, about the CR, what we know is that what may or may not pass in  the House, based on the fact that the Freedom Caucus seems to be  calling the shots, will never pass the Senate. We know whatever will  come out of the Rules Committee in the next 24 hours or 48 hours or  whatever, if anything, if ever, will not be able to get the votes not  just amongst Democrats but amongst Republicans in the Senate.   Secondly, we do know that the Senate is working in a bipartisan way.  They already have clotured and moved forward with the process to bring  up a CR, with an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, but we know what they  pass would pass this House if put on the floor. The reason why this  government will, in all likelihood, shut down is because the Speaker of  the House is so beholden to a small group of the most extreme Members  that he won't put that on the floor. He will rig it so that we do not  have a chance to be able to vote on it. That is how this government  will shut down.   My good friend talks about how this is really no big deal. It is just  another vote, and everybody should be happy, but let me ask, if this  were good for Ukraine and Ukraine's ability to defend itself against  Russia's illegal war, then why would members of the pro-Putin caucus  even agree to this? If everyone genuinely thought there was no  difference between keeping the funding in the Defense bill and moving  it separately, why insist on all of this?   The answer is really simple: Republicans who seem to be enamored with  Putin want this funding sent separately to the Senate because they know  that is their best shot to prevent this money from going to Ukraine at  all.   In fact, when Marjorie Taylor Greene left the Republican Conference  meeting this morning--I quoted her already, but I will quote it again.  She said: ``We are not funding Ukraine. That is what I heard in  there.''   Plus, we all know that there are Senators like Rand Paul and Tommy  Tuberville who will block a separate Ukraine funding bill from moving  forward. They are actively preventing the Senate from completing its  work as we speak. This is not a flaw in the sidecar plan. It is a main  feature and a goal.   Let's be clear. This funding that we are talking about here is  longstanding security assistance. It has been in the Defense bill for  years, even before Putin invaded Ukraine. This is not the supplemental  funding that President Zelenskyy requested when he met with Speaker  McCarthy last week. This is not the supplemental funding the  administration requested in their emergency funding request. It is not  the supplemental funding that the Senate is trying to put in their  bipartisan CR.   Spare me the argument that somehow this is a good thing and gives  everybody a chance for their voice to be heard on this topic. If  everybody wanted their voice to be heard on this topic, you would have  speaker after speaker right now speaking on this bill and speaking  about their concerns about our Ukraine policy. There is no one over  there.   Let's all be real about what is happening. The House already had its  voice heard, and it overwhelmingly voted to support funding in the  Defense bill, a three-fourths majority. You can't get that many people  to agree on lunch in this place, and it is a majority of your majority.  The pro-Putin extremists didn't like the outcome, so they talked the  Speaker into rigging the vote. That is what this is all about.   Mr. Speaker, I am here to offer the House the opportunity to  demonstrate for a third time that we stand by Ukraine in their time of  need, and I urge that we defeat the previous question. If we do, I will  offer an amendment that would strike the provision of the rule  eliminating security assistance funding for Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with any extraneous material  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum) to discuss this proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have nothing but great affection for the gentleman  from Oklahoma, but we have to deal with the reality that we are now  living in.   This quote from Minority Leader McConnell was just tweeted out today  with a message to the House Republicans on how a shutdown would impact  the border. Mr. McConnell says: ``Shutting down the government is a  choice, and it is a choice that would make the crisis at the southern  border even worse.''   He says it is a choice because he sees what is happening here. He  sees that the Republicans in this Chamber have made a choice to shut  the government down. We didn't hear anything today about the border,  but yesterday or the day before we did hear a lot about the border.  Senator McConnell says that it would make the crisis at our southern  border even worse.   He is concerned. He is the Republican leader in the Senate. He is  concerned by the action of the Republicans in this House. He sees that  a small group of Republicans are calling the shots. They don't even  represent the majority of the majority here. It is really quite  extraordinary that we are at this moment.   Rather than moving in a direction where we can get a bipartisan CR  passed in both the House and the Senate and one that will be signed by  the President, my Republican friends in the House are going in the  wrong direction. We are running out of time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Quigley).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, a lot of Democrats were sounding the alarm bells over  the debt ceiling issue because our credit was actually downgraded. That  is not a good thing. After we got a deal, which thank God we did, the  extreme MAGA Republicans blackmailed the Speaker of the House into not  respecting that deal. We have a problem right now.   I should also point out that we had a long discussion on the border,  and I am still puzzled why you are bringing a Homeland Security  appropriations bill to the floor that actually cuts funding for border  security. I don't quite get that.   You added a provision that says that if you pass an appropriations  bill on Homeland Security, it is kept at the desk, and it can't go to  the Senate for a vote unless this crazy bill, H.R. 2, is passed by the  Senate and signed into law by the President, without even changing a  comma. I don't know what brilliant legislative mind thought that up.  The bottom line is, this is not serious.                                time  1530    Let me again read a quote from Senator McConnell. He said: A vote  against a standard short-term funding measure is a vote against paying  over $1 billion in salary for CBP and ICE agents.   I don't know how my Republican friends are going to defend the  border. Maybe with volunteers. Come on; I mean, at some point we have  to get serious.   Let me also just say--and, again, you can't make this stuff up-- Republicans are holding their first impeachment hearing today with just  hours to go until a shutdown.   What is wrong with them?   Breaking news indicates it was a failure. The hearing was a total  failure. Republican staffers are telling reporters that it was, ``an  unmitigated disaster.''   Another GOP staffer says, ``Comer has lost control.''   Another GOP person said, ``Comer botched this bad.''   This was supposed to be their big bombshell, and it was a total dud.  Not a single one of their witnesses could come up with a shred of  evidence against the President.   Let's see what they said. Their lead witness, Jonathan Turley, who  they roll out every chance they can, was on FOX News constantly, said:  I do not believe that the current evidence would support Articles of  Impeachment. That is their star witness.   Their other lead witness, Bruce Dubinsky, said: I am not here today  to even suggest that there was corruption, fraud, or any wrongdoing.   The list of Members on the other side saying this impeachment inquiry  is a sham is getting longer and longer by the hour, and the clock keeps  ticking toward a shutdown. Instead of a bipartisan CR that can pass,  here we are wasting time.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the Record an  article from The Daily Beast, ``Star GOP Witness Immediately Pours Cold  Water on Biden Impeachment.''    Again, the gentleman mentioned what is wrong with  sending this separate bill to the Senate. I thought I explained that.  Let me explain it in two words: Paul and Tuberville. I mean, these  Senators are unhinged. Tuberville is holding up military promotions and  Paul delays everything. We see that he is trying to delay Senate  consideration on the CR.   Sending this over and expecting that there is quick action? I mean,  we all know what is going to happen, and we all know that people like  Marjorie Taylor Greene, who insisted on this, did so because they think  they have a better chance of derailing everything.   I find it interesting, Mr. Speaker, that nobody put their name on  this amendment. I don't know whose idea this was. I don't know who the  author of this particular provision is to strip out Ukraine money, but  anyway, that is a mystery that we will have to try to solve.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Smith), the distinguished ranking member of the Armed Services  Committee.    How much time do I have remaining, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   First of all, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma. I think he did the  best job he could defending this. He is very skillful in utilizing the  English language. I always appreciate listening to him on these  matters, but we all know what this is really about.   We all had a chance to vote our conscience up or down. Those who  voted to strike Ukraine aid can go home and tell their constituents  they voted to strike Ukraine's aid. It is not that complicated.   The fact of the matter is, Republicans have not done a single  productive thing this week. They passed only one appropriations bill  all year, and they are sitting here wasting time while the clock runs  out.   It is not just me saying that. Listen to our Republican colleagues.  Listen to Mike Lawler. He said, ``This is not conservative  Republicanism. This is stupidity, the idea we are going to shut the  government down when we don't control the Senate, we don't control the  White House. If the clown show of colleagues that refuse to actually  govern does not want to pass a CR, I will do everything we need to do  to make sure a CR passes.''   Congressman Marc Molinaro says, ``The goal here is to avert a  shutdown.'' Guess what? This procedural vote is his chance to stand up  and show the extremists. Instead of wasting our time in the clown show,  vote against this rule.   Congressman Anthony D'Esposito says he is ready to explore each and  every option possible to make sure that we don't shut the government  down. If Mr. D'Esposito is watching, vote against this rule.   Congressman Dusty Johnson says, ``The government should not shut  down. That would be an exceptionally stupid thing to do.'' Well, I  agree. He should vote down this rule so we can get to work on  preventing a shutdown.   I am going to say directly to all of my colleagues, this vote is  their chance to end the clown show. The only thing that matters around  here is their votes. Everything else is BS. Maybe they should focus  less on getting quotes and more on how they vote. Vote against this  clown show. Vote against this rule.   By the way, it works. It works for the Freedom Caucus and for the  most extreme elements of this Chamber. They vote down rules, and they  get these crazy things put into rules. They get everything they want.  It is enough of the talk. If there are moderate Republicans out there  who do not want this government to shut down, now is the time to put  their vote where their rhetoric is. Enough of the talk. We need action.   Finally, let me say to the chairman of the Rules Committee, the  chairman said 5 days ago, ``We will see how this week unfolds.'' Well,  this week has unfolded, and the Republican Party is still at war with  itself. We are still no closer to avoiding a shutdown.   What is happening here is so painfully transparent to anyone that is  watching. It is because all Kevin McCarthy seems to care about is  keeping his job. He should care about what a shutdown would do to his  constituents, but he doesn't. He appears to care more about keeping his  job than doing his job.   As I said last night, and I will say again, calling Republican  leadership a clown show is doing a disservice to actual working clowns.  This process is one of the most rotten, corrupt, rigged things I have  seen in all my time here. Shame on the Speaker. I have never seen  anything like this: Using the rules to overturn a democratic vote on  the House floor. Again, the vote was 339-93. 339-93. I mean, we don't  get votes like that around here. Yet, one Member--we don't even know  who is responsible for the language that we are dealing with here  today. No one put their name on it, but this is awful, and I strongly  reject this whole process.   I again make an appeal to the moderate Republicans, if there are any  out there, you know, stand with us, show us with their vote that they  want things to change now, that they do not want a shutdown. Vote down  this sham rule and force the leadership to go back up to the Rules  Committee and do what they should have done a long time ago, work on a  CR that can get a bipartisan vote in the House, a bipartisan vote in  the Senate, and we can avoid a shutdown, and we can prevent a lot of  misery for millions and millions of people in this country.   Shutdowns, contrary to what you hear by many on the other side of the  aisle, are a bad thing. It represents a failure of this institution to  do its most basic job, and that is keep the lights on. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule, and I yield back the balance of  my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
