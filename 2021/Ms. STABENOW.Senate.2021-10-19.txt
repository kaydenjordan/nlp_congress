 Madam President, reserving the right to object, the  Senator will speak further about what he is attempting to do, but I  want to make it clear, first of all, that this bill isn't about  protecting access to food assistance for moms and babies or ensuring  children continue to receive healthy school meals. This actually is,  unfortunately, a bill that is in search of a problem.   And if my colleague Senator Scott wants to work with me on  eliminating barriers to access to SNAP or the WIC Program or school  meals, I would be more than happy to work with him on it.   But let me just say this: This bill, again, is in search of a problem  because there is no rule requiring vaccinations for families to receive  food assistance, and no one in the administration is proposing that.   So let me just say that again: There is no rule requiring  vaccinations for families to receive food assistance, and no one in the  administration is proposing that.   So if we want to work together on how to support families in our  country to help make sure children have the healthy food that they need  in schools, that is terrific. But rather than spending time on bills  like this, we should be encouraging people to get vaccinated to protect  their families, protect themselves, and protect their community.   But this bill addresses something that is just not real nor will it  be real.   And so I would object.
