 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Louisiana for his leadership on this important issue.   Right now, the clock is ticking. Do you hear it?   Our communities are being destroyed by the illegal fentanyl that  continues to pour across our southern border and, tragically, it pours  into the hands of many unknowing Americans.   In just 2 weeks from now, the emergency class-wide order that makes  it illegal to possess this deadly drug will expire, and many forms of  fentanyl will become legal on American streets. If this happens, police  officers will be powerless to stop this drug from wreaking havoc on our  communities.   We know the consequences of leaving this drug. Sadly, fentanyl  overdoses are the leading cause of death among 18- to 45-year-olds, the  leading cause of death.   Just a half a mile from where we stand here in the Capitol, the  fentanyl crisis claimed three more lives last week.   In my district alone in Pennsylvania, over 400 men, women, and  children lost their lives to opioid overdoses.   Being a part of a community means taking responsibility for one  another. By not bringing this vote to the floor, liberals in this body  are failing their responsibility to the American people. Our  communities cannot wait any longer.   Madam Speaker, now is the time to permanently ban this deadly drug.  Now is the time to give law enforcement the tools that they need to  keep our neighbors, our families, and our communities safer. Americans  are counting on us.   Can you hear the clock ticking?   Now is the time to act. I thank the gentleman for leading this  Special Order Hour this evening.                                time  1830
