Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Before I address the disapproval resolution, I just want to  acknowledge the important role Federal contractors have in meeting the  needs of the Federal Government. Employment and critical services in  many districts, including my own, are heavily reliant on Federal  contractors, including those who serve a critical role for our Nation,  supporting the needs of the military, the Coast Guard, Homeland  Security, and many others.   That said, it is imperative that contractors are bidding on a level  playing field when they compete for contracts. Unfortunately, this  resolution would effectively reward contractors who cut corners,  endanger the rights of their workers, and, studies show, compromise  quality.   Although most Federal contractors obey labor laws, studies by the  GAO, the Senate HELP Committee, and others document that Federal  contractors with histories of serious, willful, and repeated violations  of labor employment and nondiscrimination laws continue to be rewarded  with Federal contracts.   For context, it is important to know that contracting rules already  require agencies to determine whether or not a prospective contractor  is responsible before awarding a contract. Amongst the criteria  considered is whether or not the contractor has ``a satisfactory record  of integrity and business ethics,'' and ``a satisfactory performance  record.''   As previous speakers have noted, violations can already be  considered. However, contracting officers don't have access to a list  of those violations until this rule is issued, nor are contracting  officers required to review a bidder's labor violations history.   The rule implementing the executive order on Fair Pay and Safe  Workplaces does not add any extra layers of review. Rather, it would  fill that data gap by requiring contractors to disclose whether they  have violations of 14 longstanding labor laws, including the Fair Labor  Standards Act, OSHA, Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act,  and nondiscrimination laws.   It only applies to contracts over $500,000, so we are not talking  about mom-and-pop operations. But if listing those violations of fair  pay and safe workplace laws constitutes an administrative burden, more  the reason to make them be listed.   They are to be disclosed. And although we have heard about  allegations, and although some violations may not be final, the only  thing that has to be disclosed are those violations for which there has  been an agency determination. That is, an allegation is made, it is  investigated, and the company has been found to be in violation. It may  be on appeal or whatnot, but there has at least been an agency  determination of guilt.   The rule requires contracting officers to focus on whether such  violations are serious, repeated, willful or pervasive. The rule helps  bring those contractors with a history of violations into compliance by  way of labor compliance agreements so they can continue to be  considered for contracting opportunities while they improve their  records.    Some have mislabeled this rule as the ``blacklisting rule,'' but this  suggestion and characterization ignores the rules' meaningful  compliance provision. The reality is that this rule would, according to  the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, encourage agency  contract officials to push bidders with serious labor law violations  ``to enter into labor compliance agreements'' rather than to disbar or  suspend them.   I want to point out that a coalition of 20,000 construction  contractors submitted testimony to the Small Business Committee where  they wrote: ``Employers--primes and subs have more rights, remedies and  redress for non-responsibility determinations based on lack of  integrity or business ethics under the executive order than the current  Federal Acquisition Regulation procedures specifically provide.''   Now, this testimony suggests that the rules are far more contractor- friendly than the detractors have characterized.   It would be premature to dismantle this rule because it hasn't even  been put into effect because it has been under a court injunction.  Further, repealing the rule under the CRA would bar future  consideration of substantially similar rules unless Congress enacts  subsequent enabling legislation.  [[Page H910]]    So the bottom line is that there are winners and there are losers if  this legislation passes. The winners, if this legislation passes, would  be companies who willfully, and repeatedly, and pervasively violate  labor laws. The winners would be the contractors who cut corners and  gain an unfair competitive advantage over law-abiding contractors.                                time  1500    The losers will be workers who are employed by Federal contractors.  They will be more susceptible to wage theft, unfair working conditions,  and unsafe workplaces run by unscrupulous contractors. Losers will be  the law-abiding contractors who lose contracts because they abide by  the laws protecting their workers.   This is why the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule enjoys support from  a widespread number of businesses, veterans, civil rights, and labor  organizations from the Easterseals to Paralyzed Veterans of America, to  the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and the International  Brotherhood of Teamsters. That is why I oppose this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), the vice ranking member of the  Committee on Education and the Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, can you advise both sides how  much time is remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 17\1/2\  minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from North Carolina has 12\1/2\  minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross), a member of the Committee on  Education and the Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), the ranking member on the  Subcommittee on Workforce Protections.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Espaillat), a member of the Committee on  Education and the Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the  time.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to restate a couple of provisions.   One is this underlying regulation only applies to contracts in excess  of $500,000. As previously stated, this information that is to be  disclosed can already be considered in contracting. This regulation  makes it available so it can be considered.   It is not just allegations. We are talking about agency  determinations after an investigation.   Now, the regulation requires consideration of the fact of whether or  not a determination is final or whether it is on appeal. That is to be  considered. But not all violations in the fullest of time are to be  considered at all. Only those that are serious, repeated, willful, or  pervasive violations of fair pay and safe workplace violations are to  be considered.   And so for the people who are not blacklisted, the guilty are  encouraged to participate in labor compliance agreements so they can  continue to receive contracts while they improve their records.                                time  1530    In closing, Mr. Speaker, let us recall who the winners and losers are  if this resolution of disapproval passes. The winners will be the  unscrupulous contractors who cut corners and compromise the safety of  their workers. The losers will be the workers, who are the most  susceptible to wage theft and unfair working conditions, and the law- abiding contractors who face unfair competition.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record three letters: one from The  Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, another from the  American Industrial Hygiene Association, and, finally, one from a  coalition of 134 business, labor, and civil society groups which stand  in opposition to this resolution of disapproval.                                       The Leadership Conference on                                          Civil and Human Rights,                                   Washington, DC, January 31, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: On behalf of       The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a       coalition charged by its diverse membership of more than 200       national organizations to promote and protect the civil and       human rights of all persons in the United States, we write in       strong opposition to the use of the Congressional Review Act       (CRA) to repeal the regulations implementing the Fair Pay and       Safe Workplaces Executive Order.        The Fair Pay regulations represent a much-needed step       forward in ensuring that the federal contractor community is       providing safe and fair workplaces for employees by       encouraging compliance with federal labor and civil rights       laws, and prohibiting the use of mandatory arbitration of       certain disputes.        Employers that have the privilege of doing business with       the federal government also have a responsibility to abide by       the law. The Fair Pay regulations are crucial because they       help ensure that federal contractors behave responsibly and       ethically with respect to labor standards and civil rights       laws. They also encourage companies applying for federal       contracts to comply with federal civil rights laws such as       the Fair Labor Standards Act (which includes the Equal Pay       Act), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with       Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Occupational Safety and       Health Act, and their state law equivalents. The Executive       Order also bans contractors from forcing employees to       arbitrate claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act as       well as claims of sexual harassment and sexual assault.        We urge you to oppose any attempts to roll back the       protections that stem from the Executive Order on Fair Pay       and Safe Workplaces. The Order and implementing regulations       provide strong protections against the federal government       contracting with employers that routinely engage in       discrimination based on race, sex, age, or disability,       violate workplace health and safety protections, withhold       wages, or commit other labor violations. If you have any       questions, please feel free to contact June Zeitlin, Director       of Human Rights Policy.            Sincerely,      Wade Henderson,        President & CEO.      Nancy Zirkin,        Executive Vice President.                                   ____                                     AIHA Protecting Worker Health                                                   January 31, 2017.   Expressing Concern for Worker Health & Safety Related to H.J.Res. 37   ``Disapproving the Final Rule Submitted by the Department of Defense,   the General Services Administration, and the National Aeronautics and   Space Administration Relating to the Federal Acquisition Regulation''         Dear US Representatives: On behalf of the American       Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), I am writing to       express our concern with H.J.Res. 37, which would overturn a       final rule that amended the Federal Acquisition Regulation to       implement Executive Order 13673 ``Fair Pay and Safe       Workplaces'', and is currently scheduled for consideration       this week on the House floor under Suspension of the Rules.       While the final rule and Executive Order address many topics,       our concerns are limited to those areas dealing with worker       health and safety, as these are the subjects in which AIHA       and its members possess unique expertise and knowledge.        Instead of a blanket repeal of this rule, AIHA encourages       you to engage with occupational and environmental health and       safety professionals, and others in a constructive dialogue       that examines how best to improve worker health, safety, and       socioeconomic prosperity--all of which are closely linked. As       currently drafted, H.J.Res. 37 threatens to slow progress       towards healthier and safer workplaces; as such, we encourage       you to oppose its passage.        Founded in 1939, AIHA is the premier association of       occupational and environmental health and safety       professionals. AIHA's 8,500 members play a crucial role on       the front line of worker health and safety every day. Our       members represent a cross-section of industry, private       business, labor, government and academia.        Thank you for your consideration of AIHA's concerns and       recommendations. AIHA looks forward to working with you to       help protect worker health and safety. Please feel free to       contact Mark Ames, AIHA's Director of Government Relations.            Respectfully,                                            Lawrence Sloan, CAE,       Chief Executive Officer, AIHA.                                   ____                                                   January 31, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: On behalf of       the undersigned organizations, we write in strong opposition       to the use of the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal       the regulations implementing the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces       Executive Order. We are organizations dedicated to protecting       workers, eliminating workplace discrimination and protecting       access to justice. The Fair Pay regulations represent a much-      needed step forward in ensuring that the federal contractor       community is providing safe and fair workplaces for employees       by encouraging compliance with federal labor and civil rights       laws, and prohibiting the use of mandatory arbitration of       certain disputes.        Employers that have the privilege of doing business with       the federal government also have a responsibility to abide by       the law. The Fair Pay regulations are crucial because they       help ensure that federal contractors behave responsibly and       ethically with respect to labor standards and civil rights       laws. They also encourage companies applying for federal       contracts to comply with federal labor and employment laws       such as the Fair Labor Standards Act (which includes the       Equal Pay Act), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the       Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Occupational       Safety and Health Act, and their state law equivalents. The       Executive Order also bans contractors from forcing employees       to arbitrate claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act       as well as claims of sexual harassment and sexual assault.        We ask you to stand with American workers and oppose any       attempts to roll back the protections that stem from the       Executive Order on Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces. They provide       strong protections against the federal government contracting       with employers that routinely violate workplace health and       safety protections, engage in age, disability, race, and sex       discrimination, withhold wages, or commit other labor       violations. These protections should not be repealed.
