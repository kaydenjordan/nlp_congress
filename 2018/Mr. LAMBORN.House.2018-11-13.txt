 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4033) to reauthorize the National Geologic Mapping Act of  1992.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4033         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Geologic Mapping       Act Reauthorization Act''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF NATIONAL GEOLOGIC MAPPING ACT OF                     1992.         (a) Reauthorization.--        (1) In general.--Section 9(a) of the National Geologic       Mapping Act of 1992 (43 U.S.C. 31h(a)) is amended by striking       ``2018'' and inserting ``2023''.        (2) Conforming amendment.--Section 4(b)(1) of the National       Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 (43 U.S.C. 31c(b)(1)) is amended       by striking ``Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009''       each place it appears in subparagraphs (A) and (B) and       inserting ``National Geologic Mapping Act Reauthorization       Act''.        (b) Geologic Mapping Advisory Committee.--Section 5(a)(3)       of the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 (43 U.S.C.       31d(a)(3)) is amended by striking ``Associate Director for       Geology'' and inserting ``Associate Director for Core Science       Systems''.        (c) Clerical Amendments.--Section 3 of the National       Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 (43 U.S.C. 31b) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (4), by striking ``section 6(d)(3)'' and       inserting ``section 4(d)(3)'';        (2) in paragraph (5), by striking ``section 6(d)(1)'' and       inserting ``section 4(d)(1)''; and        (3) in paragraph (9), by striking ``section 6(d)(2)'' and       inserting ``section 4(d)(2)''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to sponsor H.R. 4033, the National Geologic  Mapping Act Reauthorization Act. This commonsense measure will continue  funding for advanced digital geologic maps in three-dimensional models  by reauthorizing funding for the program through 2023. An identical  companion bill, S. 1787, was introduced in the Senate by Senator  Murkowski and has been favorably reported out of the Senate Energy and  Natural Resources Committee.   Geologic maps provide valuable information needed for identifying  energy, mineral, and water resources, geologic and environmental  hazards, unstable grounds subject to landslides, swelling soils,  floodplains, and abandoned mine lands.   With this knowledge, communities and citizens are able to plan for  septic systems in rural areas, water treatment facilities, road  construction and maintenance, home construction, and other  infrastructure.   The Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 established the National Cooperative  Geologic Mapping Program, or NCGMP. This program allows for  coordination between the United States Geological Survey and the  various state geological surveys, allowing for geologic maps to be  produced efficiently and cost-effectively.   The original authorizing act also created the National Geologic  Database, which catalogs data on most geologic maps ever produced in  the U.S., which to date has resulted in more than 100,000 products.   Each State and Puerto Rico has an advisory committee and a review  panel to analyze the effectiveness of these projects. More than 8,500  new geologic maps have been produced through the NCGMP, with an average  of 350 new maps and reports created each year. That is about one a day.  About 53 percent of the United States now has been mapped as a result.   The benefits from this program have been felt by end users across the  country. Geologic maps in Kentucky, for example, have assisted city  planners, water systems developers, and producers of coal and other  mineral resources. In Ohio, developers and engineers who used geologic  maps were estimated to save an average of $50,000 on each project. In  my home State of Colorado, this program resulted in the production of  an advanced geologic map and companion report that showcased  recreational and historical mining, leading to efficiency opportunities  from Leadville to Salida.   Reauthorizing the National Geologic Mapping Act through H.R. 4033  will continue to provide the economic and developmental benefits of  geologic mapping, with effects enjoyed across the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend across the  aisle, Mr. Brown, for his work on this bill. It was a good  collaboration. I appreciate his remarks tonight, and I appreciate what  he did. I look forward to working with him in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill  [[Page H9477]]  (H.R. 5787) to amend the Coastal Barrier Resources Act to give effect  to more accurate maps of units of the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier  Resources System that were produced by digital mapping of such units,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5787         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthening Coastal       Communities Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. REPLACEMENT OF JOHN H.

SEC. 4. REPEAL OF REPORT.         Section 3 of Public Law 109-226 is repealed.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5787, the Strengthening  Coastal Communities Act of 2018, sponsored by our colleague from  Florida, Congressman Neal Dunn.   This legislation codifies modernized, digital maps under the Coastal  Barrier Resources Act and was developed in a collaborative manner with  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Members whose districts are  impacted by the map revisions. Only those maps that received sign-off  from the affected Members were included in this package.   I thank Mr. Dunn, Ms. Blunt Rochester, and all who participated in  this process for their hard work on this important issue.   The Coastal Barrier Resources System has proven to be a win-win for  the  [[Page H9478]]  taxpayers and the environment since its enactment in 1982, saving the  taxpayers billions of dollars by avoiding Federal investment in  undeveloped storm- and flood-prone areas. H.R. 5787 will strengthen and  update this system and allow its success to continue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Dunn), who introduced the  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill  [[Page H9479]]  (H.R. 5636) to designate additions to the Flatside Wilderness on the  Ouachita National Forest, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5636         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Flatside Wilderness       Enhancement Act''.       SEC. 2. ADDITIONS TO FLATSIDE WILDERNESS.         Section 3(d) of Arkansas Wilderness Act of 1984 (Public Law       98-508; 98 Stat. 2349) is amended by inserting ``and certain       land in the Ouachita National Forest, which comprise       approximately 640 acres, as generally depicted as       `Recommended Wilderness Area' on the map titled `Flatside       Wilderness, Recommended Wilderness Area', dated September 6,       2018'' after ``1984''.       SEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF WILDERNESS ADDITION.         The wilderness addition created under section 2 shall be       known as the Bethune Woods-Flatside Wilderness. Any reference       in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record       of the United States to such portion of the Flatside       Wilderness shall be deemed to be a reference to the Bethune       Woods-Flatside Wilderness.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5636 adds approximately 640 acres to the 9,500-acre  Flatside Wilderness in the Ouachita National Forest.                                time  1615    This land has been studied and recommended as an addition to the  wilderness by the U.S. Forest Service.   The bill also names the addition after Congressman Ed Bethune, who  served the people of Arkansas from 1979 to 1985.   This relatively minor change will establish more manageable  wilderness boundaries, allowing the Forest Service to take better care  of the land. Most importantly, this new wilderness designation has  local support and support from the Arkansas delegation.   Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Congressman French Hill, for  introducing this legislation to benefit his district. I urge adoption  of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), who introduced the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6064) to rename the Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge as  the Congressman Lester Wolff National Wildlife Refuge.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6064         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) The Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge was created in       1968. It is located on the north shore of Long Island in       eastern Nassau County, is the largest refuge in the Long       Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex, and receives the       most public use of all the refuges in the Complex.        (2) The State of New York designated Oyster Bay a       significant coastal fish and wildlife habitat. It is       especially important for wintering waterfowl such as black       duck, greater scaup, bufflehead, canvasback and long-tailed       ducks. Management activities include wetland restoration and       protection of the natural shoreline and vegetation.        (3) The refuge is unique in consisting solely of bay bottom       and adjacent shoreline up to the mean high-tide mark. Ninety       percent of New York's commercial oyster harvest comes from       the refuge. Visitors enjoy fishing, wildlife observation,       photography and environmental education. The refuge is truly       a national treasure.  [[Page H9480]]         (4) Many visitors are unaware that were it not for the       tireless work and advocacy of then-freshman Congressman       Lester Wolff, this area would today be an 8.5-mile causeway       and bridge across Long Island Sound between Oyster Bay and       Rye, New York, connecting Nassau and Westchester Counties.        (5) The bridge was first proposed by Robert Moses, the       well-known New York City Planner, to divert traffic from New       York City. Former Governor Nelson Rockefeller signed into law       legislation creating the bridge authorized by the New York       State Legislature in 1967.        (6) Congressman Wolff, elected in 1964, quickly decided the       bridge would be an intrusion in a pristine area, and that       Long Island Sound was a very precious resource that was       despoiled. The conservation threats in the mid-1960s were       suburban development, wetland filling, and industrial       pollution. The fight to preserve this land became an enormous       political fight and is considered to be a turning point in       New York State's environmental legacy.        (7) With State and local political and community leaders,       and especially the North Shore leaders and the Committee to       Save the Long Island Sound, Congressman Wolff arranged a       meeting with Department of the Interior representatives and       local leaders where the idea of creating a wildlife refuge       from municipal and privately owned wetlands was created.        (8) The Town of Oyster Bay, in which one end of the bridge       was to be located, deeded 5,000 acres of wetlands to the       United States to be maintained as a Federal wildlife       preserve. It was stipulated that if the Department of the       Interior agreed to an intrusion of the property, it would       revert to the town. Creating a Federal wildlife preserve       provided the land with Federal protection.        (9) Because of the vision, dedication, and perseverance of       Congressman Lester Wolff, all of us and future generations       can enjoy the beauty and magnificence of this refuge.       SEC. 2. RENAMING THE OYSTER BAY NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE AS                     THE CONGRESSMAN LESTER WOLFF NATIONAL WILDLIFE                     REFUGE.         (a) Renaming.--The unit of the National Wildlife Refuge       System known as the Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge and       located near Oyster Bay, New York, shall be known as the       ``Congressman Lester Wolff National Wildlife Refuge''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System known as the       Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge is deemed to be a       reference to the ``Congressman Lester Wolff National Wildlife       Refuge''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6064 would rename the Oyster Bay National Wildlife  Refuge as the Lester Wolff National Wildlife Refuge in honor of the  former Long Island North Shore Congressman.   Elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1965,  Congressman Wolff served eight terms representing the people of New  York. During that time, he successfully pushed to create the Oyster Bay  National Wildlife Refuge on the north shore of Long Island.

During the period beginning on the date of enactment of       this Act and ending on the date of conveyance of a property       or parcel of land under this Act, the provisions of the       Management Agreement that are applicable to the property or       land, or to leases between the State and the Secretary, and       any applicable permits, shall remain in force and effect.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of S. 440, sponsored by Senator Hoeven of North  Dakota. This legislation is nearly identical to legislation sponsored  by our colleague who will soon be departing us, Congressman Kevin  Cramer, which was favorably reported by the Natural Resources Committee  in August.   This legislation would transfer small parcels of Federal land  immediately surrounding Dickinson Reservoir in North Dakota. This will  allow members of the local community to purchase the land under their  own homes, providing them with financial security and the community  with increased tax revenue that will be reinvested toward the upkeep of  the reservoir.   Other land will remain in use for recreation, public access, fish and  wildlife habitat, a fish and game headquarters, or preserved in its  natural character. If the land is not used for these purposes, it will  revert to the Federal Government.   Federal ownership of the land has led to financial uncertainty for  private citizens and the State, and I applaud the dedication of former  Natural Resources Committee member and future Senator Cramer and  Senator Hoeven to alleviating these bureaucratic challenges and  supporting their constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.  [[Page H9482]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer), who will speak on this and  the following bill, because they are very similar.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2074) to establish a procedure for the conveyance of certain  Federal property around the Jamestown Reservoir in the State of North  Dakota, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

INTERIM REQUIREMENTS.         During the period beginning on the date of enactment of       this Act and ending on the date of conveyance of a property       or parcel of land under this Act, the provisions of the       Management Agreement that are applicable to the property or       land, or to leases between the State and the Secretary, and       any applicable permits, shall remain in force and effect.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2074 sponsored by Senator Hoeven  of North Dakota. This legislation is nearly identical to legislation  sponsored by our colleague, Congressman Kevin Cramer, which was  favorably reported by the Natural Resources Committee in August.   This is another bill similar to the one that was discussed a few  minutes ago that looks to transfer small parcels of Federal land to  State and local government, this time surrounding the Jamestown  Reservoir in North Dakota. The land will continue to be used for  recreation and public purposes, public access, fish and wildlife  habitat, a fish and game headquarters, and for cabins. If any of the  land is sold, the proceeds will be given to the Federal Government or  the land will revert to the United States.   Like S. 440, which the House just considered, this legislation aims  to alleviate financial uncertainty for private citizens residing around  the reservoir and will help support the local community through tax  revenue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
