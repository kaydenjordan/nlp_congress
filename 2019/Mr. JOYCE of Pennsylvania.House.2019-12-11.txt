 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained.  Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 669.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Georgia, a pharmacist, leading this discussion. It is so important the  leadership that Representative Carter has taken in this role in  addressing this.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition of H.R. 3. This  would severely constrain biomedical innovation, limit the access to  future cures, and ultimately harm so many patients across America.   While all of us agree that we must act as a Congress to lower the  cost of prescription medicine, this bill takes a fundamentally  incorrect approach that would jeopardize Americans' access to new  medicines and have a negative impact on patient outcomes.   As a physician, as a legislator, I have witnessed new cures that  offer hope to patients facing devastating diagnoses.   As recently as 10 years ago, when I would see a patient presenting  with metastatic melanoma, the prognosis often would be fatal. Now,  thanks to the advent of new biologic therapies, patients diagnosed with  widespread  [[Page H10121]]  metastatic melanoma have a chance to live, a chance to embrace life.   Let me be clear about this issue. Passing H.R. 3 would deprive  patients and their loved ones of a chance for a cure.    Fortunately, we have the alternative in H.R. 19, the Lower Costs,  More Cures Act, of which I am proud to be an original cosponsor. This  bill is a package of more than 40 bipartisan provisions that would  actually become law and have real impact on our patients, on our  constituents. And in addition, would ultimately lower drug prices.   Madam Speaker, I am grateful to Mr. Carter for leading this  discussion and for hosting this Special Order on this crucial topic.
