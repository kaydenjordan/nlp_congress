 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the  continuing resolution before us. I am pleased we came to an agreement,  but it is only a stopgap. A bicameral, bipartisan omnibus bill must be  passed to fund government for the remainder of fiscal year 2022.   Limping along from continuing resolution to continuing resolution  keeps us from making necessary investments in critical programs, and it  halts progress on new programs, including a number included within the  bipartisan infrastructure law.   The infrastructure initiative makes historic investments in roads,  bridges, public transportation, broadband, and much more, but without a  full-year bill, formula funding is going to be restricted to fiscal  year 2021 levels, and our ability to transform our Nation's  transportation infrastructure will be limited.   For example, the newly created Carbon Reduction program and the  PROTECT grant program to promote resilience can't be initiated.  Restricting funding to fiscal year 2021 levels for some programs will  delay contracts and grants.   A full-year Transportation-HUD bill would update our aging  transportation infrastructure, remedy inequities in housing and  transportation, prevent evictions, and make our infrastructure more  resilient to natural disasters and a changing climate.   We also spent months, Madam Speaker, vetting hundreds of Community  [[Page H1054]]  Project Funding requests in a bipartisan manner for well-designed  housing, transportation, and economic development projects. Without  completing the annual appropriations process, none of these investments  will happen.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this CR today. I urge my colleagues  to work together to meet Congress' most basic constitutional  responsibility, funding our government and directing investments for  the future. We must come to the table with a constructive path forward  for fiscal year 2022 appropriations.
