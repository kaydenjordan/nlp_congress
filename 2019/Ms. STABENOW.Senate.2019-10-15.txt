 Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague. I think he  stepped to the back. No one has been a better champion for our miners  and their families than Senator Joe Manchin. Every single day, he  brings to us the needs of our coal miners and people who have literally  fueled a generation beyond our economy. I want to thank Senator Manchin  for his leadership, and also thank Senator Brown for his leadership as  well. The two of them together are leading our efforts.   I am proud to be joining with them to focus on an issue that is  hurting working men and women across Michigan and across the country.  It is an issue that, quite frankly, I can't believe that, in the  Senate, we are having to actually talk about why people should get the  pension that they have paid into their whole life. I can't believe that  we even have to have this as an issue or the fact that we are having to  fight to get the attention of the majority leader and the majority in  the Senate who actually bring up legislation to help people get the  pension they have paid into their whole working life. This ought to be  a given. We used to think it was. It is wrong that it is not today.   For generations, millions of working people built better lives for  themselves and their families with jobs that provided more than just a  paycheck. Folks worked really hard, and in exchange for a job well  done, they could count on basic benefits, including healthcare and a  secure retirement, coming through a pension that they paid into while  they were working. These workers didn't just build their own families.  They literally built the middle class.   I can tell you, coming from Michigan, that is exactly what happened.  They built our economy. They built our American way of life, and they  just assumed that America would keep its promises, that the companies  would keep their promises, that our laws would be set up in a way that  they could trust would work, and that the money they were putting into  a pension and retirement security would be there for themselves and  their families. I don't think that is too much to ask.   Many of these coal miners, truck drivers, construction workers,  autoworkers, and others gave up raises--as my colleagues already talked  about--in exchange for retirement security. They would negotiate, and  they would say that, rather than get that money in my paycheck now, I  want to put it into my retirement so that I know it is there for myself  and my family going forward.   They held up their end of the bargain. Unfortunately, that bargain is  [[Page S5783]]  now crumbling for too many. Imagine what it would be like to have to  cut your family budget 50 percent or 60 percent or even 70 percent and  still get the bills paid and keep food on the table.   I talked to a gentleman from Michigan named John who lives in Monroe.  He doesn't have to imagine that because he and his family are living  that every day. John is a retired diesel mechanic whose pension  benefits were slashed 72 percent. For any one of us, imagine if our  incomes were slashed 72 percent. That started for him in January 2018.    As you can only imagine, the past 2 years have been a tremendous  hardship for him and for his family. They have been using their  savings, as he said to me, to pay the bills for the past 2 years. They  have cut everything nonessential and are now cutting even the  essentials from their budget. John and Kathy, his wife, used to be able  to help out their children, including a son who is disabled, but they  no longer have the means to do that, which is something that is really  devastating for them.   John said: ``The mental strain and anxiety we are enduring because of  the loss of a guaranteed income has become increasingly difficult.''   Kathy added that it is hard for people to understand what it is like  to live on just one-quarter of the income that one used to have.   Kathy and John aren't alone. That is why we are on the floor. That is  why we are asking--demanding--that action be taken on their behalf.  Between 1 million and 1.5 million American workers and retirees are in  pension plans that are at serious risk of becoming insolvent within the  next 20 years. As well, by the end of this year, as Senator Manchin  said, more than 1,200 coal miners and their family members could lose  their healthcare coverage.   These hard-working Americans deserve better than this. Right now,  they are just waiting and waiting and waiting for the U.S. Senate to  act--for the Senate majority leader and the Republican majority to  decide it is important to act on their behalf. It has now been 83 days  since the House of Representatives passed the Rehabilitation for  Multiemployer Pensions Act--83 days. We have plenty of time to take  this up on the Senate floor. We have plenty of time to take it up.  There needs to be a sense of urgency about doing it because John and  Kathy certainly feel that sense of urgency as they are trying to pay  the bills and do what they can to support their children. They feel  that every day.   This bill is the companion legislation to what we have called the  Butch Lewis Act. Thanks to Senator Brown for introducing this important  legislation, I am proud to be a cosponsor along with many of my  colleagues. It has also been 285 days, as Senator Manchin said, since  Senators Manchin, Kaine, Warner, Brown, Jones, and Casey introduced the  American Miners Act. So we have two bills in front of us--one that has  been held up now for 285 days and one that has been held up for 83  days. We need to have action.   The American Miners Act secures retired miners' pensions and saves  their healthcare benefits. It is past time for Senate Majority Leader  McConnell to stop stalling and to take action on behalf of the folks  who did nothing more than work their whole lives, created the middle  class of this country, and believed their country and believed the  companies when they said, if they paid into pensions, they would be  there. Hard-working American families have been waiting way too long.   I have always believed that a pension was a promise. It is just plain  and simple. It is a promise, and it is a promise that deserves to be  kept. People like John, who have worked hard to earn their retirement  benefits, shouldn't have to worry about paying their power bills,  putting food on their tables, or keeping their homes. They should know  that their pensions will be there for them--the pensions they paid into  all the time they were working. They have earned them over a lifetime  of work, and those pensions are promises that need to be kept.   I urge my Republican colleagues to join us in helping to keep that  promise for John and for the hard-working Americans like him. We could  do this very quickly this week if we would come together and have a  sense of urgency about what is affecting folks who have worked hard all  of their lives, who are now retired, and who just need to know that  those pensions are going to be there for themselves and their families.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise today to pay special  tribute to Kettering University in Flint, which this year is  celebrating 100 years of educating the people of Michigan and advancing  innovation.   Let's think back to 1919. The Treaty of Versailles was signed,  bringing an end to the Great War. The 18th Amendment to the U.S.  Constitution--also known as Prohibition--was ratified by Congress. In  our State, the Michigan State Highway Department took over the State  trunk line highway system and first began putting up numbered signs.  And in Flint--the center of the automotive world--a group of  entrepreneurs launched a school to train homegrown talent for  Michigan's auto industry.   A few things have changed since 1919. We fought an even greater war,  Prohibition didn't last, and Michigan has a few more highways. Yet one  thing remains the same: Kettering University is still training the next  generation of leaders, for the auto industry and beyond.   Louis Chevrolet, David Dunbar Buick, Charles Stewart Mott, Alfred  Sloan, and Charles Kettering understood that to succeed in  manufacturing, it isn't enough for students to know what is in the  books; instead, these leaders built a school based on the idea that  knowledge must be both learned and applied. This model is still in use  at Kettering University today. Kettering's curriculum doesn't just  expose its students to the very latest in science, engineering, and  business knowledge; it also helps its students to put that knowledge to  work through experiential and cooperative educational opportunities  that turn learners into leaders.   Your record of success speaks for itself. From being named first in  the country by the Wall Street Journal for career preparation, fourth  in the Nation in producing alumni who hold patents, and first in the  Midwest for return on investments; to the Kettering University GM  Mobility Research Center, which is keeping Flint and Michigan at the  forefront of autonomous vehicle research and development; to counting  among your alumni General Motors CEO Mary T. Barra, former chairman and  CEO of Gibson Brands Henry Juszkiewicz, inventor and businessman Dean  Kamen, former CEO of Merrill Lynch Stanley O'Neal, and Old Navy CEO  Sonia Syngal; to making a real difference in the Flint community  through your $1 million Department of Justice grant for neighborhood  revitalization, your Employee Home Purchase and Renovation Assistance  Program, the transformation of University Avenue, and your support for  Flint's young people through your Young Innovators Fair, the Flint  River Watershed Coalition Green Summit, and FIRST Robotics.   Charles Kettering once said this: ``We are not at the end of our  progress but at the beginning.'' And I have no doubt that our progress  as a State and Nation will continue to be led by Kettering's students,  faculty, staff, and alumni.   Since 1919, Kettering University has been preparing students for  extraordinary futures, and I can't wait to see what your future holds.  Congratulations to Kettering University on your first 100  years.                            ____________________
