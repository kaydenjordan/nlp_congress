 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3229, which would  extend an important tool in protecting the safety of judges and their  families.   Each year, Federal judges and certain other judicial employees are  required to file financial disclosure reports which are made available  to the public. These reports serve a vital function in promoting  transparency, particularly of any potential conflicts of interest.   By their nature, however, they also disclose sensitive personal  information like a home address or family member's place of business.  In the hands of a disgruntled member of the public seeking retribution  or of an otherwise disturbed individual, this information could put  judges and their families at great risk.                                time  1645    Under current law, the Judicial Conference may redact information  from a financial disclosure form if publishing such information could  endanger the safety of the filer or a member of the filer's family.  Unless Congress acts, this redaction authority will expire on December  31 of this year. This commonsense bill simply extends the redaction  authority for 10 years.   Unfortunately, many Federal judges face threats to their safety  merely for doing their jobs, and according to the Judicial Conference,  the number of threats against them are increasing. For example, an Ohio  man recently pleaded guilty to arranging a murder-for-hire plot against  a judge; an alleged ISIS sympathizer who was attempting to learn a  judge's address was indicted a few months ago for threatening the  judge; and last year, a California man, who was already in prison, was  convicted of plotting to have the Federal judge, prosecutors, and FBI  agents killed as revenge.   Sadly, earlier this year, we also saw threats against several judges  who ruled against President Trump's Muslim ban. After the President  himself launched a verbal assault against the judges and against the  Federal judiciary more generally, the judges faced a cascade of online  threats and they required heightened security measures. Even without  such irresponsible and dangerous behavior by the President, Federal  judges regularly face threats, and this legislation is an important  tool in protecting their safety.   Although disclosure forms should only be redacted in the most extreme  and limited circumstances, the Judicial Conference has used its  redaction authority sparingly and wisely, and it should continue to  have this authority available to it when circumstances warrant its use.   I appreciate Mr. Jeffries' leadership in introducing this  legislation. I want to recognize Ranking Member Conyers for the work he  has done to champion this issue over the years as well. I thank  Chairman Goodlatte and Mr. Issa for moving this bipartisan bill  forward.
