 Mr. Speaker, there are 8 days until our military funding  runs out. Instead of funding the military, the House is kicking the can  down the road. Instead of bringing stability to our servicemembers,  House Democratic leadership is focused on a partisan impeachment  process.   Our men and women in uniform deserve better than this. They deserve  to have their mission, training, weapons, and equipment properly  funded.   However, next week, when we reach the funding deadline, we will  likely vote on a continuing resolution, a CR. A CR is not a thoughtful  approach to support our servicemembers. A CR maintains current spending  levels for the military and continues this cycle of uncertainty for our  servicemembers.   While better than a shutdown, there are real-world consequences to  simply passing a CR:   The Air Force is short 2,100 pilots. A CR does not provide the Air  Force with new funding to train new pilots to fill these positions.   A CR prevents the Army from building 4,000 housing units for its  members.   A CR forces the Navy to cancel ship maintenance periods and  undermines critical training programs.   This is a dangerous funding cycle that jeopardizes our  servicemembers' safety and their ability to protect our country.   Once again, our Federal spending process is broken, and it has gotten  us into this mess. Let's stop the partisan politics. Let's focus on  supporting our military. And let's work to fix the broken spending  process here in Washington.   Mr. Speaker, we must never allow our servicemembers and their mission  to be put at risk again.              Recognizing 100 Years of the Wisconsin Farm Bureau     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize 100 years of the  Wisconsin Farm Bureau. For a century, the Wisconsin Farm Bureau has  supported farmers in Wisconsin.   Agriculture is a Wisconsin tradition. Generations of Wisconsinites  have dedicated their life to farming and feeding our State and the  world. From milk to cheese, from sweet corn to soybeans, from  cranberries to whey, our proud, hardworking Wisconsin farmers are  there.   I thank the Wisconsin Farm Bureau for helping Wisconsin become and  remain America's dairyland.   Happy 100 years.     Congratulating University of Wisconsin Women's Hockey Team on Fifth                           National Championship     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the University  of Wisconsin women's hockey team on winning their fifth national  championship in program history.   They beat the Minnesota Gophers 2-0 to win their first national  championship in 8 years. Kristen Campbell did not give up a goal, and  it was her 11th shutout of the season. To make the victory better, we  beat our rival, Minnesota.   The Badgers' women's hockey team is visiting my office and the White  House to celebrate this success.   Congrats to the University of Wisconsin women's hockey team for their  hard-earned victory. The Badger State is proud of them. On, Wisconsin.                            ____________________
