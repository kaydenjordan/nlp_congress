 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 15 minutes.    Thank you.   Mr. President, later this afternoon, I believe, we will be voting on  one of the more important foreign policy issues that we have voted on  in a very long time. This, of course, deals with the U.S. involvement  in the war in Yemen.   In March of 2015, under the leadership of Muhammad bin Salman, who  was then the Saudi Defense Minister and is now, of course, the Crown  Prince, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab  [[Page S7152]]  Emirates intervened in Yemen's ongoing civil war. As a result of that  Saudi intervention, Yemen is now experiencing the worst humanitarian  disaster in the world.   It is absolutely imperative that we call attention to the inhumane  and horrific situation that is now impacting the people of Yemen, a  small nation of 28 million people, one of the poorest countries on  Earth.   According to the United Nations, Yemen is at risk of the most severe  famine in more than 100 years, with some 14 million people--about half  of that country's population--facing starvation. Already, as a result  of this terrible war, according to the Save the Children organization,  some 85,000 children in Yemen have starved to death over the last  several years. Let me repeat that. According to the Save the Children  organization, some 85,000 children in Yemen have already starved to  death over the last several years, and millions more face starvation if  the war continues. That is what we are looking at today.   In addition, Yemen is currently experiencing the worst cholera  outbreak in the world, with as many as 10,000 new cases erupting every  week, according to the World Health Organization. As you know, cholera  is a disease spread by infected water that causes severe diarrhea and  dehydration and will only accelerate the death rate as it weakens the  ability of people to resist disease. The cholera outbreak in Yemen has  occurred because Saudi bombs have destroyed Yemen's water  infrastructure, and people there are no longer able to access clean  water.   The fact is that the United States, with relatively little media  attention, has been Saudi Arabia's partner in this horrific war. We  have been providing the bombs that the Saudi-led coalition is using. We  have been refueling their planes before they drop those bombs. We have  been assisting with intelligence. In too many cases, our weapons are  being used to kill civilians.   In August, as many will remember, it was an American-made bomb that  obliterated a school bus full of young boys, killing dozens and  wounding many more. A CNN report found evidence that American weapons  have been used in a string of such deadly attacks on civilians since  the war began. According to the independent monitoring group, Yemen  Data Project, between March of 2015 and March of 2018, more than 30  percent of the Saudi-led coalition's targets have been nonmilitary.   A few weeks ago, I met with several very brave human rights activists  from Yemen, urging Congress to put a stop to this war. They told me  clearly that when Yemenis see ``Made in USA'' on the bombs that are  killing them, it tells them that it is the United States of America  that is actively involved in this war. That is the sad truth. That is a  truth we have to finally deal with, and I hope deal with effectively  later this afternoon.   The message that the Senate should be sending to the Saudi Government  and to the whole world is that we will not continue to support a  catastrophic war led by a despotic regime that has a dangerous,  destructive, and irresponsible military policy. No more--enough death,  enough killing, enough destruction.   Above and beyond the humanitarian crisis--the worst in the world  right now, destroying a small, poor country--that war has been a  disaster for our national security and the national security of our  allies. The administration defends our engagement in Yemen by  overstating Iranian support for the Houthi rebels. While Iran's support  for Houthis is of serious concern for all of us--and I do not minimize  that--the fact is that the relationship has only been strengthened with  the intensification of the war. The war is creating the very problem  this administration claims to want to solve.   The war in Yemen is also undermining the broader effort against  violent extremists. A 2016 State Department report found that the  conflict had helped al-Qaida and the Islamic State's Yemen branch  ``deepen their inroads across much of the country.'' As the head of the  International Rescue Committee, former British Foreign Minister David  Miliband said in a recent interview: ``The winners are the extremist  groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS.'' Just last week, the Wall Street  Journal reported: ``Nearly two years after being driven from its  stronghold in Yemen, one of al Qaeda's most dangerous franchises has  entrenched itself in the country's hinterlands as a devastating war  creates the conditions for its comeback.''    So this war is, without dispute, a horrific humanitarian crisis, but  it is also a strategic disaster, benefiting terrorist groups like al- Qaida and ISIS.   Further, importantly, let us not forget that Saudi Arabia is an  undemocratic monarchy controlled by one family. Sometimes we kind of  pass that over. It is controlled by one family--the Saudi family. In a  2017 report by the conservative Cato Institute, Saudi Arabia, our ally  in this terrible war in Yemen, was ranked 149 out of 159 countries in  terms of freedom and human rights. That is our ally. That is the  country with which we are putting our credibility on the line. For  decades, as I think most Members of the Senate know, the Saudis have  funded schools, mosques, and preachers who promote an extreme form of  Islam known as Wahhabism.   In Saudi Arabia today, women are not second-class citizens; they are  third-class citizens. Women still need the permission of a male  guardian to go to school or to get a job. They have to follow a strict  dress code and can be stoned to death for adultery or flogged for  spending time in the company of a man who is not their relative.   Earlier this year, Saudi activist Loujain al-Hathloul, a leader in  the fight for women's rights, was kidnapped from Abu Dhabi and forced  to return to her country. She is currently being held without charges.  The same is true of many Saudi political activists.   Sadly, President Trump continues to proclaim his love and affection  for the Saudi regime. The brutality and lawlessness of the Saudi  regime, as everybody in this country now knows, was made clear to the  entire world with the murder of the dissident Saudi journalist, Jamal  Khashoggi, in the Saudi consulate in Turkey--right in their own  consulate. Pathetically, as part of his continuing respect for  authoritarian regimes--whether it is Putin or Russia or other regimes  around the world--President Trump rejected the findings of the CIA's  assessment that the Saudi Crown Prince was responsible for that murder.  When given a choice between believing a despotic ruler in Saudi Arabia  or our own Central Intelligence Agency, sadly, the President of the  United States sided with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.   Lastly, let me raise an issue that many of my conservative friends-- Mike Lee, Rand Paul, and others--have been raising, which is an  important issue that I hope progressives pay attention to, which is  that this war in Saudi Arabia was not authorized by the U.S. Congress.  It was not voted on by the U.S. Congress and, therefore, is  unconstitutional. Let us not forget that the Founding Fathers of this  country put the awesome responsibility of war and peace into the hands  of the Congress, not the President of the United States--not a  Democratic President or a Republican President. Article I of the  Constitution clearly States that it is Congress, not the President,  that has the power to declare war.   The time is long overdue for Congress to take back that  responsibility, which it has abdicated under Democratic and Republican  leaderships.   If the Members of the House and the Senate want to go to war in  Yemen, vote to go to war in Yemen. Don't let the President of the  United States do it on his own.   Later this afternoon, as I understand it, there will be a resolution  coming before this body as to whether we proceed to vote on ending U.S.  involvement in the Saudi-led war. That amendment is cosponsored by my  friends Senator Lee of Utah, Senator Murphy of Connecticut, and many,  many others. This is an enormously important vote. This is a vote that  says to the world: We are going to end the horrific humanitarian  disaster that is killing tens of thousands of defenseless children in  Yemen. It is a vote which says that we are going to stand for American  values. It is a vote which says that the time is now to tell Saudi  Arabia that we are not continuing to partner with them in this horrific  crisis.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 1013 of the  Department of State Authorization Act, fiscal years 1984 and 1985, and  in accordance with the provisions of Section 601(b) of the  International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976,  I move to discharge S.J. Res. 54 from the Committee on Foreign  Relations.    I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes.    Mr. President, let me thank Senator Lee for his  leadership on this resolution. At a time when many bemoan the lack of  bipartisanship, we are seeing it here--people coming together around an  issue of enormous concern. I want to thank Senator Lee and Senator  Chris Murphy of Connecticut, also one of the leaders in this effort,  and the other 17 cosponsors of this resolution.   In one-half hour or so, we are going to be casting one of the most  important foreign policy votes that we have cast in recent years. It is  a vote to demand that the humanitarian crisis in Yemen be addressed. It  is a vote that will tell the despotic dictatorship in Saudi Arabia that  we will no longer be part of their destructive military adventurism. It  is a vote, as Senator Lee just mentioned, that says that the Senate  respects the Constitution of the United States and understands that the  issue of war-making--of going to war, putting our young men and women's  lives at stake--is something determined by the Congress, not the  President of the United States. It is a congressional decision, not a  Presidential decision, whether that President is a Democrat or a  Republican.    In March of 2015, under the leadership of Muhammed bin Salman--then  Saudi Defense Minister and now the Crown Prince--Saudi Arabia and the  United Arab Emirates intervened in Yemen's ongoing civil war.   Let's be clear. Yemen has been a poor and struggling country for many  years, but as a result of the Saudi-led intervention, Yemen is now  experiencing the worst humanitarian disaster in the entire world.   In one of the poorest countries on Earth, as a result of this war-- according to the Save the Children organization--some 85,000 children  have already starved to death and millions more face death, face  starvation, if this war continues.   According to the United Nations, Yemen is at risk of the most severe  famine in more than 100 years, with some 14 million people facing  starvation.   Further, Yemen is currently experiencing the worst cholera outbreak  in the world, with as many as 10,000 new cases developing every week,  according to the World Health Organization. Cholera is a disease spread  by infected water that causes severe diarrhea and dehydration and will  only accelerate the death rate and the misery in that country. The  cholera outbreak, as it happens, has occurred because Saudi bombs have  destroyed Yemen's water infrastructure, and people are no longer able  to access clean water.   The fact is that the United States, with limited media attention, has  been Saudi Arabia's partner in this horrific war. We have been  providing the bombs that the Saudi-led coalition is using. We have been  refueling their planes before they drop those bombs. We have been  assisting with intelligence.   In too many cases, our weapons are used to kill civilians. As is now  well known, in August there was an American-made bomb that obliterated  a schoolbus full of young boys, killing dozens and wounding many more.  A CNN report found evidence that American weapons have been used in a  string of such deadly attacks on civilians since the war began.  According to the independent monitoring group Yemen Data Project,  between March 2015 and March 2018, more than 30 percent of the Saudi- led coalition's targets have been nonmilitary.   A few weeks ago, I met with some brave human rights activists from  Yemen, and they are urging Congress to put a stop to this war. They  told me that when Yemenis see ``Made in U.S.A.'' on the bombs that are  killing them, it tells them that the U.S.A. is responsible for this  war, and that is the sad truth. This is not the message the United  States of America should be sending to the world.   The bottom line is that the United States should not be supporting a  catastrophic war led by a despotic regime with a dangerous and  irresponsible military policy. Above and beyond the humanitarian  crisis, this war has been a disaster for our national security and the  security of our allies.   The administration defends our engagement in Yemen by overstating  Iranian support for the Houthi rebels. While Iran's support for Houthis  is of serious concern to all of us, the fact is that the relationship  between Iran and the Houthis has only been strengthened with the  intensification of this war. The war is creating the very problem the  administration claims to want to solve. The war is also undermining the  broader effort against violent extremists. A 2016 State Department  report found that the conflict had helped al-Qaida and the Islamic  State's Yemen branch ``deepen their inroads across much of the  country.''   This war is both a humanitarian disaster and a strategic disaster in  our fight against international terrorism. Further, let's never forget  that Saudi Arabia is an undemocratic monarchy controlled by one  family--the Saud family.   In a 2017 report by the conservative Cato Institute, Saudi Arabia was  ranked 149th out of 159 countries in terms of freedom and human rights.  For decades, the Saudis have funded schools, mosques, and preachers who  promote an extreme form of Islam called Wahabbism. In Saudi Arabia  today, women are treated as third-class citizens. Women still need the  permission of a male guardian to go to school or to get a job, have to  follow a strict dress code, and can be stoned to death for adultery or  flogged for spending time in the company of a man who is not their  relative. Earlier this year, Saudi activist Loujain al-Hathloul--a  leader in the fight for women's rights--was kidnapped from Abu Dhabi  and forced to return to Saudi Arabia. She is currently being held  without charges. The same is true of many other Saudi political  activists.   Sadly, President Trump continues to proclaim his love and affection  for the Saudi regime. The brutality and lawlessness of that regime was  made clear to the whole world with the murder of dissident Saudi  journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Turkey.  Pathetically, as part of his continuing respect for authoritarian  regimes around the world, President Trump rejected the findings of the  CIA's assessment that the Saudi Crown Prince was responsible for that  murder.   Finally, an issue that has long been the concern of many of us--and  Senator Lee touched on that very thoughtfully--it is the Congress, not  the President of the United States, who, under our Constitution, has  war-making responsibility. For too long, under Democratic and  Republican Presidents, we have abdicated that responsibility.   Today, I say to my conservative friends: Respect the Constitution.  Reclaim Congress's rightful role on the issues of war and peace.  Congress has not authorized the war in Yemen; therefore, that war is  unconstitutional, and that must change and must change now.   In a few minutes, we are going to undertake a very important vote,  and I hope that all of my colleagues--Democrats, Republicans,  Independents--will vote to discharge this resolution.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President today, I would like to recognize an  extraordinary Vermonter, Enid Wonnacott, on her more than 30 years as  executive director of the Northeast Organic Farming Association of  Vermont, NOFA-VT. For three decades, Enid has worked tirelessly to  build the organic agriculture movement and develop a sustainable,  resilient, and accessible food system in our State of Vermont and  across the United States.   During Enid's tenure at NOFA-VT, Vermont has grown from 50 organic  farms to more than 700, and many of those farmers, as well as countless  consumers and agricultural advocates, have benefitted greatly from  technical assistance and training provided by NOFA-VT under Enid's  guidance.   Recognizing that those farmers need good market opportunities to be  viable businesses, Enid helped foster the growth of farmers' markets,  community supported agriculture, and initiatives for institutions to  procure locally grown food. She helped develop Vermont's farm-to-school  program that provides students with healthy food and connects them to  local agriculture through educational programming. I especially  appreciate Enid's long-held belief, which I share, that healthy local  food should be accessible to all people regardless of income, and I  applaud NOFA-VT's efforts to make good food affordable through  subsidized farmers' market coupons, CSA shares, and more.    Enid has worked on many Federal and State policies to promote  sustainable agriculture. She was instrumental in developing Federal  organic standards and was an early advocate for agricultural systems  whereby farmers enhance the quality of the soil and environment while  they also produce healthy food. Enid has been mentor to many  agriculture and food system leaders throughout the State and region and  has served on the Vermont Sustainable Agriculture Council. It should  come as no surprise to anyone who knows her, Enid received the Vermont  Agriculture Hall of Fame Award this year for her many contributions to  our State.   Of course, Enid did not do these things alone. First, she has an  excellent and committed staff, but perhaps even more important, she has  the unwavering support of her husband Harry Frank and their wonderful  children, Lila and Eli. Her family is a large part of Enid's success,  including the countless hours they spent working alongside her at NOFA  events, more than a few of which involved staffing a portable, wood- fired pizza hearth.   I am not only enormously grateful for al of Enid's many contributions  over the years, but I am also proud to count her as a good friend. At a  time when there is a growing recognition of the profound impact  agriculture and food have on our health and the health of the planet,  it is heartening to know that we have people like Enid Wonnacott  fighting for a more environmentally sound and fundamentally just food  system.                            ____________________
