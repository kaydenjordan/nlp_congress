 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 72) expressing the sense of  Congress that child safety is the first priority of custody and  visitation adjudications, and that State courts should improve  adjudications of custody where family violence is alleged, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.   The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:                              H. Con. Res. 72         Whereas approximately 15 million children are exposed each       year to domestic violence and/or child abuse, which are often       linked;        Whereas child sexual abuse is significantly under-      documented, and under-addressed in the legal system;        Whereas child abuse is a major public health issue in the       United States, with total lifetime estimated financial costs       associated with just one year of confirmed cases of child       maltreatment (including physical abuse, sexual abuse,       psychological abuse and neglect) amounting to approximately       $124 billion;        Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention, federally launched, funded and tracked       longitudinal research into ``adverse childhood experiences''       (the ACEs study) has shown that ``children who experience       abuse and neglect are also at increased risk for adverse       health effects and certain chronic diseases as adults,       including heart disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, liver       disease, obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and       high levels of C-reactive protein'';        Whereas research confirms that allegations of domestic       violence, child abuse, and child sexual abuse are often       discounted when raised in child custody litigation;        Whereas research shows that abusive parents are often       granted custody or unprotected parenting time by courts,       placing children at ongoing risk;        Whereas research confirms that a child's risk of abuse       increases after a perpetrator of domestic violence separates       from a domestic partner, even when the perpetrator has not       previously abused the child;        Whereas researchers have documented a minimum of 653       children murdered in the United States since 2008 by a parent       involved in a divorce, separation, custody, visitation, or       child support proceeding, often after access was provided by       family courts over the objections of a protective parent;        Whereas scientifically unsound theories are frequently       applied to reject parents' and children's reports of abuse;        Whereas in cases involving allegations of family violence       courts should rely on the assistance of third-party       professionals only when they possess the proper experience or       expertise for assessing family violence and trauma, and apply       scientifically sound and evidence-based theories;        Whereas most States lack standards defining required       expertise and experience for court-affiliated or appointed       fee-paid professionals in custody litigation or the required       contents of custody-related expert reports; and        Whereas custody litigation involving abuse allegations is       sometimes prohibitively expensive, resulting in parental       bankruptcy, as a result of court-mandated payments to       appointed fee-paid professionals, in addition to attorneys'       fees: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate       concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--        (1) child safety is the first priority of custody and       parenting adjudications, and courts should resolve safety       risks and claims of family violence first, as a fundamental       consideration, before assessing other best interest factors;        (2) all evidence admitted in custody and parenting       adjudications should be subject to evidentiary admissibility       standards;        (3) evidence from court-affiliated or appointed fee-paid       professionals regarding adult or child abuse allegations in       custody cases should be admitted only when the professional       possesses documented expertise and experience in the relevant       types of abuse, trauma, and the behaviors of victims and       perpetrators;        (4) States should define required standards of expertise       and experience for appointed fee-paid professionals who       provide evidence to the court on abuse, trauma and behaviors       of victims and perpetrators, should specify requirements for       the contents of such professional reports, and should require       courts to find that any appointed professionals meet those       standards;        (5) States should consider models under which court-      appointed professionals are paid directly by the courts, with       potential reimbursement by the parties after due       consideration of the parties' financial circumstances; and  [[Page H8845]]         (6) Congress should schedule hearings on family courts'       practices with regard to the objective, fair, and unbiased       adjudication of children's safety and civil rights.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 72, currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased we are voting today on this resolution,  which expresses the sense of Congress that child safety should be the  top priority of custody and visitation adjudications, and that State  courts should improve adjudications of custody where family violence is  alleged.   Custody adjudications are especially difficult cases, fraught with  emotion and complex relationships. States must ensure that the judges  presiding over these cases are trained to understand these dynamics and  apply appropriate evidentiary standards to parties' evidence.   Most importantly, States should ensure that in these disputes,  children's safety comes first.   We have seen tragedies happen throughout the United States where the  courts failed the children involved in custody disputes. Over the past  decade, the Center for Judicial Excellence has documented 653 child  homicides across the United States by a parent involved in a conflict  related to divorce, separation, custody, visitation, or child support.   Last year, Ana Estevez's 5-year-old son, Piqui, was murdered by her  ex-husband. Despite her efforts to obtain sole custody of Piqui due to  her ex-husband's history of abuse, her plea was rejected.   Her estranged husband picked up Piqui, as part of their joint custody  arrangement, and took him to Disneyland. That was the last time Ms.  Estevez saw her son.   His body was found 2 months later, and her estranged husband  eventually confessed to the murder, a tragedy that should never have  happened.   Today, we take a step in expressing to States that they must pay  special attention to these cases. We hope States will heed this  resolution and resolve to evaluate their family court systems and  implement measures to put child safety first.   I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) for bringing this  resolution before us. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to  close.    Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank the gentlewoman  for her comments and for her hard work on this resolution. I also want  to thank Chairman Sessions for bringing this forward today.   I want to encourage all of my colleagues here to vote in the  affirmative for H. Con. Res. 72.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6580) to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to  provide for expedited naturalization processes for the alien spouses of  first responders who die as a result of their employment, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6580         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Kerrie Orozco First       Responders Family Support Act''.       SEC. 2. NATURALIZATION FOR IMMEDIATE RELATIVES OF FIRST                     RESPONDERS.         Section 319 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8       U.S.C. 1430) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(f) Immediate Relatives of First Responders.--        ``(1) In general.--Any person who is the surviving spouse,       child, or parent of a United States citizen, whose citizen       spouse, parent, or child dies as a result of injury or       disease incurred in or aggravated by employment as a first       responder, and who, in the case of a surviving spouse, was       living in marital union with the citizen spouse at the time       of his death, may be naturalized upon compliance with all the       requirements of this title, except that no prior residence or       specified physical presence within the United States shall be       required.        ``(2) Definition.--For purposes of this subsection, the       term `first responder' means Federal, State, and local       government fire, law enforcement, and emergency response       personnel.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 6580, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon), my home State.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6580, the Kerrie Orozco First  Responders Family Support Act. This legislation is short, but it will  have an immense impact on the lives of close family members of certain  first responders who die as a result of injury and illness occurring in  the line of duty.   The Immigration and Nationality Act currently requires that, in order  to naturalize and become a United States citizen, a lawful permanent  resident must reside continuously in the United States for 5 years  prior to naturalization. For spouses, that residency requirement is 3  years. H.R. 6580 waives that residency requirement altogether for the  surviving spouse, child, or parent of a Federal, State, or local first  responder who dies as a result of injury or illness incurred during  line of duty activities as a first responder.   There is precedent in immigration law for such a waiver. In fact, the  language of H.R. 6580 is patterned on the current law, which waives the  same residency requirements for the surviving spouse, child, or parent  of a military servicemember killed while in Active-Duty service in the  Armed Forces.   First responders routinely place their lives in peril to help those  of us who are in need, and when they are killed or injured carrying out  their duties, we owe their families a deep debt of gratitude. H.R. 6580  is a small price to pay in return for the sacrifice that first  responders make every day.   The legislation was named after Kerrie Orozco, an Omaha, Nebraska,  police officer, killed while serving an arrest warrant on May 20, 2015.  At the time of Officer Orozco's death, her husband was in the process  of becoming a U.S. citizen. H.R. 6580 will speed up that process and  make sure other surviving immediate relatives in the same situation are  afforded the same opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the work of the gentleman from Nebraska  (Mr. Bacon) on this important piece of legislation.   I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1872) to promote access for United States officials,  journalists, and other citizens to Tibetan areas of the People's  Republic of China, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1872         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Reciprocal Access to Tibet       Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The Government of the People's Republic of China does       not grant United States diplomats and other officials,       journalists, and other citizens access to China on a basis       that is reciprocal to the access that the Government of the       United States grants Chinese diplomats and other officials,       journalists, and citizens.        (2) The Government of China imposes greater restrictions on       travel to Tibetan areas than to other areas of China.        (3) Officials of China have stated that Tibet is open to       foreign visitors.        (4) The Government of China is promoting tourism in Tibetan       areas, and at the Sixth Tibet Work Forum in August 2015,       Premier Li Keqiang called for Tibet to build ``major world       tourism destinations''.        (5) The Government of China requires foreigners to obtain       permission from the Tibet Foreign and Overseas Affairs Office       or from the Tibet Tourism Bureau to enter the Tibet       Autonomous Region, a restriction that is not imposed on       travel to any other provincial-level jurisdiction in China.        (6) The Department of State reports that--        (A) officials of the Government of the United States       submitted 39 requests for diplomatic access to the Tibet       Autonomous Region between May 2011 and July 2015, but only       four were granted; and        (B) when such requests are granted, diplomatic personnel       are closely supervised and given few opportunities to meet       local residents not approved by authorities.        (7) The Government of China delayed United States consular       access for more than 48 hours after an October 28, 2013, bus       crash in the Tibet Autonomous Region, in which three citizens       of the United States died and more than a dozen others, all       from Walnut, California, were injured, undermining the       ability of the Government of the United States to provide       consular services to the victims and their families, and       failing to meet China's obligations under the Convention on       Consular Relations, done at Vienna April 24, 1963 (21 UST       77).        (8) Following a 2015 earthquake that trapped dozens of       citizens of the United States in the Tibet Autonomous Region,       the United States Consulate General in Chengdu faced       significant challenges in providing emergency consular       assistance due to a lack of consular access.        (9) The Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2015       of the Department of State stated ``With the exception of a       few highly controlled trips, the Chinese government also       denied multiple requests by foreign diplomats for permission       to visit the TAR.''.        (10) Tibetan-Americans, attempting to visit their homeland,       report having to undergo a discriminatory visa application       process, different from what is typically required, at the       Chinese embassy and consulates in the United States, and       often find their requests to travel denied.        (11) The Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016       of the Department of State stated ``The few visits to the TAR       by diplomats and journalists that were allowed were tightly       controlled by local authorities.''.        (12) A September 2016 article in the Washington Post       reported that ``The Tibet Autonomous Region . . . is harder       to visit as a journalist than North Korea.''.        (13) The Government of China has failed to respond       positively to requests from the Government of the United       States to open a consulate in Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region.        (14) The Foreign Correspondents Club of China reports       that--        (A) 2008 rules prevent foreign reporters from visiting the       Tibet Autonomous Region without prior permission from the       Government of such Region;        (B) such permission has only rarely been granted; and        (C) although the 2008 rules allow journalists to travel       freely in other parts of China, Tibetan areas outside such       Region remain ``effectively off-limits to foreign       reporters''.        (15) The Department of State reports that in addition to       having to obtain permission to enter the Tibet Autonomous       Region, foreign tourists--        (A) must be accompanied at all times by a government-      designated tour guide;        (B) are rarely granted permission to enter the region by       road;        (C) are largely barred from visiting around the March       anniversary of a 1959 Tibetan uprising; and        (D) are banned from visiting the area where Larung Gar, the       world's largest center for the study of Tibetan Buddhism, and       the site of a large-scale campaign to expel students and       demolish living quarters, is located.        (16) Foreign visitors also face restrictions in their       ability to travel freely in Tibetan areas outside the Tibet       Autonomous Region.        (17) The Government of the United States generally allows       journalists and other citizens of China to travel freely       within the United States. The Government of the United States       requires diplomats from China to notify the Department of       State of their travel plans, and in certain situations, the       Government of the United States requires such diplomats to       obtain approval from the Department of State before travel.       However, where approval is required, it is almost always       granted expeditiously.        (18) The United States regularly grants visas to Chinese       diplomats and other officials, scholars, and others who       travel to the United States to discuss, promote, and display       the perspective of the Government of China on the situation       in Tibetan areas, even as the Government of China restricts       the ability of citizens of the United States to travel to       Tibetan areas to gain their own perspective.        (19) Chinese diplomats based in the United States generally       avail themselves of the freedom to travel to United States       cities and lobby city councils, mayors, and governors to       refrain from passing resolutions, issuing proclamations, or       making statements of concern on Tibet.        (20) The Government of China characterizes statements made       by officials of the United States about the situation in       Tibetan areas as inappropriate interference in the internal       affairs of China.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--        (A) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       the Judiciary of the Senate; and        (B) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on       the Judiciary of the House of Representatives.        (2) Tibetan areas.--The term ``Tibetan areas'' includes--        (A) the Tibet Autonomous Region; and        (B) the areas that the Chinese Government designates as       Tibetan Autonomous, as follows:        (i) Kanlho (Gannan) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and Pari       (Tianzhu) Tibetan Autonomous County located in Gansu       Province.        (ii) Golog (Guoluo) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Malho       (Huangnan) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Tsojang (Haibei)       Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Tsolho (Hainan) Tibetan       Autonomous Prefecture, Tsonub (Haixi) Mongolian and Tibetan       Autonomous Prefecture, and Yulshul (Yushu) Tibetan Autonomous       Prefecture, located in Qinghai Province.        (iii) Garze (Ganzi) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Ngawa       (Aba) Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, and Muli       (Mili) Tibetan Autonomous County, located in Sichuan       Province.        (iv) Dechen (Diqing) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, located       in Yunnan Province.       SEC. 4. ANNUAL REPORT ON ACCESS TO TIBETAN AREAS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for the       following five years, the Secretary of State shall submit to       the appropriate congressional committees, and make available       to the public on the website of the Department of State, a       report that includes an assessment of the level of access       Chinese authorities granted diplomats and other officials,       journalists, and tourists from the United States to Tibetan       areas, including--        (1) a comparison with the level of access granted to other       areas of China;        (2) a comparison between the levels of access granted to       Tibetan and non-Tibetan areas in relevant provinces;        (3) a comparison of the level of access in the reporting       year and the previous reporting year; and        (4) a description of the required permits and other       measures that impede the freedom to travel in Tibetan areas.        (b) Consolidation.--After the issuance of the first report       required by subsection (a),  [[Page H8850]]       the Secretary of State is authorized to incorporate       subsequent reports required by subsection (a) into other       publicly available, annual reports produced by the Department       of State, provided they are submitted to the appropriate       congressional committees in a manner specifying that they are       being submitted in fulfillment of the requirements of this       Act.       SEC. 5. INADMISSIBILITY OF CERTAIN ALIENS.         (a) Ineligibility for Visas.--No individual whom the       Secretary of State has determined to be substantially       involved in the formulation or execution of policies related       to access for foreigners to Tibetan areas may be eligible to       receive a visa to enter the United States or be admitted to       the United States if the Secretary of State determines that--        (1)(A) the requirement for specific official permission for       foreigners to enter the Tibetan Autonomous Region remains in       effect; or        (B) such requirement has been replaced by a regulation that       has a similar effect and requires foreign travelers to gain a       level of permission to enter the Tibet Autonomous Region that       is not required for travel to other provinces in China; and        (2) restrictions on travel by diplomats and other       officials, journalists, and citizens of the United States to       areas designated as ``Tibetan Autonomous'' in the provinces       of Sichuan, Qinghai, Yunnan, and Gansu of China are greater       than any restrictions on travel by such officials and       citizens to areas in such provinces that are not so       designated.        (b) Current Visas Revoked.--The Secretary of State shall       revoke, in accordance with section 221(i) of the Immigration       and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1201(i)), the visa or other       documentation to enter or be present in the United States       issued for an alien who would be ineligible to receive such a       visa or documentation under subsection (a).        (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than one year after the       date of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter       for the following five years, the Secretary of State shall       provide to the appropriate congressional committees a report       identifying the individuals who have had visas denied or       revoked pursuant to this section during the preceding year       and, to the extent practicable, a list of Chinese officials       who were substantially involved in the formulation or       execution of policies to restrict access of United States       diplomats and other officials, journalists, and citizens of       the United States to Tibetan areas. The report required by       this subsection shall be submitted in unclassified form, but       may include a classified annex.        (d) Waiver for National Interest.--        (1) In general.--The Secretary of State may waive the       application of subsection (a) or (b) in the case of an alien       if the Secretary determines that such a waiver--        (A) is necessary to permit the United States to comply with       the Agreement Regarding the Headquarters of the United       Nations, signed at Lake Success June 26, 1947, and entered       into force November 21, 1947 (TIAS 1676), or any other       applicable international obligation of the United States; or        (B) is in the national interest of the United States.        (2) Notification.--Upon granting a waiver under paragraph       (1), the Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate       congressional committees a document detailing the evidence       and justification for the necessity of such waiver,       including, if such waiver is granted pursuant to paragraph       (1)(B), how such waiver relates to the national interest of       the United States.       SEC. 6. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State,       when granting diplomats and other officials from China access       to parts of the United States, including consular access,       should take into account the extent to which the Government       of China grants diplomats and other officials from the United       States access to parts of China, including the level of       access afforded to such diplomats and other officials to       Tibetan areas.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on H.R. 1872, currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1872, the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018,  addresses an issue of longstanding and increasing concern regarding  China's treatment of Tibetans living in the Tibet Autonomous Region,  also known as TAR, and other Tibetan areas controlled by China.   In 1950, the Chinese People's Liberation Army went into Tibet in  order to establish control over the region. In the years since then, as  noted by the U.S. Department of State, the Chinese Government has  ``imposed severe restrictions on Tibetans' ability to exercise their  human rights and fundamental freedoms.'' Such restrictions occur with  regard to religious practice, freedom of travel, freedom to practice  cultural and language preferences, and other aspects of everyday life.   In addition, the Chinese Government routinely engages in human rights  abuses, such as extrajudicial killings, torture, and arbitrary arrest.  In fact, the Chinese Government's actions are so severe that, in recent  years, over 150 Tibetans have self-immolated in a last-ditch effort to  get the rest of the world to focus on this problem.   In order to prevent documentation of the religious freedom  restrictions and other human rights abuses to the outside world, the  Government of China has severely limited access by foreign nationals to  these Tibetan regions. Such limitations prevent access to U.S.  officials seeking diplomatic and consular access, journalists, human  rights workers, and even tourists. When rare access is granted,  activities are closely monitored by the PRC and information  dissemination is restricted.   Matteo Mecacci, the president of the International Campaign for  Tibet, has stated that the Chinese leadership is seeking to enforce  complete isolation of Tibet, often described as being worse than in  North Korea, where at least some foreign media are based. Independent  international observers are shut out of Tibet or allowed to visit only  under strictly controlled circumstances, while numerous delegations of  party officials face no obstacles in traveling to Western democracies  to spread their propaganda.   In fact, travel by Chinese nationals, including those with direct and  substantial involvement in the formulation of policies to restrict  access to Tibet, is routinely allowed by governments all over the  world, including the United States. During fiscal year 2017, for  instance, nearly 1.5 million tourist visas were issued by the United  States to Chinese nationals. Those visas are valid for 10 years, during  which the Chinese nationals can visit the United States multiple times.  During that same period, the United States issued nearly 4,500  diplomatic visas to Chinese officials.   H.R. 1872 prohibits an individual who is ``substantially involved in  the formulation or execution of policies related to access for  foreigners to Tibetan areas'' from being granted a U.S. visa if the  Secretary determines that: one, the requirement for specific official  permission for foreigners to enter the Tibet Autonomous Region remains  in effect; or, two, such requirement has been replaced by a regulation  that has a similar effect and requires foreign travelers to gain a  level of permission to enter the Tibet Autonomous Region that is not  required for travel to other provinces in China; and, three,  restrictions on travel by officials, journalists, and citizens of the  United States to areas designated as ``Tibetan Autonomous'' in the  provinces of Sichuan, Qinghai, Yunnan, Gansu of China are greater than  any restrictions on travel by such officials and citizens to areas in  such provinces that are not so designated. Any visas currently held by  such individuals will be revoked under the bill.   The bill then requires the State Department to report annually to the  House and Senate Judiciary Committees as well as the House Foreign  Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the  number of actions taken regarding visas pursuant to this legislation.   According to the State Department, in recent years, there have been  very small inroads made with regard to access to the Tibetan areas. And  while some have expressed the concern that maybe this bill could make  the Chinese Government roll back some of those inroads, moving this  bill is the right thing to do. It is time that Congress takes a stand  with regard to access by foreign nationals to the Tibetan regions.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman McGovern for his work on  this issue.   I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.

Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee regarding H.R. 1872, the Reciprocal       Access to Tibet Act, and for considering our input during       your markup of the bill. I agree that the Foreign Affairs       Committee may be discharged from further consideration of       that measure, so that it may proceed expeditiously to the       House floor.        I am writing to confirm our mutual understanding that       forgoing further action on this measure does not in any way       diminish, alter, or prejudice the jurisdiction of the       Committee on Foreign Affairs, its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this bill or similar legislation, or its right to seek an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this bill.        I ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter       be included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of H.R. 1872.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                 Washington, DC, September 20, 2018.      Hon. Edward R. Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Royce: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on the Judiciary and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 1872, the ``Reciprocal Access       to Tibet Act,'' so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to       the House floor.        I agree that your foregoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 1872 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the minority leader for her  comments on this issue and strong bipartisan support for human rights,  not only in Tibet but all over the globe. Really, this is a great  moment, I think, for this body.   I will repeat again that it is time that Congress takes a stand with  regard to access by foreign nationals to the Tibetan regions. Again, I  want to thank Congressman McGovern for his work on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1872, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
