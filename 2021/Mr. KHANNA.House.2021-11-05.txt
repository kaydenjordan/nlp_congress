 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, as a progressive, I rise today to say that our party  must unify, and we must vote ``yes'' today on both the rule and the  bipartisan infrastructure bill.   Now, I know there is all this jargon about rule and BBB and BIF, but  really, to me, this is very simple. The question is: Do you trust the  President?   I trust President Biden. I trust that President Biden cares about the  working class. And for 40 years, the working class has not had any  support. On the other side, for 4 years under Trump, they gave tax cuts  to the rich. President Biden wants to give money to working families in  the child allowance. He wants to give them a tax cut. He wants to make  sure they can pay for childcare. And he understands the working class  experience.   We will unify as a party. We will vote ``yes'' tonight. We will  deliver. And this President is going to make history by finally looking  out for the working class and the middle class in this country.
