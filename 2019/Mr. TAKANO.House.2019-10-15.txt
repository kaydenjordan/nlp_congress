 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2385) to permit the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to  establish a grant program to conduct cemetery research and produce  educational materials for the Veterans Legacy Program, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2385         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. GRANTS FOR CEMETERY RESEARCH AND THE PRODUCTION OF                     EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS.         (a) Grants Authorized.--        (1) In general.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may       establish a grant program to conduct cemetery research and       produce educational materials for the Veterans Legacy       Program.        (2) Eligible recipients.--The Secretary may award a grant       under this section to any of the following entities:        (A) An institution of higher learning.        (B) A local education agency.        (C) A non-profit entity that the Secretary determines has a       demonstrated history of community engagement.        (D) Another recipient the Secretary determines to be       appropriate.        (3) Use of funds.--A recipient of a grant under this       section may use the grant amount to--        (A) conduct research related to national, State, or Tribal       veterans' cemeteries;        (B) produce education materials that teach about the       history of veterans interred in national, State, or Tribal       veterans' cemeteries; and        (C) promote community engagement with the histories of       veterans interred in national, State, or Tribal veterans'       cemeteries.        (4) Maximum amount.--A grant awarded under this section may       not exceed $500,000.        (b) Regulations.--If the Secretary establishes a grant       program under this section, the Secretary shall prescribe       regulations regarding--        (1) the evaluation of applications for grants under the       program; and        (2) administration of the program.        (c) Report Required.--Not later than two years after the       Secretary establishes a grant program under this section, the       Secretary shall submit to the committees on Veterans' Affairs       of the House of Representatives and the Senate a report       regarding the determination of the Secretary whether the       grant program is a financially effective means to promote the       purposes in subsection (a)(3).        (d) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) The term ``Veterans Legacy Program'' means the program       of the National Cemetery Administration that is responsible       for providing engagement and educational tools and       opportunities to the public regarding the service and       sacrifice of veterans interred in national, State, or Tribal       veterans' cemeteries.        (2) The term ``institution of higher learning'' has the       meaning given that term in section 3452(f) of title 38,       United States Code.        (3) The term ``local educational agency'' has the meaning       given that term in section 8101 of the Elementary and       Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2385, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2385, as amended. This bill  was introduced by Representative Conor Lamb, vice chair of the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs. It would permit the Secretary of the VA  to use grants rather than Federal contracts to fund cemetery research  programs and produce educational materials as part of the Veterans  Legacy Program. Switching to a grant program would ease many  administrative burdens associated with Federal contracts, allow for  more timely payment, and broaden the reach of the program to smaller  organizations.   The Veterans Legacy Program was launched by VA's National Cemetery  Administration in order to resurrect the stories of veterans interred  at national cemeteries, to educate future generations, and to honor the  legacy of our Nation's heroes.   This program is a broad collection of public history materials that  tell the story of America's veterans buried in national cemeteries. It  supports the National Cemetery Administration's mission to honor and  memorialize our veterans by creating educational materials that local  educators can use to teach their students and others about the veterans  buried in local cemeteries.   Currently, the National Cemetery Administration awards Federal  contracts to colleges, universities, and other institutions to support  the Veterans Legacy Program. These contract awards are used to develop  specific curricula.   Eligible recipients of these contracts include institutions of higher  learning, local education agencies, nonprofit entities the Secretary  determines have a demonstrated history of community engagement, or any  other recipient the Secretary deems appropriate.   Contract funds can also be used to conduct research related to  national, State, or Tribal veterans' cemeteries and produce educational  materials about or promote community engagement with the history of the  veterans interred at those cemeteries. The maximum contract amount is  $500,000. Presently, 16 separate contracts have been awarded, which  have produced an impressive array of digital and nondigital resources.   Cemetery directors say that they are pleased to see students visiting  the cemeteries as part of their studies. This renewed interest, by the  young and old alike, revives the lives and stories of American  veterans.   However, the National Cemetery Administration and the institutions of  higher education that most often receive and utilize these contracts  tell us that working with grants is much more efficient and easier for  them to administer than contracts.   For instance, grants allow an award cycle that more closely aligns  with the academic calendar of schools and colleges. Administrators of  the Veterans Legacy Program said grant programs would help increase the  reach of the program beyond large universities to smaller groups that  want to become involved.   A grant program also allows for faster funding. Contracts involve a  onetime payment for work at the end of the project. A grant  configuration, however, would allow for fluid and regular payments  throughout the course of the work.   Memorializing veterans is a primary responsibility of this committee,  and we need to support innovative ideas for bringing energy and  interest into national veterans' cemeteries. The Veterans Legacy  Program is just that.  [[Page H8130]]    Those currently working with the program at the National Cemetery  Administration, in institutions of higher learning, and in community  groups tell us that a grant program, as opposed to a Federal contract  program, would solve most, if not all, of the administrative problems  related to accessing funds in a consistent and flexible way.   H.R. 2385 does that by simply allowing the VA to provide grant  funding to the Veterans Legacy Program.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Lamb), my good friend and vice chairman of the House  Committee on Veterans Affairs, a veteran himself and author of H.R.  2385.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I do want to mention a couple of important stories  related to the Veterans Legacy Program.   Earlier this year, Professor Hedge Coke of the University of  California, Riverside presented testimony supporting H.R. 2385, as  amended.   Her research on the veterans buried at the Riverside National  Cemetery--by the way, the largest national cemetery in terms of its  geography in my district. She developed teaching curricula for local  teachers. She has remarkable energy in the remarkable attention that  she has brought to the cemetery. Her students use her educational  programs to revitalize the stories of the men and women buried there.   And, Mr. Speaker, at our hearing, Professor Hedge Coke told us that  the Veterans Legacy Program doesn't just bring students and community  members to the cemeteries; it takes the history of the cemeteries back  to the classrooms. Undergraduates, graduate students, and recent alumni  of UC Riverside go to local classrooms, from kindergarten through high  school, to foster this programming.   She said that in almost every classroom, a good third of the students  have significant ties to the cemetery they didn't know anything about.  This allows discovery of family and neighborhood ties and encourages  cultural development within the community.   To date, her program has produced dozens of lesson plans, and she has  worked with over 2,700 students in local public schools, including the  Sherman Indian High School.   I also want to say that one of the heroes that is buried at that  cemetery, Riverside National Cemetery, is Ysmael ``Smiley'' Villegas  from Casa Blanca, who earned the Medal of Honor by charging enemy  foxholes in World War II. He was killed 1 day short of his 21st  birthday.   Smiley Villegas' neighborhood, Casa Blanca, is a small neighborhood  of about 225 families; yet this neighborhood of 225 families sent 254  troops to serve in World War II.   Mr. Speaker, the Veterans Legacy Program helps to memorialize  veterans like Smiley and the enormous contributions of minority  communities like Casa Blanca.   The program recently created an interactive web app and digital  mapping of Riverside National Cemetery. It includes gravestone tributes  from local students, along with information about the cemetery's  construction, history, and notes of interest, such as Native American  and indigenous American veterans buried there.   In Professor Hedge Coke's words: ``The Legacy Program delivers this  terrific meeting of story and culture to the university, K-12 schools,  and the surrounding cultures and communities that make up our region.''   Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly encourage all of my colleagues to join  me in passing H.R. 2385, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1199) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct  a study regarding the accessibility of websites of the Department of  Veterans Affairs to individuals with disabilities.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:  [[Page H8131]]                                      H.R. 1199         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``VA Website Accessibility Act       of 2019''.       SEC. 2. STUDY REGARDING THE ACCESSIBILITY OF WEBSITES OF THE                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO INDIVIDUALS                     WITH DISABILITIES.         (a) Study.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall examine all websites (including attached files and web-      based applications) of the Department of Veterans Affairs to       determine whether such websites are accessible to individuals       with disabilities in accordance with section 508 of the       Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d).        (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after completing the       study under subsection (a), the Secretary shall submit a       report to Congress regarding such study. The report shall       include the following:        (1) A list of each website, file, or web-based application       described in subsection (a) that is not accessible to       individuals with disabilities in accordance with section 508       of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d).        (2) For each website, file, or web-based application       identified under paragraph (1), a description of the barriers       to bringing such website, file, or web-based application into       compliance with the requirements of such section, including       barriers relating to staffing.        (3) The plan of the Secretary to bring each website, file,       or web-based application identified in the list under       paragraph (1) into compliance with the requirements of       section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C.       794d).        (c) Definition of Website.--In this section, the term       ``website'' includes a kiosk at a Department of Veterans       Affairs medical facility, the use of which is required to       check in for scheduled appointments.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 1199.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1199, the VA Website  Accountability Act of 2019, introduced by Representative Elaine Luria,  chair of our Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial  Affairs. This bill directs VA to conduct a study regarding the  accessibility of VA websites to individuals with disabilities.   Since 1998, Federal law has required VA to make electronic and  information technology accessible to people with disabilities.  Unimpeded access to VA resources, including websites and mobile apps,  is crucial because it serves as a gateway to VA services and benefits.   However, VA has a long history of stating that it is ``working toward  compliance,'' while failing to ensure that all of its websites are  accessible to the blind via use of electronic readers. In fact, VA has  had more than 20 years to comply with the law.   Mr. Speaker, this was especially concerning last year when the  Veteran Crisis Line was updated, and because the chat feature was no  longer accessible for the visually impaired, it left blind veterans  unable to access this lifesaving resource.   Other barriers visually impaired veterans face when accessing VA  websites include forms that are incompatible with the screen reader  software or magnification programs; small buttons that are hidden among  other items, making them very difficult to find; elements like checked  boxes and buttons that are not properly labeled; and tables that cannot  be navigated cell by cell so screen reader software and magnification  programs cannot read them.   Now, H.R. 1199 does not propose any changes to existing Federal law;  instead, it requires VA to examine all of its websites to determine  whether or not they are accessible to individuals with disabilities so  it can comply with the law.   H.R. 1199 also requires VA to compile a complete list of noncompliant  websites and kiosks and submit a plan to Congress detailing how it  plans to bring those websites into legal compliance.   Mr. Speaker, the Blinded Veterans Association estimates there are  currently over 130,000 legally blind veterans living in this country  and another 1.5 million veterans with low vision. But last year, over  42,000 of these veterans had cases open with a visual impairment  services team coordinator at VA because they could not access websites  and mobile apps.   The number of visually impaired veterans is expected to grow as the  U.S. population ages in the next 20 years. We cannot wait another 20  years for VA to comply with the law.   This growing population will need to access VA's websites, apps,  medical center information kiosks, telehealth tools, disability  benefits, and other programs and services administered by VA both now  and for the foreseeable future.   Since many veterans are comfortable accessing information, scheduling  appointments, and communicating using information technology, visually  impaired veterans want the same access to these tools that VA offers to  other veterans.   When concerns about the accessibility of websites, documents, and  other equipment and media used to communicate with veterans are  minimized or ignored, some of our Nation's most vulnerable veterans-- those with catastrophic disabilities--are left behind.   So Mr. Speaker, when these veterans are denied access to information  and services, they are at risk for further aggravation of their  disabilities and, in some cases, even suicide.   The longer we wait, the greater the risk.   I urge all Members to support H.R. 1199, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Luria), my good friend and chairman of the Subcommittee  on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, also the sponsor of H.R.  1199 and a veteran herself.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers and am prepared  to close.   Mr. Speaker, I, again, want to urge all of my colleagues to join me  in passing H.R. 1199, Mrs. Luria's legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2334) to designate the Department of Veterans Affairs  community-based outpatient clinic in Odessa, Texas, as the ``Wilson and  Young Medal of Honor VA Clinic''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2334         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF WILSON AND YOUNG MEDAL OF HONOR VA                     CLINIC.         (a) Finding.--Congress finds that Private First Class       Alfred ``Mac'' Wilson of the Marine Corps and Staff Sergeant       Marvin ``Rex'' Young of the Army were both posthumously       awarded the Medal of Honor for their heroic actions in the       Vietnam War.        (b) Designation.--The Department of Veterans Affairs       community-based outpatient clinic in Odessa, Texas, shall       after the date of the enactment of this Act be known and       designated as the ``Wilson and Young Medal of Honor VA       Clinic''.        (c) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (b) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Wilson and Young Medal of Honor VA       Clinic''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2334.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the lives of Army Staff Sergeant Marvin  ``Rex'' Young and Marine Corps Private First Class Alfred ``Mac''  Wilson. I thank my colleague from Texas (Mr. Conaway) for bringing this  bill before us so that we all may be able to pay tribute to two of our  Nation's heroes.   As soon as the law allowed, both men signed up to serve our country  during the height of the Vietnam war. It was during this war that both  Staff Sergeant Young and Private First Class Wilson would ultimately  give their lives in defense of our country.   Private First Class Wilson was born on January 13, 1948, in Olney,  Illinois. His family moved to Odessa, Texas, in 1950, where he attended  local schools before graduating from Odessa Senior High School in 1967.  He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve at Abilene,  Texas, on November 1, 1967, and was discharged to enlist in the Marine  Corps on January 14, 1968.   At the time of his death, Private First Class Wilson was a rifleman  with Company M, 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines, 3rd Marine Division.   Staff Sergeant Young was born on May 11, 1947, in Alpine, Texas, the  youngest of three children born to Roy Clinton and Marilyn Young.   He joined the Army from Odessa, Texas, in September 1966 and by  August 21, 1968, was serving as a staff sergeant in Company C, 1st  Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division.   At two different points of the Vietnam war, these two brave men gave  their lives to support the mission of their respective units and were  both posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.   For Private First Class Wilson, it was March 3, 1969, when the first  platoon of Company M was ambushed by the North Vietnamese Army after  returning from patrol. Intense automatic weapons fire and grenade  attacks wounded the platoon's gunner and assistant gunner.   Acting as squad leader, Private Wilson put himself in between enemy  fire and his men to retrieve the machine gun from the wounded marines  so that his platoon could maintain a heavy volume of fire against the  enemy.   When he reached the M-60 machine gun, a North Vietnamese soldier  threw a grenade at him, landing between Private First Class Wilson and  another  [[Page H8133]]  marine. Private First Class Wilson first fired a burst from his M-16  rifle, killing the enemy, and then shouted to his companion and,  unhesitatingly, threw himself on the grenade, absorbing the full force  of the explosion with his body.   Because of his selfless act of valor, his platoon members were able  to give maximum effort to aggressively and successfully defeat the  enemy.   On August 21, 1968, a regimental sized force of the North Vietnamese  Army attacked Staff Sergeant Young's platoon while on a reconnaissance  mission. Staff Sergeant Young assumed command of the platoon after the  acting platoon leader was killed, organizing and deploying his men to  repel the enemy force.   While wave after wave of the enemy attacked, he courageously moved  from position to position, encouraging and directing fire at the North  Vietnamese Army while exposing himself to enemy bullets.   When Staff Sergeant Young noticed that parts of his squad were unable  to retreat, he fought his way to them, despite sustaining a critical  head injury, so they could safely withdraw. While fighting with the  squad as it fought its way to the rear, Staff Sergeant Young was  seriously wounded in the arm and his leg was badly shattered.   Without wanting to slow the retreat of his squad, he refused  assistance and ordered their withdrawal while providing protective  cover until the enemy engulfed his position.   These two heroes sacrificed their lives for their fellow  servicemembers and our freedom.   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I, and a grateful Nation, owe a debt  of gratitude to Private First Class Alfred ``Mac'' Wilson and Staff  Sergeant Marvin ``Rex'' Young, and to their families and to their  legacies.   I fully support the naming of the Department of Veterans Affairs  community-based outpatient clinic in Odessa, Texas, as the ``Wilson and  Young Medal of Honor VA Clinic'' so that we never forget their  sacrifices.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill and  urge our Senate colleagues to take up this bill without delay, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from The  American Legion, Department of Texas; from the DAV, Disabled American  Veterans, Department of Texas; and the VFW, the Veterans of Foreign  Wars, in support of Mr. Conaway's bill to name the clinic in Texas  after these gentlemen.                                                The American Legion,                                             Department of Texas,                                           Austin, TX, May 30, 2019.      Chairman Mark Takano,      House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Phil Roe,      House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Roe: On the behalf       of The American Legion, Department of Texas, I am honored to       extend my support to the efforts of U.S. Representative K.       Michael Conaway and the Members of Congress from Texas to       rename the Department of Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic       in Odessa, Texas to the ``Wilson and Young Medal of Honor VA       Clinic''.        As Medal of Honor recipients raised in Odessa, it is       fitting that Alfred ``Mac'' Wilson and Marvin ``Rex'' Young       be memorialized by naming a facility that serves their       brothers and sisters in arms in their time of need. It is a       testament to their bravery and self-sacrifice. May it also be       a reminder for us all to live up to their examples.            ``For God and Country'',                                                  Lloyd Buckmaster,                                                   State Commander.             Attest:                                                      William West,      State Adjutant.                                   ____                                                                DAV,                                             Department of Texas,                                         Lufkin, TX, April 24, 2019.      Chairman Mark Takano,      House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Phil Roe,      House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Roe: On the behalf       of the Disabled American Veterans, Department of Texas, I am       honored to extend my support to the efforts of U.S.       Representative K. Michael Conaway and the Members of Congress       from Texas to rename the Department of Veterans Affairs       outpatient clinic in Odessa, Texas to the ``Wilson and Young       Medal of Honor VA Clinic''.

Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers and am prepared  to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me say how much I appreciate this legislation from the gentleman  from Texas. Reading through the medal citations, it was certainly very  moving. I found myself even finding my voice very halting as I read  through it with my staff. I see that the gentleman still, today,  remembers his friend with great memories. He was a great ballplayer.   It is always poignant to take note of young servicemembers who give  their lives for our country, and we certainly want to join together, on  a bipartisan basis, as a Nation, to express our gratitude.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 2334,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 2334, honoring  Staff Sergeant Marvin ``Rex'' Young and Private First Class Alfred  ``Mac'' Wilson, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 95) to amend title 38, United States Code, to ensure that  children of homeless veterans are included in the calculation of the  amounts of certain per diem grants.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 95         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Homeless Veteran Families       Act''.       SEC. 2. MODIFICATION OF CALCULATION OF AMOUNTS OF PER DIEM                     GRANTS.         Section 2012(a)(2)(B) of title 38, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) in clause (i), by inserting ``or (iii)'' after ``clause       (ii)''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following new clause:        ``(iii) With respect to a homeless veteran who has care of       a minor dependent while receiving services from the grant       recipient or eligible entity, the daily cost of care shall be       the sum of the daily cost of care determined under       subparagraph (A) plus, for each such minor dependent, an       amount that equals 50 percent of such daily cost of care.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 95.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 95, the Homeless Veteran  Families Act.   H.R. 95 was introduced by Representative Julia Brownley, chair of the  Subcommittee on Health and a tireless advocate for women veterans and  their children.   This bill would ensure that children of homeless veterans are  included in the calculation of per diem grants to organizations  supporting homeless veterans and their families. By including children  in this calculation, homeless veterans and their children will receive  much-needed housing and supportive services, which will reduce the rate  of homelessness among the veteran population.   Mr. Speaker, since 1994, VA's homeless grant and per diem program has  provided homeless veterans with community-based transitional housing  and supportive services. The grant per diem program annually offers  funding to community agencies that provide supportive services to  homeless veterans. It promotes the development and provision of  supportive housing and supportive services, with the goal of helping  homeless veterans achieve residential stability, increase their skill  levels and income, and obtain greater self-determination.   However, many homeless veterans with children are unable to obtain  transitional housing and support assistance through the program because  providers only receive payments from VA for the veteran, not their  dependent children. Many housing providers have been unable to house  homeless veterans who are accompanied by their dependent children  without additional financial support.   Mr. Speaker, current law limits VA's authority to reimburse the  additional costs associated with sheltering the dependent children of  homeless veterans, which has resulted in many grant per diem service  providers not accepting homeless veterans with dependent children.   This has resulted in a lack of access to supportive housing and  services for veterans with children, as these veterans are forced to  choose between receipt of housing assistance and supportive services  and caring for their children. This is especially true for many women  veterans who have children and who are also homeless.   This legislation would authorize VA to pay a partial per diem to  grant per diem service providers supporting our Nation's homeless  veterans with children. For each child accompanying a homeless veteran,  the service provider would receive per diem at a 50 percent rate for  each child.   This committee is committed to addressing and ending homelessness,  and this legislation is one step toward this end.   Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, Economic Opportunity Subcommittee  Chairman Levin and Ranking Member Bilirakis held two field hearings in  San Diego, California, and Tampa, Florida, to learn more about how VA  can better coordinate with local organizations to end veteran  homelessness. This bill is the first of many solutions, some of which  have been identified from these bipartisan hearings of the Economic  Opportunity Subcommittee.   The full committee will continue to work together to find bipartisan  solutions to end veteran homelessness. H.R. 95 has 301 cosponsors,  which demonstrates this Chamber's commitment to ending veteran  homelessness and to working together to improve the lives of the  veterans we represent.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Brownley), my good friend, the chairwoman of the Health  Subcommittee, and the author of this bill.    I yield the gentlewoman from California an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I certainly also want to congratulate and  thank Congresswoman Brownley, the Chair of our Health Subcommittee, for  bringing this legislation forward. And I also want to also express my  gratitude to Ranking Member Roe, former Chairman Roe. We both made a  commitment to the territory of Puerto Rico, and we want the people of  Puerto Rico to know that on a bipartisan basis the Veterans' Affairs  Committee cares about the service and the benefits that are owed to the  veterans of Puerto Rico.   So I urge all of my colleagues to pass H.R. 95, which addresses a  critical need for veterans that have children and who are in need of  housing to prevent them from being homeless. I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
