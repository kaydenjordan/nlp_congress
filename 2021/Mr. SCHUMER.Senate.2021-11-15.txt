 Madam President, I thank my colleague from Tennessee for  yielding, and in a few minutes, I intend to take the first procedural  step to begin consideration of the annual Defense policy bill. With  cooperation, the Senate can and should move through this important  legislation that we attend to each year.   This year, we will amend the Defense bill to include the U.S.  Innovation and Competition Act, the historic manufacturing and  innovation bill that the Senate passed earlier this year on a strong  bipartisan basis and which will help tackle our Nation's supply chain  crisis. Our supply chain crisis needs attending to, and we cannot wait.  Members from both sides of the aisle have expressed interest in getting  this done.   Passing USICA would be an essential far-reaching step that Congress  could take to help fight inflation, help increase American workers'  wages, and relieve strained supply chains, particularly with regard to  the current devastating chip shortage that is hurting the auto  industry, the tech industry, and so many other industries. We cannot  allow us to become dependent on foreign chips, especially when we do-- we do the groundbreaking technology.   We are also working with the Speaker and our colleagues in the House  and Republican colleagues in the Senate to find a path forward to get  this important legislation over the finish line before the end of the  year.   It is also my intention to have an amendment vote on the bipartisan  legislation, repealing the 2002 Iraq war AUMF. This measure was  reported on a bipartisan basis out of the Foreign Relations Committee  earlier this year,  [[Page S8071]]  and the NDAA is the logical place to have that vote on the Senate  floor.   The Iraq war has been over for nearly a decade. An authorization  passed in 2002 is no longer necessary in 2021. In no way will repealing  this measure impact our ability to keep Americans safe nor impact our  relationship with Iraq.   We will have other votes on amendments on the Defense bill as well. I  look forward to working with our colleagues on the other side of the  aisle to move this important process forward.   So now I am going to move cloture on the NDAA.   I have some words to say about my dear colleague, Senator Leahy, and  some words to say on Build Back Better, but I will come at a later  moment because I know my friend from Tennessee is waiting to do those  things tonight.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 144,  H.R. 4350, the National Defense Authorization Act.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum call for the cloture motion filed today, November 15, be waived.    I yield the floor, and I thank the Senator from  Tennessee for her courtesy.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk,  and I ask for its first reading.    Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading, and in  order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule  XIV, I object to my own request.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today a little sad  but also immensely full of gratitude. Earlier today, our dear colleague  Senator Patrick Leahy announced that he will retire from the Senate at  the conclusion of his term.   Now, this Chamber has had a long history of many a dedicated public  servant, but there has only been one Patrick Leahy. For eight terms,  the gentleman from Vermont has been a Senator's Senator, one of only  four in the history of the Senate to surpass 16,000 votes in service to  his beloved home State.   Today, I can only say this: Thank you. Thank you, Pat, for your many  years of friendship, leadership, and dedication to the Constitution and  the rule of law. The Senate is better off because of you. Vermont is  better off because of you. Our country is better off because of you.   Now, we still may disagree strongly about which State has the best  maple syrup, but we never let that get in the way of doing great things  together.   Pat, you are a great guy. It is bittersweet. You deserve a wonderful  retirement with Marcelle and your beautiful children and grandchildren,  but we are going to miss you dearly. I wish you and Marcelle the very  best on the road ahead and the best of luck. Godspeed.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  November 16; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning  business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Steele nomination postcloture; further, that at  11:30 a.m., all postcloture time be expired and the Senate vote on  confirmation of the Steele nomination; that the Senate recess following  the cloture vote on the Bonnie nomination until 2:15 p.m. to allow for  the weekly caucus meetings; further, that if cloture is invoked on the  Bonnie nomination, the vote on confirmation will be at 2:30 p.m.; and,  finally, that if any nominations are confirmed during Tuesday's  session, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:05 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, November 16, 2021, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
