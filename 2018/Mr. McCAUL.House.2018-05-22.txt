 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend Dr. Burgess  for shepherding this bill through the Energy and Commerce Committee and  taking us to the point where we are today on the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, the Childhood Cancer  STAR Act. The bill addresses 4 major concerns facing the pediatric  cancer community: survivorship, treatment, access, and research.   I was proud to introduce this bill with Ms. Jackie Speier, with G.K.  Butterfield, and Mr. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania. This is the most  comprehensive childhood cancer bill ever considered before this House.  This bill passed the House in 2016, and I encourage the support of all  Members today so we can finally send it to the President's desk for his  signature. I am proud to say that today is the day. I know a lot of the  advocates have been waiting for this day for quite some time.   Childhood cancer, unfortunately, remains the deadliest killer of our  children. At some point we, as a Congress and as a Nation, must say  enough is enough. In short, the STAR Act elevates and prioritizes the  fight against childhood cancer at the NIH. Specifically, STAR places a  pediatric oncologist on the board at the National Cancer Institute, so  childhood cancer will now have a voice at the table when funding  decisions are made.   It also expands opportunities to childhood cancer research, allowing  doctors to better understand and track how cancer develops in children.  Finally, we must also address the needs of the nearly 500,000 survivors  of childhood cancer. Due to their treatments using chemotherapy, a  World War I chemical agent, two-thirds of these survivors will face  serious, lifelong medical conditions.   When I think about what this means, I think of my friend Sadie  Keller. She is perhaps the strongest person I know. Sadie underwent  over 2 years of chemotherapy at the age of 7 after being diagnosed with  leukemia. She has been, at her young age, perhaps the most relentless  advocate for this cause, this bill here on Capitol Hill, and throughout  the childhood cancer community.   I just want to refer to this picture of little Sadie and myself when  she was going through remission, on the Speaker's balcony, looking out  over The Mall, with a vision towards the future, a future where  children will no longer have to go through this disease, looking at the  dark clouds but the sunlight coming through. That is what this bill  represents is sunlight for the children who have been afflicted with  this terrible disease.                                time  1545    While now her cancer is in remission, that does not mean her medical  challenges are over. We must do more as a Nation to care for these  survivors. To that end, the STAR Act will improve collaboration among  providers so doctors are better able to care for survivors as they age.   I want to close by thanking Sadie, but I also want to thank people  like Danielle Leach and the Alliance for Childhood Cancer team for  their relentless advocacy on the Hill and work on this bill. I also  want to thank Nancy Goodman and Kids v. Cancer and the entire childhood  cancer advocacy community for standing up and getting us to the point  where we are today.   They are the voice of these children. They made this event possible  here today. And I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart.   I urge passage of this life-altering piece of legislation.
