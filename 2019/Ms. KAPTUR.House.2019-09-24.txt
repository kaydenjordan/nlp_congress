 Madam Speaker, I rise today as co-chair of the  Congressional Ukraine Caucus. Like so many Americans, I am alarmed by  President Trump's repeated betrayal of American national security  interests in favor of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.   This President, President Trump, has put efforts forward to coerce  Ukraine's new President Zelensky, an allied leader, into helping Trump  win reelection by using congressionally supported military aid as  leverage.   That is not only a dramatic betrayal of the President's oath of  office; it is also the latest example of Trump doing Putin's bidding.   I am certain this President's relationship with Vladimir Putin didn't  start with his veiled support for Putin's election meddling, inviting  the Russians to hack the DNC, or even lobbying for inviting Russia to  be readmitted to the G7, for heaven's sake.   So, who benefits when Ukraine loses military assistance and Zelensky  is humiliated? Russia: the country that has waged a bloody war in  Ukraine for over 5 years, leaving over 13,000 dead, 30,000 injured, and  over 1.5 million people displaced.   Who is to say Putin wasn't listening in when Trump blackmailed  Zelensky?  [[Page H7891]]    Let's have the full truth. It is a great cleanser.
