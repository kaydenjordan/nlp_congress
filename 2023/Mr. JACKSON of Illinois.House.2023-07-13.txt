 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the  echoes of our past resonating deeply in the present, echoing in a way  that should give us pause, concern, and impetus to change.   Recently, the Supreme Court rendered a decision that threatens the  principles of equality and justice we so ardently strive to uphold. By  overturning affirmative action, they ruled that the admissions policies  of Harvard University, founded in 1636, and the University of North  Carolina, founded in 1789, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the  14th Amendment, ratified in this Chamber in 1868, an amendment born  from the ashes of a divided nation after a Civil War.   ``Born or naturalized in the United States'' is what the 14th  Amendment tried to ensure that there would be equal protection under  the law even for those who had been formerly enslaved.   In interpreting this amendment in the case of affirmative action of  which we speak, we are brought face to face with an ominous specter of  our past: The infamous decision of Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896, a case  about a man seven-eighths White, one-eighth African American in  Louisiana who had purchased a first-class train ticket who was then  removed because of his race.   In that case, the Supreme Court decided that, indeed, separate but  equal facilities satisfied the 14th Amendment. That decision left a  dark legacy falsely equating enforced segregation with equality. Today,  we find ourselves in an eerily similar situation, with the dismantling  of affirmative action policies echoing the disheartening tones of  separate but equal.   In both instances, our highest court has interpreted the noble cause  of equal protection in a way that undermines the pursuit of real,  substantive equality. Mr. Speaker, I assert that just as separate but  equal in the Plessy v. Ferguson case was a misnomer hiding the reality  of discrimination, the recent overturning of affirmative action  similarly threatens to cloak and perpetuate the very disparities it  sought to challenge. Affirmative action is more than a policy. It is a  pledge, a commitment to an ongoing endeavor toward genuine, substantive  equality and opportunity for all.   In parallel, another struggle for equality is taking place, not in  our courts but in our classrooms. Across our Nation, books are being  removed from shelves, banned from curricula, hidden away from young  minds eager to explore the world through the written word. This  chilling trend is reminiscent of the dark times in our history when we  had antiliteracy laws and books were not just banned but also burned.   Consider the data: In the first half of the 2022-2023 school year,  874 unique book titles have been banned, a surge of 28 percent compared  to the prior 6 months. These are not mere numbers. These are  extinguished perspectives, silenced voices, curtailed visions.   What we face is a dual assault on opportunity and knowledge, an  attack on the principles of equality and intellectual freedom that echo  some of the most challenging times in our Nation's history. Yet, it is  within these echoes that we find our call to action.   We must advocate for the continued need for policies like affirmative  action that aim to level the playing field, to fight against the  systemic biases that for too long have marginalized certain  communities. We must stand against the banning of books, ensuring that  the world of ideas remain open, vibrant, and accessible to all, that we  resist the impulse to limit our collective intellectual growth.   Mr. Speaker, as we reflect on the interconnectedness of these issues,  let us remember the words of our 16th President from the State of  Illinois, President Abraham Lincoln: ``The philosophy of the schoolroom  in one generation will be the philosophy of government in the next.''  Let us ensure that philosophy promotes inclusivity, celebrates  diversity, fosters critical thinking, and upholds the spirit of  equality that is at the heart of our great Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to address and express  my concerns today.                            ____________________
