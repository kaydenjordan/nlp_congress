 Mr. Speaker, the ox is in the ditch and it is time to go  to work and get him out.   We were sent to Washington to work, but it sure doesn't feel like we  are doing that right now. We promised the American people we would rein  in these out-of-control Federal agencies and get spending under  control. The way we do that is by uniting and passing conservative  appropriation bills that will give us leverage against the Senate and  the White House.   Colleagues, this has gotten out of hand, and we need to start voting.  Let's put these bills on the House floor to debate and amend so that  Members can put themselves on record. I am fine defending my votes back  home. What I am not fine with is going home and telling people that we  clocked in this week and we didn't do any work.   Mr. Speaker, we should stay here until we pass all 12 appropriations  bills and send them to the Senate. Until we do that, the job is not  done.                            ____________________
