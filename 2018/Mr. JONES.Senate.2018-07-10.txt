 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise to speak on a matter of both  personal and national importance.   As many folks know by now, a defining moment in my career as a  prosecutor was bringing to justice two former Ku Klux Klansmen for the  bombing of Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church in 1963. That act of  domestic terrorism, and that is exactly what it was, killed four  innocent, beautiful little girls. As one of their mothers, Miss Alpha  Robertson, described, ``It sounded like the whole world was shaking.''   There is no doubt it did. The whole world shook as people asked: How  could this happen in America, the land of the free and the home of the  brave? Despite the feeling that the whole world shook--and indeed the  horrific crime did add momentum to the civil rights movement--the  criminals responsible for the murder of those four little girls were  not brought to justice for decades.   The first came in 1977, 14 years after the fact, by my friend and  former Alabama attorney general, Bill Baxley. It would be 24 and 25  years later, in 2001 and 2002, that my team of Robert Posey, Jeff  Wallace, Don Cochran, Bill Fleming, Ben Herren, and I completed that  journey. The bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church was but one of  many civil rights-era crimes that have gone unsolved.   Solving and successfully prosecuting an almost 40-year-old case was  no easy task, and the effort involved a team of both Federal and State  law enforcement. Media coverage also contributed to some key breaks in  that case. In fact, it was through the dedicated efforts of my friend  Jerry Mitchell, an award-winning journalist at the Jackson, MS, Clarion  Ledger, that these unsolved civil rights cases even got a second look.  It was when the State of Mississippi opened closed files of a Jim Crow- era State commission that Jerry discovered it might be possible to  reopen several unsolved cases, including the cases of Medgar Evers and  Vernon Dahmer. When those cases resulted in convictions, law  enforcement officers and communities around the South began to  reexamine so many of the unsolved crimes, including the bombing of the  16th Street Baptist Church.   Today there are more than 100 unsolved civil rights criminal cases  out there. Many of them are 50 years old or older. Some were  investigated a little, some were investigated a lot, but because these  were State not Federal crimes most were never really investigated at  all.   While it is certainly never too late for justice, years of delays can  create serious and sometimes insurmountable obstacles: Memories fade or  are lost to death, evidence disappears. Potential defendants also die,  taking the details of their crimes to their graves.   Justice can take many forms. It doesn't always have to be a criminal  conviction. One measure of justice--not a full measure but a measure  nonetheless--can be achieved through a public examination of the facts  and determination of the truth about what happened and why, but because  these were criminal cases, the records and files relating to these  unsolved cases are often classified or shielded from public view, and  sometimes they are literally scattered among various agencies and hard  to find.   Yet the victims of these crimes and their families have no less right  to justice than they did at the time the crimes were committed, and the  American people have a right to know this part of our Nation's history.  As has often been said, if we do not learn from the mistakes of the  past, we are doomed to repeat them. In today's climate, I believe we  need to be more than ever vigilant and knowledgeable about the mistakes  of the crimes of the civil rights era.   Eleven years ago, nearly to the day, I testified as a lawyer before  the House Judiciary Committee in support of the Emmett Till Unsolved  Civil Rights Crimes Act. That act created the Department of Justice's  Civil Rights Cold Case Division to focus exclusively on solving these  unsolved civil rights cases. Since the bill's passage, the Civil Rights  Division has reexamined a number of these cases. I certainly applaud  their efforts in doing so, but often, as was my experience, these cases  end up being solved with the help of journalists, historians, private  investigators, and local law enforcement, but that requires having  access to the files. It is not an easy task getting access to these  kinds of files. However, by ensuring public access to the files and  records relating to these cases, we can expand the universe of people  who can help these victims receive the justice they have long since  been denied. If we are going to find the truth, it has to start with  transparency.   That is why today I am introducing the Civil Rights Cold Case Records  Collection Act of 2018, which will require the assembly, collection,  and public disclosure of government cold case records about unsolved  civil rights cases.   This legislation would not have been possible without the dedicated  efforts of students at Hightstown High School in Hightstown, NJ, and  their teacher Stuart Wexler, who have joined me in the Gallery today.   It was a couple of years ago, long before becoming a U.S. Senator was  really on my radar, that I received a call from Mr. Wexler explaining  that he and his students had been stymied in efforts to obtain  documents through the Freedom of Information Act about some of these  cases. They wanted my support and others for legislation they were  drafting to open these files to the public. Since I had already made  that suggestion to folks at the Justice Department and others, I  enthusiastically endorsed their project. Who would have imagined that 2  or 3 years ago we would be here today?   I thank them for reminding me of our conversations and our shared  commitment and for working with me and my staff to make the  introduction of this legislation possible today. It means a lot that  these young people from New Jersey, who were not even born when these  crimes were committed, care so much about this issue.   I also thank a few other folks. I thank John Hamilton and Jay Bosanko  at the National Archives for working with the staff, and Professor Hank  Klibanoff, who is also with us in the Gallery today, a former  journalist and Pulitzer Prize winner for the book ``The Race Beat''  that examined the role of the journalist during the civil rights  movement.   I thank them for their help in drafting this legislation and others  who dedicated their lives to working on these cold cases--people like  Andrew Sheldon in Atlanta and Alvin Sykes, who worked so hard on the  Emmett Till bill and the Emmett Till case; Margaret Burnham, a law  professor from Northeast Eastern University Law School; and Paula  Johnson from Syracuse University Law School have all done remarkable  work in trying to reexamine these cases.   While prosecuting the church bombing cases, I learned how deeply  important this work is to anyone who lost a loved one just because  someone else hated the color of their skin. It is also important to the  communities where these crimes occurred.   It is impossible to express the emotion and satisfaction our team  felt at the conclusion of those trials and the guilty verdicts we  obtained. It was a privilege to work on cases that meant so much to so  many. We have come a long way since 1963, but justice delayed does not  have to mean justice denied.   When I testified at the House Judiciary Committee 11 years ago, I  noted that we could never prosecute all of these cases but that as a  country of compassion, we should find other ways to heal these old  wounds. Reconciliation can be the most potent medicine for healing.  After all this time, we might not solve every one of these cold cases,  but my hope is, our efforts today will, at the very least, help us find  some long overdue healing and understanding of the truth.   Each civil rights crime, each victim of that era deserves as much  attention and effort as Carol Robertson, Denise McNair, Addie Mae  Collins, and Cynthia Morris Wesley, the young girls who lost their  lives that Sunday morning in 1963.
