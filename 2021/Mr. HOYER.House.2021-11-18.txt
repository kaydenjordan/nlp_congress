 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Scalise), the Republican whip, for the purpose of an inquiry as to the  balance of the day.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his question. Let  me read through this so I reach every point that I think each Member  needs to know.   Following the next vote, the House will stand in recess subject to  the call of the Chair. As all Members know, we are waiting for some  technical pursuits of the budget and reconciliation process to be  completed.   The House has completed, as I think all of you know, 1 hour and 40  minutes of the 2 hours of debate on the Build Back Better Act, so there  will remain 10 minutes on each side prior to the passage of the Build  Back Better Act.  [[Page H6597]]    We are waiting, as the gentleman indicated, for the completion of a  privileged scrub from the Senate Parliamentarians necessary for the  reconciliation process.   Once we have received that information, the Rules Committee and Mr.  McGovern will meet to report a rule with an additional manager's  amendment to make technical corrections to the bill, which will be  considered on the floor so that the Parliamentarian's concerns will be  met in that technical amendment.   We are also awaiting the final two committee estimates from CBO. We  expect CBO to have estimates--and I want to make it clear that this may  not be the CBO score of the overall piece of legislation. We have just  heard from those who are going to be reading that through the night, I  know. We are also waiting for the final two committee estimates.   As I said, I want to thank the Senate Parliamentarian, who has been  working around the clock--their office has been working around the  clock to get us to where I think we are now.   I want to also thank CBO, who has been working extraordinarily hard.  This is a large piece of legislation, which I guess is an  understatement, and it is also complex.   Having said that, obviously, CBO has been working for months-- literally August, September, October, and November--on this  legislation. We appreciate the hard work of the Parliamentarian and the  Director of CBO and their staffs.   We are working toward completing the Build Back Better Act today, and  more information on the schedule will be provided as soon as it becomes  available.   Let me add, if I can, Mr. Whip, it is my hope that we will complete  this legislation today so that this would be the last legislative day  prior to the Thanksgiving work period.   I want to make sure everybody understands, however, we will complete  Build Back Better before we go home. I am hopeful and believe--I think  most Members are hopeful--that we can do that tonight, whether you are  for it or against it, that we can do it tonight, and that is my effort  to achieve that objective. I know it is the Speaker's effort as well.   I yield to my friend, the whip.    There would be debate on the rule, and then the 20 minutes  of remaining debate on the bill itself; 10 minutes on your side and 10  minutes on our side.   I want to say, we do expect to have a full table of the score. As  those of you who have pored over CBO scores, you know there is a number  of pages--sometimes shorter, 15, it can be longer than that--of prose  in explanation of the score. What we will have is the score itself, as  I understand it, a summary table of the score. We may not have the  prose by that time.   I want to make it clear to you that that is not necessary for us to  pass it. It is necessary, and it will be in place, before it goes to  the Senate under the reconciliation rules.    The Energy and Commerce has been done, so we do have that.  But the other two will be in the table, correct.    Yes, that is my understanding.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is November 18, 2021. Those of us who  serve in the Congress of the United States on this date will be able to  tell our children and our children's children that we were there when  the United States Congress passed one of the most transformational  bills in the history of the Congress for the people.   Tonight, House Democrats will vote on the Build Back Better Act as  will House Republicans, legislation to transform our country by making  opportunities available and equitable for all Americans.   Its name, of course, refers to the broad recognition that too many  Americans are just barely getting by in our economy, and we simply  cannot go back to the way things were before the pandemic.   We have to ensure our people can access the tools and resources they  need, not just to survive, but to succeed.  [[Page H6616]]    This bill does so by making investments in four key areas.   First, it will invest in childcare, universal pre-K, and home care so  that more Americans can get back to the workforce and grow our economy.   Secondly, it further expands the Affordable Care Act coverage,  reduces out-of-pocket costs, caps insulin at $35 for everyone, and  finally gives Medicare the tools and authority to negotiate lower drug  prices for seniors just as we do for veterans.   Thirdly, it will bring down the everyday costs for housing and higher  education that make it harder for Americans to secure a place in our  middle class.   And fourth, the Build Back Better Act makes the largest commitment  toward addressing the climate crisis ever considered by any Nation in  history.   Mr. Speaker, in all four of these critical areas, the Build Back  Better Act will make transformational investments that will help more  Americans access opportunities and achieve greater economic security.   This bill is truly for the people, not just those who have much, but  those who have too little.   Many Americans are looking at the investments this bill would make in  America's workers and families and asking: How are we going to afford  it?   My friends on the other side of the aisle have raised that and I am  sure will raise it again.   First and foremost, Mr. Speaker, this bill does not raise taxes from  households or small businesses earning less than $400,000 a year.   In fact, the Build Back Better Act would provide a tax cut--contrary  to the rhetoric I have heard on the other side of the aisle--to 80  percent of American households next year.   Not only that, but it will raise revenue, according to the Treasury  Department and outside analyses.   My Republican friends should be excited that we give a tax cut  essentially to 80 percent of Americans, not just 1 percent. By most  estimates, this bill reduces the deficit. This bill reduces the  deficit. It also ensures that all of us will pay our fair share to  support our democracy.   The impacts of this historic legislation will be reflected in the  greater economic security of millions of families and in the growth and  competitiveness of a robust American economy.   President Biden said, in fact, very truthfully, this will be  transformational, and it will be measured in the deeper sense of hope  that Americans will have when they see their economy working for them  instead of holding them back.   I am hopeful that the Senate acts quickly to pass this bill under  reconciliation even while Republicans all sit on the sidelines on this  historic moment, just as all but 13 of them did when we passed a  transformational infrastructure investment bill, which will make  America competitive in the 21st century and make businesses in America  grow and succeed.   Democrats will not rest until all Americans have the tools to build  back better, to access opportunities to get ahead, to achieve real  economic security, and to reach for the American Dream that has been  this country's promise for generations.   This bill, Mr. Speaker, as I said at the beginning, is for the  people, all the people, the little people, the big people, all the  people.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to be able to say on  November 18, 2021, I voted for that legislation which made America, as  John Kennedy said, a great country even greater.
