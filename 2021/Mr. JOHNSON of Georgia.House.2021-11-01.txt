 Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of the  anniversary of this important day in American history, November 1,  1965. On that day, the Interstate Commerce Commission ruled that  segregation on interstate buses and facilities was illegal. This ruling  came after months of protests and arrests of the Freedom Riders on  public transit.   The Freedom Riders, made up of Black and White, male and female,  young and old, united to show the Nation that we are all equal. I had  the honor of serving in Congress alongside one of the original Freedom  Riders, my good friend and our colleague, the late Congressman John  Lewis.   To honor his legacy and commitment to ending racial segregation, I  reintroduced H.R. 1348, to award a Congressional Gold Medal to the  Freedom Riders in recognition of their unique contribution to civil  rights.   I strongly encourage my congressional colleagues to cosponsor H.R.  1348. This year marks the 65th anniversary of the Freedom Riders, and  it is past time that we recognize their courage and contributions.                            ____________________
