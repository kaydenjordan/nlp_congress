 Madam Speaker, today, my Michigan colleagues and  members of the Congressional Black Caucus rise in honor of the life and  service of Congresswoman Barbara-Rose Collins. She dedicated her life  to community and broke countless barriers.   Madam Speaker, I ask that everyone rise for a moment of silence in  honor of Congresswoman Barbara-Rose Collins.                            ____________________
