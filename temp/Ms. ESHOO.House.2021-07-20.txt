 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2668, the  Consumer Protection and Recovery Act. This legislation restores the  Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) authority to protect consumers and  businesses from scammers.   In April 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that the FTC can no longer use  section 13(b) of the FTC Act to ensure monetary relief to Americans who  have fallen victim to fraudsters and scammers. This ruling gutted the  FTC's authority and we must act quickly to restore it. The FTC has  returned $11.2 billion to consumers in the last five years alone, and  since 2018, the FTC has recovered more than $171 million dollars for  almost one million Californians. Section 13(b) has also helped veterans  who have been defrauded by for-profit colleges and provided relief to  low-income families gouged by payday lenders.   The FTC has relied on this authority for four decades, and if  Congress does not act with urgency, millions more Americans will fall  victim to fraudsters with no pathway to reprieve. The urgency of this  situation cannot be underscored enough. There is more than $2 billion  dollars in 24 pending cases that are currently threatened by the FTC no  longer having this authority.   If Congress is to protect consumers across every state in every  district, then we must act now. I urge my colleagues to support this  bill and vote yes.
