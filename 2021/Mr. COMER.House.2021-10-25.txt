 Madam Speaker, I rise to express my continued concern and  opposition to the efforts from the Democrat majority to pass another  $3.5 trillion worth of unnecessary spending.   If you ask any American right now what the biggest challenge they  face is, it is inflation. We have inflation today primarily because of  the last unnecessary spending that was passed in this House, and that  was the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that Democrats passed on a partisan  basis in this House. That has led to inflation.   We have more inflation than we have had in my adult lifetime. Yet,  this body wants to continue to pass more unnecessary spending that will  lead to more inflation. Enough is enough. We need to move on from this  bill and take care of the business that the American people deserve  Congress to address.                            ____________________
