 Mr. Speaker, how did we get to this point?  [[Page H4118]]    The Affordable Care Act is simply not working for the American  people. It is limiting choices. It is raising costs. It is leaving  millions without access to care. And unfortunately, these are not just  talking points but very real issues affecting very real Americans.   The Affordable Care Act has left the individual market in shambles  and has driven insurers away from offering coverage. Now, we are seeing  one-third of all counties in the United States of America with only a  single insurer. And among the plans that have chosen to remain in these  markets, there have been widespread, double-digit premium increases. In  Texas, premiums have jumped 29 percent a year, on average, from 2014 to  2017.   The markets are in difficulty. They are failing to live up to the  promise made 7 years ago, that Americans would be able to receive  ``affordable care.''   As we knew then, and we still know now, this was an empty promise and  has priced over 19 million Americans out of the market. What is worse,  these individuals are forced to pay the individual mandate penalty or  seek a hardship exemption because of the cost to purchase and use their  health insurance.   Mr. Speaker, 11 months ago, Speaker Ryan released the Better Way plan  to save the Nation's healthcare system and to bring relief to the  American people. This plan, which served as the blueprint for the  American Health Care Act, laid out policies to stabilize the markets  damaged by the Affordable Care Act, repeal the burdensome Affordable  Care Act taxes and mandates that have hindered innovation and limited  access to care. So let's take a look at what the American Health Care  Act does.   First and foremost, the American Health Care Act provides immediate  relief to the State insurance markets. As Republicans, we know that  one-size-fits-all works for no one, and certainly did not work for the  individual markets. The States should have the flexibility to support  their insurance markets and ensure that plans can continue to provide  options for coverage.   To do this, we relax two of the more egregious market regulations  that were imposed under the Affordable Care Act: the mandate that  premiums cannot vary for younger and older Americans by more than a 3- to-1 ratio and the mandate creating fixed actuarial values for plans.   The mandate limiting a plan's ability to set premiums by age has  driven up the cost of coverage for younger and healthier Americans and,  subsequently, pushed them away from seeking coverage by the millions.  Of the over 19 million Americans who have sidestepped the individual  market, it is estimated that as many as 45 percent of these individuals  are under the age of 35. Without these younger Americans seeking  coverage, the markets have plunged, as insurers have hiked up premiums  year after year to compensate for unhealthy risk pools.    To change this, there is relaxation of the 5-to-1 ratio. It will  lower premium costs and provide necessary opportunities to stabilize  markets. We also give States the option, the choice to go higher or go  lower, which honors the spirit of federalism.   Additionally, we are repealing the actuarial values mandate to  provide insurers with additional flexibility to offer more coverage  options. The requirement for insurers to offer specified Bronze,  Silver, and Gold level tiers has limited consumer choice, driving even  more individuals away from seeking coverage and further contributing to  the collapse of the healthcare markets.   To further supplement these efforts, we are establishing the Patient  and State Stability Fund. This fund provides States access to a total  of over $140 billion over 10 years to promote innovative solutions to  lower costs and increase access to health care for their unique patient  populations.   Mr. Speaker, the goal is simple, to provide States with maximum  flexibility in how they address the cost of care for their citizens.  The American Health Care Act provides States with options for how to  use funds, including providing financial assistance for high-cost  individuals, incentivizing insurer participation in those markets,  reducing the cost of insurance, promoting access to preventive  services, and reducing out-of-pocket costs for patients.   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a combination of the  Stability Fund and other proconsumer changes would reduce premiums by  10 percent below current projections of 2026.   We want patients to have access to high-quality, affordably priced  health coverage. The Patient and State Stability Fund can help States  lower costs and can increase access to high quality health care for  their citizens.   In addition to supporting the insurance markets, the American Health  Care Act creates needed reforms to the Medicaid program itself. Without  any changes, the current Medicaid expansion is expected to cost $1  trillion in 10 years' time--$1 trillion a year in 10 years' time.  Medicaid needs reform so that States can continue to provide coverage  to children, people with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups, the  very populations that this safety net program was created to serve.   To address these concerns, the American Health Care Act first phases  out the Medicaid expansion, not traditional Medicaid but Medicaid  expansion. The expansion has hurt State budgets and limited States'  abilities to ensure that resources will continue to be available for  the vulnerable populations for which Medicaid was designed. By phasing  out expansion, we are providing States with greater budget autonomy.   Additionally, our bill helps further bend the Medicaid cost curve by  shifting the program toward a per beneficiary allotment. Per  beneficiary allotments set limits on the annual growth for per capita  expenditures for which the States will receive matching funds from the  Federal Government. Per beneficiary allotments create greater fiscal  accountability and ensure that the program can continue to exist for  years to come.   This is not a new idea. This was an idea put forward by President  Bill Clinton and, at one time, supported by every Democratic Member of  the Senate in 1995.   Second, the American Health Care Act increases the amount of  flexibility that States have in managing their Medicaid program. The  bill scales back the Affordable Care Act mandates that have limited a  State's ability to tailor plans toward the needs of beneficiaries.  States can and States should be trusted to effectively manage the needs  of their Medicaid beneficiaries. The American Health Care Act will  allow them to do so.   Additionally, the American Health Care Act furthers the goal of  providing the States with greater flexibility in managing their  Medicaid programs by providing States with the option to implement two  additional opportunities: work requirements and block grants for  Medicaid.   When the Affordable Care Act was being debated, some of the most  consistent complaints that we heard throughout the discussion came from  Governors and State representatives expressing concerns about the  negative consequences that they saw on the horizon.   This time around, we chose to engage our State counterparts in the  discussion and listen to their input as we designed the bill; and at  the top of their list was a desire to see the work requirements built  into the Medicaid and the expansion populations, and the opportunity to  work with Medicaid as a block grant.    Republicans trust that States know what works for their respective  populations, and we are not going to stand in the way of States seeking  to design Medicaid programs that work for them.   Finally, the American Health Care Act provides additional resources  to bolster State safety net providers. The bill provides increases to  the Community Health Center Fund, offers enhanced funding to support  the safety net providers in States that did not expand Medicaid, and  ends the cuts to Disproportionate Share Hospital payments, cuts that  are going to occur under current law on October 1 of this year.   We are committed to ensuring that our local providers can continue to  deliver lifesaving care and that the American Health Care Act turns  this commitment into action. For the millions of Americans in rural and  medically underserved areas, these actions  [[Page H4119]]  will provide needed relief that was undercut by the Affordable Care Act  and will allow these Americans to continue to have access to care.   Moving forward, together, these efforts will provide meaningful  reform and relief for the States and for the individuals seeking health  care. We are stabilizing the markets, reforming Medicaid in the most  substantive and consequential way in its 52-year history, and ensuring  that all Americans can maintain access to care through local safety net  providers.   We do recognize there is still more work to be done in health care,  and that is why we only consider the American Health Care Act to be the  beginning. It is the key that gets us through the door into additional  health reform. From here, we will work with Secretary Price at the  Department of Health and Human Services to further deregulate the  marketplace and increase consumer choice in the healthcare markets, and  we will enhance the American Health Care Act with additional  legislative efforts to further the goal of lowering healthcare costs.   Mr. Speaker, this should be a very exciting time in health care. With  all of the knowledge that has been gained over the years in the  practice of medicine, I am humbled to be here today speaking in support  of this legislation.   It will begin the much-awaited process of unwinding the Affordable  Care Act and will finally return patients to the center of health care.                                time  0945     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 308, I call up  the bill (H.R. 2192) to amend the Public Health Service Act to  eliminate the non-application of certain State waiver provisions to  Members of Congress and congressional staff, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 2192.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, after 7 years, we have heard the stories from our  constituents, from our patients, from our friends, from our families  who have suffered under the Affordable Care Act. Today, we will have a  chance to vote on a plan that will rescue and revitalize the market and  lower costs and increase flexibility for patients to choose and keep a  health insurance plan that works for them and their family. However,  before we can do that, we have to pass a bill that will ensure that  Members of Congress and their staffs are treated the same way as the  rest of America.   So let's be clear. We firmly believe that Members of Congress should  live by the same rules as everyone else, period. The bill we are  considering now will make a simple technical correction to ensure that  the American Health Care Act and its amendments apply equally to  everyone when signed into law.   Over the last several months, we have worked thoughtfully and  thoroughly with our colleagues in the Senate to achieve our shared goal  of repealing and replacing ObamaCare. Throughout these discussions, we  have come to better appreciate and better understand the other  Chamber's reconciliation limitations. As a result, we have drafted the  American Health Care Act with constant awareness of what the slightest  misstep may mean for the legislation's privileged status or that 51- vote threshold in the other body.   Some might say it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a  needle than to draft House policy to Senate procedure, but we are  confident that we have achieved that challenging feat.   One of the limitations we have come to respect is that no committee  other than the Senate Committee on Finance or the Senate Committee on  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions can receive a jurisdictional  referral. For example, if we were to cross-reference multi-State plans  established by the Affordable Care Act, we would get a referral to the  Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee because  those plans are under the Office of Personnel Management.                                time  1115    So let's be clear, congressional healthcare operates as a small group  plan within the District of Columbia's SHOP Exchange. This was a  decision that was made by the Obama administration.   So for waivers impacting the essential health benefits of age rating,  which impacts both the individual and small group markets, Members of  Congress and our staffs would be treated the same. As far as community  rating, this impacts only the individual market, so no group plans,  including Members of Congress or our staffs, would be impacted.   Even so, in an attempt to be crystal clear, today we are passing a  bill, out of fairness and transparency, to ensure that Congress  operates under the same laws as private citizens, a principle that both  Republicans and Democrats should support.   My thanks to Representative McSally for her leadership on this issue.  Her bill helps deliver us a step closer to fulfilling our promise.  Today we will fulfill our promise to provide relief from the higher  costs and the dwindling choices for patients under the Affordable Care  Act. Today we will repeal and replace ObamaCare with a better solution.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Ms. McSally), the author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), the vice chairman of the Health Subcommittee on  Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Olson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), a valuable member of the Health Subcommittee  on the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I wish to now speak to the underlying MacArthur  amendment that the McSally bill is here to modify. The MacArthur  amendment specifically would allow States to waive three of ObamaCare's  costliest mandates. Let me stress that again. It would allow States-- not require States; it would allow States to waive three of ObamaCare's  costliest mandates, essential health benefits, age ratings, and  community rating.   In waiving these Federal mandates, health insurers would not be  allowed to discriminate by gender or preexisting condition, and no one  would be denied coverage, period.   Here is how it works: a State may apply to waive essential health  benefits or to increase the age rating ratio from the bill's underlying  5-to-1 ratio. They may also change the way individuals who have not  maintained continuous coverage are charged for their healthcare plan,  but only if the State has a risk-sharing program in place, like the  Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program established by the Palmer- Schweikert amendment.   In order to receive a waiver, a State must explain to the Secretary  of Health and Human Services how the program will reduce average  premiums for patients, increase enrollment for residents, stabilize the  State's health insurance market, stabilize premiums for individuals  living with preexisting conditions, or increase the patient's  healthcare options.   It is important to note that in providing assistance to reduce  premiums or other out-of-pocket costs, for individuals who may be  subject to an increase in their monthly premiums because they reside in  a State with an approved waiver, have a preexisting condition, are  uninsured because they have not maintained continuous coverage and they  purchase health insurance on the individual market, there will be $138  billion to assist with premium assistance.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would point out that within the State of  Illinois, there were eight plans in 2015. There are five plans in 2017  with a 57 percent increase in premiums.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Johnson), a valuable member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, directed to the Chair, I would just make  note of the fact in North Carolina, there were three plans offered in  2015, down to two plans in 2017, premium increase of 82 percent.   Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Walberg), another member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), another valuable member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee and a member of the Health Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I would point out that, in the State of  Florida, there were 10 insurance plans available in the individual  market in 2015, down to 5 plans in 2017, with a 24 percent premium  increase.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Collins), who is a very valuable member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Dunn), who is a very valuable Member of Congress and a  fellow physician.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Griffith), who is a valuable member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe), who is a fellow physician and the chairman of the  House Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Tennessee (Mrs. Black), the chairman of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), the vice chairman of the Health Subcommittee on  the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the full Committee on Energy and  Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 20 seconds to the gentleman from  Oregon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), the vice chairman of the Subcommittee on  Health.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Rice).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   I do want to take a minute today to thank the superior team we have  in the House Legislative Counsel. They have put in many man hours and  woman hours to draft this bill that is being considered here in the  House today. Specifically I want to thank Ed Grossman, Jessica Shapiro,  Michelle Vanek, and Jesse Cross for their devotion to the people of the  United States in helping us draft this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today to correct a technical problem that  exists with trying to draft to Senate rules with the House legislation.  Recognizing the problem, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) has  introduced a straightforward and practical bill to fix the problem. It  is a simple 2-page bill that, when the American  [[Page H4149]]  Health Care Act becomes law, Members of Congress and congressional  staff will be treated the same way as every other citizen. That is only  right, and it is only proper.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
