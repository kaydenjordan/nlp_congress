 Mr. President, I rise today to honor and  recognize Mr. Eric Atkinson of Topeka, KS.   Growing up on a farm outside of Winfield, KS, Eric would listen to  the radio at night as his way to stay connected with current events.  Captivated by the transmissions that reached him, he became involved  with radio in high school, resulting in a lifelong passion for  broadcasting. Eric graduated from Kansas State University with a  broadcasting degree and worked several jobs in radio, as well as on the  family farm, before the opportunity to host ``Agriculture Today''  arose. He would go on to host the radio program for 39 years,  broadcasting over 9,000 shows and interviewing hundreds of agriculture  experts and professionals about the issues most relevant to Kansas  agriculture.   In the 39 years Eric hosted ``Agriculture Today,'' he made it his  goal for the show to serve as a platform for agriculture professionals  to share their expertise. He made an effort to ask the most relevant  questions and discuss important research topics during his time on air.  Throughout his time on the radio, Eric has been credited as an  accomplished professional who always worked hard to make sure the  issues at hand were easily relatable for farmers across Kansas. His  substantial presence in farm truck radios across the State as the host  of ``Agriculture Today'' will continue to be on the hearts and minds of  farmers and agribusiness officials.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the wonderful impact  Mr. Eric Atkinson has had on the agriculture industry and to honor him  for his 39 years of service to Kansas farmers.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor and  recognize Mr. Chris Leon of Wichita, KS.   Chris started volunteering for Kansas Honor Flight 8 years ago.  Kansas Honor Flight is an all-volunteer organization dedicated to  honoring Kansas veterans of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam by sending  these heroes on an all-expense-paid journey of honor and remembrance to  visit their memorials in Washington, DC. Chris has demonstrated  outstanding leadership in his volunteer work with ALLmetal Recycling,  and thanks to his efforts crushing aluminum cans, Kansas Honor Flight  has been able to send countless veterans on a trip of a lifetime to  Washington, DC. Chris is now 31 years old and continues to demonstrate  his leadership and support for our veterans through his exemplary  volunteer work.   I thoroughly enjoyed meeting Chris on his visit to Washington DC, and  I can't wait to see what he accomplishes  [[Page S2964]]  in the future. It is my honor to congratulate him, and I hope he knows  how much his efforts have contributed to financing the Kansas Honor  Flight Program. His deep love for his country and his desire to give  back to those who have sacrificed so much are truly an inspiration to  us all. I now ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Chris for his  wonderful accomplishments, as well as in wishing him nothing but  success in the future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor and  recognize the staff of the YMCA in Andover, KS.   On Friday, April 29, 2022, an EF-3 tornado touched down in Sedgewick  County, KS, and left a path of destruction nearly 13 miles long behind.  The 165-mile-per-hour winds created by the tornado injured four people  and damaged well over 300 buildings in Andover. One of the buildings  that sustained heavy damage was the Andover YMCA. The damage done by  the tornado would certainly have been much more severe if it wasn't for  the quick thinking of the YMCA staff.   I would like to honor and thank the staff of the Andover YMCA who  helped save those in the building on the evening of the tornado. As the  tornado approached, members of the YMCA staff made announcements on the  loudspeakers and helped direct individuals to the safest areas of the  building, primarily interior locker rooms. As the tornado hit the  building, cars were thrown through walls and windows, with many parts  of the building being completely destroyed. The staff working at the  YMCA that day saved many lives through their quick thinking to move  gym-goers to safety.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Andover YMCA staff,  as well as in thanking them for all they did to keep their fellow  Kansans safe.                            ____________________
