 Mr. Speaker, all due respect to my  colleague from Wyoming, it is not liberty for a woman to be forced to  go to work within weeks of having a child. That is what this bill would  do.   Mr. Speaker, it is not liberty for people over 50 years old to be  required to pay increased fees and increased expenses simply to go to  the hospital, and it is not liberty to have their essential health  benefits stripped away. They might not even be able to go to a  hospital. It is not liberty for 7 million veterans to have a vets tax,  to have their benefits stripped away from an amendment that was  introduced in the middle of the night. That is not liberty. Vote ``no''  on this bill.
