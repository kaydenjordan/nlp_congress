 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness Month. I am wearing purple in support  of the millions of Americans, including my mom, who are living with  Alzheimer's disease.   The nearly 6 million people with Alzheimer's are our sisters, our  brothers, our parents, our grandparents, and our neighbors--our fellow  Americans. Many are suffering in silence because there is so much  stigma around having Alzheimer's.   I want every patient, family member, and caregiver to know that you  matter. Your quality of life matters. Know that you have a champion in  Congress who knows how hard it is for family and caregivers.   That is why I will continue to push for more investments in  Alzheimer's research and care and will continue to fight so CMS  provides equitable access to promising Alzheimer's drugs.   Our fight against this devastating disease is nowhere near done.                            ____________________
