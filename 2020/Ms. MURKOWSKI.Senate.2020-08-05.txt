 Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my  colleague, Senator Blunt, and the effort he has made to really focus in  on how we can ensure there are appropriate levels of testing as we  respond to this COVID pandemic. We recognize that the technologies,  treatments, and vaccines are what will get us there.   In the meantime, there are many men and women across the country who  are doing extraordinary work responding on the healthcare side, as well  as responding as we deal with the economic impact and the economic  fallout due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   There are a lot of challenges--incredible challenges, all over the  country--challenges to the health sector, to our economy, and to our  everyday life. I think it is fair to say that the last 6 months have  been emotionally exhausting for people.   We have heard this before. We are all ready for COVID-19 to be over,  but the virus is not ready to be over with us.   We are adjusting to a new normal, and as we deal with it, I think it  is important to acknowledge the individuals--really, the heroes--in so  many of our communities who have saved lives and really provided a  level of care and compassion throughout it all.   Like all States in the Nation, Alaska has been severely impacted by  this pandemic. Last week was a pretty rough week for us. We were  included among the States with the fastest growing numbers in terms of  rates of transmission. Fortunately, that seems to be tapering a little  bit right now but only with very aggressive measures.    In my hometown of Anchorage, our mayor has resumed the hunker-down  mode for us in terms of restaurants and bars being closed to indoor  dining or a recognition that many of the advances we had been able to  move forward on are now being ratcheted back. There are also additional  travel restrictions.   For us, it is a time of year when our communities all over the State  would be welcoming droves of tourists, all coming to enjoy the best of  Alaska, but this year, our season is all but eliminated, almost  nonexistent. Certainly, when it comes to recognizing the volume of  tourists the cruise industry provides to Alaska, those have all been  canceled. The flights that people would make to the State have been  made more difficult by mandatory quarantine for our travelers. It has  not impacted just the tourism sector; it has impacted the oil industry,  the service industry, and our fisheries.   As I mentioned, as difficult as these economic times are, the most  important thing we all need to be focused on is the health and safety  of our people.   I have tremendous appreciation and gratitude for all the healthcare  workers and the individuals who work to protect Alaskans on a daily  basis.   In Alaska, we are extremely fortunate to have our COVID-19 health  response led by Dr. Anne Zink. She is our State's chief medical  officer. She, along with her team at the Division of Public Health, has  been doing a great job under Governor Dunleavy's leadership to  implement and communicate clear public health guidelines from the  beginning of this unpredictable event. I think if you have an  opportunity to meet Dr. Zink, she just projects calm. She projects  confidence. She projects assurance.   She has absolutely earned the trust of Alaskans throughout this  difficult time. She has done so not only because of her demeanor but  really how she leads. She leads by example in modeling the behavior  that she is encouraging all Alaskans to follow. She has probably taken  social distancing and teleworking to a new level, as she teleworks from  a yurt outside of her family home in Palmer.   She was able to take a small group of Alaskans to some villages--more  remote villages in this State with Dr. Eastman from Health and Social  Services when he came to Alaska. It was at a time when most of these  communities were very, very reticent--as many still are--to allow  anyone in from the outside for fear of transmitting the virus. She not  only led this trip very safely, but then, when she returned to her  home, she led the example of self-quarantining for 14 days to ensure  that anything she might have been exposed to was not going to be shared  with those whom she loved. Her priority has been and continues to be  flattening the curve, slowing the spread.   We know in our State that we are just a little more isolated. We are  more separate. We are more remote. But we know that we are not immune  from any disease of this type. That is surely evidenced by our history.   In 1918, when the Spanish flu--the last global pandemic--hit our  State, more people died per capita in Alaska than almost anywhere else  in the world. In many of our small and Native villages, 70 percent, 80  percent of the population was wiped out literally in a few-day period.  It is hard not to think about that when we face this current pandemic.   In fact, Alaska was one of the very first States in the country to  put together a coordinated response to the challenges presented by  COVID. This was back in January.   On January 28, there was a chartered plane carrying U.S. consulate  personnel and citizens from an area of China that had been at the  center of the outbreak. That plane landed in Anchorage. The passengers  had to debark the plane in order to refuel. They were moving to  California.   We had a situation where there was a pretty quick scramble. Dr. Zink  led her team, and they were able to mobilize very quickly and very  efficiently to ensure a safe operation that was successful in ensuring  the protection and the health and safety of all who were involved. They  opened up a terminal there at Ted Stevens International Airport. They  created a quarantine unit that delivered not one but two health  screenings to over 200 passengers and crew members. It was a pretty  extraordinary event that they were able to put together in very, very  short order.   Those who were part of that said Dr. Zink's comments on this effort  really reflect her strong leadership.   Dr. Zink noted:         It is easy to stay focused on all that we had to do in a       short period of time to prepare and respond, but at the end       of the day, this mission was about people. It was about       American citizens, some of whom were working to serve our       country. It was about families, and it was about helping each       other in a time of need.    Dr. Zink has been doing extraordinary work as we have dealt with  challenging issues as they relate to quarantine after travel, travel  restrictions around the States that have been extraordinarily limiting.   She has worked with her team to put together plans of operation and  protocols so that our fisheries can be successfully prosecuted, and  they have  [[Page S4897]]  been a mark of success in terms of being able to identify and then  isolate and then keep the virus from transmitting.   She is now very, very focused on how we safely return our kids back  to school. I had a long conversation with her a few days back. She says  that this is the ultimate challenge in that it is not just how we  reopen schools but how we keep our schools open after that. That is our  challenge.   She shared with me--she said: I thought that putting together the  plans and the protocols for the seafood processors was going to be  challenging and difficult in these very remote communities where they  have limited healthcare in the event that you have the virus spread.  That was difficult, but getting our schools open and keeping them open  safely--this is the biggest challenge.   She said that schools are now her new seafood processors. So she is  taking up the challenge aggressively.   Dr. Zink reminds us that at the end of the day, what we have to stay  focused on is keeping people safe, keeping our families and our workers  safe. This is a moment about all of us and how we respond during this  great time of need.   I am extraordinarily thankful for Dr. Zink's leadership, both out in  front and behind the scenes as she works with the many extraordinary  Alaskans who are seeking to make a difference as we take on the daily  challenges and battles that face us with the COVID-19 response   With that, I yield the floor.
