 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Pallone for  yielding the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan legislation  with Representative Kim Schrier, the PREVENT HPV Cancers Act.   Mr. Speaker, if Dr. Francis Collins, the head of the NIH, called a  press conference today and announced that we had found a cure for  cancer, there would be cause for celebration.   Well, since 2006, there has been a safe and effective vaccine that  prevents six types of cancer, including HPV-related cancers, including  cervical cancer and throat cancer. It has been a remarkable  development. The problem is that with these HPV-related cancers, there  are no screening tests for many of these cancers, other than cervical  cancer, for which there is a screening test. So you have to rely on  prevention in order to avoid ever contracting these types of cancers.   The other problem is that during the pandemic, there has been a  dramatic drop-off in childhood vaccinations. It is very troubling. All  childhood vaccinations have fallen way off, but particularly with the  cancer-preventing HPV vaccine.   According to data from CDC, HPV vaccinations fell by almost 64  percent for children ages 9 to 12, and they fell 71 percent for young  people ages 13 to 17 compared to the previous two years. Last year  alone, more than 1 million doses were missed.   Mr. Speaker, here is what is also troubling, the trends that are  here: There is a distinct rise among men and HPV-related cancers. Four  out of ten HPV-related cancers occur among men: a lot of throat cancer.  There are now 14,000 men annually being diagnosed with HPV-related  cancers. That is a five-fold increase over the past 20 years.   We can tackle this problem by helping educate families and parents  all across America to avoid these catastrophic diagnoses and save lives  in doing it.   The PREVENT HPV Cancers Act builds on work the CDC is already doing  to raise awareness about gynecological cancers through Johanna's Law  and includes HPV and HPV-related cancers in the national public  awareness campaign to educate providers, parents, and the general  public about the lifesaving HPV vaccine. This is especially important  in rural areas where there has also been a very dramatic drop-off.   I thank my friends back home at the Moffitt Cancer Center, Florida's  only NCI-designated cancer center, Dr. Anna Giuliano, who is an expert  in the field, for educating me, and for bringing together advocates  across the country.   I thank Chairman Pallone, Chair Eshoo, Ranking Member McMorris  Rodgers, and Chairman Guthrie very much for their help, and Dr. Burgess  as well for his support. Thank you for making this a bipartisan effort.   I also thank Stephen Holland with the majority staff and Kristen  Shatynski with the minority staff.   Mr. Speaker, to the parents and families, it is vitally important to  know that you can prevent your children from ever contracting cancer  through the HPV vaccine. It is safe and effective, and more parents  need to understand the import of doing this.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption, a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 1550, the  PREVENT HPV Cancers Act.                                time  1545
