 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, while I appreciate my friend and colleague  from Virginia and his concern about this issue, I have to oppose the  amendment because it would prevent the administration from continuing  its important work to finalize proposed rules to examine the exposure  limits for beryllium in construction and shipyard industries.   Mr. Chairman, regulations to protect worker health are vital and  necessary; however, all voices should be heard through proper notice  and comment period. Unfortunately, in the last days of the previous  administration, OSHA expanded its 2017 final rule without allowing for  proper notice and comment from many impacted industries.   The public comment period is an essential part of upholding our  democratic values because it ensures that Americans will have their  voices heard in the Federal Government's regulatory process. People  need to have the confidence that Federal agencies are open to their  insights and constructive criticism and that their concerns will not be  circumvented at the last minute.   So I encourage Members to oppose this amendment and allow OSHA to get  back to work to issue a regulation that has undergone the proper review  and protects the health of workers.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to Mr. Comer.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
