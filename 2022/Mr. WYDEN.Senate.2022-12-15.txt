 Mr. President, colleagues, I would strongly urge  opposition to the Scott motion. The Scott motion would strip funding  the IRS needs very much to go after wealthy tax cheats who are refusing  to pay taxes they already owe. The most recent IRS Commissioner, a  Republican appointee, estimated that the amount of taxes owed that are  not collected could be as much as $1 trillion per year.   Working Americans--firefighters and nurses--who pay their taxes with  every paycheck believe that the IRS must have the resources it needs to  go after the sophisticated, wealthy tax cheats at the top, but powerful  special interests who don't want to pay what they already owe are lying  to the American people about how the additional IRS funding will be  used.   I urge my colleagues to strongly oppose the Scott motion.
