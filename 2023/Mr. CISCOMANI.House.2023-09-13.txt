 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Arizona's 2023  Teacher of the Year, Mr. Ty White, a chemistry teacher at Wilcox High  School in Wilcox, Arizona.   Mr. White, known for his dedication to his students in and out of the  classroom, embodies all that a parent wants to see in their children's  teachers.   He serves as a founding board member of InSimEd, a nonprofit that  helps students participate in STEM-related experiential learning  opportunities. He also sponsors other initiatives at Wilcox High School  aimed at finding ways for his students to gain real world industry  experiences.   Mr. White has been widely honored by other organizations across the  country, including being recognized as the 2023 National Rural  Education Association's National Teacher of the Year, the Air and Space  Force Association's Arizona Teacher of the Year, and the first runner- up for the Air and Space Force Association's National Teacher of the  Year.   His commitment to the next generation is unmatched. I am incredibly  proud to have him in our district. I know his students will walk away  from his class and the programs he runs with lifelong lessons.   Because of his tireless efforts, people in my district are developing  an interest in STEM fields and growing their love for learning.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent Ty White and the committed  educators like him. Congratulations to Mr. White on this well-deserved  recognition.                        HIGHLIGHTING THE TOWN OF PIMA     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the town of  Pima, one of the many unique and special rural communities in my  district. This town has a long history of bravery, service, and  sacrifice.   This town, during World War II, lost 27 men, accounting for the  greatest loss suffered by any community in the country on a per capita  basis.   Today, a memorial to these men stands at the local high school. I was  able to spend some time in Pima over the August work period, and I had  the opportunity to visit their local fire station.   Like many communities across the country, these firefighters are all  a volunteer force. I was inspired by these individuals' commitment to  their community, running toward the danger when their neighbors need  them most.   It is clear that these Arizonans have a strong dedication to not only  each other and their community, but service to our country as a whole.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent them in Congress.                            ____________________
