 Mr. Speaker, the Republican plan to repeal and  replace the Affordable Care Act is an exercise in smoke and mirrors.   This proposal would give tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans while  burdening the hardworking families with higher healthcare costs. The  Republican plan also allows soaring new healthcare costs for our  seniors and shortens the life of the Medicare trust fund, endangering  seniors and disabled Americans who depend on Medicaid coverage. This is  completely unacceptable to Floridians.   We need to hear from the Congressional Budget Office about what this  bill would really mean in numbers. The American people deserve to  understand what the Republicans are trying to do with their health  care.   I will continue to fight to ensure that Floridians with preexisting  conditions don't have to worry about losing their healthcare coverage,  and that young adults can stay on their parents' insurance until they  reach age 26, and that we are going to do all we can to make health  care affordable and accessible for all Americans and not just for a  select few.                            ____________________
