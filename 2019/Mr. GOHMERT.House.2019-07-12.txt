 Mr. Speaker, it has been an interesting day. It is  amazing we voted on a National Defense Authorization Act. That is  normally a bipartisan action here in the House. It is normally quite a  compromise. But this NDAA didn't end up being that way because it had  so many different leftist dreams inserted into it that had nothing to  do with the national defense. It is rather a shame. It is something  that has to be worked on. We have got to be able to defend ourselves  and properly pay those who are doing so, or trying to do so.   It was a sad day that we did not pass that with the same  bipartisanship that we have had in the past. I hope that changes for  the future. There are only a few areas like that where we have had  bipartisanship in the past, and I hope we can get back to it.   One area where there hasn't been a lot of bipartisanship at all has  occurred in the area of the great tragedy, crisis, emergency now, that  is occurring on our southern border. It is amazing because we have  heard for months that there was a manufactured crisis, it wasn't really  a crisis on our southern border, that President Trump was just making  it up, that Republicans were just making it up. There was no crisis  there. Nothing to see. We can just keep moving along because there is  no problem on the southern border.   Well, there was a crisis. There wasn't a disaster occurring there.  And by virtue of the fact that people in other countries saw that the  majority of the House of Representatives was sending them messages  about what they were doing and saying here, that there was not going to  be any wall, there was not going to be the kind of border security that  we should have, and, in fact, more and more people seem to be  advocating that we have no border at all.  [[Page H5771]]    The fact is that if a nation has no borders, it is no longer a  nation. And yet, I know there are those here who think America is  horrible, that it is this horrendous, imperialistic hegemony, always  trying to take advantage of others. They refuse to face the fact there  has never been a more generous nation than the United States. If we  were imperialistic, they would not be speaking German in Germany, or  French in France, or Japanese in Japan. This is not an imperialist  nation. We are not out to colonize the world.   And it is amazing how some who would accuse us of that, they are  doing what has become so common here in Washington, and that is  projecting. If somebody does something inappropriate, harmful, or  hateful, then they accuse their opponents of doing exactly what they  did.   We will be getting into some of that type of projecting as we  continue in our Judiciary Committee in the next couple of weeks,  continuing to take up the Mueller report.   They know now, there is no question, the Clinton campaign paid a  foreign agent to gather information, from what he has since admitted,  who probably worked for Putin--could have very well worked for Putin,  that is--and gave false information that was used and was called a  dossier--of course, giving dossiers a bad name--that was used to try to  stop a Presidential candidate. And, at the same time, it was used by a  newly weaponized Department of Justice, FBI, and intelligence  community, in at least part of it, some at the very top, to try to win  an election. We hadn't had that before.   Now, we have known for some time now that J. Edgar Hoover was at the  FBI so long that he began to use the FBI, not as a political weapon to  win for one party or another, but just as his weapon to be able to get  what he wanted from presidents, regardless of their party.   I recall seeing the FBI interview, retired, talking about Hoover  sending them to watch the apartment of a woman with whom President  Kennedy was supposedly having an affair, and they watched it be  burglarized. They didn't report it or didn't file charges. In fact,  they wanted to find out what exactly was stolen during the burglary.   They never reported it because their job was to gather information  for the head of the FBI. The head of the FBI could then use it to  prevent a president from doing anything the FBI director didn't want  him to do, which, as I understand it, gave rise to the term limits for  an FBI director. I think that was a very good thing.   I thought it was a bad thing when President Obama extended Robert  Mueller's 10-year term by 2 years. He was a fiasco. He was a disaster.  He ran off thousands and thousands of years of experience. And I can't  help but think that if Mueller had not instituted a policy, personnel  policy, that ran off thousands and thousands of years of experience,  some of his best people around the country and the world, that there  would not have been the atmosphere that existed with McCabe as acting  FBI director. People like Strzok in charge of counterintelligence, Lisa  Page, people who used the FBI as just a political tool, a weaponized  political tool, and people in the DOJ who we are finding out more about  all the time, whether it is Loretta Lynch and, before that, Eric  Holder.   But if Mueller had not run off so many of our best long-serving FBI  agents, I still continue to believe there would have been people around  when Strzok, McCabe, and others were trying to use the FBI as a  political weapon. There would have been longer-serving people who would  have said: You can't do this. This is not what the FBI is about.   But Mueller wanted nothing but yes people around him: people who  would salute him, figuratively speaking, and the flag and do exactly  what he said without reservations. So he got much younger agents in  charge all around the country and the world, people that would not be  able to say: Sir, I know that seems like a good idea, but I was here 20  years ago when we tried that, and it was a disaster. I would recommend  looking back at the failure before, before you push us into this new  type of activity.    And, of course, he wouldn't listen to anybody when he wasted millions  of dollars on computer and software programs. But that, to me, was not  near the biggest problem as the damage he had done with the FBI.   He came out with a report that is just abysmal. I mean, when I was an  assistant district attorney, fresh out of law school, and I was asked  to put something together about this case or that case, what I put  together was a lot better than anything Mueller put together. That was  a political document.   And I know I have some Republican friends, media friends, who think  the new Horowitz IG report is going to be just breathtaking. But the  trouble is, he already had one report. As I told him in our hearing, he  spent about 500 pages documenting the most outrageous and unbelievable  bias and prejudice against a candidate, Donald Trump, and in favor of a  candidate, Hillary Clinton. He documents just outrageous, blatant  bigotry against a party, a candidate. And, as I told him at the  hearing: I think you realize, as you gathered all of that devastating  evidence of outrageous prejudice in the FBI and the DOJ, and you  realize, whoops, Democrats got me here. This is not going the way my  friends would want it to go, so perhaps I better throw them a bone,  which he didn't just throw them a bone, he threw them the whole rib-eye  and said: Even though we got 500 pages documented of the most  ridiculous, outrageous prejudice and bias, and even though every  investigation ended up with a conclusion that was totally consistent  with all the bigotry and bias and prejudice, I find that there was no  relationship between the outrageous prejudice and the conclusion to the  cases coming out exactly consistent with the bias.   It was ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous.   So he showed us that he was not capable of giving us a proper  conclusion in the first Horowitz inspector general report. So I would  just encourage people, don't get your hopes up that he is going to man  up and do the right thing, or woman up, whichever you prefer, in the  next Horowitz IG report. I hope he does. I pray he does do the right  thing. But that remains to be seen.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I met Ross Perot while I was a student at  Texas A&M. He was very much involved in activities at the Memorial  Student Center, and he came more than once.   I owed the Army 4 years for the scholarship I was using at the time,  and I got to meet this guy that had gone to the Naval Academy, served  his country, and loved this country. Nobody could rival the love he had  for the United States of America.   He was willing to lay down his life, if called upon to do it, for his  country. But then, again, Ross Perot was willing to give everything he  had for anything that he felt should be done.   Having grown up in the town of Mount Pleasant just down the road from  Texarkana and New Boston, I heard about him for years before I met him  in college. He was a legend even then, even though EDS had not grown to  nearly the heights that it would under his leadership.   But everything that he was involved in, whether it was charitable,  whether it was business, he demanded truth. He demanded the best that  anyone could give, and hearing from so many people who worked for him,  he rewarded truth, he rewarded hard work, and he has a lot to show for  it.   They say, we are told in scripture that where your heart is, there  your treasure will be. It is really uplifting to see a man who has been  able to store up treasure without a dollar value, and, yet, has done so  well in business. His son, Ross Jr., has been a friend, has been  helpful, and I know we all grieve for the family.   But as a family of believers, I know that we will all get to see him  some day. The question to me is: In heaven, will we all have the same  accent? It would be a shame to lose his. I hope we still get to hear  that same sound.   But some were--and I was one of them in 1992--wondering about him  running for President. But you ultimately realize, this man has never  changed. Truth means everything to him. Not harming the country that he  loved, and he served was uppermost in his mind. It never went away.  That is why he did so much for soldiers, sailors, marines, and the  Coast Guard. He would do anything for those serving our country,  including invest massive amounts to try to free POWs.   He was an extraordinary man, and if he saw somebod was not being as  truthful as he thought they should be, then he was going to get  involved.    He was a man that will be sorely missed, but what a legacy, what a  history, and what a love for God and this country that we miss already.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 2 o'clock and 53 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday, July  15, 2019, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
