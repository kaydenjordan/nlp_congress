 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 100th  anniversary of the American Legion Auxiliary. I appreciate the  opportunity to speak about this esteemed organization and recognize  their efforts supporting American servicemembers, veterans, and their  families. The centennial celebration is a historic occasion for the  State of Michigan, as well as the entire Nation.   The American Legion Auxiliary was founded in 1919 to support the  efforts of the men in the American Legion. The women of the Auxiliary  saw an opportunity to embark on a mission of their own, to not only  support active servicemembers and veterans of World War I but also  their communities and families. This mission resonated among others and  by November 1920, there were 1,342 Auxiliary units founded across 43  States.   During World War II, the Auxiliary jumped into action again to serve  brave servicemembers joining the fight. They established scholarships  for students to train as nurses and fulfill needs on the frontlines,  donated six mobile blood units to the Red Cross, and established an  Emergency Voluntary Committee to support the war effort. At the  beginning of World War I, there were approximately 500,000 enrolled  members. After World War II, membership rose rapidly and peaked in 1955  with 1,001,545 members. Today, the American Legion Auxiliary consists  of approximately 800,000 members who continue to support troops and  veterans across the world in war and peacetime.   Communities throughout the State of Michigan, as well as across the  country, benefit from the Auxiliary's advocacy and outreach. This past  year, their work has culminated into over 40 million volunteer hours  and $37 million to charitable efforts across the United States. Their  own charitable causes include Girls Nation and State, the Auxiliary  Emergency Fund, and American Legion Child Welfare Foundation, as well  as numerous scholarships and helping to fund veteran support services.   In addition to philanthropic work, the Auxiliary has advocated for  veterans' rights and increased support for those who have served our  Nation. They have advocated for legislation such as the GI bill,  legislation that would expand U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs  benefits, and efforts to help end homelessness among veterans.   It is my great pleasure to congratulate the American Legion Auxiliary  on its centennial milestone and recognize the meaningful impact they  continue to have in the State of Michigan and across our Nation. I ask  my colleagues to join me in congratulating its members and their  dedication to support servicemembers, veterans, and their families by  promoting fellowship, patriotism, peace, and security throughout the  world.                            ____________________
