 ROSE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.  Res. 328.   I applaud my colleague, Mr. Casten, for his thoughtful leadership on  this initiative.   For too long, the financial exploitation of our seniors has been  swept under the rug. It is truly heartbreaking to hear stories of  Tennesseans' parents, siblings, and friends being taken advantage of,  often by those they trust the most. It is time to equip our friends,  families, and neighbors with the knowledge and tools they need to guard  against the heartbreak of their hard-earned security and stability  being stolen in the golden years of life.   Age brings many of life's most difficult challenges, but financial  exploitation should not be one of them. It is incumbent upon us to  correct this injustice and encourage the many community partnerships  which work to do the same, including the work of our  [[Page H3318]]  men and women in law enforcement, various nonprofit organizations, and  affiliated regulatory agencies.   Scammers and deceivers hurt good folks across the Sixth District of  Tennessee and across America.   My esteemed colleague from Illinois (Mr. Casten) and I urge our  fellow Members to join us in standing against this despicable injustice  plaguing our country.
