 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my longtime dear  friend Rudy D'Amico, who will be retiring next year as the president  and CEO of the Central Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired,  also known as CABVI.   Rudy and his team at CABVI have touched the lives of so many. Their  resources and services have improved the  [[Page H10158]]  quality of life for so many in our region, including my father, who  spent the last 7 years of his life legally blind and confined to a  wheelchair. CABVI and their compassionate staff enabled him to continue  to serve as a full-time member of the New York State Supreme Court,  despite his disabilities.   Rudy, a veteran of the New York Army National Guard, began his tenure  with CABVI in 2003 as vice president of operations before moving up to  president and CEO in May of 2008. He has overseen significant expansion  and growth at CABVI, including expanding employment services into  Onondaga County, the addition of more than 100 employees, and opening  four base supply centers in Northeastern States.   Along with this work at CABVI, Rudy has also remained deeply involved  in our community. He has served on the board of directors for the  National Association for the Employment of People Who Are Blind, the  New York Vision Rehabilitation Association, and the Community  Foundation of and Oneida Counties.   To my dear friend Rudy D'Amico, thank you for your many years of  service. From a grateful community, we wish you the best of luck in  your retirement. Please sharpen up your golf game.                            ____________________
