 Mr. Speaker, America's economic history is rooted in the  exploitation of labor. It is a lesson worth remembering, but its  history is not one of yesteryears alone.   Our existing trade deals impose an economic model built on cheap  labor, where profits matter more than people. This system undermines  the rule of law with a global race to the bottom.   Trade is not just about goods. It is about people. It is about  communities. It is about workers.   In the agriculture sector alone, one can argue that our continent has  gone from slavery to serfdom. That is why, today, I am introducing the  Independent Labor Secretariat for Fair Trade Deals Act.   We need a trade model that respects workers and holds employers and  workers accountable, with strong mechanisms for labor enforcement.   My bill would establish an independent labor secretariat to monitor  and enforce transnational labor issues, with a wages and standards  working group with expert wage panels to study the impacts on wages,  benefits, labor rights, working conditions, and inequality.   The bill also requires that any trade agreement eligible for  expedited consideration include enforceable labor standards and  protections.   Mr. Speaker, let us dignify the workers who sustain us.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, corporate America and Wall Street are awash  in profits and cash, but American workers haven't had the benefit of a  Federal minimum wage increase in over a decade, while the prices of  everything have gone up--medicine, housing, food, cars. A recent study  found there isn't a single congressional district in our Nation where a  full-time minimum wage worker can afford a two-bedroom apartment.   While many States and cities have raised their own minimum wage  requirements, millions of Americans are stuck at $7.25 an hour.   What does this really mean? A person working full time for minimum  wage takes home an annual salary of just a bit over $15,000 a year.  With inflation, these workers have effectively had their wages cut by  an astonishing 17 percent.   That is why I rise today in support of the Raise the Wage Act, a bill  that will gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 by 2025, lift 27  million American workers out of poverty, give roughly 40 million  Americans a raise--nearly a third of our workforce--and stimulate local  economies as Americans have more money to spend.    Such a raise would put $3,200 in the pockets of more than  128,000 workers just in northern Ohio.   Mr. Speaker, the Raise the Wage Act will dramatically improve the  lives of millions of hardworking people and families and communities  across our country. Let's come together and really help the American  people who are working and pass this much-needed legislation without  delay.
