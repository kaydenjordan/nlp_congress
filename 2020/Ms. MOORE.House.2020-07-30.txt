 Mr. Speaker, year after year since coming to Congress, I  have led efforts in the House to secure funding for Violence Against  Women programs. I was honored to have led the efforts to renew the VAWA  authorizing legislation in 2013. This is personal for me. And I want to  make sure that for all of those who are going through the horror that  domestic violence, they know that they have a place to go or services  and supports to turn to get through those dark days.   VAWA is essential legislation that provides the premier services for  survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. However, that  authorizing language is only as good as we actually fund it. With  domestic violence-related homicides on the rise, now more than ever, we  need these funds and we need these funds right now.   I have offered two amendments to this bill for programs that are in  desperate need for additional funds.   I applaud the committee for their efforts but like so many programs,  the need continues to outpace available resources. The first amendment  I submitted is for the Transitional Housing Program. This program  provides transitional housing and short-term housing assistance for  victims and their children or other dependents. With many victims stuck  at home during the pandemic, access to safe housing can be the  difference between life and death.   I also offered an amendment to increase funding for the Sexual  Assault Services Program. This essential program provides grants to  rape crisis centers and other agencies for survivors of sexual assault.  I am so proud of the work that these programs have done but we cannot  limit the resources required to combat sexual violence in our  communities during these dire times.   I am glad that these amendments have been included in En Bloc and  thank Chairwoman Lowey and Chairman Serrano for their support. I  encourage my colleagues to support this En Bloc.
