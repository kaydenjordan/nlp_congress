 Mr. President, the Supreme Court nomination before us is  of historic importance. We have a nominee whose nomination is clouded  with credible allegations of sexual assault, whose truthfulness before  Congress is questionable, and who showed himself as partisan and  lacking in judicial temperament before this body in his supplemental  hearing.   As of today, more than 2,400 law professors throughout the country  are on record that Judge Kavanaugh's display of lack of judicial  restraint during that hearing is disqualifying. The growing list  includes professors from all political stripes and professors who had  previously supported his nomination. Indeed, former Justice John Paul  Stevens, a highly respected jurist, has taken the unusual step of  publicly opining the same.   Yesterday, I spoke on the Senate floor about why Judge Kavanaugh  should not be confirmed in light of the allegations swirling around  him, his lack of candor with this body, and his demeanor during the  supplemental hearing. But, Mr. President, on the merits as well, Judge  Kavanaugh has not shown himself deserving of elevation to our highest  Court.   Let's start with his overly expansive view of Executive power--a view  that could shield our current President from being held to account for  potential crimes and misdeeds.   Judge Kavanaugh has written and spoken extensively about the need to  shield the President from criminal investigation while in office. He is  on record that, in his opinion, the President has authority under the  Constitution to terminate an independent counsel at will. Indeed, there  is probably no other viable candidate to the seat who has argued more  strenuously in favor of Presidential immunity and the President's  absolute authority to fire a special prosecutor. It is no coincidence,  then, that this President, who is under criminal investigation by a  special counsel, selected Brett Kavanaugh to sit on the Court.   Judge Kavanaugh is clear that, as a matter of policy, Presidents  should be completely immunized from criminal and civil suit while in  office. He writes that ``the President should be free from some of the  burdens of ordinary citizenship.'' For Judge Kavanaugh, freeing the  President of ``burdens'' the rest of us must bear takes precedence over  ensuring the President follows the law.   Judge Kavanaugh's supporters point out that his writings in support  of broad Presidential immunity represent his policy views, not his  constitutional analysis. But his writings do not tell us that he would  uphold Special Counsel Mueller's investigation, nor would he tell us  during his confirmation hearing that he would hold the President to  account for any crimes. In my view, the ``burdens'' of a criminal  investigation do not outweigh the dangers of a criminal occupying the  Oval Office.   There is nothing in the Constitution that immunizes a President from  criminal investigation and prosecution while in office. The drafters  knew how to immunize public officials if they wanted. Members of  Congress, for example, have express immunity ``from arrest or  interrogation for any speech or debate entered into during a  legislative session.'' The speech and debate immunity for Congress is  narrowly tailored. The drafters gave no immunity--narrow or broad--to  the President or members of his Cabinet. While Judge Kavanaugh claims  to be a strict constructionist, I have no confidence he would stick to  the text of the Constitution and not grant the President immunity.   There is evidence in the public record that close associates and even  family of the President may have conspired with Russia, and we have the  President's own inexplicable behavior cozying up to and trying to curry  favor with Vladmir Putin. There is abundant evidence in the public  record that the President has worked to undermine the investigation  into Russian interference in our election and investigation into  himself. And we have sworn testimony from the President's former  personal lawyer that the President directed commission of two campaign- related felonies. If the President has committed crimes, he should be  held responsible, just like the rest of us.   Judge Kavanaugh has said he would ``put the final nail in'' Morrison  v. Olson. Morrison v. Olson is the 1988, 8-to-1 decision written by  Chief Justice Rehnquist that upheld the Independent Counsel Act. That  act was passed in the aftermath of Watergate to curb Executive abuse  and mitigate the obvious conflict of interest the U.S. Department of  Justice would have investigating the President. Judge Kavanaugh sides  with the lone dissent in that case and with the idea that the President  should be able to fire the person who is investigating him--with no  check. If the constitutionality of Special Counsel Mueller's  investigation comes before the Supreme Court--and it is likely that it  will--there is every reason to believe Justice Kavanaugh would have his  chance to hammer in that nail.   Judge Kavanaugh espouses a ``unitary executive'' theory of the  separation of powers. Hidden behind this legalese is a simple and  dangerous idea: that the President holds absolute power over the  executive branch. Under his theory, President Trump could actually fire  Special Counsel Mueller because he uncovered wrongdoing by the  President. In plain terms, he would let the fox raid the henhouse.   Judge Kavanaugh's theory that the Constitution requires no checks on  the President's authority strains that document to the point of  breaking. Our entire constitutional system of separation of powers is  built on the principle of checks and balances--so that one branch of  government does not accumulate and exercise an inordinate amount of  power.   Under DOJ regulations, the Attorney General, or Acting Attorney  General if the Attorney General is recused, may only appoint a special  counsel if it is warranted and there is a conflict with the Department  or other ``extraordinary circumstances.'' Only the Attorney General-- not the President--may remove a special counsel. And the Attorney  General--or in the case of Special Counsel Mueller, the Deputy Attorney  General--may only do so for ``misconduct, dereliction of duty,  incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause, including  violation of Departmental policies.'' The DOJ regulations provide  appropriate and constitutionally sound checks on the executive's  authority.   The American people deserve to know the truth about Russia's attack  on our democracy. They deserve to know whether Candidate Trump or his  campaign was part of the attack. And they deserve to know all the facts  behind the President's efforts to stop DOJ's investigation into Russian  interference and any Trump collusion. The President should not be able  to hide the truth and the facts by firing Special Counsel Mueller.   And that is not all. There is open speculation that the President may  pardon close associates. His family. Even himself. The new Justice may  be called upon to determine the scope of the President's power to  pardon and whether that power may be exercised for corrupt purpose.  Given Judge Kavanaugh's overly expansive view of Executive authority, I  am concerned he would set no limits on the President's power to pardon  and would allow a Presidential pardon even if wielded to obstruct  justice.   At this point in our history, with so many questions whether the  President, his family, or others close to him committed crimes, the  American public must be assured that the new Justice will provide a  check on the President. And not give him a blank check to commit  crimes.   I am proud that New Mexico is a majority minority State, but I am  really worried that a Justice Kavanaugh will not protect minority  rights. Ten percent of our State's population is Native American. Judge  Kavanaugh, however,  [[Page S6627]]  has shown a distinct hostility to indigenous people's rights. For  example, in Rice v. Cayetano, he argued in the Supreme Court against a  voting system limited to Native Hawaiians, arguing they should not be  treated like Tribes even though Native Hawaiians and Tribes share a  history of forced assimilation. In that case, he represented the Center  for Equal Opportunity--a fervently anti-affirmative action group. While  the case was pending, he authored an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal  arguing that ``any racial group with creative reasoning can qualify as  an Indian tribe.'' He called the voting system a ``naked-racial spoils  system.'' Such an offensive view demonstrates a level of  misunderstanding--perhaps even willful ignorance unworthy of a nominee  to our highest Court. While the Court ultimately struck down the voting  system, it did not do so on Mr. Kavanaugh's claimed grounds.   Recently disclosed emails that Judge Kavanaugh wrote as a White House  lawyer confirm he is a threat to indigenous communities. In his view,  if Native peoples are not organized into Tribes and live on  reservations, they are not entitled to any special recognition under  the law. But not all Tribes are alike. Not all indigenous peoples are  organized the same way. Alaska Natives, for example, are organized as  Tribes, villages, and regional corporations. Alaska Natives are  rightfully concerned whether he will protect their rights.   Bottom line: Judge Kavanaugh questions the constitutionality of  programs specifically dedicated to Native Americans--a view that could  upend decades of progress for Indian Country on everything from housing  to government contracting.   As ranking member of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I wrote to the  chair of the Judiciary Committee in August asking for all of Judge  Kavanaugh's documents related to Native issues. The Chair refused my  request. So we don't even know if we have the full extent of emails and  memos from Judge Kavanaugh disparaging Native rights.   But we do know that Judge Kavanaugh is hostile to affirmative action  programs. When he was a White House lawyer, he called Department of  Transportation regulations designed to remedy past and present  discrimination ``a naked racial set-aside.'' But those regulations,  which favored ``socially and economically disadvantaged individuals,''  were upheld by the Federal courts under established equal protection  principles.    While Judge Kavanaugh advocates strongly for ``race neutrality'' when  it comes to distribution of government benefits, he is not so quick to  embrace race-neutral policies when it comes to racial profiling. In the  aftermath of 9/11, in a series of White House emails labeled ``racial  profiling,'' the idea of long-term use of racial profiling at airports  and by law enforcement was raised. Mr. Kavanaugh responded that ``the  people (such as you and I) who generally favor effective security  measures that are race-neutral in fact DO need to grapple--and grapple  now--with the interim question of what to do before a truly effective  and comprehensive race-neutral system is developed and implemented.''  In other words, maybe we use racial profiling in the interim because  coming up with a race-neutral system is so hard.   In New Mexico, almost 49 percent of our population is Hispanic--the  largest percentage of any State. If we were to accept racial profiling  in New Mexico--coupled with our Native population and other minority  groups--over 62 percent of our population would be targeted. That would  be wholly unacceptable, as would be doing away with Federal and State  programs intended to redress past and present discrimination.   One of the most critical roles the courts play is protecting minority  rights, but Judge Kavanaugh's record does not demonstrate he will  fulfill this role. He simply doesn't appear to understand or to  appreciate the discrimination, oppression, the assault that Native  peoples, Hispanics, African Americans, and other groups have faced over  time and continue to face. Supreme Court equal protection jurisprudence  is informed by this history.   Whether it is affirmative action, voting rights, or redistricting, we  must have a Justice on the Court who protects minority rights, and  Judge Kavanaugh has not shown himself to be that Justice.   The same is true for women's reproductive rights. Trump the candidate  promised only to appoint Justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade.  Potential Supreme Court candidates can only make it onto the Federalist  Society list if they will vote to overturn Roe.   Judge Kavanaugh's record does not bode well for women's rights. He  tried to stand in the way of a 17-year-old pregnant girl, an immigrant  held in Federal detention, who wanted an abortion. He would have  required her to find a ``sponsor'' in the United States who would  provide housing for her and allow her to terminate her pregnancy. And  if the Federal Government couldn't find a sponsor, the young woman  could return to the district court in 2 weeks. Of course, the longer a  pregnancy continues, the greater the risk to the woman's health and  safety.   Judge Kavanaugh did not believe these onerous, bureaucratic  requirements represented an ``undue burden'' on the young woman's  constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy. Fortunately, however,  the full DC Court of Appeals did. They quickly overturned the decision  and allowed the young woman to immediately exercise her right.   The American public--Democrats, Republicans, and independents-- support a woman's right to choose. If Judge Kavanaugh would have this  country go back to the days of back-alley abortions, he should have  said so during his confirmation hearings, but he would not. I cannot  vote for a nominee who is not willing to affirm a woman's right to  choose.   A woman's reproductive right is not the only health care right at  risk with Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. Our entire system of health  care rights and benefits under the Affordable Care Act is in jeopardy.  A group of Republican attorney General and Governors has filed suit to  gut critical ACA protections. They want to take away protections from  the millions of Americans with preexisting conditions and allow  insurance companies to discriminate on this basis again. They want to  take away the prohibition against lifetime limits on benefits, and go  back to the days when you could get booted off insurance because you  have high medical expenses. They want to take away the right to cover  children up to age 26, to get free preventive care, and prescription  drug coverage for seniors. And they want to eviscerate Medicaid  expansion, which has given 11 million Americans healthcare they didn't  have before.   The Trump administration has sided with the Republican attorney  Generals and Governors who want to decimate our health care system  despite the President's repeated campaign promises to cover everyone,  protect people with preexisting illnesses, and cover children up to age  26.   This case is now before a Federal court in Texas and will likely make  its way to the Supreme Court. We do not want a Justice who sides with  corporate interests over consumers, who is willing to throw statutory  language and constitutional principles aside to get the results he  wants. I am concerned that a Justice Kavanaugh would do the President's  bidding and gut critical health care rights that Congress has enacted  and that the American people overwhelmingly stand by.   But there is more at stake. In his legal opinions, Judge Kavanaugh  inevitably sides with business and against the environment, workers,  and consumers. His environmental record deserves a spotlight.  Interpreting environmental statutes, Judge Kavanaugh will veer far from  the legal text he claims to honor to reach the result he wants. For  example, Judge Kavanaugh once blocked the Environmental Protection  Agency from protecting ``downwind'' states from nitrogen oxide and  sulfur dioxide coming from ``upwind'' States under the ``Good Neighbor  Provision'' of the Clean Air Act. Nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide  develop into ozone and cause respiratory illnesses and other health  problems. However, the Supreme Court reversed Judge Kavanaugh. In a 6- to-2 decision that included justice Kennedy and Chief Justice Roberts  in the majority, the Court found that Judge Kavanaugh ``rewrites a  decades-old statute whose plain text and structure'' are clear.  [[Page S6628]]    In case after case, whether in dissent or the majority, Judge  Kavanaugh votes against the environment and with industry. He voted to  invalidate EPA rules to regulate emission of greenhouse gasses by  plants and factories, to overturn EPA's mercury and air toxics  standards limiting hazardous emissions from powerplants, to allow EPA  to delay implementation of its methane control rule, to overturn an EPA  rule regulating greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks, to  overturn an EPA decision to revoke a coal company permit that would  harm the environment. This is not the record the American people want  from a Justice likely to rule for decades on the most important  environmental law cases.   His record on matters addressing climate change is especially  troubling. Climate change can hit minorities and low-income communities  the hardest. In New Mexico, traditional land grant and acequia  communities depend on the land to sustain their families. The climate  change-induced drought we are experiencing in New Mexico and the  Southwest threatens our way of life.   If we are looking for a Justice who will put balance back into our  campaign finance system, Judge Kavanaugh is not a likely candidate. He  has been clear that he believes that money equals free speech. So it is  a good bet he will not scrutinize Citizens United or the other Supreme  Court cases that now allow unlimited, dark money to run roughshod over  our campaigns and tear at the fabric of our democracy. Our campaign  finance system is broken beyond repair. Unless we change the rules-- either through Supreme Court decision or congressional action and  constitutional amendment--we will continue to see the kinds of perverse  results we now see where a few superwealthy individuals and big  corporations drown out the many. But we are pretty much assured that a  Justice Kavanaugh will not change the rules that now allow unfettered  dark money to pollute our elections.   It is hard to overstate the importance of the Supreme Court  nomination before the Senate. New Mexicans and the American people want  a nominee who has been 100 percent honest, whose nomination is not  tainted by credible allegations of sexual assault and misconduct. New  Mexicans and the American people want a nominee who will act as a check  on the powerful, but President Trump chose this nominee to do the  opposite.   At this critical point in our Nation's history--when we have a  President who is under DOJ investigation for conspiracy with Russia to  undermine our national election and obstruction of justice, who may  have broken campaign finance laws to win the Presidency--we must have  Justices on the Court who believe in the rule of law, who believe that  no one is above the law, even the President. At this historic juncture,  the American people must have assurance that any judicial nominee will  hold the President true to our laws, true to our Constitution, but  Judge Kavanaugh cannot give the American people this assurance, and I  cannot support his nomination.                            ____________________
