 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment.   What it does is, it sees that in the underlying legislation there is  language that strikes the President's ability to use the resources  within the Department of Defense budget to build a wall or a road along  the southern border. It would be a mistake to take that language out  and--to have that language in there. We need to take the language out  and let the President have the discretion to make these decisions. He  has a mandate from the American people.   The southern border is such a risk that 80 to 90 percent of the  illegal drugs coming through into the United States come from or  through Mexico; 70,000 drug overdose deaths; the violence that comes  from it; tens of millions of illegal aliens in America, and we have  seen unemployment numbers in this country as high as 40 million  throughout this COVID epidemic.   So to tie the President's hands and to take away the resources he has  in front of him now, because it essentially says, no funds heretofore  appropriated may be used either for a wall or a road.   I would say also that I came to this floor and from this very podium  in 2006 with a model that demonstrated how easy it was to build a wall  on the southern border. It is cost effective, and it preserves our  security. This amendment gives the President back the authority to  continue the construction of the wall.   Madam Speaker, I urge its adoption.                                time  1630
