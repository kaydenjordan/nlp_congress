 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of  Ron Voegeli. He passed away on January 1.   Ron was a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and Christian. He  touched countless lives during his 30 years as a member of the Disabled  American Veterans, raising thousands of dollars to purchase vans to  take vets to and from the VA, expanding the Beaufort National Cemetery,  and spending hours each week helping veterans fill out disability  paperwork.   If a Lowcountry vet passed away without family to attend the funeral,  Ron became their family. He often rallied hundreds of others to attend  the burial or perform the ceremony himself. He believed that no veteran  who sacrificed for their country should be laid to rest alone.   When we die, we all hope to hear: ``Well done, good and faithful  servant . . . Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.''   That is how Ron lived his life, and that is what he deserves.                            ____________________
