 Before I get started, Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield  to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), who serves on the  Education and Labor Committee.                 Free Speech at George Washington University     Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Foxx again for her great  leadership.  [[Page H1099]]    Next, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).                                time  1330            Honoring the Life of Raymond G. ``Jerry'' Strawbridge     Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Duncan for his  comments. I appreciate that very much.   Today I rise in honor of Black History Month and the everlasting  resiliency of patriots in the Black community who have risen above  circumstance to live the American Dream.   As we get started, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Tenney), my really good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. I really appreciate  it.  [[Page H1100]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Donalds), my  great friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, on that note, I would like to highlight something that I  want those who are listening to be aware of. As you listen to those of  the Republican Party, those who believe in these conservative values of  love of God, country, family, that as we talk about our history, as we  talk about things we are doing and have overcome and achieved, notice  the sense of hope that we bring to the message. Notice the sense of  unity.   Yes, we look back on the past because we have a lot to learn from the  past. But we look at the past in the way of what we have achieved and  how far we have come, not where we are today. And I want Americans to  think through the last couple of years. Are we tired of being afraid?  Are we tired of being angry? Are we tired of fear? Listen to the  messages of our great history and you will see that this country is a  country of second chances. This country is a place where you come here  no matter what language you speak, how poor you are, you have the  opportunity to live your own American Dream.   It was the Marxist, Karl Marx, who said it very simply. ``The first  battlefield is to rewrite history.'' Why would the Marxists--why would  the hard left want to steal our history, change our history? Because  within our great American history we have pride in our past,  appreciation for our present, and a vision for our future.   We are American people and it is within our DNA that we are hopeful.  And only through the nuances of changing history which, by the way, has  been done since the 1940s by the Progressive, ``father of the public  school system,'' John Dewey, that this change has been happening.                                time  1345    We have talked about the success of Tulsa, a remarkable success. Just  a few decades after the Civil War ended, you have this environment of  success where people could live the American Dream, a little town where  600 businesses were established with over 50 millionaires, and six of  them had their own private planes. It was started back in the early  1900s.   In 1921, that little community was destroyed within 12 hours, not by  the American people, but by Southern Democratic KKK members. That is  the nuance.   We have been fighting against evil for a long time, and we will  continue to. But let's just make sure that we, the American people,  know who the fight is against. It is not against those of us who  believe in God, country, and family, a free market, the belief in  looking at each other from the inside out versus the outside in.   We are friends, no matter what side of the aisle we sit on, those of  us who believe in our American way, those of us who see our future as  coming closer together, not dividing us. We are on the same team, my  friends. Let's remember that.   I am going to read the introduction that I have from one of the books  I wrote earlier: For those who grew up in the Deep South, in the days  of the KKK and Jim Crow segregation, pride in community was not founded  on the embellishment of opportunities lost due to racism. Instead, it  was built on the highlighting of the great accomplishments achieved, in  spite of the obstacles.   The can-do outlook that prevailed in the past generations cleared the  pathway to prosperity and celebrated creative, courageous, and self- respecting community determined not to be held back. That community  succeeded in their quest. That community was my dad's generation and  the ones before that who believed in this great country, who went to  war to fight for this great country.   I am going to talk about a couple of my heroes. I have had a chance,  thank goodness, growing up in the Deep South in the days of KKK, Jim  Crow, and segregation, in Tallahassee, Florida, to be raised by a  community who was proud of who they were, a community whose parents and  teachers collaborated, talked, and respected each other, because the  goal at the end of the day was their children would go out and give  their community a good name, give their family a good name, and  represent the race that could achieve anything by overcoming obstacles.   My hero is not an NFL player, a basketball player, or some person on  TV,  [[Page H1101]]  who I had no idea who they were, what their character was. My hero was  someone who I saw the mistakes that he made. He was not a perfect  person, but he was a great father. That is my dad, Clarence Burgess  Owens, Sr.   Dad represented that generation very, very well. By the way, for  those who don't know, which I am sure most don't because of the history  that has been changed, my race has never been a race of hopeless,  hapless people waiting for White people to show up and give us freedom.  We got freedom through the fight in which we participated in, the Civil  War. There was no race that appreciated that freedom more than my race.   For generations from that point on, we have had within our DNA a  desire for freedom, the conservative values of home, family, free  market, and faith. I grew up in a home that taught that. It was a good  experience.   My dad was raised by parents who did not finish high school. Well, my  grandmother did finish high school when she was 50 years old. My  grandfather dropped out when he was in the third grade. They were  businessowners.   But let me tell you how it works out in America, because every  generation looks to help the next generation stand on their shoulders.  In my community, that was the goal. In my family, that is exactly what  happened.   From those humble beginnings, those parents of four children that did  not have an education, a formal education, that next generation were  kids that had nothing but good education. My dad got his Ph.D. at Ohio  State in agronomy. My uncle got his Ph.D. in economics at Ohio State in  1950 to 1951, the days of the KKK, Jim Crow, and segregation.   I had an uncle who was an engineer. He was part time and decided he  wanted to fly planes. In the early 1960s, this was something that no  one ever did, and that is he purchased his own private plane, a single  prop. He would take mail from Wichita Falls, Texas, to Chicago. Who did  that in 1960-61?   Well, as a 12-year-old, I had a chance to experience and understand  the opportunity to dream past my limitations or perceived limitations.  One time, he flew out to Tallahassee, where I had a chance to fly, for  the first time, in this private plane.   I learned something through that process. That is what that  generation did. They wanted to make sure that every generation was  getting more educated, more critical thinking skills.   We went up. For those who don't understand what a stall is, it is  important to know what a stall is before you stall. He took us up and  stalled the airplane. He saw that I was panicking. He grabbed the  control and explained airplane lift. To this day, I can explain to you  exactly what airplane lift looks like and how it feels.   That was a generation that overcame.   Now, my dad grew up in Texas and went to war. He was in the  Philippines, and this is in Japan, where he finished up. Again, he  received some documentation because he ended up coming back from war to  Texas. In those days, in Texas, because of Jim Crow laws, he could not  get his postgraduate degree.   I ran across a box of letters after dad passed away, something he  never talked about, a box of rejection letters from colleges across our  country, particularly the Northeast, that had rejected his application  to get his postgraduate degree. I knew it was because of race. I could  see it in the applications, in the amount of letters I saw in this  particular box.   What is interesting about that generation, about dad, is he never  complained about it. He never pulled it out. He never said: ``Well,  this is what they did to me.'' That was a generation that took  rejection and took obstacles as motivation. That was a generation that  said: If you don't believe me, sit back and watch. I am going to run  harder, study harder, work harder. I will prove that I will command  your respect because I do believe in meritocracy--which they did.    He continued that process and got into Ohio State. Five years after  graduating from Ohio State with his Ph.D., we were living in Liberia,  Africa. He was doing research there.   Dad went on to teach for 40 years at Florida A&M. He was a  researcher. He was a farmer for 35 of those years. He was a remarkable  mentor, and he believed that our race, if given the opportunity of  education, could achieve and move forward.   Because he understood his past, because he was taught at that time  the greatness of people like Booker T. Washington and the many people I  am going to talk about in the next few minutes, he appreciated the  progress that he had made and his family had made at that point, and he  saw such a great future for those that were coming behind him.   I have a granddad who was a third grade dropout, a dad who was a  college professor, and his son, who now stands before you in Congress.   This country, there is nothing like it. It is time for us to  understand: If you want a second chance, if you want to dream big, if  you want to overcome, this is the place. And guess what? You will have  help from every corner of this United States. Every culture, every  religion, every color, it does not matter. Because in this country, we  teach ourselves to look at each other from the inside out, not the  outside in.   I refuse, as long as I stand in Congress, to allow the left to demean  my race's past. I refuse to allow the left to narrate that my race was  one that was hopeless, hapless, could not achieve, and sit back and  look at nothing but the negative that happened. By the way, negative  happens to every race, every culture, every person. It is life. It is  what you do with it that makes us Americans.   Americans never give up on our dream. We believe in something called  meritocracy. We do not believe we should give this power over to any  government power. We believe we should live our lives and move forward.   If you think about the person who would appreciate, more than anyone  else in this room, a full glass of water, that person would be the one  who has not had a drop in days. That first drop would be like heaven.   That was the Black community when freedom was given to us, a race  that for generations never thought freedom was a possibility, a race  that sent their sons to war, that volunteered because they understood  the power of freedom.   They understood the power of having their faith, that they could  worship without someone beating them up or hanging them, one that  believed in family because there was no guarantee in those days that a  family would ever stay united.   They believed in an idea called ownership of property, free market,  to be creative, to get paid for your own work, your own effort, your  own risk, and the benefit of education.   There was no race in our country that understood and believed and  appreciated this more than mine did. There is a reason why, in the  1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, it was the Black community that led our  country in the growth of the middle class. Many graduated from college.  Many committed to marriage. Many became entrepreneurs.   There is a reason why, growing up in Tallahassee, I could look around  in that community, not seeing a Black America, not associating with  White America until I was 16 years old, and seeing nothing but business  ownership everywhere, whether it be Baker's Pharmacy, Perkins Service  Station, Speed's Grocery Store, FAMU Hospital with Black nurses and  Black doctors. There were engineers, lawyers, and teachers. And the  message was very simple: You live in America, young man. You can  achieve anything you want to if you commit to those tenets that make  our country great: faith, family, the free market, and education.   We have had our representation of brave warriors throughout history,  as we do today, frontline warriors who serve in the military, that go  out every single day, that thin blue line to protect us from evil.   Why is their contribution so important? They believe in something  very simple, and it is something from Booker T. Washington: You do not  have to beg or ask for respect when you can command respect. You do not  have to beg or demand somebody else's property in a free country when  you can earn it yourself.   How do we do that? Through meritocracy. How do we do that? By showing  courage when others might feel fear.   Ask the all-Black Army, the 54th Army Regiment from Massachusetts,  during the Civil War, Freedmen who volunteered to go south to fight a  battle to free fellow members of their  [[Page H1102]]  race. Or ask the 1869 Buffalo Soldiers or the World War II unit that  went to Germany called the Black Rattlers, who the German called the  Hellfighters, because they had so much respect for the way they fought  and what they did.   My race has stood on the shoulders of the great men and women I am  going to talk about the next few minutes. One of the greatest, I  realized, after my dad had passed and after I did my homework, that  that entire generation listened to and built their lives around was  Booker T. Washington. He was a former slave who started Tuskegee  University in 1881.   By 1905, it was creating more self-made millionaires than Harvard,  Yale, and Princeton combined. Why? Because he was teaching those young  people coming through not just to master one trade but two. Yes, work  harder than the next guy. Yes, don't complain about the work. Don't  complain about what is asked of you. Don't do what is being taught to  our kids today where kids say: Well, I have to work harder than the  other guy because of my color.   No, you have to work harder than the other guy because that is what  America is about. You outrun, you outwork, you out-study. You find your  greatest potential by what you put into your efforts. You don't lower  your standards because somebody else has lowered theirs. We don't do  that. That is not America.                                time  1400    Black History Month is dedicated to the heroes who rose above  slavery, segregation, and racism to champion life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness for future generations. Because of their courage,  Black Americans have made enormous strides to shape the soul of our  Nation.   From a childhood in the segregated South to serving in Congress, I am  inspired by the tenacity of giants like Charles R. Drew, Robert Smalls,  J. Mayo Williams, Bessie Coleman, Dr. Mildred Jefferson, Elizabeth  Freeman, Sergeant William Carney, and so many others who fought for the  founding ideals of liberty and equality.   I would like to share with you a few of my heroes who have had a  tremendous impact on my life and the lives of countless, countless  Americans. These, by the way, are Americans who were proud to be  Americans. These are Americans proud of their race. These are Americans  who saw their kids living a much better dream, and the last thing they  would do is tell them to stop dreaming. The last thing they would do is  tell them the obstacles are too great for them. The last thing they  would do is say these White people are going to keep you from achieving  your dreams. No, we were taught it didn't matter who it was or what it  was, that we had within us the ability to overcome all obstacles.   Dr. Charles R. Drew was born in 1904 here in D.C., breaking the  barriers throughout his life of a racially divided America to become  the most influential scientist of the 20th century. It was during his  research into banked blood at Columbia University that his ultimate  destiny in serving mankind was shaped.   As World War II created an important need for procedures to preserve  blood, and injuries seen by physicians became more severe, the need for  blood plasma intensified. As he was the leading authority in the field,  Dr. Charles Drew was selected as a full-time medical director of the  Blood for Britain project, where he supervised the successful  collection of thousands of pints of vital plasma for the British,  saving countless lives.   In February 1941, Drew was appointed the director of the first  American Red Cross Blood Bank and was put in charge of blood for the  use of the U.S. Army and Navy. Dr. Drew returned to Freedmen's Hospital  and Howard University, where he served as a surgeon and professor of  medicine from 1942 until he passed away in 1950.   Robert Smalls was born into slavery in Beaumont, South Carolina, and  gained his freedom daringly and courageously. He commandeered a  Confederate cargo ship and sailed the vessel into Union waters before  being captured, freeing himself, his crew, and their families.   His action that day helped persuade Lincoln to accept Black soldiers  in the Union Army. He went on to serve in the Union's Navy and was  eventually elected to Congress.   Elijah Abel was one of the early leaders in the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints, a popular missionary who, as a Black man,  lived the restored gospel that was intended for Black and White, bond  and free.   Born in Texas in 1892, Bessie Coleman, also known as Queen Bess or  Brave Bessie, was the first Black female pilot. Her mother, Susan, was  a maid; her father, George, was a sharecropper of Native American and  African-American descent. Bessie grew up helping her mother pick cotton  and wash laundry to earn extra money.   By the time she was 18, she had saved money to attend the Colored  Agricultural and Normal University, now Langston University, in  Langston, Oklahoma. She dropped out of college after only one semester  because she could not afford to attend.   Bessie's brothers, who both served in the military in World War I,  came home with stories of their time in France, often teasing her that  French women could learn how to fly airplanes, but Bessie couldn't.  Because of this, she applied to many flight schools across the country,  but no school would take her because she was a Black woman.   With no opportunities in America, Bessie saved and saved, and finally  obtained scholarships to travel to France to flight school. She even  had to take a French class at night to complete her flight school  application.   After finishing flight school, she toured the country, giving  speeches, showing videos of her air tricks to earn money, refusing to  speak anywhere that was segregated or that discriminated against Black  Americans.   In 1922, she performed the first public flight by an African-American  woman. I want you to keep in mind these dates; these are the dates the  other side of the aisle would like to tell you we were hopeless,  hapless, and doing nothing. No, we were doing just like every other  race in this country has, every other culture that has overcome  obstacles. We had great vision, and we had great courage, and we  succeeded big time.   She became more popular both in the United States and Europe. She  toured the country giving flight lessons, performing in-flight shows,  and she encouraged women to learn how to fly, becoming famous in  America and Europe as a star pilot.   On April 30, 1926, Bessie passed away in a tragic plane crash. She  remains an inspiration to untold millions around the world.   Madam C. J. Walker was born in 1867 on a Delta, Louisiana,  plantation, where her parents had been enslaved before the end of the  Civil War.   She and her sister grew cotton in Delta and Vicksburg, Mississippi,  and survived by working in the fields. To escape abuse from her  brother-in-law, she married Moses McWilliams at the age of 14.   Following the death of her husband, she moved to St. Louis to join  her four brothers, who had become barbers. With just $1.50 a day, she  managed to save enough money to send her daughter to public school.   As a talented entrepreneur with a skill for self-promotion, she often  said, ``I got my start by giving myself a start.'' How about that one?  ``I got my start by giving myself a start.''   She was the first self-made woman millionaire in America, earning her  fortune through her business empire, a line of hair care products  especially for Black women she created after experiencing hair loss.  The self-made millionaire used her fortune to fund scholarships for  women and donated large parts of her wealth to charity.    Elizabeth Freeman, better known as Mum Bett, was born into slavery  but became the first slave to be freed under the Massachusetts  Constitution. Less than 1 year after the adoption of the Massachusetts  State Constitution, she filed a lawsuit for freedom, marking the  beginning of a group of freedom suits that would ultimately lead the  Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court to outlaw slavery in their State.  Despite not knowing how to read or write, she was clever enough,  strategic enough, determined enough to secure her freedom.   She sought out the help of a local lawyer after being inspired by the  constitutional provision that all men were created free and equal. They  won the case, implicitly ending slavery in the State of Massachusetts.  [[Page H1103]]    After securing her freedom, she became a paid domestic worker and  also made a living as a prominent healer, midwife, and nurse. After 20  years, she was able to buy her own house, where she lived with her  children. She passed away December 28, 1829, at the age of 85.   It is amazing, these remarkable men and women who figured out the  American Dream could work for them if they never gave up on it.   J. Mayo Williams was one of the first Black professional football  players in the 1920s and went on to become one of the most successful  record producers in the 1930s and 1940s. He was the only man to be  inducted into both the National Football Hall of Fame and the Blues  Hall of Fame.   Senator Hiram Revels of Mississippi in 1870 became the first African  American to serve in the U.S. Senate. As a member of the Republican  Party, he challenged the social order and was an outspoken opponent  against segregation, fighting for equality across racial lines.   Sergeant William Carney was the first Black Medal of Honor recipient.  He kept the American flag held high. He was born in Norfolk, Virginia,  in 1840 to a family of enslaved people. His parents bought their  freedom and moved to Massachusetts. He enlisted in March 1863, and his  unit, the 54th, which included two sons of abolitionist Frederick  Douglass, headed down to South Carolina.   By the way, the South Carolina Confederate President had made note  that any Black soldier caught would be instantly hung. This is what  these men knew and understood, yet they marched south to fight for the  freedom of their race and their country.   Carney's unit headed down to South Carolina. Their first combat  mission was leading the charge on Fort Wagner in Charleston. Carney saw  his unit's flag bearer was shot and killed and ran to catch the  American flag he was holding. Carney, too, was shot during the battle,  but he held that flag high and crawled up the hill toward the fort. He  planted the flag in the sand and kept holding on even after he was  rescued. He was the first to receive the Medal of Honor.   Let me tell you how acts like that of courage and knowing our history  add up. As a seventh grader, I had the opportunity--I was chosen in my  segregated high school, junior high school to raise the flag in the  morning and to bring it down in the afternoon--an honor.   I remember walking to school every morning, early in the morning, and  my friend, Spencer Williams, and I, we understood the nature of that  flag, what it meant. My dad had come back from war, and how he felt  about the flag, we were sure never to let that flag touch the ground.   That reverence for our flag allowed me to feel proud as an NFL player  to hear the national anthem, to see that flag flying on the sideline,  getting teary-eyed. I was living my dream in a country that allowed for  the American Dream to be alive and well. To see how far we had come in  the 1970s, from my upbringing in the 1960s, to see my teammates of all  colors, backgrounds, and creeds, that we could care less about our  background, color, or creed. We cared about the fact that we wanted to  win. We looked inside for those who had the character, tenacity,  discipline, courage to play hard so we could win. That is America. That  is what we do.   Dr. Mildred Jefferson was the first Black woman to graduate from  Harvard. She dedicated her life to protecting life at all stages. In  1951, Mildred became the first Black woman to graduate from Harvard  Medical School. By the way, she was a pro-life advocate, just like my  parents' generation was across the board. We believe in our children,  believe in our history and their future, and believe they are a gift  from God. My race would not stand for what has happened today as we  watch my race being targeted for abortion. She also was the first woman  employed as a general surgeon at the Boston University Medical Center.   Phillis Wheatley was born in West Africa and sold into slavery at the  age of 7. Despite being enslaved, she learned to read and write. Her  Massachusetts owners saw talent in her poetry skills and encouraged  her. Phillis was brought by her owners to London, seeking to publish  her work. She quickly rose to prominence when she published her book,  ``Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral.''    She became a talented poet. Her poems became popular and even drew  the praise of George Washington and poet Jupiter Hammon.   As I close this out, I can't say enough how proud I am to have been  raised in the time I was raised, in the community I was raised in, in  the race I was raised in, in a country that gave us all hope for a  great future.   Because we lived so close to Florida A&M and had all these college  kids getting engaged with civil rights, at the age of 12, I had the  opportunity and decided to join them for a demonstration in front of  Florida's State Theater. I was the youngest, but I witnessed what it  was for young men and women to be disciplined, to be articulate, to be  dressed well, to represent our race because it wasn't just in front of  Florida's State Theater that we were making an impact; it was those  watching across our country.   I want those who watch Martin Luther King's demonstrations again to  notice something about that remarkable group of people. Notice the  white shirts, the dark ties, the dress shoes. Notice the articulation  of those who represented these great warriors, these leaders in  freedom. Notice their discipline as they were attacked by dogs, fire  hoses, people calling them names. Notice they did not retaliate. They  did not go down and burn down buildings. They believed in the American  people. They believed in this country, that they could command respect  from around our country by being the best examples of what it was to be  an American.                                time  1415    They were Christians, and it was Martin Luther King's view that by  fighting in the way Christians could fight, nonviolently, they could  earn the hearts of Americans across the country, and that is exactly  what they did.   See, what Martin Luther King was doing in our Nation at that time was  not just fighting against the Jim Crow laws that we talk about all the  time, the evil that we saw in the south perpetrated on Black Americans  by Democrats, by the way, at that time. It was more than just Jim Crow  that we were fighting against. It was a narrative that Black Americans  couldn't think, we weren't leaders, we weren't intelligent, we were  unkempt, we were undisciplined, we were cowards. That was the narrative  that we fought against.   That was the narrative that I faced when I left Tallahassee, Florida,  with the goal of being a marine biology major and hearing through the  grapevine from someone, a White person who had gone to Florida State,  that I couldn't do it because Blacks could not think in those days.  That was the thought.   Unlike today--I didn't say I'm going to give up, I am going to quit,  I am going to sue. I was taught that when somebody tells you you can't,  you prove them wrong. I spent the next 4 years at the University of  Miami living in a library when I wasn't playing football. I wanted to  prove that guy wrong. That was the generation I was raised by, thank  goodness. That guy probably never knew probably that I succeeded, but I  knew. My parents knew. And now I can tell you the story that that is  the way our race was.   We have to fight this soft bigotry of low expectations, my friends.  It is the worst of all evils. For people to wrap their arms around us,  tell us how much they love us, and then tell us we can't. To wake up to  news reports that we have an administration that, for the sake of  equity, is going to give Black people access to crack pipes. That is  equity? We now have the opportunity to get free crack pipes.   Equity is not lowering the standards. Equity, equality is raising the  standards so high and telling every single child that can hear your  voice that you can do it. That is equality. That is meritocracy. That  is how we get respect. You don't beg for respect. You command respect.   In closing, I often say that Black American history is so rich  because of the heroes who came before us.   These proud Black Americans broke countless barriers and have been  lifelong inspirations for untold millions right here in America but  also around the world.  [[Page H1104]]    Black History Month is an important celebration and recognition of  American history, and I am humbled to stand on the shoulders of the  great men and women who came before me.   I encourage all of you to read up on the true history of our Nation.  The true history of our Nation is that we the people have done it. We  the people with our good hearts established the Underground Railroad. I  would not be here without their courage, their sacrifice, their vision.   I am so thankful to have been taught to love our great Nation, to  love the people before us, that are with us, and those in the future  that we will fight for.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
