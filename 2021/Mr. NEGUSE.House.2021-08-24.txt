 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 601 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 601         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 4) to amend       the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to revise the criteria for       determining which States and political subdivisions are       subject to section 4 of the Act, and for other purposes. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       The amendment printed in the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution shall be considered as adopted.       The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points       of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are       waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill, as amended, and on any further amendment       thereto, to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Judiciary or their respective designees; and (2) one motion       to recommit.        Sec. 2.  The chair of the Committee on the Judiciary may       insert in the Congressional Record not later than August 24,       2021, such material as he may deem explanatory of H.R. 4.        Sec. 3. (a) Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 3684)       to authorize funds for Federal-aid highways, highway safety       programs, and transit programs, and for other purposes, with       the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider in the House,       without intervention of any point of order, a motion offered       by the chair of the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure or his designee that the House concur in the       Senate amendment. The Senate amendment and the motion shall       be considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for one       hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure or their respective designees. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to its       adoption without intervening motion.        (b) On the legislative day of September 27, 2021, the House       shall consider in the House the motion referred to in       subsection (a) if not offered prior to such legislative day.       A motion considered pursuant to this subsection shall be       considered as though offered pursuant to subsection (a).        Sec. 4.  Senate Concurrent Resolution 14 is hereby adopted.        Sec. 5.  Rule XXVIII shall not apply with respect to the       adoption by the House of a concurrent resolution on the       budget for fiscal year 2022.        Sec. 6.  House Resolution 594 and House Resolution 600 are       laid on the table.    Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.  Fischbach), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, earlier today, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 601, providing for consideration of  three measures.   First, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 4 under a closed  rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled  by the chair and the ranking minority member of the Committee on the  Judiciary or their designee. The rule self-executes a manager's  amendment from Chairman Nadler, provides one motion to recommit, and  provides the Judiciary Committee with the authority to insert in the  Congressional Record explanatory material related to H.R. 4 no later  than August 24.  [[Page H4360]]    The rule also provides for consideration of the Senate amendment to  H.R. 3684. The rule makes in order a motion offered by the chair of the  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure that the House concur in  the Senate amendment to H.R. 3684. The rule provides for 1 hour of  debate on the motion equally divided and controlled by the chair and  the ranking minority member of the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure or their designees.   Finally, the rule provides that S. Con. Res. 14 is adopted under  adoption of the rule.   Madam Speaker, today is an important day. The underlying bills before  us today are critical pieces of legislation to enact President Biden's  Build Back Better agenda. This plan will create good-paying jobs, put  money in the pockets of American families, lower healthcare and  childcare costs, and invest in our Nation's infrastructure paid for by  ensuring that the wealthiest Americans are paying their fair share in  taxes. We also take important critical steps today to secure the right  to vote and safeguard our democracy.   S. Con. Res. 14 begins the process to enact this important  legislative agenda. In short, the resolution sets out President Biden's  Build Back Better plan, which includes critical investments that we can  and must make now to provide a better future for our country.   This is a plan to create jobs, to cut taxes, and to lower costs for  working families.   Our plan will make things affordable for the middle class and working  families and reduce healthcare costs.   The Build Back Better plan will help prepare our Nation for the  impacts of climate change: Through historic investments in a reimagined  Climate Conservation Corps, investments that will put people to work to  protect and conserve our public lands and open spaces, invest in the  electrification of our infrastructure, and ensure that we can prepare  for and mitigate the impacts of climate change.   We will provide for wildfire prevention and mitigation, resources  that are desperately needed, Madam Speaker, across the western United  States as we continue to experience devastating wildfires year after  year. My State of Colorado, along with many other western States, are  in the midst of a terrible drought which, combined with extreme heat,  is continuing to wreak havoc on our communities.   As a father of a 3-year-old daughter who will be starting preschool  just next week, we will invest in our children through the Build Back  Better plan by ensuring universal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4- year-old in our country, provide tuition-free community college,  childcare for working families, upgrading school infrastructure, and  strengthening our education workforce.   We will fund investments in child nutrition programs, expand  Medicare, Madam Speaker, for the first time in its 55-year history to  include dental benefits, vision benefits, hearing coverage, critical  coverage that will help our seniors access the care that they need.   The Build Back Better plan will be transformational for the American  people, reaching every aspect of their lives and making investments in  resources that they can rely on. Madam Speaker, we will lower costs for  the American people, we will cut taxes, and we will create jobs. This  resolution is a first step toward making those critical investments a  reality.   I now turn to a bill that I know, Madam Speaker, you care deeply  about, as you are the sponsor of the legislation, and that is the John  R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, H.R. 4. Voting is a sacred  right foundational to our democracy and to our Republic. It is a right  that many have fought and died to secure and that the late civil rights  hero, our dear friend and colleague, John Lewis, fought to protect,  despite being harassed, jailed, and beaten. Madam Speaker, as you know,  Mr. Lewis often told us that the vote is the most powerful nonviolent  tool that we have.   Unfortunately, it is a right that is once again under attack, and we  see it, Madam Speaker, in the laws that are being passed in Georgia and  in Florida and in Iowa. In State after State after State, and in the  glaring absence of Federal standards and enforcement, partisan  legislatures are making it harder for those who are legally eligible to  vote to do so.   We cannot stand by, Madam Speaker, as discriminatory measures run  rampant, blocking Americans from participating in our democracy.   Voting is a constitutional right. It is ingrained at the very core of  who we are as Americans, Madam Speaker. As a Congress, protecting that  right is foundational; it really is the heart of our duty.   The vote can only truly represent the people's voice if they have the  ability to execute it freely and easily. That is why Congress needs to  take clear, decisive action today to protect voting rights by passing  the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. This bill would  strengthen the VRA and respond to recent Supreme Court cases striking  critical provisions of the bill, while making clear that Congress has  the power to create a new formula.    The VRA has been reauthorized, Madam Speaker, as you know, on a  bipartisan basis for decades, most recently in 2006 when the  reauthorization on the VRA passed this Chamber 390-33, and in the  Senate 98 votes for it, zero votes against it. This should not be a  partisan issue.   Our democracy is safeguarded only when every eligible voter has the  opportunity to participate, and that is what we will ensure today by  passing this bill out of the House.   Finally, Madam Speaker, as you know, the rule provides for  consideration of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This  bipartisan bill is an important down payment toward meeting the  critical infrastructure needs of our communities. We all know that our  Nation's infrastructure is in desperate need of repair, and this  bipartisan bill seeks to make those much-needed investments.   The bill invests in our roads, our highways, our bridges, focusing on  making infrastructure resilient to the impacts of climate change and  natural disasters.   It has become particularly clear over the course of this last year  that access to affordable, reliable broadband is absolutely critical  for Americans to be able to do their jobs and to participate equally in  remote learning, to access healthcare, to stay connected. This  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provides $65 billion to expand  broadband coverage to areas most in need across the United States, and  it also takes steps to make sure that that coverage is more affordable  for individuals for whom those costs might be prohibitive.   The bill makes critical investments in our drinking water  infrastructure, ensuring that clean, safe drinking water is a right in  all communities.   Lastly, I would be remiss, Madam Speaker, if I didn't mention that  there are several priorities that I have been working on with many of  my colleagues from the western United States that are part of this  bill, the Joint Chiefs Landscape Restoration Partnership Program, my  bill to help restore our forests and respond to wildfire risks; the  reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools Program; and, of course,  the Disaster Safe Power Grid Act, which ensures a safer and more  resilient power grid in the face of emergencies.                                time  1330    The Senate has already passed this bill and shown the desire to  invest in our infrastructure, and the House must now do the same.   Madam Speaker, these three underlying bills that we are considering  today make essential investments in American families and communities,  and we have to meet this moment for the American people.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I must say with great respect for my  colleague from Minnesota, I think the Republican minority leader of the  United States Senate, Mitch McConnell, would disagree with the  gentlewoman's characterization of the bipartisan infrastructure bill  being for--I think she said--urban cities or blue cities.   Madam Speaker, 19 Republicans voted for that bill in the United  States Senate, including the Senate minority leader. So I think that it  is important for us to recognize that the investments made in that  bill, as well as the investments made in the resolution, the Build Back  Better plan that we are also considering over the coming weeks are  incredibly important for the future of our country.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Ross), a distinguished member of both the Committee on  Rules and the Committee on the Judiciary.    Madam Speaker, you know what is interesting? I don't  remember the ranking member complaining about the deficit 3 years ago  when they passed tax cuts for billionaires across our country to the  tune of $2 trillion in terms of adding it to the deficit. I don't  remember them complaining about process when they had to do three rules  within a time period of 6 weeks to try to repeal the Affordable Care  Act back in 2017.   I heard much today by way of process, but very little in terms of  substance. Why? Because they know that the plan we have put forward  today will lower costs, will cut taxes, and will create jobs.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of this House.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I certainly understand where my colleague is coming  from and have great reverence and respect for him and his service to  our country, and I certainly look forward to continuing to work with  him on the important issues that he described.   But defeating the previous question would hand over the floor to the  Republican Conference. And, as you know, Madam Speaker, we have  incredibly important pieces of legislation that we are considering,  specifically, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, and the bipartisan  infrastructure budget, and the President's Build Back Better plan  today.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to voting for the rule, and would  encourage all Members in the House to vote for the rule, to vote for  the previous question so that we can proceed with the business of the  House.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), who is the distinguished chairman of the  Committee on Energy and Commerce.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague on the Rules Committee  for the respectful way in which she has engaged in today's debate. I  wish I could say the same for all of the speeches that Members have  delivered today.   I think it is unfortunate to have deeply partisan speeches made on  the floor on matters of such great significance. I have great respect  and reverence for Democratic and Republican Members of this body who  have served so honorably in our Nation's Armed Forces and who have been  working together to do everything they can, in concert with the  administration, to evacuate Americans and our Afghan partners out of  Afghanistan.   I think it is unfortunate, as I said, to hear folks politicize that  particular issue. I didn't hear much, Madam Speaker, regarding the  bipartisan infrastructure deal that we are considering today. I didn't  hear much by way of specifics in terms of the voting rights advancement  act that we are considering today. Why? Because my friends on the other  side of the aisle know that both the Build Back Better plan and the  bipartisan infrastructure deal will create jobs, will lower costs, and  will cut taxes.   I wish we could have a reasonable debate on the merits of these  particular policies, but it is clear that some would prefer to avoid  that debate entirely.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee), my distinguished colleague on the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, while I would relish the opportunity to  respond to the points made by my colleague, we have a lot of enthusiasm  on our side to speak in support of this rule.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro), the distinguished chairwoman of the Committee on  Appropriations, who has led on the child tax cut for decades.    Madam Speaker, my colleague from California is certainly  right about one thing, the Build Back Better plan would raise taxes on  billionaires. The tax cuts that ultimately were approved by my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle several years ago for the  richest Americans in our country, we do not pursue that in our bill.  Instead, we pursue tax cuts for working families, for middle-class  Americans.   Madam Speaker, I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Waters), the distinguished chairwoman of the  Committee on Financial Services, whose leadership has kept millions of  Americans in their homes over the course of the last year.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Ms. Sewell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Ryan).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   We have heard a lot about partisanship during the course of today's  debate.   What are the three bills that we are considering within the rule  today?   The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, a reauthorization of  the Voting Rights Act. VRA has been reauthorized by Republicans and  Democrats in the United States Congress for decades. The last time it  was signed by George W. Bush, a Republican.   A bipartisan infrastructure deal that earned the votes of 69  Senators, 19 Republicans, including Mitch McConnell, but apparently,  that proposal is too radical for the House Republican Conference.   And a Build Back Better plan that would invest in American families,  that would lower costs, that would cut taxes for working families.   Americans are worth investing in. Our families, our students, our  teachers, our firefighters, our communities  [[Page H4371]]  are worth investing in. And we have a chance to do that today.   The late Congressman John Lewis once said that every generation  leaves behind a legacy. What that legacy will be is determined by the  people of that generation. Madam Speaker, I would say that our legacy  must be one of progress, of courage, and of action.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this rule and on the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Fischbach is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 601         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 7. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 5071) to direct the Secretary of Defense to submit       to Congress daily reports on the evacuation of citizens and       permanent residents of the United States from Afghanistan,       and for other purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Armed       Services; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 8. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 5071.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
