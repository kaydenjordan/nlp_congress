 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be  up to 6 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to the scheduled  rollcall vote.    Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 1354, and I  ask that it be reported by number.   The clerk will report by number.   The bill clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an       amendment numbered 1354 to amendment No. 1092.    The amendment is as follows:   (Purpose: To prohibit the availability of funds for the Secretary of    Veterans Affairs to report certain information to the Department of     Justice for use by the National Instant Criminal Background Check                                  System)          At the appropriate place, insert the following:       SEC. ___. PROHIBITION ON AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FOR SECRETARY                     OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO REPORT CERTAIN                     INFORMATION REGARDING VETERANS.         None of the funds made available by this Act may be used by       the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under section 5502 of title       38, United States Code, in any case arising out of the       administration by the Secretary of laws and benefits under       such title, to report a person who is deemed mentally       incapacitated, mentally incompetent, or to be experiencing an       extended loss of consciousness as a person who has been       adjudicated as a mental defective under subsection (d)(4) or       (g)(4) of section 922 of title 18, United States Code,       without the order or finding of a judge, magistrate, or other       judicial authority of competent jurisdiction that such person       is a danger to himself or herself or others.     Madam President, before I explain my amendment, I would  like to yield 30 seconds to my good friend Senator Tester.    Madam President, there are 16 million veterans in our  country. Sometimes some of them need help with managing their financial  affairs. When they do, they go to the Veterans Health Administration,  and the Veterans Health Administration appoints a fiduciary to help  that veteran manage his or her financial affairs.   But, under current VA policy, if a veteran who defended this country  has to go to the VA and ask for help with managing his or her financial  affairs, the VA automatically reports that veteran to the FBI's  National Instant Criminal Background Check System--we call it NICS--and  that veteran loses his firearm. He loses his firearm automatically--no  due process, no questions asked. This decision is not being made by a  judge; it is being made by a bureaucrat.   All our amendment would do would be to say that the VA, just because  you have asked for help with your money, cannot automatically take away  your firearm or report you to NICS unless a judge has ruled that that  veteran is a danger to himself or to others.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam President, with all the respect I can muster, what  my colleague said is inaccurate.   Now, I understand this is America; people can believe what they want.  There are people who wish we didn't have the Second Amendment. I get  that, but we do. And I agree with Senator Murphy. We both agree on  this. Chris believes that love is the answer, and I do, too, but I own  a handgun just in case. That is my right, and every veteran has that  right. We shouldn't take away a person's gun without a judge--not a  bureaucrat at the VA--ruling that person to be mentally incompetent.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1354     Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
