 Mr. President, I wanted to take a few moments today. I  know we are in the middle of this debate about the health care law,  about the nomination. On a topic I have been working on for a while, I  was compelled to come to the floor at this late hour because it has now  broken in the press. It is important to kind of give some clarity.   As my colleagues know, I have spent a significant amount of time over  the last few years discussing the issues in the nation of Venezuela,  which has a direct impact on my home State of Florida but ultimately on  the country. It is a nation that faces some very significant  challenges, primarily because its political leadership is a disaster.  It is no longer truly a democracy. It is now a government run by a  tyrant who has basically ignored the Constitution. They have taken over  the courts. The members of the judiciary in Venezuela are now basically  under the complete control of their so-called President, Nicolas  Maduro, and before that, Chavez. They control the press. They have a  national assembly that actually is controlled by the minority party or  the opposition party to the government. But it is pretty shocking. My  colleagues would be shocked by this. We all travel abroad often.  Imagine if you lived in a country where the President denied you the  ability to travel abroad. Well, that is what has happened.   One of the members of the National Assembly in the opposition, Luis  Florido was trying to go to Peru to travel and was denied the ability  to  [[Page S1049]]  leave the country. Imagine that. Imagine that one of our Democratic  colleagues here in the Senate decided they wanted to take a trip next  week overseas in the conduct of their office and were told that the  President was not allowing them to travel abroad. That happened in  Venezuela. Another one, Williams Davila, had his passport taken away by  the President of Venezuela. So the country is a disaster because of  their leadership. It is actually headed into a cataclysm.   In April of this year, Venezuela has to make a $6 billion payment on  their debt. They will not be able to make that payment. The Government  of Venezuela knows that. It is a terrible situation.   But in the midst of all of that, I have argued that the national  security interests of the United States is at stake in what is  happening in Venezuela. This is not just about the issue of democracy;  it is also about the threat it potentially poses to the United States.  That is what I come to the floor to speak about tonight.   My office has been engaged with a number of people over the last few  months and year who have been coming to us with information. We have  been working on some of this. Some of that has now broken into the  press tonight in a CNN report that I am about to describe in a moment,  but first, let me lay out the scene.   There have been about 8.5 million names added to Venezuela's  immigration system since it was last independently audited in the year  2003. OK. So 8.5 million people were added to their immigration system,  the new names that have come about. Of the 8.5 million names that were  added, 221,000 of those--over 221,000 of those are foreign nationals,  and at least 173 of those 221,000 foreign nationals are from the  following countries: Iran, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan. So 173  people from these countries were provided government passports and  national IDs between the year 2008 and 2012, which leads me to this: In  November of 2015, a Venezuelan attache by the name of Misael Lopez  Soto, who was assigned to the country's Embassy in Baghdad, became a  whistleblower, and he began to reveal the identities of several of  these 173 names.   Understand that this is important because there has been a 168- percent jump in U.S. asylum applications from Venezuela since October  of 2015, now the third highest nation of origin for asylum applicants  to the United States. The overwhelming majority of them are legitimate  people fleeing all this craziness that is happening. But I lay the  groundwork to understand the connection between Venezuela and the  United States.   I now want to go into the story of Mr. Soto, who, as I said, used to  work at the Embassy.   Mr. Soto was assigned to work at the Embassy of Venezuela in Iraq. As  he began to work there, he noticed some irregularities, so he began to  report what he says was a scheme to sell passports and visas for  thousands of dollars out of that Embassy. He was offered all kinds of  money to do this, to get a cut of those thousands of dollars. He says  he declined it.   CNN and CNN en Espanol have over the last year teamed up on a joint  investigation, relying on much of the same information that I have had  access to, looking into all of these allegations and what they  uncovered. In the story that posted tonight was evidence of serious  irregularities in the issuing of Venezuela passports and visas,  including passports that were given to people with ties to terrorism.   According to CNN, one confidential intelligence document obtained by  CNN--intelligence documents from nations in the Western Hemisphere, not  from the United States--actually directly links Venezuela's now new  Vice President, who is in line to potentially become the President when  the current dictator is going to have to give up power here soon  because of this cataclysm that they are facing--the name of that Vice  President is Tareck El Aissami. There are now links, according to CNN,  to the current Vice President, Tareck El Aissami, and the 173  Venezuelan passports and IDs that were issued to individuals from the  Middle East, including people connected to the terrorist group  Hezbollah.   It is important to understand--and the CNN article appropriately  outlines this--if you have a passport from Venezuela, you are allowed  to enter over 130 countries on this planet without a visa. That  includes the 26 countries in the European Union. So a Venezuelan  passport is a valuable commodity for someone who is trying to travel  around the world under an assumed name with a valid government  document. That is why it is important.   Mr. Lopez, the whistleblower who once worked at the Embassy, is a  lawyer. He used to be a police officer in Venezuela. He said, according  to the article, that he thought that becoming a diplomat was a great  career opportunity that would allow him to serve his country, so he  moved to Baghdad and started his new life at the Embassy.   He remembers what he calls an unwelcome surprise on his first day in  July of 2013. His new boss was Venezuelan Ambassador Jonathan Velasco.  The Ambassador handed him a special envelope, he said.         ``He gave me an envelope full of visas and passports,''       Lopez recalled. ``He told me, `Get this, this is one million       U.S. dollars.' I thought it was like a joke. Then he told me       here people pay a lot of money to get a visa or a passport to       leave this country.''    Meaning Iraq.   About a month later, Lopez said he realized it was no joke.   An Iraqi employee of the Embassy who was hired to be an interpreter  told him that she, the interpreter, had made thousands of dollars  selling Venezuelan passports and visas and that he could make a lot of  money too. He says he told her it was wrong and he refused. The  employee pressed the issue, telling him that there were thousands of  dollars to be made, even discussing an offer to sell visas to 13  Syrians for $10,000 each.   Lopez said that he was stunned when he found the document inside the  Embassy. It was a list of 21 Arabic names with corresponding Venezuelan  passport numbers and Venezuelan identification numbers. A Venezuelan  immigration official told CNN that a crosscheck of the passport numbers  indicated that the passports are valid and that those passports, given  to these people with the 21 Arabic names--when he ran the crosscheck,  they actually matched the names on the list Lopez found, meaning the  people on the list could be able to travel using those Venezuelan  passports.   But here is what is incredible: A publicly available database in  Venezuela examined by CNN shows that 20 of the 21 identification  numbers of the people with the Arabic names that match the passports  are actually registered to people with Hispanic names, not the Arabic  names listed on the passports.   So basically CNN has uncovered evidence that at least on 21  occasions, the Venezuelan Government--the Venezuelan Embassy has sold  passports to someone from the Middle East but assigned them a Hispanic  surname or a Hispanic name. People are traveling under assumed  identities from the Middle East. We have a couple of those names we are  going to share with you in a moment.   In April 2014, only 9 months after he started the job, he emailed a  report about all this to the Ambassador. He said the Ambassador did  nothing, and, in fact, the Ambassador, Velasco, threatened to fire him.   By 2015, he was so frustrated that no one would investigate it that  he took what he found to Delcy Rodriguez, who was Venezuela's Foreign  Minister. He emailed the report and said that there was fraudulent  issuing of visas, birth certificates, and Venezuelan documents. He said  nothing happened. With nowhere else to turn, Mr. Lopez said he  contacted an FBI official at the U.S. Embassy in Madrid.   By the end of 2015, the Venezuelan Government accused him of  abandoning his post and removed him. A police official showed up at his  home in Venezuela with a document that said he was under investigation  for revealing confidential documents or secrets.   Now, this is not the first time this Congress hears about this. U.S.  lawmakers heard reports about Venezuela's passport fraud during  congressional hearings as far back as 2006. In fact, a congressional  report warned that ``Venezuela is providing support, including identity  documents that could prove useful to radical Islamic groups.''  [[Page S1050]]    A State Department report at that time concluded that ``Venezuelan  travel and identification documents are extremely easy to obtain by  persons not entitled to them.''   Roger Noriega, the former U.S. Ambassador to the OAS, a former  Assistant Secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere, said in  prepared remarks before Congress in 2012 that ``Venezuela has provided  thousands of phony IDs, passports and visas to persons of Middle  Eastern origin.''   In 2013, confidential intelligence reports from a group of Latin  American countries obtained by CNN said that from 2008 to 2012--I  already outlined this earlier--173 individuals from the Middle East  were issued Venezuelan passports and IDs. Among them were people  connected to the terrorist group Hezbollah. The official who ordered  the issuing of those passports, the report said, is Tareck El Aissami,  who just a few months ago was appointed and is now the Vice President  of Venezuela. Back then, he was the Minister in charge of immigration,  as well as a Governor. He personally took charge of issuing granting  visas and nationalizing citizens from different countries, especially  Syrians, Lebanese, Jordanians, Iranians, and Iraqis, the report said.   So what we have now is an unbelievable situation in which a country  in this hemisphere, according to both the whistleblower, independent  reports, and now CNN's own investigation--Venezuela--has been providing  passports to people from the Middle East under false pretenses,  basically fraudulent documents that allow them to travel all over the  world.   Among them, Hakim Mohamed Ali Diab Fattah, a Palestinian and  suspected Hezbollah member, was given national ID No. 16.105.824,  issued on July 12, 2012. He was deported from the United States in 2002  for his possible connection to the 9/11 hijackers via aviation school  in the United States. He was detained and arrested by Jordanian  authorities on May 3, 2015, for suspicion of financing terror. This  individual has that national ID number from Venezuela and a passport  that was allowing him to travel.   Here is another one: Ahmad Adnan Ali, an Iraqi, another suspected  Hezbollah member. He is a convicted trafficker facing charges in France  and Denmark, and he has documents under two aliases: Ahmed El Timmy  Villalobos, with the number 29.645.898. That is the number on the ID  that was issued on January 16, 2014. He has another alias and another  document: Ahmad El Timmy Gomez. His name is neither Villalobos nor  Gomez, but he has these documents.   By the way, all of this, according to CNN, is no surprise to General  Marco Ferreira, who was in charge of the immigration office in  Venezuela in 2002. He now lives in Miami. He was granted political  asylum. ``He told CNN that he personally witnessed corrupt senior  officials ordering passports for people who were not citizens when he  was running the department.'' He said it was ``very easy'' to assume  someone else's identity. It was ``very, very easy to go and be a  Venezuelan or pretend being born in Venezuela.''   I bring this up in the midst of all these other things because we now  understand that what we are facing in Venezuela is not just a corrupt  government and a tyranny but a nation that is under the corrupt  leadership of its now Vice President and, of course, its President, a  nation that is trafficking in selling passports and travel documents to  individuals with links to terrorism. That poses a direct threat to the  national security of the United States. I hope in the days to come,  with this new information and with this report, that we can work with  the Justice Department and the State Department to take appropriate  measures to protect our Nation and the world from what is occurring at  the hands of the Venezuelan Government under the tyrant Maduro and  under its Vice President, who personally ran the department that was  undertaking these corrupt activities.   I yield the floor.
