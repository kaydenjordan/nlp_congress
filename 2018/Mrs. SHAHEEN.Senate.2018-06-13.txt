 Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Tillis on  the floor today as he discusses Turkey and Pastor Andrew Brunson. I  applaud Senator Tillis for his continued commitment in seeking justice  for Pastor Brunson. Since March, Senator Tillis, Senator Lankford, and  I have joined together to keep pressure on Turkish President Erdogan.   We are not driven by diaspora politics, we have no hidden agendas,  and we are not agents for Gulen or other actors like the Turkish papers  have claimed--quite the contrary. As cochairs of the Senate NATO  Observer Group, Senator Tillis and I are ardent supporters of NATO. We  value Turkey's importance as an ally. We want U.S.-Turkey relations to  improve. Yet, supporting Turkey and the Turkish people should not mean  appeasing the Turkish President.   It is clear that the less we push back as a nation against Turkish  President Erdogan, the more emboldened he becomes.   Five years ago, if you had asked any diplomat or military official  whether Turkey would stoop so low as to take innocent Americans hostage  and leverage them for political gain, no one would have said that this  was a possibility. Yet that is where we are today.   Turkey has not only joined the ranks of Iran, Syria, North Korea, and  Venezuela as a hostage-taker, but it has shifted its orientation away  from NATO and toward Russia for no other reason except for Erdogan's  financial and electoral gain.   Even with the near-constant propaganda, however, there are things the  Turkish Government can't hide: Turkey's rapidly falling currency, the  faltering state of their judiciary, the inexplicable enrichment of  President Erdogan, his family, and his inner circle. All these issues  are well-known concerns. In fact, according to New World Wealth--the  research outfit that tracks millionaire migrations--in 2017, the  largest exodus of millionaires was seen in Turkey--a clear indication  that those who can leave Turkey are choosing to do so.   Unfortunately, the Turkish people can only do so much while living  under a dictatorship--a dictatorship that is about to expand on June  24, the date of Turkey's next election. For this reason, the United  States should not stay silent about what is happening in Turkey and  what is happening to NATO because of Turkey.   Senator Tillis and I both serve on the Senate Armed Services  Committee, and we successfully added a bipartisan and widely supported  amendment to this year's Defense bill that is moving through the  Senate. The amendment would stall the delivery or transfer of F-35  Joint Strike Fighters to Turkey.   I hope that both the Departments of State and Defense hear Congress  loud and clear: We should have no signing ceremonies, no planes, and no  moves to weaken NATO are acceptable at this time.   Our government is well aware of the serious security concerns that  may come if Turkey takes control of any F-35 aircraft. My colleagues  Senator Donnelly and Senator Tillis have already spoken eloquently to  that.   First, the Turkish Government claims to have purchased a Russian air  defense system designed to shoot these very planes down. NATO partners  need these F-35s to counter Russian activity. We would be handing this  technology over to the Kremlin if we granted Turkey these planes, and  Congress will not stand for it.   Second and absolutely critical to this afternoon's discussion is that  nothing should be more important than the safety of American citizens.   Pastor Brunson has been held in Turkey since October of 2016. The  charges against him are clearly fabricated, and the legal proceedings  have been a farce. His defense is not allowed to call up witnesses, and  the identities of the secret witnesses in his indictment are known to  be petty criminals.   What is happening to Pastor Brunson is an absolute shame, but it has  become a sad reality for those living in Turkey because Turkey has  already imprisoned over 50,000 of its own people. I wish we could do  more for all of those people, but at the very least, our government has  a duty to act when any American anywhere is held unjustly by a foreign  government. We must do everything we can to bring Americans home, to  bring Pastor Brunson home.   I encourage the administration to use every tool available in their  diplomatic and economic toolbox to bring the pastor and all innocent  Americans home at once. In the meantime, Senators Tillis, Lankford, and  I will continue to push for targeted sanctions against Erdogan and all  officials who are involved in the unlawful detention of Americans in  Turkey. We will not cease our efforts until Turkey rejoins the  community of democracies it once belonged to. We all hope this day  comes sooner rather than later.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to also talk about an issue that  has not made it into the Defense authorization bill, unlike the  amendment that Senator Tillis and I support.   Sadly, help for the Afghans who aided our troops in the war in  Afghanistan is not included in this Defense authorization bill. As most  of us know in  [[Page S3901]]  the Senate, the Afghan special immigrant visa program allows Afghans  who supported the U.S. mission in Afghanistan and who face threats of  harm to themselves or their families because of their service--we allow  them to apply for refuge in the United States through the special  immigrant visa program, or SIV program.   Over the years, there has been strong bipartisan support for this  effort to bring those Afghans in harm's way back to the United States.  I am pleased to have worked with Senator Tillis, Senator Wicker,  Senator Leahy, Senator Graham, and, of course, Senator McCain, who has  been the champion in the Senate to address this issue. I am proud to  partner yet again with these Senators, and we have introduced  legislation to authorize 4,000 SIVs for 2019 so that we can continue to  bring to the United States those people who are at risk.   Even as the administration sharply restricts immigration and refugee  programs, President Trump has made an exception for those who serve  alongside our soldiers and diplomats. He has included 4,000 Afghan SIVs  in his budget request for this upcoming fiscal year. The support for  this program truly is bipartisan.   I am here on the floor with Senator Tillis today to try to put a face  on this important program.   Afghan civilians who have assisted our military as interpreters,  firefighters, construction workers, and community liaisons are being  targeted by the Taliban for their willingness to work with the United  States. Without congressional approval, our military and our diplomats  will be powerless to help those Afghans. Moreover, U.S. officials in  Afghanistan will be powerless to help themselves. Unless Congress acts,  this program will lapse, and our Embassy and military will  unnecessarily suffer the devastating effects of this decision.   We cannot afford to break our promises to the Afghan people, to those  who serve our mission with such loyalty and at such enormous risk,  particularly at this time. U.S. forces--our military--and our diplomats  have always relied on local people to help accomplish our mission. As  we think about our future engagements, we will need this kind of  support in other places in the future. What does it say to people if we  renege on our promises to the Afghans? We must be aware of the message  we are sending to partners around the world when we don't fulfill our  duty to protect them after they have protected us. This is exactly why  countless military commanders and Ambassadors have pleaded with  Congress to extend the Afghan SIV program.   Behind me is a quote from Senator John McCain, a leader, as I said,  in the effort to ensure the safety of Afghan SIVs. We have worked  together each year since 2013, and his presence is sorely missed this  year. During last year's NDAA debate, he said:         We're talking about the lives of men who have put it on the       line for the men and women serving. . . . They're going to       die if we don't pass this amendment and take them out of       harm's way. Don't you understand the gravity of that?''    That is what Senator McCain had to say in 2016 when we were trying to  get this done in the Defense authorization bill. He is right. There is  no plan B for these Afghans. Either we save them by authorizing  additional special immigrant visas, or they will die. They will be  killed. Their families will be killed.   If Senator McCain were able to come to the floor today, I have no  doubt that he would be right here with Senator Tillis and me saying the  same thing. I hope that we can do Senator McCain a service by  reauthorizing the program he cared so much about under the bill that  bears his name.   We have also had many officials who have spoken out against attempts  to limit the eligibility of applicants. Former U.S. Ambassador to  Afghanistan Ryan Crocker said:         When deciding whom to kill, the Taliban do not make such       distinctions in service--nor should we when determining whom       to save.    Similarly, our former commander in Afghanistan, General Stanley  McChrystal, said:         Afghans performing a variety of roles are vital to the U.S.       mission, whether they work directly or indirectly with U.S.       Forces. I would urge Congress not to further erode already       limited eligibility guidelines.    In addition, our soldiers and marines are keenly interested in  protecting Afghan civilians who served with them. Many of them owe  their lives to the Afghans in various roles who went into combat with  them.   The roles in which Afghans serve range from interpreter, to lawyer,  to aid administrators, to cafeteria workers.   Abdul--who doesn't want his last name used because he fears for the  safety of his family back home--worked as the head waiter for American  troops in Afghanistan. Despite his classification as a cafeteria  employee, he helped our troops translate documents and interpret  conversations they were having both on and off the base. One night he  came in, and someone jumped him, beat him up, and threatened to kill  him and his family if he continued to help the United States.   Abdul was recommended for a special immigrant visa by the Army  sergeant he reported to, who found him the night he was attacked. The  chief of mission who approved his application thought that Abdul's  heartfelt service to our Nation was worthy enough to help save his  life. I believe that too. He wasn't an interpreter. He wasn't part of a  narrow group of Afghans who helped us. But he was there, nevertheless,  putting his life on the line for Americans serving in Afghanistan.   Last year, in Keene, NH, I met with a remarkable immigrant from  Afghanistan named Patmana Rafiq Kunary. Patmana had worked closely with  the U.S. Agency for International Development in Kabul. She went door- to-door and encouraged women to take out microloans to start their own  businesses. Patmana eventually became the vice president of operations  for the USAID-sponsored microloan program.    Yet, for a woman in Afghanistan, going door-to-door and working  closely with Americans, this was dangerous work. She drew unwelcome  attention wherever she went, and she became a high-profile target for  the Taliban and others. Then, one day in 2013, she received a call at  her USAID office. It was from the distraught wife of a USAID colleague,  an Afghan. The caller's husband had just been murdered, apparently, in  retaliation for his work with the Americans.   In her realizing that her life was in danger, too, Patmana applied  for a special immigrant visa. For 2 years, she and her husband were  subjected to repeated interviews at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. She told  me that while those background checks were going on, they had to move  periodically because, as soon as they settled someplace, the Taliban  would find out where they were, and they would be threatened again. Her  background was checked and rechecked before the visas were finally  granted.   Now, thankfully, Patmana lives happily in Keene. Her husband has  found work, and they have a 3-year-old daughter. They are welcomed as  valued members of the Keene community.   When it comes to the SIV program, there is no shortage of inspiring  narratives like the ones I am sharing today. It is no wonder that  during his own confirmation process, the Secretary of Defense, Gen.  James Mattis, said: ``Most of our units could not have accomplished  their missions without the assistance, often at the risk of their  lives, of these courageous men and women.''   We would never leave an American warrior behind on the battlefield.  Likewise, we must not leave behind those Afghans who served side by  side with our warriors and diplomats. We made a solemn promise to these  brave men and women, and I know that those of us here who believe we  need to keep that promise are going to do everything we can to make  sure that those special immigrant visas are authorized and available  next year for those thousands of Afghans who are still in the queue,  who are still themselves facing threats and threats to their families  because of their trying to help our military in Afghanistan.   I encourage all of my colleagues in the Senate to allow this program  to continue and to not permit any ill-informed notions about the  program's eligibility standards or the vetting process distract from  its success and from the strong bipartisan support it receives each  year. I urge my colleagues to keep our promise to our Afghan allies by  supporting these efforts.   I am very pleased to be here with Senator Tillis, who is also  committed  [[Page S3902]]  to the effort of trying to get this done. I know my colleague Senator  Ernst, who is here to speak, is also a supporter of this program. There  is strong bipartisan support to make this happen. We should not allow  one or two people to keep us from moving forward.   I thank the Presiding Officer. We will continue to work on this  effort.
