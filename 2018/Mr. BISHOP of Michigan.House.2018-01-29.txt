 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S.  534, the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport  Authorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) for giving me  this opportunity to speak.   Mr. Speaker, last week was a tough week in my district and in our  country. In a courtroom in Lansing, Michigan, 156 victims, one by one,  bravely faced depraved sexual predator Larry Nassar to recount their  personal story of unimaginable and despicable atrocities.   As we now know, reports of sexual misconduct were routinely dismissed  or flatly ignored by the management of USA Gymnastics. As a direct  result, hundreds of young women, all of whom relied on these trusted  professionals all around them, were sexually assaulted under the guise  of medical treatment.   The court did its part this week and sentenced Nassar to a maximum  prison term where he will spend the rest of his life. But the  investigation continues and others will be held accountable in days to  come.   For our part during this process, Members of Congress must do  everything in their power to ensure that this never happens again. With  that as our objective, I believe this bill takes a dramatic step in the  right direction.    Now, I must say in all candor, I stand before you today in absolute  disbelief; disbelief in the layers of mismanagement that should have  prevented this from happening, but also disbelief that it takes an act  of Congress to ensure a congressionally chartered organization fulfill  its obligation to care for and protect the young athletes with whom  their parents have entrusted.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to join my constituents in offering our  heartfelt prayers to the victims and their families for the nightmare  that they have experienced.   To all of you: Please know my colleagues and I will do everything in  our power to be your strong advocate and to ensure justice.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to advocate and support this  legislation   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, as we have listened to various speakers, I am glad that  we are joined by men and women of the United States Congress. All of us  have indicated the sadness in which we do this now.   But I think it is also important to take note of the fact of  individuals who have to be held responsible. We know that the president  of the university was asked to resign, or in fact has resigned. As we  go forward, there will be others as well.   This should be the clarion call, even as this legislation is passed  and signed by the President, for all of these agencies and associations  that run sports for children to do their own vetting and internal  assessment of individuals who are not there for the benefit of children  but are there for the benefit of themselves.   156-plus women were molested by this doctor. One of the victims said  something that stops your breath. This could have been stopped in 1997,  more than 20 years ago.   So this legislation should move swiftly to the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1730
