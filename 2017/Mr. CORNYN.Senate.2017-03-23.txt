 Madam President, speaking of the vote that we will be  having in just a few minutes, for the last several weeks, this Chamber  has worked very hard to undo harmful rules and regulations that had  been put forward by the Obama administration, at the last moment, as he  was headed out the door. These are rules that hurt job creators and  stifle economic growth.   The FCC privacy rules are just another example of burdensome rules  that hurt more than they help and serve as another example of the  government's picking winners and losers. They unnecessarily target  internet service providers and, ultimately, make our internet ecosystem  less efficient by adding more redtape.   The bottom line is that the FCC privacy rules are bad regulations  that need to be repealed.   I should also note that this Congressional Review Act vote will not  change the entire online privacy protections that consumers currently  enjoy, and it will not change statutory privacy protections under the  Communications Act. It will repeal something that was done unilaterally  by President Obama and his administration, as I said, following the  ending of his term, as they were headed out the door.   I thank the junior Senator from Arizona, Senator Flake, for his work  on this CRA and moving it forward.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution of  disapproval.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Georgia (Mr. Isakson) and the Senator from Kentucky (Mr.  Paul).   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). Are there any other Senators in  the Chamber desiring to vote?   The result was announced--yeas 50, nays 48, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 94 Leg.]                                  YEAS--50       Alexander      Barrasso      Blunt      Boozman      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Cochran      Collins      Corker      Cornyn      Cotton      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Enzi      Ernst      Fischer      Flake      Gardner      Graham      Grassley      Hatch      Heller      Hoeven      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      McCain      McConnell      Moran      Murkowski      Perdue      Portman      Risch      Roberts      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott      Shelby      Strange  [[Page S1955]]        Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Wicker      Young                                  NAYS--48       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Coons      Cortez Masto      Donnelly      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Franken      Gillibrand      Harris      Hassan      Heinrich      Heitkamp      Hirono      Kaine      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Manchin      Markey      McCaskill      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Nelson      Peters      Reed      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Stabenow      Tester      Udall      Van Hollen      Warner      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                               NOT VOTING--2       Isakson      Paul           The joint resolution (S.J.
