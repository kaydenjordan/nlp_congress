 Madam Speaker, today, we honor the life of a fearless  labor leader, Richard Trumka. With his recent passing, the working  people of America lost an outspoken, powerful voice.   Mr. Trumka dedicated his life and career to serving American workers.  From his early days as a staff attorney for the United Mine Workers of  America and throughout his tenure as President of the American  Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, he was a  consistent champion for social and economic justice, fair wages, and  safe working conditions--and our nation is better for it.   During my time in Congress, I had the pleasure of meeting with Mr.  Trumka on several occasions to discuss the challenges facing American  families and union workers, and to explore the ways in which we could  lift up all people. He was a fierce advocate for policies that had the  power to produce real, meaningful results that would improve countless  lives.   Now more than ever, as our country and our economy grapple with the  devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will miss Mr. Trumka  's presence in the fight to fully recover from the economic downturn  and difficulties we've experienced, but we will never stop the work he  started. The way to honor his memory is by empowering workers and the  unions that represent them.   I offer my sincerest condolences to the family, friends, colleagues,  and loved ones of Mr. Trumka during this time.
