 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 2, line 18, strike ``public''.        Page 2, line 19, insert before the period the following ``,       other than a business combination related shell company''.        Page 2, after line 19, insert the following:        (iv) Directly, or indirectly through any of its affiliates,       provides financing related to the transfer of ownership of an       eligible privately held company.        (v) Assists any party to obtain financing from an       unaffiliated third party without--         (I) complying with all other applicable laws in connection       with such assistance, including, if applicable, Regulation T       (12 C.F.R. 220 et seq.); and        (II) disclosing any compensation in writing to the party.         (vi) Represents both the buyer and the seller in the same       transaction without providing clear written disclosure as to       the parties the broker represents and obtaining written       consent from both parties to the joint representation.        (vii) Facilitates a transaction with a group of buyers       formed with the assistance of the M&A broker to acquire the       eligible privately held company.        (viii) Engages in a transaction involving the transfer of       ownership of an eligible privately held company to a passive       buyer or group of passive buyers. For purposes of the       preceding sentence, a buyer that is actively involved in       managing the acquired company is not a passive buyer,       regardless of whether such buyer is itself owned by passive       beneficial owners.        (ix) Binds a party to a transfer of ownership of an       eligible privately held company.        Page 3, after line 16, insert the following (and       redesignate subsequent clauses accordingly):        ``(i) Business combination related shell company.--The term       `business combination related shell company' means a shell       company that is formed by an entity that is not a shell       company--         ``(I) solely for the purpose of changing the corporate       domicile of that entity solely within the United States; or        ``(II) solely for the purpose of completing a business       combination transaction (as defined under section 230.165(f)       of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations) among one or more       entities other than the company itself, none of which is a       shell company.''.         Page 4, line 1, strike ``officer exercising'' and insert       ``corporate officer of a corporation or limited liability       company, and exercises''.        Page 4, line 4, strike ``20'' and insert ``25''.        Page 4, line 7, strike ``20'' and insert ``25''.        Page 4, line 12, strike ``20'' and insert ``25''.        Page 5, after line 18, insert the following flush-left       text: ``For purposes of this subclause, the Commission may by       rule modify the dollar figures if the Commission determines       that such a modification is necessary or appropriate in the       public interest or for the protection of investors.''.        Page 7, strike lines 15 through 25 and insert the       following:        ``(v) Shell company.--The term `shell company' means a       company that at the time of a transaction with an eligible       privately held company--         ``(I) has no or nominal operations; and        ``(II) has--''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 647, the  gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman) and a Member opposed each will  control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R. 477, the  Small Business Mergers, Acquisitions, Sales, and Brokerage  Simplification Act of 2017.   I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) for  working with me on this amendment. It has been a pleasure to work with  him on this bill over a period of three Congresses.   With the adoption of this amendment, the bill will be in a form that  will secure support from both sides of the aisle, not only my support,  but, more importantly, the ranking member's support.   In the 113th Congress, the House of Representatives supported a  similar bill to provide relief to the M&A community by providing that,  in certain circumstances, a small business merger or acquisitions  broker would not have to register.   As a result of that action by the House, which was not matched by  action in the Senate, the Securities and Exchange Commission understood  the wisdom of this House and introduced a no-action letter dated  January 2014 to provide the same level of relief requested by the  House.   In their no-action letter, however, the SEC placed several  limitations on the exemption from registration that were not included  in the House bill, but, with this amendment, will be included in this  year's bill.   These limitations provided additional protections for investors and  small businesses. It excluded bad actors and shell companies. It  prohibited passive buyers in the M&A transaction to ensure that  companies cannot use this exemption from registration as a capital- raising mechanism. It prohibited an M&A broker from providing financing  for the transfer. It prohibited M&A brokers from binding a party to a  transfer of ownership. I think this is most important: it required  that, to be eligible, a broker would have to disclose to both parties  and get their consents if they are being paid by both parties. So if  there is both a seller's commission and a buyer's commission, you have  to tell the buyer and the seller.   Now, those who want to step outside this safe harbor can simply  register. But those who will be exempt from registration need to comply  with these six elements.   The Small Business Mergers, Acquisition, Sales, and Brokerage  Simplification Act will codify the SEC's no-action letter and provide  certainty to  [[Page H9742]]  small business merger and acquisition brokers.   In the last Congress, I opposed the bill because it included only two  of the six restrictions that were included by the SEC. With this  amendment, the bill will include all of the restrictions. This is a  bipartisan amendment and it includes all the limitations of the SEC's  no-action letter. It has been a pleasure to work with the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) on it.   In addition, our amendment provides that the SEC has the rulemaking  authority to determine the correct thresholds for gross revenues and of  EBITDA--that is to say, earnings of the company before interest, taxes,  depreciation, and amortization--in determining whether a company  qualifies as an eligible company under this bill.   The SEC is the agency with the expertise to do this. I encourage them  to examine this issue closely and to ensure that any threshold in place  is evidence-based. I encourage them in future years to inflation-adjust  whatever limitation dollar figures they have in their regulations.   I am pleased to offer this amendment with my colleague, Mr. Huizenga,  whom I may have previously identified as the gentleman from Michigan. I  offer it also with the support of the ranking member. I urge the  passage of this amendment, as it will ensure bipartisan support for the  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question  is ordered on the bill, as amended, and on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman).   The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman).   The amendment was agreed to.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third  reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
