 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the brilliant coach  of the United States Women's National Team, Jill Ellis.   On Sunday, on a soccer pitch in Lyon, France, our U.S. team clinched  their fourth FIFA World Cup victory, two of which have been won under  the leadership of Coach Jill Ellis.   I know that our former colleagues who passed title IX in 1972 are  smiling. That year, only 700 girls in the United States played soccer  at a high school level. This year, over 400,000 played at a high school  level, a 55,000 percent increase.   Coach Ellis lives in my district with her family. She is my friend.   We join our entire country in honoring her extraordinary recruiting,  her analytical skills, and the sophisticated winning system she  developed. As one writer put it, her team ``could do different things  and win in different ways.''   Jill Ellis is one of the greatest coaches in soccer history. She is  the very definition of world class.   I am proud to join my colleagues in honoring her and the entire  United States Women's National Team today.

Madam Chairwoman, the Department of Defense Tuition Assistance  program provides financial assistance to servicemembers for voluntary  off-duty education programs in support of professional and personal  development.   Tuition assistance is available for courses that are offered in the  classroom or by distance learning and are part of an approved academic  degree or certification program.   These courses must be offered by schools that are recognized by the  United States Department of Education, and they must abide by all rules  governing the higher education sector.   Because of a loophole that exists in Federal law, known as the GI  Bill loophole, however, many for-profit colleges target veterans and  servicemembers with aggressive and deceptive recruiting tactics in  order to collect as much GI Bill and DOD revenue as possible.                                time  2000    In fact, research has demonstrated that the for-profit college sector  is the only sector in higher education that increases tuition when  additional Federal student aid becomes available. As one for-profit  college president turned whistleblower told veterans' organizations and  Federal officials last summer:         We cleaned up all our materials, but behind closed doors,       our recruiters will do anything and say anything to get their       hands on GI benefits and DOD Tuition Assistance funds.    This is simply unacceptable. Through the selfless sacrifice of our  men and women in uniform, we as citizens receive freedom, a freedom  that many people in this world envy. We owe an immense debt of  gratitude to those who serve and must not allow anyone to abuse their  benefits.   Madam Chair, this amendment is simple, and it will ensure that  veterans, Active Duty servicemembers, and their families are not taken  advantage of by anyone in the predatory for-profit college sector. This  amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to publish on its website  the distribution of DOD Tuition Assistance funds at institutions of  higher education and conduct an audit for any for-profit institution  that fails to meet the financial responsibility standards set in the  Higher Education Act of 1965.   Madam Chair, a for-profit college has, by definition, a fiduciary  duty to its shareholders to maximize profits. Success is determined by  the amount of tuition revenue brought in and the profits made, not by  the quality of education provided to its students.   We speak about the good and bad actors in the for-profit college  sector, and this amendment seeks to tell us just that. I know that my  good friends on the other side of the aisle have always supported our  veterans. I know they deeply care about fiscally responsible policies  and transparency.   Supporting our veterans and Active Duty servicemembers has  historically drawn large, bipartisan support. It is incumbent upon us  as elected officials to put forth an accountability system that  distinguishes bad actors from good actors and looks out for the  American taxpayer and protects our military community.   Madam Chair, this is personal for me. Every generation of my family  has served in our country's military, and all have used their  educational benefits. I know the value of a good education. I have seen  it firsthand in my four decades as an educator and as a college  president. Our veterans deserve better than policies that allow bad  actors in our education system to take advantage of their service and  their sacrifice.   I want to thank my colleagues who have worked with me on this issue  and my good friend, Congresswoman Katie Porter, for cosponsoring this  amendment. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment  and stand on the side of our servicemembers.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, the DOD has already taken steps before to  ensure Tuition Assistance funds are being spent properly when those  institutions have been identified.   My amendment allows the Secretary to broadly apply much-needed  oversight to a sector that continues to defraud servicemembers and  siphons off billions of dollars from the Federal Government.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
