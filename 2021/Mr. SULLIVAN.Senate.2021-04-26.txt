 Madam President, I rise today on the Senate floor to  call for the resignation of John Kerry as a member of the Biden  administration's National Security Council.   Now, I don't do this lightly. As a matter of fact, in my entire time  in the Senate, I have never called for anyone's resignation--Obama- Biden administration, Trump administration, Biden administration now. I  have been tempted, particularly when some in government have tried to  hurt my State. A lot of that is going on right now with the Biden  administration. But his record--John Kerry's record--of undermining  working families and working against American national security  interests is too much to bear. He needs to go.   Today, I have heard such disturbing news that, if true, it should  absolutely result in the call of John Kerry either being fired or  resigning. Enough is enough. Why am I saying this? First, he is killing  jobs, arrogantly killing American jobs. That is a fact. He is putting  hard-working Americans, particularly in the energy sector--the great  men and women who make our country strong by developing oil and gas  resources; a lot of my constituents--in the name of climate goals, he  is putting them out of work. He is going to Wall Street, saying: Don't  finance these projects anymore. That is what reporters are saying.   On these issues, I completely and adamantly disagree with the  arrogant way--frankly, callous way--he says: Hey, people need to move  on to better jobs. But for this issue alone, I wouldn't be calling for  his resignation. This is a major difference in the Biden  administration's policies and priorities with regard to the American  people. I think it is going to really come back and hit this  administration hard because the vast majority of Americans don't agree  with putting people out of work, energy workers out of work during a  recession and pandemic, but that  [[Page S2192]]  is going to be decided in the voting box in the elections. The American  people will ultimately decide whether arrogantly putting thousands and  thousands of energy workers out of work right now is a good idea.   In the name of these climate goals, he has also been a strong  appeaser of countries that threaten ours.   Let me take you back to 2015. I was a brandnew U.S. Senator.  President Obama and President Xi Jinping are meeting in the Rose  Garden.   President Xi Jinping from China tells the President of the United  States and the American people: No, we are not going to militarize the  South China Sea. We won't do it.   Of course, the Chinese Communist Party was not telling the truth to  the President of the United States and the American people. They  started to do this already, militarizing one of the most important sea  routes in the world.   Many of us here in the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, said: We  need to stand up for our interests. We need the U.S. Navy to do freedom  of navigation operations.    The Secretary of Defense wanted to do this. The admiral in charge of  the INDOPACOM area of responsibility wanted to do this. But we now  know, in principals' meetings, we delayed doing this for almost 3 years  because John Kerry said: We don't want to get the Chinese mad, or they  will go back on their Paris climate deal and commitments--which, by the  way, are way out in the future.   This is true. This is true. This happened. Again, in my view, this  bordered on treacherous but not treasonous. I didn't call for his  resignation then. I was mad about it. By the way, a lot of people in  the Obama administration were mad about this, including the Secretary  of Defense. We lost a lot of time.   It certainly makes me nervous that John Kerry is out in Beijing  again. What kind of deal did he cut this time with China, the Communist  Party of China, which won't keep any commitments? But, again, that  wasn't a call for resignation.   The straw that broke the camel's back came out today, and it is the  reason I am up here calling for John Kerry to resign. It is a tape that  was leaked of an interview with Iran's Foreign Minister, Mohammad  Zarif.   First, some background. Zarif was being interviewed by an economist  and journalist who is an adviser to Mohammad Khatami, the pro-reform  cleric who served two terms as Iran's President. An edited version was  intended to be public of this interview only after Iran's current  President left office in August, but it was leaked.   Zarif, according to reports, says many interesting and telling things  in the tape, one, for example, that, in my view, the rightful killing  of General Soleimani, the Quds Force commander, in January of 2020 when  he was in Iraq looking to kill more American soldiers--Zarif said this  ``was a major blow to Iran, more damaging than if it had wiped out an  entire city in an attack''--that was what a lot of us were arguing at  the time--and that unlike what John Kerry had been telling the public  when negotiating the Iran nuclear deal in the Obama administration, it  is the Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Quds Force, not Zarif, who calls  the shots in Iran. That is all on the tapes.   But the most disturbing part of the interview that was leaked was  when Zarif said that John Kerry told him, the Iranian Foreign Minister,  about covert Israeli actions against Iranian interests in Syria. Now  think about that. According to news reports, Zarif is heard as saying:         It was former U.S. Foreign Secretary John Kerry who told me       Israel had launched more than 200 attacks on Iranian forces       in Syria.    That is Zarif saying John Kerry told him that, classified information  about one of our most important allies in the world, Israel.   Zarif said that he ``listened to this information [from Secretary  Kerry] in astonishment.''   Now, when I read this today, I was astonished as well, that a former  Secretary of State, now a member of President Biden's National Security  Council--who wasn't confirmed for that, by the way, by this body--would  reveal the secrets of one of our most important and enduring allies in  the region to an avowed enemy and the largest state sponsor of  terrorism, a country that was responsible for the killing and wounding  and maiming of thousands of American service men and women, whose  leaders have the blood of American soldiers on their hands. He is  telling them that information.   It is unclear why John Kerry would relay such information to the  leaders of the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world, but  here is a guess: During the Trump administration, after that  administration pulled out of the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, which  John Kerry negotiated--and by the way, a bipartisan majority of U.S.  Senators in this body were against that deal--John Kerry started to  freelance. He admitted to meeting with Zarif in 2018 to try to salvage  the nuclear deal. In other words, he was likely acting and working  against the previous administration, the elected administration, the  Trump administration, and many of us here in Congress who applauded  when we pulled out of the JCPOA.   Madam President, I would ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record an article written today by the National Review titled ``John  Kerry, Enemy of Israel.'        There being no objection, the material was ordered to be       printed in the Record, as follows:                        John Kerry, Enemy of Israel                            (By David Harsanyi)         We know now that former secretary of state John Kerry isn't       merely a critic of Israel; he is an adversary. In leaked       audiotapes obtained by the U.K.-based Iran International, as       reported by the New York Times, Iranian foreign minister       Mohammad Javad Zarif told a supporter that the former       secretary of state had informed him about ``at least'' 200       covert Israeli actions against Iranian interests in Syria.       Zarif listened to this information in ``astonishment.''        It's predictable, perhaps, that the Times glides over this       remarkable exchange in a single-sentence paragraph that is       submerged near the bottom of the piece. (I guess it's better       than the Washington Post, which doesn't even mention the       interaction.)        A high-ranking American official feels comfortable sharing       this information with an autocratic adversary--a government       that's murdered hundreds of Americans, regularly kidnapped       them, interfered with our elections, and propped up a regime       that gasses its people--about the covert actions of a long-      time American ally. What else did he tell Zarif? The Times       doesn't say.        It wouldn't be surprising if Israel was more reluctant to       share intel with the United States when Democrats such as       Kerry show more fondness for those making genocidal threats       against the Jewish people than they do for the state that       protects them. It's worth remembering that others like       Senator Chris Murphy (who is now ``requesting a classified       briefing'' on the Natanz incident, in which Israel likely       sabotaged a nuclear facility) also secretly met with Zarif in       Munich in a coordinated effort to undercut the Trump       administration's efforts to derail Iran's ongoing nuclear-      weapons program--an incident that comports far more closely       with the definition of ``collusion'' than anything turned up       against Trump officials. We have no idea what Murphy       discussed with Zarif, either.        We do know that after the assassination of Qasem       Soleimani--head of the Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force and       the terror group behind the death of over 600 American       servicemen and thousands of others--Kerry and Murphy were       among the many people scaremongering over a ``massive       regional war'' that never materialized. In his leaked       conversation, Zarif says of Soleimani that ``by assassinating       him in Iraq, the United States delivered a major blow to       Iran, more damaging than if it had wiped out an entire city       in an attack.''        As the Trump years proved, there are a number of options       available as we wait for the Iranian regime to come to its       senses or, hopefully, crumble, including maximum economic       pressure and sabotage. Last week. Israel reportedly blew up       Iran's Natanz nuclear facility's electrical substation,       located 40 to 50 meters underground, damaging ``thousands of       centrifuges.'' This is likely the second time in the past few       months that the Israelis have been able to smuggle explosives       into the facility and detonate them remotely. Of course, this       incident is only one in a long line of unexplained fires,       assassinations, and computer worms that have caused       substantial delays and damage to the illegal Iranian nuclear-      weapons program. All of these efforts have likely saved lives       by delaying the ability of Iran to become another North       Korea--or worse, since Iran exports terror all over the       world.        During the Obama years, Democrats would offer an ugly false       choice: You either support diplomacy with the ``moderate''       wing of the theocratic state, or you endorse ``war''; either       fly unmarked euros in tonnage and bail out the Mullahs, or       plunge America into another Iraq War. At one point, Obama       claimed that the Republican caucus was making ``common       cause'' with Iranian hard-liners.        The opposite was true. In the leaked audio from Zarif, we       hear that the military and  [[Page S2193]]       theocratic forces in the nation ``call the shots'' and       overrule ``government decisions and ignoring advice.''       According to the Times, Zarif says that the political wing is       ``severely constricted'' and decisions ``are dictated by the       supreme leader or Revolutionary Guards Corps.'' Obama's       contention that the Iran deal was being forged with the       ``moderate faction'' was always a fantasy.        The real moderates in Iran were forsaken by Obama and Biden       when they decided that the United States wouldn't support the       2009 Green Movement, in what Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky       called one of the biggest failures of human rights in modern       history. Democrats Murphy, Biden, and Kerry are more       interested in ensuring Iran becomes a regional counterforce       to Israeli power.        Whatever you believe about the Joint Comprehensive Plan of       Action, or Biden's iteration of the deal, it should not have       to be said that high-ranking United States officials       shouldn't be sharing sensitive information about an ally with       a terror regime. Yet it also seems quite likely that's       exactly what John Kerry did.     The beginning of this article says:         Let's pause to reflect on how monumentally stunning it is       that the former U.S. secretary of state allegedly tattled on       Israel to Iran.    It goes on to say: A high-ranking American official would feel  comfortable sharing this kind of classified information ``with an  autocratic adversary--a government that's murdered hundreds of  Americans, regularly kidnapped them, interfered with our elections, and  propped up a regime that gasses its people--about the covert actions of  a long-time critical American ally.''   What else did Kerry tell Zarif, this article asks? Press reports  don't say, but if this is true, if John Kerry told Iran--the leaders of  Iran--about issues relating to our most critical ally in the region,  Israel, which Iran has repeatedly said they want to wipe Israel off the  face of the Earth, if he did this, he needs to resign. If he did this  with the intent of undermining the current President of the United  States at the time, President Trump, and the Members of this body, he  needs to resign.   He is a member of the current administration's National Security  Council. It has become clear that our adversaries, whether Beijing or  Iran, like it when John Kerry is in charge of foreign policy and  national security. Why? Because they know how to use him to their  advantage. And our allies fear him. Why? Because they know his judgment  is off on so many issues. So, too, do America's working families.   We need to look into this. If this is true--if this is true--I  certainly hope other Members of this body, Democrats and Republicans,  will join me in calling for the resignation of John Kerry. Enough is  enough. The redline that was crossed, if this is true, revealing secret  information to one of America's most sworn enemies, with the blood of  thousands of American military members on its hands, undermining the  interests of one of our most important allies, the State of Israel, if  this is true, John Kerry needs to go. He should resign or he should get  fired by the President of the United States.   I yield the floor.
