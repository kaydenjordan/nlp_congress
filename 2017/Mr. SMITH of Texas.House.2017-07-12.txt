 Mr. Speaker, a recent Politico/Morning Consult  poll shows that 60 percent of registered voters support ``new  guidelines which say visa applicants from six predominantly Muslim  countries must prove a close family relationship with a U.S. resident  in order to enter the country.'' Only 28 percent oppose. Also,  respondents trust Republicans in Congress more than Democrats to handle  the issue of immigration.   The new, nationwide poll demonstrates strong approval by the  electorate for the President's effort to keep America safe, despite a  question slanted to make respondents think his action is based on  religion.   Had the question noted that the six nations that require additional  visa scrutiny were also selected by the Obama administration as  national security threats, the poll likely would have revealed even  more support for the new guidelines.   When it comes to immigration policy, the American people support the  President.                            ____________________
