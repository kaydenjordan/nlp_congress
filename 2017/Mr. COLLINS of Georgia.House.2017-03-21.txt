 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 209 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:  [[Page H2253]]                                     H. Res. 209         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 372) to       restore the application of the Federal antitrust laws to the       business of health insurance to protect competition and       consumers. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on the Judiciary now       printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a       substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       115-8 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended,       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as       amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary;       and (2) one motion to recommit with or without instructions.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for  1 hour.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Polis), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                general leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Polis), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                general leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on House Resolution 209, currently  under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Stewart). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Today I am pleased to bring forward this rule on behalf of the Rules  Committee. The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 372, the  Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act. The rule provides for 1 hour  of debate for the bill, equally divided between the chairman and  ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. The rule also provides for a  motion to recommit.   Yesterday, the Rules Committee had the opportunity to hear from  Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte and Congressman David  Cicilline on behalf of the Judiciary Committee.   I thank Chairman Goodlatte and the Judiciary Committee staff for  their work on this legislation. As a member of the Judiciary Committee,  I had the opportunity to review this legislation at both a committee  hearing and a markup.   We heard from several witnesses at the Judiciary Committee hearing,  including the bill's primary sponsor, Congressman Paul Gosar of  Arizona.   In addition to the bill's sponsor and the Judiciary Committee, I  would also like to recognize one of my colleagues from Georgia,  Representative Austin Scott, for his interest in this topic and  leadership on this legislation. Congressman Austin Scott of Georgia  testified before the Judiciary Committee on this bill and has worked  actively to highlight this issue.   The issue of competition in the health insurance marketplace is not a  new one, but it is one that deserves more attention. Legislation  similar to the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act passed the House  under a Democrat-led Congress in 2010 and under a Republican Congress  in 2012.   Mr. Speaker, much of our attention on the floor this week is focused  on making health care more affordable and accessible to the American  people. The Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act is part of that  plan.   From shore to shore, we have seen and heard stories about the soaring  costs of health care and the health insurance markets that have been  hamstrung by ACA regulations. As a result, insurers have fled the  exchanges while consumer choice and access to quality care have  disappeared along with them.   Today, more than ever, we need to institute reforms that restore  options for Americans by encouraging healthy competition in the health  insurance market. The problem actually dates back to the 1940s, and the  Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act helps address a problem that  has increasingly demanded attention.   In 1944, Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court held, for the first time,  that insurance was part of interstate commerce and was, therefore,  subject to Federal antitrust laws. Congress responded a year later by  passing the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which established certain exemptions  from the Federal antitrust regulations for the business of insurance.  That law remains in place today, and reexamining it in the context of  our health insurance market has received bipartisan support.   The Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act would amend the 1945  McCarran-Ferguson Act to apply our three main antitrust laws--the  Clayton Act, the Sherman Act, and the FTC Act--to the health insurance  industry.   To be clear, this bill does not impose new or radical regulations  upon the health insurance industry. It merely applies longstanding  antitrust laws to the business of health insurance, laws that have  applied to the rest of the economy for decades. By restoring the  application of our competition and antitrust laws to the health  insurance industry, we strengthen the foundation for a competitive  health insurance market.   The high prices and lack of choices that patients find in health  insurance flow back from a lack of competition in the market and a  barrage of regulations. So it is past time that we reestablish a basis  for a system in which insurance providers compete for customers in a  patient-driven marketplace.   While we work to bring common sense back to health care, we also have  to look at the broad context of where the industry is and how it got  there. In that spirit, this bill recognizes the importance of open and  free competition across the economy, including the healthcare  marketplace. Part of the government's role is to guard the American  people rather than creating special interest exemptions that ultimately  work against the hardworking citizens. H.R. 372 establishes that there  is no basis for further exemption of the health insurance industry from  the Federal antitrust law.   Importantly, however, H.R. 372 also contains narrowly defined safe  harbors to protect historically procompetitive collaborative activities  that are unique to the business of insurance, including the collection  and distribution of historical loss data and the performance of  actuarial services that do not involve a restraint of trade.   The Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act is not a magic pill or a  silver bullet, but it is a key component of our broader plan to restore  competition and common sense to the healthcare marketplace.   The principles captured by this bill are part of our House Republican  Better Way plan and a part of our plan to address the harm done that  ObamaCare has brought on our healthcare system and those who depend on  it.   I look forward to the underlying legislation once again receiving  broad support from both sides of the aisle.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott) to continue  discussing the rule before us about the McCarran-Ferguson repeal.   Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of H.R. 372, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of  2017, which would take a big step towards creating a more business- and  consumer-friendly insurance market that works for all Americans.   As I listened to the comments just before I stood up, I heard that  this is a fine bill. It is more than a fine bill. This is a good bill.  Let me tell you how I know it is a good bill--because, a few years ago,  both Nancy Pelosi and Mike Pence voted for it.   Now, what the Democrats don't want to tell you is that on February  24, 2010, less than a month before the Affordable Care Act was signed  into law, there was an agreement that allowing the insurance companies  to be exempt from the antitrust laws in the country was a problem.   So how is it that with a bill that passed 406 ``yes'' votes to 19  ``no'' votes--when it came out of the dark rooms, the Affordable Care  Act was brought to the floor with the comments of: Well, you will have  to read it to find out what is in it.  [[Page H2255]]    Perhaps the Democrats should have read it to find out what wasn't in  it, because the leadership not only sold America out, they sold them  out. This bill passed 406-19. Yet, in the back rooms where they put the  Affordable Care Act together, they didn't include the provision.   While the Affordable Care Act certainly has played a major role in  the disruptions patients and providers have experienced, the decades- old special exemption--which they voted to take away, and then the  leadership of the Democratic party gave it back to the insurance  industry--shielding insurers from Federal antitrust laws has eroded  confidence and competition in the marketplace. Fortunately, we have a  vehicle before us to walk back this special deal.   The legislation currently before the House would inject much-needed  competition into the health insurance market by eliminating the  antitrust exemptions for health and dental insurers, leveling the  playing field and giving consumers and providers more leverage and  better options. There are very few antitrust exemptions in our country,  and for good reason.   This exemption is not only damaging to the consumer when they  purchase health insurance, but it damages the healthcare providers,  further limiting consumers' access to services.   The dominance of the market that large insurers have enjoyed has  forced many providers to move, close, merge, or sell to larger regional  hospitals, impacting parties across the industry. In the 24 counties of  Georgia that I represent, patients have few healthcare choices left  that impacts their ability to receive quality care and negotiate a  policy that meets their unique needs.   Echoing that sentiment, I think anyone who has skin in the game will  tell you that a majority of the problems in the healthcare marketplace  trace their roots back to a lack of competition.                                time  1245    Yet, the Democrats left the insurance industry exempt from the  antitrust laws once again when they passed the Affordable Care Act.   While insurance companies have the power to negotiate, just as they  proved in the negotiations with the Democrats on the Affordable Care  Act, pharmacies, physicians, and hospitals are left without a seat at  the table. When the insurance companies get to determine who is and  isn't able to provide healthcare services, the insurer-provider  relationship is closer to extortion than negotiation.   So why do we allow the health insurance industry that controls,  through their contracts, who your doctor is, who your pharmacist is,  which medicine you can get, and which hospital you can go to, to be  exempt from the antitrust laws of the country? How could the Democrats  do that to you in the Affordable Care Act?   By definition, health care and health insurance are not the same  thing, but when one industry, one insurance company controls such  significant portions of the cash flow of all of the providers in a  region, no provider can stay in business without a contract with that  carrier; therefore, the insurance company gets to determine who is and  who is not able to provide health care.   Removing this antitrust exemption for health insurers means one more  option for consumers, increased competition between providers, and  greater certainty for insurers when it comes to hammering out policies  and working for consumers across the spectrum. It should have been done  long ago, but the Democrats turned their back on the American public  and, again, granted the health insurance industry an exemption from the  antitrust laws of the country.   While this is certainly not an end-all, be-all to reforming our  broken and dysfunctional healthcare system, it is a commonsense step  towards untangling the mess our health insurance marketplace has  become.   I also think it noteworthy to mention, again, February 24, 2010, the  Health Insurance Industry Fair Competition Act passed the House with a  vote 406-19 only 1 month prior to the Affordable Care Act being signed  into law. And yet, the American citizens, once again, were sold out by  the Democratic Party.   I strongly believe this piece of legislation currently before the  House lays a firm foundation in our work to fulfill our promise to fix  our badly broken healthcare system. Today we have the opportunity to  provide relief to consumers and providers alike, and I urge my  colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 372, the Competitive Health  Insurance Reform Act of 2017.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I would just like to remind those from the House that if you do  defeat this rule, you will not vote on this commonsense piece of  legislation. So let's at least put the correct procedural order out  there.   We need to vote ``yes'' on this rule and get on to the underlying  piece of legislation, which is a piece that has passed this House not  only unanimously by voice vote in the Republican Congress but also with  an overwhelming vote just recently in the Democratic administration as  well. So we are moving forward on this.   I think what is interesting here, and what I have worked on, and we  are going to have a lot of discussion on for the next 2 days is  repealing and replacing ObamaCare. I think it was interesting that my  friend--we share many a night and day in the Rules Committee, we share  different opinions, but he made mention of the elephant in the room. I  will just make mention of the donkey in the room.    It is amazing to me now that we are actually concerned about people  losing health care. We are actually concerned about prices going up. We  are actually concerned about these issues that have been going on for 7  years. We are having an $800 billion tax because we have removed the  taxes and impediments of ObamaCare. We are actually--instead of  mandating the folks that they buy insurance that they can't afford and  can't use, we are actually getting a marketplace that will actually  give them better choices and results.   I think the interesting part here is not knowing the cost and  benefits. Good gracious. All we have to do is look back over the last 7  years, Mr. Speaker. When we understand what is going on, let's also, as  we throw out the discussion--it was made in comment by my friend, 7  years to fix. You can't fix broken in this regard. When he goes about  it traditionally wrong, it is not fixing. When you take away the  markets, when you take away the individual market, and when you are  taking away the very incentives that actually are the underpinnings of  our health care to enlarge and grow, if your goals were to reduce and  expand, then you failed miserably. You have not reduced costs, they  have gone up. You have not expanded choices, they have gone down.   I have listened to it about as much as I can right now. We are going  to have the next 2 days to give people health. It is why we are over  here for the majority speaking because of the failure of the ACA in  ObamaCare. When we understand that, then we can look at pieces of  legislation like the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act that  should have been part of this a long time ago. Yet, we choose to begin  discussions about a failure. It is about a failure.   Choose the status quo. Squint your eyes, look real hard, it is not  getting worse, it is really okay, just help us tweak it, help it get  better.   It is not getting any better. In fact, any insurance company is on a  death spiral. ObamaCare is failing. Some of the CBO estimates about  increased costs 10 years out are based on ObamaCare pricing. There  wouldn't even be an ObamaCare plan in 10 years because it won't be  there.   So we will have these arguments. We will have these discussions. But  if you want to move forward a commonsense piece of legislation, if you  want to move forward a bipartisan piece of legislation, if you want one  that actually the American people sent us here to do to actually make  things better, then vote ``yes'' on the rule and vote ``yes'' on the  underlying bill because that is why we are here--real solutions from a  real majority that will answer the questions and then gladly defend it  to an American people who are tired of being told about and talked  about and taking things away because we didn't read it to know what was  in it. That is why, because you couldn't know what was in it.   Now we are going to tell you what is in it, and we are going to put  back a  [[Page H2258]]  marketplace that actually works for Americans. When we do that, we will  gladly put the market back there where they can actually have a plan  they can afford and actually use. When we understand that, the health  care and the plan we put forward will be one that works for the  American people, not against them.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 209 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       section:        Sec. 2. In rule XXI add the following new clause:        13. (a) It shall not be in order to consider a measure or       matter proposing to repeal or amend the Patient Protection       and Affordable Care Act (PL 111-148) and the Health Care and       Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PL 111-      152), or part thereof, in the House or in the Committee of       the Whole House on the state of the Union unless an easily       searchable electronic estimate and comparison prepared by the       Director of the Congressional Budget Office is made available       on a publicly available website of the House.        (b) It shall not be in order to consider a measure or       matter proposing to repeal or amend the Patient Protection       and Affordable Care Act (PL 111-148) and the Health Care and       Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PL 111-      152), or part thereof, in the House or in the Committee of       the Whole House on the state of the Union, that is called up       pursuant to a rule or order that makes a manager's amendment       in order or considers such an amendment to be adopted, unless       an easily searchable updated electronic estimate and       comparison prepared by the Director of the Congressional       Budget Office reflecting such amendment is made available on       a publicly available website of the House.        (c) It shall not be in order to consider a rule or order       that waives the application of paragraphs (a) or (b).                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Graves of Louisiana). The question is on  ordering the previous question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule  XX, this 15-minute vote on ordering the previous question will be  followed by 5-minute votes on adopting the resolution, if ordered, and suspending  the rules and passing H.R. 1353.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 231,  nays 185, not voting 13, as follows:                               [Roll No. 176]                                 YEAS--231       Abraham      Aderholt      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barton      Bergman      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Bost      Brady (TX)      Brat      Bridenstine      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Chaffetz      Cheney      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Comstock      Conaway      Cook      Costello (PA)      Cramer      Crawford      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Davidson      Davis, Rodney      Denham      Dent      DeSantis      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Duncan (TN)      Dunn      Farenthold      Faso      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Foxx      Franks (AZ)      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Garrett      Gibbs      Gohmert      Goodlatte      Gosar      Gowdy      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Griffith      Guthrie      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hensarling      Herrera Beutler      Hice, Jody B.
