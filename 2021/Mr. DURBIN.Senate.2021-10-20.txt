 Mr. President, right now, the end of the pandemic may  be--I underline ``may be''--within our reach. The Delta surge is  finally waning. Over the past month, coronavirus case numbers have  fallen by more than 40 percent, thank goodness. The average number of  daily vaccinations has increased by more than 25 percent--not an  unrelated statistic--and COVID death rates are finally starting to  decline. These are all promising developments, and they demonstrate  that President Biden's response to the coronavirus is working.   But as winter approaches, we need to ask ourselves a serious  question: Will we continue to take the steps that are necessary to save  lives and beat this virus once and for all? Or will we do nothing, as  some of our Republican colleagues seem to urge, and allow the pandemic  to come roaring back for another deadly wave?   Millions of American families have already suffered the consequences  of denial, deception, and inaction. A report released earlier this  month found that since June--just since June--nearly 100,000 American  lives could have been saved if there were more vaccinations. But we can  save the next 100,000 lives in America if we rally behind the  President's call for his vaccination policy. The American people are  already with him. The majority of people support mandating COVID-19  vaccinations for students 12 and up.   Business owners across the country have followed President Biden's  lead by instituting their own vaccine mandates. They have helped  increase vaccination rates by more than 20 percent. In Texas, where the  Governor is seeking to outlaw vaccine mandates, one hospital CEO said  that requiring his workers to be vaccinated is ``unequivocally . . .  the best decision we ever made'' and that 98 percent of his staff has  now been vaccinated.   President Biden's vaccine policy is supported by parents and business  owners alike because they recognize a very simple truth: The only way  to keep our kids in school, keep our economy on the road to recovery,  and stop the spread of this deadly virus is vaccination. A do-nothing  strategy is deadly and disastrous for our economy. Yet that is exactly  what many of our Republican colleagues continue to propose that we do:  nothing. It is the same response they had earlier this month when it  came to raising the debt limit.   Let me reflect for a moment on the effort that is underway by State  attorneys general. The Republican attorneys general across the United  States represent 24 different States. They have threatened to file  lawsuits to try to stop vaccine mandates and mask requirements.   I think it is fair to take a look at the period of June 15, 2021, to  September 15, 2021, and ask how the States are doing represented by  these attorneys general who are fighting President Biden's coronavirus  policy. Well, we took a look at the average of the 24 States that are  threatening these lawsuits. Their infection rate is more than twice  than all the other States'. So the people in their States where they  are supposedly fighting for their well-being are losing when it comes  to the infections of coronavirus.   How about the death rates? Of the 24 States in this period of time  threatening lawsuits, we have a death rate almost three times the death  rate in the other 26 States. The vaccination rate is lower in the 24  States represented by these Republican attorneys general.   So what are they winning? Some political war? What the heck  difference does it make who wins a political war when we are talking  about a life-and-death issue? And that is frankly what we are faced  with.   When it comes to the debt limit, we see the same negative default  approach  [[Page S7100]]  by the Republicans. Senate Republicans were ready to let go of the  steering wheel and swerve into oncoming traffic with the debt limit.  Right up until the eleventh hour, they wanted to use the filibuster to  block Democrats from addressing the debt, the limit of the debt. Do you  know when that debt was incurred? It was incurred during the Trump  administration, with many of these same Republicans voting for the  spending that stands behind it.   Now the minority leader, Senator McConnell, has once again pledged  that Republicans refuse to lift a finger to deal with the debt limit  when it expires in the first week of December. Think for a moment what  defaulting on the debt would mean to American families. It is fodder  for even more inflation.   So don't come to the floor with your posing for Holy pictures on the  issue of inflation and then turn around and say: I don't care what  happens to the debt limit. Americans will pay more each month because  of that for their mortgages and credit card bills and student and car  loans. Fifteen trillion dollars in household wealth and retirement  savings would be wiped out if Senator McConnell and the Republicans  have their way in the first week of December.   If our Republican colleagues are truly concerned about the economic  well-being of America, work with us to put together a sensible response  to the debt limit. Senator Schumer and the Democrats have said to the  Republicans: If you won't lead, if you can't follow, then get the heck  out of the way. Democrats, with a majority vote, will enact a new debt  limit. We understand our responsibility to this Nation.
