 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the  nomination of Nancy Abudu to the U.S. Court of Appeals.   I served as Governor for 8 years, and, in that time, I had the great  privilege of appointing dozens of judicial appointments to Nebraska  courts. I appointed four of the current Nebraska Supreme Court justices  and many more to lower courts.   When I considered a prospective nominee, I was often reminded of our  State's motto: ``Equality Before the law.'' That motto reflects a  commonsense American principle that all people should receive equal  treatment and equal opportunity, regardless of one's race or  background. The women and men who serve in our courts should reflect  this motto.   When I considered nominees, I looked at a few things. I looked at  whether they were leaders with high integrity and character. I looked  at their experience, and I looked at how they understood their role as  a judge. Did they think the job of a judge was to make the law or to  interpret the law?   I looked at if they had a respect for the law and whether they had  the temperament to bring a thoughtful and fairminded approach to each  case they would have at hand. I looked at whether they were respected  by their peers. And I am proud of the appointments that I made.   Nancy Abudu is not someone I would have considered for a judgeship.  Ms. Abudu is the kind of soft-on-crime, anti-police, activist we  actually must keep off of the bench. And I want to take a moment to go  over her record.   Ms. Abudu has argued publicly and repeatedly that American voting  laws and the criminal justice system are racist and discriminatory. She  has specifically maligned the three States that comprise the Eleventh  Circuit that she is being considered for. In Alabama, she said that Jim  Crow continues to cast a long shadow on the State's elections.   She said that Florida is engaged in a ``war to strip poor and low- income people of all political power.'' And she accused Georgia State  legislators of ``punishing voters and undermining democracy'' and said  that the State is a ``bad actor'' and ``simply cannot be trusted to  protect the rights of voters.''   At a time when Americans require certainty and security of our  elections, Ms. Abudu has consistently argued dangerous and misleading  positions, trying to undermine the public's trust of our elections and  our voting rights. She has argued that prohibiting felons from voting  is ``practically the same system as during slavery.'' She argued that  requiring voters to present identification is voter suppression.   My colleague, Ranking Member Grassley, described Abudu as one of the  ``most activist judicial nominees we've ever seen.'' During her  confirmation hearing, the Judiciary Committee heard Abudu double down  in defense of her work in 2018 to challenge a Miami ordinance that  banned sex offenders from living within 2,500 feet of a school.   Senator Grassley questioned Abudu about a 2016 article where she  advocated for laws that ``would allow noncitizens to vote in local  elections'' and suggested that opponents of such legislation are  ``trying to incite hysteria that undocumented immigrants are also  taking over the ballot box in addition to our country.''   When asked which election she thought noncitizens should be permitted  to vote in, Abudu declined to substantively respond, saying:         In the article, I noted that some cities allow noncitizens       to vote in local elections.    Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Abudu  about numerous partisan and inflammatory statements she has also made,  including:         Systemic racism [is] embedded in the criminal justice       system and other parts of our society.    That the ``problem'' with southern States when it comes to voting  laws ``is they're not always doing the right thing and the resentment  they feel is that historically, the Federal Government has not allowed  them to get away with it.''         Governor DeSantis is digging his heels in to ensure poor       people in his State are blocked from voting.    With respect to the privatization of schools, she said:         [W]e are not in an environment or a culture where we want       to rely on our State legislators to do the right thing by our       children, especially if they are Black or Brown.    Nancy Abudu's work at the Southern Poverty Law Center, SPLC, since  2019 and currently as the Strategic Litigation Director are also  extremely concerning positions. For those unfamiliar, the Southern  Poverty Law Center is a far-left activist organization that only  targets conservatives whom they disagree with politically. The SPLC is  well-known for, unapologetically and often without any justification,  labeling conservative and religious organizations and individuals as  ``hate groups'' or ``extremists.''   As a Federal judge recently found that the SPLC hate list does not  ``depend upon objective data or evidence'' and its application of the  ``hate group'' designation is ``entirely subjective.''   Another Federal judge ruled that SPLC's ``representation or  description'' of a nonprofit organization as a hate group ``is not one  `of fact.'''   SPLC's Hate Map, as they call it, is ``outright fraud'' and ``a  willful deception designed to scare older liberals into writing checks  to the SPLC.''   Their misinformation has real-world implications ranging from  careless to incendiary and deadly. Floyd Lee Corkins entered the Family  Research Council's headquarters with a 9-millimeter pistol, multiple  ammunition clips, and a box of extra rounds, and the intent to ``kill  as many people as possible.'' Fortunately, Corkins was stopped by the  building manager from carrying out this mass shooting.   Under FBI interrogation, Corkins said he chose to carry out the  attack on FRC after it was labeled a ``hate group'' on the Southern  Poverty Law Center's website.   In 2018, the SPLC paid $3.375 million in damages after brandishing  British Muslim reformer Maajid Nawaz as an anti-Muslim extremist.   Similarly, the SPLC was compelled to issue an official apology for  placing Dr. Ben Carson under their extremist watchlist back in 2014.   In 2021, in Nebraska, we saw the Southern Poverty Law Center's  reckless and misguided definition of ``hate groups'' used against  University of Nebraska-Lincoln students. A Christian student  organization called Ratio Christi filed a lawsuit alleging the  University discriminated against the organization's conservative and  Christian views when it denied funds for a speaker.   I spoke out at the time urging the University to support speakers  from a wide variety of viewpoints on campus, including Christian  speakers. The group of students had secured legal defense from the  Alliance Defending Freedom, a religious freedom organization. The  Southern Poverty Law Center's designation of ADF as a hate group was  then used against the students in media reports across the State.   Fortunately, justice prevailed; and in a victory for free speech at  public universities, a Federal court entered a partial judgment against  the University of Nebraska-Lincoln officials who discriminated against  Christian student organizations. The University revised its funding  policies to provide  [[Page S1733]]  transparency and accountability in the process.   In 2023, an FBI whistleblower revealed the Bureau issued an internal  memo--now rescinded--on ``radical-traditionalist Christian ideology,''  citing the SPLC. The memo characterized radical traditionalist  Catholics primarily by their rejection of church developments since the  Second Vatican Council--Vatican II--and opposition to homosexuality.  The memo suggests the FBI should monitor these Catholics through ``the  development of sources with access,'' including in places of worship.  It presents a list of hate groups published by the SPLC as a place to  start with this work.   The SPLC's hate label destroys civil discourse and breeds contempt  for those with different views.   Americans want judges that understand their role to interpret our  laws, not make them. Americans want judges who want to give every  litigant a fair shake. Americans want judges that believe in our  Founding documents.   Ms. Abudu has failed to demonstrate she understands the critical role  that a judge should play in our legal system. Her record proves that  she is far outside the mainstream. Far-left activists do not belong on  the Federal bench. I call on my colleagues to join me in opposing this  radical nominee.   I yield the floor.
