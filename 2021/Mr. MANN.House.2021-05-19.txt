 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge Americans who can get  back to work, get back to work.   It has been more than a year since the pandemic shut down the  country. Today, nationwide coronavirus cases have dramatically  decreased, and cases in Kansas alone are only 7 percent of what they  were in January. We are getting back to normal. Businesses are ready to  reopen and welcome back customers.   Unfortunately, President Biden's bonus, the new monthly unemployment  checks being distributed on top of the checks unemployed persons  already receive, is paying a premium for potential workers to remain at  home rather than finding work. I have heard from  [[Page H2560]]  countless small business owners in the Big First who cite the Biden  bonus as the reason why they cannot find workers and completely reopen.   The data doesn't lie. There are nearly 8 million open jobs in America  right now, a new record. The Biden bonus, at a time when employers are  searching for workers, is unwanted Federal Government interference in  the marketplace.   I recently joined fellow Kansas Republicans in urging the Kansas  Governor to opt out of enhanced unemployment benefits. I cosponsored  the Help Wanted Act, which addresses the severe labor shortages caused  by the Federal unemployment policy.   It is time to take off the masks, get our kids back to school, get  our businesses open, and get people back to work so we can get America  back on track.                            ____________________
