 Madam President, as a member of the Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am proud to recognize our hard- working Hoosiers and their vital contributions to our economy during  National Small Business Week.   This week, I would like to recognize AndyMark, a successful Indiana  small business that provides Hoosiers with innovative and competitive  robotics products. AndyMark is located in Kokomo, IN, where their  staff, who have over 200 years of combined experience, support the  Hoosier robotics industry. AndyMark recently announced it is hiring  more employees as a result of tax reform. It is important that we  continue to support and protect Hoosier small businesses like AndyMark  by advancing policies that will help our small and medium-sized  businesses grow.                            ____________________
