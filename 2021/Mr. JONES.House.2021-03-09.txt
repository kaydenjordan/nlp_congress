 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the PRO Act, which  protects a worker's right to join a union.   This is not just an issue of economic justice, as we seek to restore  power to the people, as we experience an era of entrenched corporate  power, and as members of this very body dare to debate the need for a  $15 minimum wage.   This is also an issue of racial justice. History shows that unions  help to reduce the racial wage gap by empowering Black and Brown  workers to fight for better pay and better working conditions; but, due  to Republican policies, much of that progress has been lost.   Today, we are seeing the increasing exploitation of workers of color.  Antiunion policies have hurt Black and Brown workers the most. Today,  people of color are the most likely to be exploited by greedy  corporations.   We cannot achieve racial justice without economic justice, and we  can't achieve economic justice without protecting all of our workers  and their right to organize.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this proworker bill, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes.''
