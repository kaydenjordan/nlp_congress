 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, when I took the gavel as chair of the  Senate Judiciary Committee, one of my first goals and objectives was to  restore the committee's oversight role.   Since the beginning of the 117th Congress, we have kept a close watch  on those Agencies in the executive branch which are within our  jurisdiction. We have held oversight hearings on the Justice  Department, the FBI, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons, to mention a  few. This last Tuesday, we continued that tradition with a second  oversight hearing on the Department of Homeland Security.   It is worth noting that, under the previous administration, the  previous President, the Homeland Security Secretary only appeared  before our committee one time in 4 years. So we were glad to welcome  Secretary Mayorkas back to the hearing room and learn about the work  that he is undertaking to keep America safe.   As I mentioned on Tuesday, I think Secretary Mayorkas has one of the  hardest jobs in Washington. The Department of Homeland Security is  responsible for defending our Nation from a wide range of threats from  domestic terrorism, narcotics trafficking, the climate crisis, and even  cyber attacks. But, despite this broad mandate, our discussion kept  returning to one subject last Tuesday: America's broken immigration  system.   It was interesting to hear the Republican Senators on my committee  being critical of the job that Mr. Mayorkas is doing as head of the DHS  while, at the same time, it has been over 30 years since this body, the  U.S. Senate, has enacted legislation to upgrade and modernize our  immigration system--30 years. Trust me. The world has changed  dramatically in that period, but the Senate has refused to keep pace.   It is easy to criticize Secretary Mayorkas about our border  situation, and he faces some amazing challenges. But let's face it. We  share in the responsibility for this situation, and we certainly share  in the burden of coming up with solutions that help.   For years, I have tried my best to pass appropriations reform. There  was a bipartisan moment 10 years ago when the so-called Gang of Eight  Senators--four Democrats, four Republicans, and I was included in that  group--sat down and wrote a comprehensive immigration reform package. I  think it was pretty good. In fact, it was so good that it passed on the  floor of the U.S. Senate with over 60 votes in favor of it.   We had our fingers crossed and sent it across the Rotunda over to the  Republican-controlled House, and, for 2 years, they refused to even  consider it, even call it for a debate, or even offer their own  amendments. They did nothing--nothing--and we are paying the price for  that today.   So here is the question after this week's hearing: Are we going to  keep pointing our fingers and mugging for the cameras or are we going  to come together to fix our immigration system?   I am ready. I certainly hope the Members of the House are ready. But  we need a bipartisan consensus to get that done.         Restoring America's Health Care Workforce and Readiness Act    On another topic, Mr. President, it is a problem I am going to  discuss that affects roughly 100 million Americans. In the wealthiest  Nation in the world, nearly one in three people in this Nation lives in  an area with too few doctors.   You know the story in your home State of Georgia. I know it in  Illinois. I have seen it. Whenever I visit a clinic or a hospital  outside of Chicago, I hear the same thing: Our healthcare system is  understaffed, underfunded, and underequipped to address the health  needs of American families.   The greatest healthcare system in the world is suffering from serious  shortages and deficiencies. The pandemic brought this to light. It may  not have broken us, but it showed us where our health system is broken.   Over the past 3 years, our doctors, nurses, and other healthcare  providers have been pushed to the brink, and, as a result, nearly one  out of every five healthcare workers has quit their jobs. Think about  that: 20 percent quit their jobs.   These departures have taken a massive toll in the healthcare of  America. In the years ahead, as our population ages, our needs grow,  and more providers leave the profession. Those challenges will get  worse unless we in Congress do something.   In the next decade, America is expected to face a shortage of more  than 120,000 doctors. By 2025, we may face a deficit of nearly a half a  million nurses. And that is on top of our current shortage of about  100,000 dentists that we need now and hundreds of thousands of mental  healthcare professionals.   This is a ticking timebomb for every community in America, especially  rural communities and communities of color that already have less  access to affordable care.   So here in Congress, we need to prevent these shortages from becoming  a crisis. Earlier this month, Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and I  joined in introducing the Restoring America's Health Care Workforce and  Readiness Act. It is a bipartisan measure to address the healthcare  work shortage in America. Over the next 3 years, our bill would provide  hundreds of millions of dollars to the National Health Service Corps  Scholarship and Loan Repayment Program, more than doubling the current  funding level.  [[Page S1064]]    This program is vital to pay for the education and training and  recruitment of the next generation of doctors, nurses, dentists, and  behavioral health specialists.   Why is this program, in particular, so important? Let me tell you,  one of the biggest drivers of the American healthcare shortage is the  cost of medical education. Doctors graduating from medical school with  $200,000 or $300,000 in student loan debt or more can hardly consider  taking posts in rural and underserved areas. They have got to pay off  those loans. So because of those debts, they may not be able to do what  they want to do--give care and professional treatment to some of the  most needy people in America. We take our best and brightest, we  educate them so well, but we heap debt on them unimaginable that makes  a real difference in their career choices.   So with the National Health Service Corps and Nurse Corps, aspiring  health professionals have another option. If they will serve in areas  of need, we will forgive student loans--in fact, in some cases,  providing scholarships for those who are in medical training.   The National Health Service Corps was created 50 years ago. More  recently, we have seen the difference it can make. In the American  Rescue Plan that Congress passed in 2021, I included a one-time, $1  billion funding increase for scholarships and loan repayments for the  National Health Service Corps. It was the largest single-year  appropriation for our healthcare force in history. At this very moment,  that funding is supporting thousands--thousands--of doctors, nurses,  dentists, and other professionals across America. Today, 21 million  Americans receive healthcare from the National Health Service Corps  personnel.   I recently received a letter from one of those who provide that kind  of healthcare. Her name is Shannon. She is a licensed clinical social  worker in Illinois. She is a first-generation college student from a  working-class family. She tells me her life-long dream was to have a  professional career in social work, but her ambitions were limited  because of the cost of graduate school. She just couldn't imagine  taking on that debt.   Then, in July of 2022, she found a path forward. She was accepted  into the program I described. In Shannon's words, ``being accepted into  this program has changed my life. . . . [It] has given me a chance at  financial freedom . . . [and] professionally, this program allowed me  to grow into my career.   Today, Shannon is working as a behavioral healthcare provider in  Carbondale, IL, in wonderful Jackson County.   In Shannon's words, this role allows her to ``come into contact . . .  with those in rural southern Illinois who are in great need of  behavioral health services, such as counseling.''   It is hard to imagine a better investment in America's future than  programs like the National Health Service Corps and Nurse Corps. In  Shannon's case, this program enabled her to pursue her life-long  passion. The community is winning. Shannon is winning. It is a win-win  situation.   We need to make more stories like Shannon's possible, and we have a  chance to do it with the bipartisan bill that Senator Rubio and I have.   If you go home to your State as a U.S. Senator, and you visit and ask  local healthcare providers, they are going to tell you the same thing  from one corner of America to the other corner: We are in desperate  need of medical professionals to care for people who are underserved  now.   What are we going to do about it? What is the Senate going to do  about it? What will our generation do about it? Can we put together the  resources now to meet these shortages and needs in the healthcare  workforce? That is the challenge that we face.   The National Health Service Corps is up for reauthorization this  fall. I will be working with the HELP chair, Bernie Sanders, and  Ranking Member Bill Cassidy to pass our legislation.                                  SIREN Act    Mr. President, there is one last point I would like to make. It was  several years ago that I was visited by a couple of emergency medical  service personnel from Illinois, Mark and Mavis Kennedy. They are EMTs  in Nauvoo, IL, a storied and historic town on the western part of  downstate Illinois. They told us about trying to provide ambulance and  emergency health services in a rural county, in this case Hancock  County, where Nauvoo is located.   They talked about the expense of upgrading the equipment in their  ambulances so that they can make sure that the person that they were  trying to help gets all the necessary medical care on their way to the  hospital. They dreamed up an idea. I want to credit the Kennedys of  Nauvoo, as well as Andrew Jackson, the fire chief in Magnolia, and many  others who said: Why don't we have a grant program specifically for our  equipment in these ambulances and for the training of emergency medical  personnel?   At the time, we were debating the farm bill. I think it was about 4  or 5 years ago. I went to the chairman of the Agriculture Committee,  Senator Pat Roberts of rural Kansas, and said to him: Pat, I think we  have got an idea here that is going to help communities not only in our  States but across the Nation. He generously agreed to serve as my  cosponsor on a bill that we called SIREN Act.   The SIREN Act said to these ambulance services and emergency medical  responders: You can apply for assistance and help to the Federal  Government, and we will try to help you buy the new equipment you need  to make sure that your ambulance is right where it needs to be.   You have to understand, if you don't live in a rural area, that some  of these ambulance services are really the difference between life and  death. They are the first responders. In fact, they are the only  responders. They come to scenes across smalltown America and provide  the kind of medical services to keep people alive for those precious  minutes on their way to a hospital. So the idea of giving them the best  and most modern equipment makes all the difference in the world.   Well, thanks to Senator Roberts, who has since retired from the State  of Kansas, we included the SIREN Act in the farm bill several years  ago.   I have talked to Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, who is now the  chairman of the Agriculture Committee, and told her that I hope we can  reauthorize this program in the next farm bill. She supports it. I am  going to talk to the Republicans on the committee as well. I hope that  we can do that.   What we have done has been able to make grants available: First, $5  million in fiscal year 2020, $10\1/2\ million in 2023, and we hope to  go higher in the years to come.   Does it make any difference?   Just a few minutes ago, Mark and Mavis Kennedy of Nauvoo, IL, were in  my office. They were in uniform, and they are very proud of the work  that they do in Hancock County. Because of the assistance that we  provided to them on one of their applications, they have been able to  extend their emergency medical services to virtually all the towns in  Hancock County. What it means for their ambulance service is, instead  of 140 calls a year, they are now receiving 361--virtually a call every  single day for services--and they have the equipment and the personnel  well trained by the same SIREN Act to respond and save lives as they  are transporting people who live in that county to nearby hospitals.   If it is someone you love in your family who is in desperate medical  need, if it is your child or your grandchild or your parents, and you  have that one phone call to make, you want that ambulance there as  quickly as possible and the people on board as well trained as  possible. The SIREN Act does that.   It is small by Federal standards. I hope it will increase in the  years ahead. But it just proves that, when people are willing to  sacrifice and volunteer to help in local communities and we stand by  them and give them a helping hand, it is the difference between life  and death.   I hope all of my colleagues will join us in this effort to  reauthorize the SIREN Act as part of our commitment to increase  healthcare personnel and their qualifications across the United States.
