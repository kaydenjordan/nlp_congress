 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and the  dedicated service of Joseph Costner who entered eternal rest on March  26, 2023.   Throughout the duration of his life, Mr. Costner unfailingly answered  the call to serve his country and his community. He was raised in  Lawndale, North Carolina, and he joined the Army at the age of 18 where  he dedicated the remainder of his life to fighting for the country he  loved proudly and profoundly.   First, serving in the Korean war, Mr. Costner later completed two  terms in Vietnam, where his unwavering courage resulted in numerous  medals of honor, including the Presidential Unit Citation and the  Bronze Star.   He eventually retired after 26 years with the rank of chief warrant  officer 4 specializing in Army intelligence.   Following his retirement from the Army, Mr. Costner continued to  serve his country for the next 17 years with the Defense Investigative  Service where he rose to regional director in Roanoke, Virginia.   His dedication to serving his country and his people was perpetual,  and he spent the last 27 years of his life with the Volunteer Income  Tax Assistance Program in Rock Hill, South Carolina, where he prepared  taxes free of charge for low-income, disabled, and elderly citizens of  his community.   Within Rock Hill, South Carolina, and the greater community, Mr.  Costner was widely referred to as a hero, a role model, and most of  all, a friend.   He was greatly loved and cherished by his wife of 60 years, Helen;  his three children; five grandchildren; great-grandson; and countless  friends.   Mr. Costner set the gold standard for over 70 years of service  dedicated and committed to his country for which he will long be  remembered. For all that, we join in saying good-bye to a hero.                            ____________________
