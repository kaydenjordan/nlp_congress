 Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme  Court nomination and the sham hearings that are happening in the Senate  today.   Even before President Trump nominated Judge Kavanaugh, Senate  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned that the millions of pages in  Judge Kavanaugh's White House records would reopen controversies dating  back to George W. Bush's administration and delay consideration of his  nomination. But instead of following regular order, rather than  obtaining Judge Kavanaugh's full record and sharing it in a timely  fashion with all the Senators, Senate Republicans simply changed the  rules. This is unacceptable.   The nine Justices who sit on the Supreme Court make crucial decisions  about justice in our country. At times, the Court's landmark decisions  have shown the best of who we are and what our country stands for, the  ideas that our public schools should not be segregated based on race,  that women have a right to make their own decisions about their bodies,  and that everybody has the right to marry the person they love.   In other cases, Supreme Court decisions have been stains on our  Nation;  [[Page H7830]]  for instance, deciding that African Americans could not be U.S.  citizens, upholding the cruel and unjust internment of Japanese  Americans during World War I, maintaining segregation, and striking  down key provisions protecting access to voting.   Make no mistake, Judge Kavanaugh poses a serious threat to the rights  that we hold so dear. Take, for instance, the case of Jane Doe, the  teenage girl who sought an abortion last year while being held in  government custody in Texas.   Jane Doe did everything herself to secure that abortion. She got  permission from a judge. She got her own transportation. And yet, the  Federal Government physically blocked her from leaving the government- run shelter where she was detained.   So then the ACLU sued on her behalf, and her case eventually made it  in front of Judge Kavanaugh. Although he recognized the time  sensitivity, even clarifying that she would no longer be able to seek a  legal abortion in Texas at 20 weeks, Judge Kavanaugh blocked Jane Doe's  access to her legally allowable abortion when she was about 15 weeks  pregnant. He gave the Trump administration 11 more days to find a  sponsor, a process that he was aware takes months to complete. He told  Jane Doe that, after those 11 days, she could ask a lower court again  for an abortion. If at 17 weeks she was unsuccessful, then he told her  that she could bring it up again to him for consideration, which would  have been scheduled when she was, at that point, 18 or 19 weeks  pregnant, if she were lucky. Court delays could have pushed it even  further, seriously putting her at risk of being outside the window to  obtain something that was her legal right.   But, fortunately, the full court overturned Judge Kavanaugh's  decision a few days later, and Jane Doe was able to proceed in the  course that she chose for her own body, a decision that Judge Kavanaugh  vehemently opposed.   Fortunately for Jane Doe, Judge Kavanaugh's decision was not the  crucial vote deciding her future. But if Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed,  the rest of the country will not be so lucky.   There is broad consensus that Judge Kavanaugh would be a decisive  vote to eliminate women's constitutionally protected right to abortion,  a right, by the way, that is not partisan. Seventy-one percent of  voters support that right.   In addition, Judge Kavanaugh's record shows that he could be the  deciding vote to undermine access to healthcare for millions of  Americans. He has written dissenting opinions in three cases that would  have undermined the Affordable Care Act. In one of those dissenting  opinions, Judge Kavanaugh argued that a President could choose not to  enforce a law like the Affordable Care Act if he thought it was  unconstitutional, even if a court had already ruled that it is  constitutional.   Further, in a 2013 speech, Judge Kavanaugh said that it is ``a  traditional exercise of power by Presidents'' to pick and choose which  laws to enforce. At a time when we are hearing reports from the highest  levels of our government that top aides to the President are literally  hiding papers from him so that he cannot execute orders that they view  as dangerous to our security and would result in geopolitical crises,  what we need is a Justice who will serve as a check on the executive,  as our Founders intended.   The Senate has a responsibility to the American people to fully vet  Supreme Court nominees. The most basic function is for them to do the  leg work of obtaining all records related to those nominees. I strongly  urge my Senate colleagues to adjourn the Kavanaugh hearing, as Senator  Blumenthal and my good colleagues proposed. A ``no'' vote is a vote for  the people.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of my amendment,  which simply adds to the requirements for student loan exit counseling  in the underlying bill.   I would like to thank Congressman Guthrie and Congresswoman Bonamici  for their leadership in crafting this bill and for their consideration  of this amendment.   With my amendment, exit counseling would include an explicit warning  about third-party, fraudulent companies that often call, email, text,  send letters, and use aggressive advertising to reach students during  the repayment process.   These so-called debt relief companies sometimes say they can help  settle your Federal student loans, warn borrowers that forgiveness  programs could end soon, and sometimes even pose as being affiliated  with the U.S. Government.   These companies generally do not offer any relief at all and charge  for services that are already provided for free by loan servicers.  Often, these companies leave borrowers worse off, severely damage their  credit scores, or make changes to loan repayment plans that they didn't  authorize.   I think Republicans and Democrats both agree that these are scams,  pure and simple. These same companies who once preyed on underwater  mortgage holders have now moved on to lure student loan borrowers  simply trying to pay off their debts, provide for themselves or their  families, and live a better life. It is hard enough for borrowers to  navigate the complicated maze of repayment options and obtain sound  guidance from their servicer without scammers coming in to blow up the  whole thing.   What is more, many of these companies have already had to pay massive  settlements to our government for scamming consumers. The Federal Trade  Commission and State attorneys general across the country, including  from my home State of Washington, have brought cases against these  scammers who have used deception and false promises of relief to take  more than $95 million in illegal upfront fees from American consumers  over the years.   In 2014, the CFPB filed a lawsuit against a company called Student  Loan Processing.US for deceiving consumers about its fee structure and  misrepresenting its affiliation. It led to the distribution of hundreds  of thousands of dollars back to defrauded consumers.   I am very grateful for the opportunity to offer this critical  consumer protection amendment that helps empower students to make sound  financial decisions. I do recognize that enhancing financial literacy  is just a small sliver of the legislation we need to chip away at our  student debt crisis.   Right now, I know that we need to take that next step in the crisis  with bold policy solutions to address that $1.4 trillion in student  loan debt that is dragging down our economy. But at this moment, Madam  Chair, I commend my colleagues for this practical step, and I urge  support of my amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Madam Chair, I wanted to again reiterate my thanks to  both Congressman Guthrie and Congresswoman Bonamici, and urge support  of my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
