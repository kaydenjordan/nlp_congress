 Mr. President, today I recognize Katie Murray for all of  her hard work on behalf of myself, my staff, and the citizens of South  Dakota while working in my Rapid City and Sioux Falls, offices.   Katie is a joy to work with, and she has been an excellent public  servant. We wish her the best in all of her future endeavors.   The citizens of South Dakota, my staff, and I are grateful to Katie  for her service. We are a better State because of her hard work.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Michele Mustain for all  of her hard work on behalf of myself, my staff, and the people of South  Dakota while working in my Sioux Falls, SD office.   We are grateful for the excellent work she has done for other elected  leaders and for all of the help she has given to the citizens of the  United States.   Because she has helped so many soldiers and their families, it is  fitting that she will now be working for the Employer Support for the  Guard and Reserve.   My staff and I wish her the best in the future. We will always  appreciate her and her willingness to help us become better public  servants.                            ____________________
