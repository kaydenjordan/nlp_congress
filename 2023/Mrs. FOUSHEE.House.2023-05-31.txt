 Mr. Speaker, with a heavy heart, I rise today to join  my colleagues in honoring the memory of Mr. Conen Morgan, an  extraordinary North Carolinian who was taken from us far too soon.   Conen was a steadfast advocate for equity and played a pivotal role  in shaping North Carolina politics as a renowned political consultant  and a founding member of Advance North Carolina.   He was a remarkable human being and had the unique ability to inspire  and touch the lives of everyone he encountered through his kindness,  compassion, and genuine care for others.   Conen's leadership, passion, and tireless efforts will have a lasting  impact and will leave a profound void in many folks across North  Carolina that will be felt for years to come.   I am immensely honored to have known Conen, both personally and  professionally. Indeed, he was my friend. I extend my deepest  condolences to his wife, Reyna Walters-Morgan, and his family, friends,  and loved ones.                            ____________________
