 Mr. President, I, along with the rest of the Senate,  look  [[Page S4900]]  forward to going through the process with Brett Kavanaugh, who is an  exceptionally qualified judge. He has been described as a judge of  judges. He is one to whom judges look around the country to see what he  has written and what his opinions have noted. In fact, historically,  the Supreme Court has also looked to his opinions on the circuit court  and has taken high notice of those and has quoted several of his  opinions verbatim in Supreme Court opinions.   This person has had a lot of respect for what he has done and how he  has done it in the process. I have enjoyed getting a chance to meet his  family and to have been introduced to not only his personal faith but  to his passion for people and his work with the homeless and other  things that he has done for so many years.   This will be an interesting process. Over the next 2 months or so,  this body should do as it has done before with Justice Gorsuch and  Justice Sotomayor--about 66 days for both of them as we worked through  their nomination processes until we actually got to the final votes.   We will see how this goes in the days ahead. I look forward to  getting a chance to visit with Judge Kavanaugh in my office in the days  ahead to ask him specific questions. I am reserving judgment on him  until I have the opportunity to visit with him personally and to finish  going through all the opinions he has written.   He seems like an exceptional candidate. I look forward to walking  through this process judiciously.
