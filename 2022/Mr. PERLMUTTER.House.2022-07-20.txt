 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the  devastating events of July 20, 2012, in Aurora, Colorado.   I represented Aurora, Colorado, on this day 10 years ago when in an  Aurora theater 12 lives were taken and 70 were wounded, and an entire  community was scarred and traumatized.   Today marks a very painful day for our community, and my heart aches  with those who lost a loved one that day and will forever carry a hole  in their heart.   Yet, in this tragedy we saw incredible heroism--those who carried the  wounded to safety and the first responders and medical teams whose  tireless efforts saved lives.   Madam Speaker, I would like to recognize the 12 who lost their lives  that night:   AJ Boik, 18;   Jesse Childress, 29;   Gordon Cowden, 51, whose two teenage children were in the theater  when he was killed;   Jessica Ghawi, 24;   Micayla Medek, 23;   Veronica Moser-Sullivan, 6, whose mother was shot in the chest and  miscarried a week after the attack;   Rebecca Wingo, 32; and   Alex Sullivan, who was celebrating his 27th birthday and was one week  away from his first wedding anniversary.   This also includes the four men who died that night while saving  others:   Jonathan Blunk, 26;   John Larimer, 27;   Matt McQuinn, 27; and   Alex Teves, 24.   In the face of unspeakable violence and tragedy, these men proved to  be everyday heroes, sacrificing their own lives to save others.   Gun violence rips through our community, leaves trauma with families  and friends of victims, the medical staff and first responders, and the  entire community for a lifetime. It is a trauma and a scar too many  communities in Colorado and too many communities across the country  have faced.   As our country grapples with incidents of violence, chaos, and  tragedy, it is the courageous acts and selfless spirit of the helpers  and heroes among us that we remember.   During our darkest days, there are always everyday heroes who answer  the call to save lives and help their community. They provide light and  hope for the future. The same heroic acts we saw in Aurora, Colorado,  10 years ago have been reflected in other tragedies as gun violence  continues in our communities, including in the recent tragedies in  Highland Park, Illinois; Uvalde, Texas; and Buffalo, New York.   Heroes can come in many different forms. During the COVID-19  pandemic, we saw heroes in medical professionals, frontline workers and  essential personnel, such as truck drivers, letter carriers, food and  grocery workers, teachers, small business owners, and researchers.   That is why I am, once again, introducing a resolution, alongside my  friend and colleague Congressman Jason Crow, to designate today, July  20, as National Heroes Day.   As Mr. Rogers famously said: ``You will always find people who are  helping.''   In the midst of our dark days, let's focus on lifting up and  recognizing the helpers and the heroes whose actions, big and small,  make a difference in the lives of friends, coworkers, neighbors, and  the larger community.                            ____________________
