 Mr. Speaker, there are many things that we come to  this floor to do. In the midst of our duties, we stand in this well as  armor and advocates for democracy. There are moments of joy, and there  are moments of high debate, but I come this morning partly for a moment  of sadness.   I am looking at my iPhone at a picture of myself and the late  Congressman Elijah Cummings so many years ago. It tells the story of  the breadth and depth of his life, when he invited Members of Congress  to come to his district to challenge the scourge of HIV and to stand  against the proliferation of addiction.   He was always standing in the gap for his constituents, his beloved  Baltimore, and his beloved family. He always considered himself as  someone who would find a cure for the ailments of society.   That is why, this morning, we have heard some of his words: ``Come  on, people, we are better than this.''   The wonderment of his words that really came from his strong  spiritual connection--I want everybody to know that he was able to say  all of this and remain that steady figure in the eye of the storm  because he was a man of faith who had no shame in his love of God and  the teachings of his parents, who he reminded us all the time, as they  rest in peace themselves, that they were sharecroppers.   Look at him now. He ascended to greatness. As chairman of the  Oversight and Reform Committee, his focus was not only on this recent  impeachment inquiry. He looked at all aspects of wrongness that  afflicted the American people, certainly one being the overuse of  prescription drugs causing people to either lose their lives or not be  able to take care of themselves.   He was also a man of justice who wanted criminal justice reform and  wanted to work to ensure that our police persons and law enforcement  could have the kind of training and understanding of culturally diverse  communities.   He served us in many ways. He certainly was an icon amongst the  Congressional Black Caucus, but he was not ours alone. He belonged to  this Congress--Republicans and Democrats--and he belonged to the  Nation.   But, Baltimore, I cannot leave you out. He belonged to his beloved  Baltimore and also the heritage of his parents.   I stand here today to give comfort to those who are mourning, to try  to ease the pain that I am experiencing, and to be able to call upon a  Nation that has the beauty of allowing us to pray to any God that we  worship in any faith that we may have, that we call upon that faith  today to be reminded of a giant like Elijah Cummings.   I conclude with just a moment to say that I pray for the families in  Syria, the fleeing Kurds. I pray that this unmistakable disaster that  has occurred, that we can put it right-side up with the Congress  working to secure a no-fly zone and to have a cease-fire in northern  Syria to be able to stop the bloodletting of women and children and the  fleeing that is going on.   As my good friend would want, we want to fix government. In fixing  government, we want to protect the American people. This threat to  national security that has now been unleashed with the escaping of ISIS  supporters and family members along with ISIS persons, we must come  together to find a way to bring about peace.   In his name, I am grateful to have this opportunity to honor him and  to also speak to peace. That is what I believe his life legacy will be,  that he always wanted the best for America. He would always say to all  of us, no matter what walk of life we were in, what background we came  from, and what diverse part of America we represented, he would always  say, ``We are better than this.''   His faith in a higher power was without question, and that will be  the strength that I have today, faith in a higher power.   May God bless him. May he rest and have a soul that is rested. May  God bless his family, may God bless all those who loved him and his  constituents, and may God bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
