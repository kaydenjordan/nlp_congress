 Madam Speaker, recently, the Collings Lakes Fire  Department held a parade celebrating 55 years of service and dedicated  a new fire truck in honor of the late deputy chief, Edwin R. Jones, Jr.   Ed took on many roles throughout his life, most of them involving him  giving of himself and of his time without expecting anything but to see  someone smile.   Ed began his career as a volunteer firefighter, and when he moved to  Collings Lakes in Atlantic County, he joined the fire department to  serve as an engineer. Throughout his 40-year career with the fire  department, Ed served in many roles, including treasurer, vice  president, fire commissioner, and he was serving as the deputy chief  when he passed away in 2017.   Ed is remembered. He is remembered by his family, his coworkers, and  his friends for being a selfless, caring presence in our community, and  his loss is felt by many.   Ed was a true American hero.                            ____________________
