 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table H.R. 3401, with the Senate amendment thereto, and  concur in the Senate amendment.   We must not adjourn. We will stay and do the people's work and take  care of this humanitarian crisis on the border. Send this to the  President's desk immediately, today, for signature.
