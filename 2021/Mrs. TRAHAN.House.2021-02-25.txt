 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Equality  Act, and I associate myself with the remarks of the bill's sponsor, the  gentleman from Rhode Island.   Because Mr. Cicilline and my colleagues have already said all that  there is to say about the clear merits of the bill, I would simply ask,  through the Chair, that if our colleagues on the other side cannot find  it within themselves to support this bill out of a sense of fairness  and goodwill to those enduring discrimination, then please do so out of  concern for their parents, people just like our colleagues on the other  side, mothers and fathers who love their children every bit as much as  our colleagues love theirs.   We want nothing more than to send our kids out into the world with  confidence and a reasonable expectation of being treated fairly and  equally. It is never too late to do the right thing.   Please join us in voting ``yes'' on the Equality Act.
