 Madam Speaker, why would President Biden, with the  stroke of a pen, in the middle of one of the worst recessions and  economic recoveries, destroy thousands of good-paying pipeline jobs and  the livelihoods and future of hardworking American families? Well, for  the same reason he has imposed his open border mandates that have  created an unprecedented crisis at our southern border. He is placating  the left. He is putting them in charge. And he is allowing them to  drive their radical agenda to transform our economy, our values, and  our way of life.   Gaylord Lincoln, a pipeline mechanic from South Dakota, said it best:  ``Come down here. See the destruction you caused. See the pain of job  loss. You took our chance to have a decent life with a stroke of a pen.  It is all BS in Washington. They are playing with our lives.''   Mr. Lincoln is right; it is BS. They are playing with their lives,  and this President is leading the charge.                            ____________________
