 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 1077 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1077         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider the conference report to accompany the       bill (H.R. 6157) making appropriations for the Department of       Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and       for other purposes. All points of order against the       conference report and against its consideration are waived.       The conference report shall be considered as read. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       conference report to its adoption without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate; and (2) one motion to       recommit if applicable.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order without intervention of any point of order to consider       in the House the resolution (H. Res. 1071) recognizing that       allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the       franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States       citizens. The resolution shall be considered as read. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary.        Sec. 3.  It shall be in order at any time on the       legislative day of September 27, 2018, or September 28, 2018,       for the Speaker to entertain motions that the House suspend       the rules as though under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or       his designee shall consult with the Minority Leader or her       designee on the designation of any matter for consideration       pursuant to this section.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and reported  a rule for consideration of the conference report to H.R. 6157, the  Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and  Education Appropriations Act, 2019, and Continuing Appropriations Act,  2019, and for an additional resolution, H. Res. 1071. The rule provides  for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and  the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee.   Mr. Speaker, the appropriations package in front of us represents the  second of what will likely be several appropriations packages to fully  fund the government for fiscal year 2019.   This represents the first time in more than 10 years that Congress  will send more than one final appropriations bill to the President for  signature before the beginning of the fiscal year. In years past, we  have relied strongly on omnibus spending bills to fund the government;  but now, with the hard work done on both sides of the aisle and in both  Houses of Congress, we are returning to regular order and completing  spending work through the normal legislative process.   Mr. Speaker, as I have so often said on this floor, the primary  obligation of the Congress is to fund the American Government and keep  it open and operating. The American people deserve no less. With this  package under consideration today, Congress will do just that with  respect to 2 of the 12 main spending bills: the Department of Defense  and the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education,  and related agencies.   In addition, the bill also includes a continuing resolution extending  funding for other parts of the government not covered by this bill or  the appropriations bill signed by the President last week.   In passing this bill, we will provide crucial funding for services  across broad areas of the government and fulfill our promises to the  American people: to patients, to communities, to business owners, to  the military, and to Americans of all stripes.   The House is already familiar with this bill from when it was passed  in June, and this conference version, agreed to with the Senate, has  not substantially changed with respect to Defense. However, it now  reflects the combined priorities of the Members of both sides of the  aisle and in both the House and the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, in the Defense title of the bill, the conference report  appropriates a total of $674.4 billion for the Department of Defense,  including $606.5 billion in base funding, an increase of $17 billion  above fiscal year 2018, and $67.9 billion in overseas contingency  operations and global war on terrorism funding. This increase in  funding will help begin to right the wrongs committed against our  military readiness by several years of chronic underfunding.   This bill provides an authorized 2.6 percent pay increase for our  troops, the largest pay raise in 9 years, and it ensures we will be  able to increase our Active-Duty number of military personnel by more  than 16,000 soldiers.   The bill provides $148 billion for equipment procurement, including  13 new warships, a number that includes two new Virginia-class  submarines and three new littoral combat ships. It also adds 93 new F- 35 aircraft, new transport aircraft, new tankers, and over 100 new  helicopters.   The bill also provides $96.1 billion for research and development of  new defense systems and technologies, and $243.2 billion for training,  maintenance, and base operations, funding that is sorely needed to  increase our dwindling readiness to confront threats both at home and  abroad.   Mr. Speaker, in the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education  title, the conference report appropriates $178 billion, a $1 billion  increase over fiscal year 2018.   As the conference knows, I am fortunate to chair the Labor, Health  and  [[Page H8898]]  Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, and I am  very pleased with the results of this year's bill. We were able to  increase the budget of the National Institutes of Health by $2 billion  to $39 billion, thus ensuring that we will be able to direct  significant new dollars to medical research, tackling vexing health  problems like Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and the opioid crisis.   Indeed, across the entire bill, we are putting more than $6.6 billion  into the fight against the opioid crisis. We are putting $7.9 billion  into the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to make sure that  we will have the resources available to battle emerging public health  emergencies and fight infectious disease. We did all of this while also  ensuring that popular programs like Meals on Wheels, which provides  meals for our vulnerable senior citizens, can continue to be funded at  current levels.   In the other areas of the Labor-HHS title, we have provided $12.1  billion for the Department of Labor, including $3.5 billion for job  training, $1.7 billion for Job Corps, and $300 million to help veterans  transition into the workforce.   We provided $71 billion to the Department of Education. This includes  $12.4 billion for IDEA special education grants to States. We also  funded TRIO at $1.06 million and GEAR UP at $360 million, both  substantial increases.                                time  1230    These programs are near and dear to my heart personally and help  first-generation college students succeed.   We increased the maximum Pell grant award to $6,195, and we provided  $1.9 billion for career, technical, and adult education programs. We  included significant funding for our youngest Americans, including  $10.1 billion for Head Start, $5.3 billion for childcare and  development block grants, and $250 million for early childhood  programs.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, this bill also includes a provision acting as a  continuing resolution, extending some portions of government funding  out to December 7. This extension, while not ideal, gives the  Appropriations Committee and both Houses of Congress time to come to an  agreement on legislation funding the remaining areas of our government.  Such an extension fulfills our primary obligation as legislators, which  is to fund the government and keep it open and operating.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a brief look at what we have  accomplished and put these bills in context.   Last week, the President signed into law the first package of three  bills for fiscal year 2019, covering Energy and Water, Military  Construction and Veteran Affairs, and the Legislative Branch titles.  These bills covered just over 11 percent of total discretionary  spending.   Today's bill, which covers the Defense and Labor, Health and Human  Services, and Education titles, will produce the vast majority of  discretionary spending, just short of 65 percent of the total  discretionary spending for fiscal year 2019. What is left in the  remaining seven titles amounts to just shy of 24 percent of  discretionary spending.   We may need to do a short-term continuing resolution for part of the  government, but with these bills today, what we will have accomplished  is sending over 75 percent of the total discretionary spending to the  President for his signature into law before the start of the new fiscal  year.   That is an amazing accomplishment, one that has not happened in  Congress in over a decade. Indeed, this is the first time in more than  10 years that the Department of Defense will have its full annual  funding enacted before the start of the fiscal year. This is the first  time in 22 years that the Departments of Labor, Health and Human  Services, Education, and Related Agencies will have been funded before  the beginning of the fiscal year.   As Chairman Frelinghuysen has said, this is the next step on the  return to regular order. Those who would reject this bill because of  the presence of a continuing resolution for part of the government are,  frankly, throwing the proverbial baby out with the bath water. This  bill, Mr. Speaker, is a return to regular order, and we should all be  proud of what we have achieved. It also represents a compromise between  the two parties in this body and between this body and our counterpart  on the other side of the Capitol Rotunda.   Mr. Speaker, today's conference report represents nearly a year of  strong work by Congress. I applaud my colleagues for all they have  accomplished. This is just the next step, and we will have many things  to do before we finish our appropriations work for fiscal year 2019.  But for now, I congratulate the House and the Senate for finalizing  this package.   I want to take a moment also, since this is the last one of these  particular bills that Chairman Frelinghuysen will present, he will have  others later, obviously, but he is ending his term, and I want to  congratulate our chairman for the outstanding work that he has done,  and also that of his strong working partner, Mrs. Lowey of New York,  for her outstanding work.   Frankly, since we are dealing with the Labor-H portion, I want to  thank my good working partner and friend, Rosa DeLauro, the gentlewoman  from Connecticut, for her hard work. I also thank our superb staff,  particularly our clerk, Ms. Ross, for her work in ably helping us  arrive at a monumental achievement. Again, this is the first time in 22  years that the Labor-H bill has gotten done in full and on time.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking my good friend, my colleague  on the Rules Committee, for her kind words and her acknowledgment of  how many accomplishments there are that both parties have worked hard  to achieve in this particular legislation. That is why I am confident  that once the bill comes to the floor, we will have a substantial  majority of my friends on the other side of the aisle voting for it and  a substantial majority of my friends from my side of the aisle joining  them in that. That is a good thing. America should be exceptionally  pleased with that.   I also want to thank the President, because he is a participant in  this. While this bill does represent a compromise, the reality is,  particularly in the defense area, we essentially gave the President  most of the things that he asked for and worked for, and we brought  this. So I think he can take considerable pride in the achievements of  restoring the military, because that was his suggestion, his proposal,  and he worked to that end.                                time  1245    There are also particular initiatives in the Labor-H portion of the  bill that the President deserves credit for. My friend cited the  apprenticeship program, a great program. That was a Presidential-level  proposal. A lot of the training programs are.   It was this President who declared opioids as a national healthcare  emergency. I am proud Congress, on both sides of the aisle, have  responded. As my friend knows, there was a budget agreement last year  between the administration, the Senate, and the House that actually put  an emphasis on more money at the NIH, more money for opioids.   I am the first to acknowledge there is good work and good praise here  to go all around for everybody. My friends in the House worked very  hard. I have always joked with my good friend, the ranking member, that  we always start out on different sides, but for four times in a row  now, we have come together for the final package and both supported the  legislation that authorized Health and Human Services, Labor,  Education, and related agencies. Again, that wouldn't be possible  without the leadership of the full committee. That wouldn't be possible  without friends across the rotunda.   Far be it from me to overpraise the Senate of the United States, but  I have to say that they deserve a lot of praise in this instance,  because the leadership of Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Leahy on  that side was exceptionally important to us in reaching a resolution  and working through some of the knotty issues.   Finally, I want to thank the President of the United States. We make  Presidents go first in their budget proposals, largely so then we can  pick them apart later and do what Congress should do, and that is to  make the final decisions in this area. But we took the President's  recommendations very, very seriously.   There are many good things in this bill, both in the military side  and the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education side, that  began with proposals of the administration.   I mentioned opioids. I mentioned apprenticeship programs. I could go  on. I could mention charter schools. There are many, many proposals out  of the administration that are incorporated in this.   The reality is, I think this is actually what the American people  want to see. All three of the legs of this stool--the House, the  Senate, and the executive branch--cooperating together, compromise,  found different ways. We did that within our ranks, within this body  between Republicans and Democrats. We did that across the rotunda with  our colleagues in the Senate. And we certainly did it working with the  President of the United States.   It takes all three of us to get it done. The reality is, this has  already passed the Senate in, I must add, an overwhelmingly bipartisan  manner, 93 to 7, if I recall the vote correctly. That makes a strong  statement as to how well our friends on both sides of the aisle in the  other Chamber work.   I think we will have a very strong vote when we get to final  legislation. That, again, is something that the leadership on both  sides, and particularly in the Appropriations Committee, can take a  great deal of pride in.   When we send it down to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, if the  President of the United States doesn't sign it, it doesn't become law.  I believe we will get that signature, and I want to acknowledge how  hard the President and his team worked with us to arrive at a solution  with our friends in both Chambers.  [[Page H8900]]    Mr. Speaker, with praise all around, I am going to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by agreeing with the objective that my  friends are laying out but disagreeing with the means by which they are  trying to achieve it.   I couldn't agree more that passing the National Violence Against  Women Act, or extending it, is the appropriate thing to do. I worked  very hard the last time we did the extension.   I actually helped put together a coalition of Republicans that  brought down the Republican bill, because we thought the Senate  Democratic bill was superior. It extended for the first time  opportunities in Indian country for Tribal governments to hold non- Tribal Members accountable for assault.   So this is a cause that is near and dear to my heart. I don't pretend  to sit on the authorization committee, which my good friend from Texas  does. I am not exactly sure where they are in the process. But as she  did say, this is normally bipartisan.   So I look on this as a routine extension while they continue to work  through. I think, if we get the legislation to the floor, I have no  doubt it will pass in a very strongly bipartisan way.   I will say, if we adopt the strategy my friends recommend, we will,  actually, in some ways, hurt the cause that I know she feels so  passionately about.                                time  1300    The Labor-H bill actually funds the battered women shelters and the  National Domestic Violence Hotline. Those are two important items in  here that are actually funded in the bill. If we bring down the bill,  we are going to derail the appropriations process for all Defense, for  Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, a  lot of these other related programs that are extremely important.   So I have no doubt about the sincerity of my friend's position, but I  don't want to, frankly, number one, disrupt funding for very, very  important programs that we help, you know, sustain like, again, the  National Domestic Violence Hotline and battered women's shelters, and I  certainly don't want to defund it for the larger measures here either.   So I think you have to recognize we don't always get everything done  on time. I don't think we got VAWA done on time the last time. I know  at least it was quite a difficult struggle, but we eventually got  there, and we got there with substantial votes from both parties and  got it through. I think we will again.   I pledge to work with my friends on the other side of the aisle to  achieve that objective. I just don't think, right now, we should derail  an $800 billion bill when this bill will actually extend the current  legislation and give us the time to finish whatever the differences  are, resolve whatever the differences are, if there are any, within the  committee and eventually bring it forward.   Again, I think it is a worthy objective. I look forward to working  with my friends to achieve it. I just simply don't want to derail this  appropriations bill in the course of doing that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking my friend from California.  We don't agree on every point here, but we do agree on the underlying  legislation. We both, frankly, appreciate the labors of both Democrats  and Republicans to come to compromises on an extraordinarily large  budget item--65 percent, roughly, of the Federal budget here between  Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related  Agencies. I share my friend's appreciation and admiration for all that  were part of that.   My friend did bring up in her close the concern about two items in a  government shutdown. I will remind my friend, it was our friends who  tried to shut down the government in the House on the other side of the  aisle, and the Democrats in the Senate who actually did shut down the  government in 2017. So I always point out both parties have done this.  It is never a very good idea. Neither has ever achieved their  objectives there, so we are working hard to make sure that doesn't  happen. But it wasn't Republicans that shut down the government in  2017. I think it was actually called--well, I won't use the name, but  it was actually named after a Democratic Senator. So let's put that  aside.   Let's focus. My friend did raise an interesting point on closed  rules. And I think, you know, this is something they continue to focus  on, and, I think, sometimes lost in this, we ignore the structured rule  amendment process that has routinely been used actually by majorities  of both sides, to be fair.   If we are going to use that metric for measuring openness, I want to  clarify a couple of points for the Record.   Mr. Speaker, 16 of the closed rules cited by the minority were  rolling back regulations under the Congressional Review Act, which does  not allow for amendments, to ensure that only a majority vote is  required in the United States Senate.   Another 12 closed rules were for bills where the minority put out a  call for amendments but received no amendments. And if my friends from  the other side of the aisle believe that open rules are the only  measure of success, it is only fair to clarify for the American people  the Democratic majority's record in this regard.   In the 111th Congress, under Speaker Pelosi, the majority had zero  open rules. However, as we have already stated in the past, comparing  open versus closed rules ignores the structured amendment process. The  majority has made it a priority to make in order large numbers of  amendments for floor consideration, a majority of those with a  Democratic sponsor and/or cosponsor.   In fact, as of September 26, 2018, Republicans in the 115th Congress  have provided for consideration of over 1,650 amendments on the House  floor: over 750 of those amendments were offered by my friends, the  Democrats on the other side of the aisle; over 635 Republican  amendments were made in order; and over 280 bipartisan amendments.   So the 114th Congress, the GOP majority has actually allowed over  1,700 amendments to be considered on the House floor, and in the 113th  Congress, the Republican majority allowed over 1,500 amendments to be  considered on the floor. My friends, the last time they were in the  majority, the 111th Congress, offered fewer than 1,000 amendments to be  considered.  [[Page H8902]]    So there is a case to be made on both sides of these things. I think  the majority has tried to move legislation as best they can, but we  certainly want the active participation of our friends from the other  side, and, quite often, they are very robust in taking advantage of  that opportunity. That is a good thing.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to encourage all Members to support  the rule. I recognize my friends on the other side probably will not do  that, and that is appropriate. The rule debate is normally a partisan  divide, and I respect my friend's efforts in that regard.   But I know that many of my friends will support the underlying  resolution, and, for that, I express my appreciation, and, frankly, my  gratitude for the good hard work that has gone back and forth across  partisan aisles. This bill, though, this rule represents the next step  toward fulfilling our primary obligation as Members of Congress to fund  the government.   For the first time in over 10 years, we will fully fund the  Department of Defense before the start of our fiscal year. We will pass  a Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies  appropriations bill, providing funds for healthcare, schools, medical  research, job training, and thousands of other priorities for both  parties for the first time in 22 years. And we will enable that the  government remains open and operating to provide needed services for  our constituents.   So I want to applaud my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  their hard work. I want to thank our friends in the United States  Senate who have already completed their portion of this. I want to join  my friend in urging the President, assuming we pass this legislation,  to sign it and sign it before the end of the fiscal year.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Torres is as follows:             An Amendment to H. Res. 1077 Offered by Ms. Torres         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       6545) to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act of 1994,       and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall       be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration       of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to       the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill       shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.       All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the       House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6545.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, today marks a victory in the return to regular  order on the Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill. I am  proud of the hard work that brought this bill to us, and I want to  highlight just a few of the many provisions in the Labor, Health and  Human Services section of the bill that all Members can be proud of.   First of all, I want to note that, while the Defense portion of the  bill is up $18 billion, the Labor-H portion of the bill is actually  only up $1 billion. It is no secret that our friends on the other side  wanted a $5.5 billion increase. Our friends in the Senate version  actually got a $2.2 billion increase. In the end, the Labor-H bill  allocation actually only increased by $1 billion. In fact, almost  three-quarters of the bill in front of us is dedicated to defense.   The Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education portion of the  agreement boosts funding for the National Institutes of Health by $2  billion, continuing our quest to cure diseases like Alzheimer's and  cancer, and unlock the secrets of genetic conditions like Down  syndrome. We have provided increases to help our Nation prepare for  public health emergencies, and included $6.7 billion to fight and,  hopefully, end the opioid abuse epidemic, including $1.1 billion of  grants to States.    I am also proud to say that the agreement includes $50 million for a  new Infectious Disease Rapid Response Reserve Fund. The fund will not  only save American lives, it will save money too. By banking resources  now that only can be used in the event of a future infectious disease  public health emergency, we will provide the Secretary of Health and  Human Services with immediate access to the funds to respond to a new  outbreak, without waiting months for Congress to pass a costly  supplemental bill.   The conference agreement also increases funding for education and  training programs, including a $70 million increase for career and  technical education, a $60 million increase for TRIO and GEAR UP  programs to help more students obtain solid workplace skills and a  career of their choosing.   We increased funds for Impact Aid and charter schools, and provided  funds for our veterans to integrate back into the workforce.    We invested in TRIO and GEAR UP, and also in early  childhood education.   We have increased programs to help people with disabilities live  independently, and to fund early intervention and education services  for children with disabilities. We have increased school safety and  mental health programs, and increased funding for graduate medical  education to train more primary healthcare providers.   Finally, the bill continues the existing pro-life riders, including  the Hyde and Weldon amendments. We didn't give an inch on pro-life  matters in this bill.   This is a good agreement. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle, particularly Chairman Frelinghuysen, and my good friend,  Ranking Member Lowey. I also want to acknowledge my working partner and  good friend, Rosa DeLauro from Connecticut, and all the Members that  participated in the process.  [[Page H9043]]    But I particularly want to thank the outstanding staff that made this  possible: Susan Ross, Jennifer Cama, Justin Gibbons, Kathryn Salmon,  and Karyn Richman and Lori Bias on the majority staff; and minority  staff Stephen Steigleder and Robin Juliano for their diligence in  bringing this across the finish line for the first time in 22 years.    So I look forward to the floor passage and the President's  signature.
