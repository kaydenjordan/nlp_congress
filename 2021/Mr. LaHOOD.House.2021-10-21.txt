 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Tom  Cavanagh of Springfield, Illinois, who passed away this past weekend.   Tom had decades-long service to Springfield and to Sangamon County.  Tom was known as a loyal friend and a consistent advocate for  taxpayers. Tom spent three decades in public service, serving four  terms as Sangamon County treasurer and also county auditor, as Capital  Township supervisor of assessments, and on the Springfield Park  District board of trustees.   Tom's years of dedicated service in support of Springfield and  Sangamon County culminated in his recognition as the Illinois County  Official of the Year in 2018, when he was serving as treasurer.   Everyone who had the pleasure of knowing Tom knew him for his great  sense of humor and commitment to the community he served. Tom always  had a knack for finding a way to provide better services at a lower  cost for Sangamon and Springfield residents.   Tom will be missed by our Springfield community, but his legacy will  carry on through the work he did to better Sangamon County.    As central Illinois continues to mourn Tom's loss, my thoughts and  prayers remain with his family and loved ones.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Minnesota  for yielding and Mr. Ferguson for leading this effort.   If the previous question is defeated, we will amend the rule and  immediately consider H.R. 5586, the Prohibiting IRS Financial  Surveillance Act.   This legislation would prohibit the Treasury Department and the IRS  from implementing any new financial account surveillance regimes. This  is a direct response to this administration's invasive proposal that  would require financial institutions to report transaction data on  every American's bank account that meets their proposed threshold.   I am deeply skeptical of the need for this dangerous expansion of IRS  oversight and believe it to be a significant risk to individual  privacy. The Democrats are leading the American people to believe that  this is needed to target wealthy tax cheats and to help close the tax  gap. Unfortunately, this proposal, even with a $10,000 threshold, would  subject Americans at every rung of the economic ladder to these onerous  reporting requirements. This includes middle-class families, small  business owners, and farmers.   Even with proposed carve-outs, this proposal would turn local banks  into IRS reporting units, which is not only incredibly burdensome but  also costly. I have already been hearing from local bankers in Morton  and Liberty, Illinois, and throughout my district who are deeply  concerned about how this proposal will encourage their customers to  empty out their bank accounts, further exacerbating the unbanked-banked  divide.   In a letter dated September 29, 2021, the Department of the Treasury  cited that the IRS experiences 1.4 billion cyberattacks a year. I don't  know a single American who would like to have their personal data  reported to a system that is highly targeted by hackers and foreign  adversaries. In addition, the IRS' track record for leaking personal  information raises serious questions about their ability to implement a  program of this scale.   I am proud to join my friend, Congressman Ferguson, in his effort to  protect Americans' privacy, and I urge my colleagues to defeat the  previous question.
