 Madam Chair, Oregon, Idaho, California, New Mexico; the  Western United States is on fire. We need to do something now. The  folks here probably remember last year when we looked out the window  here in D.C., we saw smoke going over the top of this town and that was  Oregon or what used to be part of Oregon.   If we are going to avoid that, we need to do something now. To delay  is to destroy. This bill, sadly, should be called the delay bill. Why?  Because built into it throughout are obstacles to getting back into the  forests. Obstacles in the form of foundations for litigation of all  sorts, all types, and what we engage in then is paralysis through  litigation.   This bill creates numerous new means of delaying getting back into  the woods. We cannot afford to do this. To delay is to destroy. This  bill needs to be opposed.
