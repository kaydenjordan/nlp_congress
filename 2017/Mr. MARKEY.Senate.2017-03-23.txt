 Mr. President, today, we are truly in a historic fight, a  fight to protect one of the most treasured and revered American  values--our right to privacy. Make no mistake, our privacy has never  been more in danger, and the American public knows it.   The American public knows its privacy is in danger when a smart TV  can listen to its most intimate living room conversations--your  conversations with your children, with your parents, with your spouse.   The American public knows its privacy is in danger when it seems that  every day there is a hack on the databases of one of our country's  largest companies--Yahoo!, Target, Home Depot, JPMorgan Chase.   The American public knows its privacy is in danger when the Russian  surveillance machine--firing on all cylinders--hacks the U.S. election,  threatening to undermine our sacred democratic system.   The American public knows its privacy is in danger when both Chambers  of Congress hold countless hearings, launch investigations, and receive  briefings on the rapidly growing cybersecurity threat to our Nation and  the impact both on our national security and to the public.   The American public wants us to do more to protect its privacy. The  American public wants us to do more to protect its sensitive  information. Yet what do the Republicans in Congress want to do today  on the Senate floor? They want to make it easier for Americans'  sensitive information to be used, shared, and sold without their  permission.   Today, the Republicans are seeking a vote on a Congressional Review  Act resolution that would allow Comcast, Verizon, Charter, AT&T, and  other broadband companies to take control away from consumers and  relentlessly collect and sell their sensitive information without the  consent of that family.   That is sensitive information about your health, about your finances,  even about your children. They want to track your location and draw a  map of where you shop, where you work, where you eat, where your  children go to school, and then sell that information to data brokers  or anyone else who wants to make a profit off of you.   They want to document how many times you search online for heart  disease, breast cancer, opioid addiction treatments, or AIDS treatment,  and then sell that information to your insurance company. They want to  know what games your teenagers play or shows they watch so they can  then target ads to your family--and all of this done without your  consent.   What the Republicans are bringing to the floor today is going to  basically change the definition of ``ISP''--internet service provider-- to ``information sold for profit.'' It will stand for ``invading  subscriber privacy.''   President Trump, himself, is outraged about fake violations of his  own privacy, but we should all be alarmed by this very real violation  of privacy that will occur today if the Senate decides to roll back  these important consumer protections.   Here on the Senate floor, the Republicans are fighting to make it  easier for your broadband provider to use and sell that same type of  information--remarkably detailed and sensitive dossiers of information  about you, your kids, your parents, your grandparents--320 million  Americans.   The Republicans are trying to rescind the Federal Communications  Commission's broadband privacy rules, which simply require your cable,  wireless, or telephone company provider to obtain consumer consent  before using or sharing subscribers' personal information; promote  transparency by disclosing what they collect about internet and  wireless users; and adopt data security protections and notify  consumers if a breach occurs.   That is it. That is what this whole debate is all about--whether  consumers, not the broadband providers, have control over their  sensitive information.   The big broadband companies and their Republican allies say we need a  light touch regulatory framework to protect Americans' broadband  privacy--a light touch approach, like with the Federal Trade  Commission, which does not prescribe actual privacy rules. The Federal  Trade Commission only enforces the privacy policies companies create  for themselves, and then they bring an enforcement action if a company  violates its own very low standards, but if Comcast's or AT&T's or  Verizon's policy is that you have no privacy, there is nothing for  anyone to enforce. It would be impossible for the internet service  provider to violate its own nonexistent or very low privacy  protections.   Let's be clear here. When the broadband behemoths say ``light  touch,'' they mean ``hands off.'' They mean hands off their ability to  monetize captive consumers' sensitive information.   Let's be clear. When the big broadband barons and their Republican  allies are firing their opening salvo in the war on net neutrality,  they want broadband privacy protections to be the first victim.   When Republicans say we need to harmonize regulations, they really  mean self-regulation. Self-regulation is the ultimate dream of the  Republicans, who are beholden to those special interests. They really  want to allow broadband companies to write their own privacy rules.   Is this really what the American public wants--a harmonized, light- touch approach to protecting their sensitive information from their  broadband providers? Does the American public really want us to allow  our broadband companies to ignore reasonable data security practices,  making consumers' sensitive information more vulnerable to breaches and  unauthorized access?   This resolution does just that. The internet service providers even  oppose  [[Page S1948]]  following reasonable data security practices.   We should know better. The American public wants us to strengthen our  privacy protections, not weaken them. The American people do not want  their sensitive information collected, used, and sold by any third  party, whether that be your broadband provider or a hacker.   At its core, this debate is about our values--our values as a people,  our values as a society. While technology has certainly changed, our  core values have not changed as a country. For generations, we have  valued the right to choose whom we let into our homes, whom we  communicate with, whom we share our most sensitive secrets with, but  now the Republicans and the broadband industry are telling us that we  must forgo those rights just because our homes are connected to the  internet and our phones are connected to the internet.   With many Americans across the country having only a couple of  broadband providers, at most, to choose from, they will not have the  option of changing service providers if their privacy protections are  not transparent or robust. And throughout it all, while the internet  service providers monetize your personal information, the monthly bill  will continue to show up for the service that is siphoning off your  sensitive information.   My colleagues, we know the attack on the free and open internet is  coming. Net neutrality is on the chopping block, and this is the first  step in ensuring that the few and the powerful control the internet. We  must stop this today, so I urge my colleagues to join with me.   The fundamental principle here is that every person should have the  knowledge that information is being gathered about their families when  they use the internet; second, that they have notice from the company  that that information is going to be resold to a third party, to  someone else, not to the broadband company; and third, that you have  the right to say no, that you do not want that information about your  family member to be resold.   When we were all younger and the salesman came to the front door and  knocked, your mother told you to tell the salesman that they could not  come into the house because the privacy of your family did not warrant  allowing a stranger into your home. The broadband companies now say:  Well, we are in your home, and we are wired in every room, and we now  have the right to take all of the information of your family and sell  it. What sites do your children go on? What sites do you go on to look  for help for the disease that someone in your family might have?   Now the broadband companies say they are coming right through the  front door. They are going into every room in your house. The American  people have the right to say what they have always said: No, you cannot  take those secrets of our family. You cannot take how we use that  information.   So this vote that we are about to take in the next couple of hours on  the Senate floor goes right to the heart of who we are.   We now hear more about the Russians, and we hear more about companies  whose information has been hacked. Then the Republicans are crying  their crocodile tears about the compromise of privacy of people in our  country, and then they come to the floor and take all of the  information online in the family and allow it to be sold as a product.  That is just fundamentally wrong. It goes contrary to the values of our  country.   I urge very strongly a ``no'' vote from the Members of the Senate.  Just remember: This is the privacy vote of all time on the Senate  floor--of all time--because there has never been anything like the  internet going into our homes. No one should be allowed to take all of  that information and just sell it without getting their permission.   Mr. President, I urge a ``no'' vote on this resolution.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise to speak again today about the  epidemic of deadly, illicit fentanyl plaguing our Nation and how,  through bipartisan legislation I have introduced today, we can help to  stop this dangerous opioid from flowing into our country from abroad.   I want to start by providing some basic information about fentanyl.  What  [[Page S1976]]  is fentanyl? Well, fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50 times  stronger than heroin and 100 times more powerful than morphine.  Although pharmaceutical fentanyl can be misused, the current fentanyl  epidemic in our country is being fueled by illicitly manufactured  fentanyl and illicit versions of chemically similar compounds known as  fentanyl analogs.   Fentanyl, in its powder form, is often mixed with other illegal drugs  like heroin or it is disguised in pill form to resemble an opioid  painkiller like OxyContin. Many drug users overdose on fentanyl because  they have no idea it is cut into whatever substance they are injecting  or whatever pills they are swallowing. They simply do not realize just  how deadly fentanyl is.   In fact, just a few salt-size grains of fentanyl can kill an adult.  Where does illicit fentanyl come from? According to the Drug  Enforcement Administration, Mexico is the primary source for illicit  fentanyl trafficked into the United States. Distributors in China are  the principal source of the precursor chemicals, the chemical building  blocks used to manufacture fentanyl in Mexico and elsewhere.   China is also a source of finished product illicit fentanyl coming  into the United States. Why is illicit fentanyl trafficking increasing?  Well, we are in the midst of an opioid epidemic that has begun with the  overprescription and resulting abuse of prescription opioids like  OxyContin. When users found those pills too expensive to sustain their  addiction, they turned to cheaper heroin.   Now they are turning to even cheaper and more powerful fentanyl,  which has become an extremely lucrative product for drug dealers and  drug cartels. According to the DEA, a kilogram of heroin can be  purchased from Colombia for about $6,000 and then sold on the wholesale  drug market for $80,000--purchased for 6,000, sold for $80,000. By  comparison, a kilogram of pure fentanyl can be purchased from China for  less than $5,000 and then sold on the market for $80,000 as well.   Because it is so potent that 1 kilogram of fentanyl can be cut with  agents like talcum powder or caffeine, resulting in 24 kilograms of  product to be sold, that means that one $5,000 kilogram of fentanyl  actually reaps a whopping profit in the neighborhood of $1.6 million.   What has been the impact of the fentanyl epidemic on the United  States? Well, the DEA is so concerned about fentanyl that in March of  2015, it issued a nationwide alert that highlighted the drug as a  threat to health and public safety. Between 2014 and 2015, overdose  deaths in the United States from synthetic opioids, principally illicit  fentanyl, increased 72 percent.   In 2015, there were more than 9,500 such overdose deaths in the  United States. Last year, it is estimated that my home State of  Massachusetts suffered more than 2,000 opioid-related overdose deaths,  largely fueled by the deadly rise of illicit fentanyl. In fact,  Massachusetts ranked second notionally per capita in synthetic opioid  deaths, which includes fentanyl, with the number of deaths between 2014  and 2015 increasing by 109 percent.   Massachusetts authorities are now finding fentanyl in 74 percent of  the State's opioid overdose deaths. If those figures hold up, that  means last year there will have been roughly 1,500 fentanyl-related  deaths in Massachusetts in 2016. If the fentanyl epidemic were to hit  the entire Nation as hard as it is hitting Massachusetts, the country  would lose almost 75,000 people each year to fentanyl. Think about  that. Those are more deaths than the United States suffered in the  entire Vietnam war.   Fentanyl is the Godzilla of opioids. It will overrun communities and  lay them to waste, unless we take action now to stop it. So how do we  stop it? There is no easy solution to a crisis caused by a drug that is  so small, so powerful, so profitable that those who traffic in it just  want to make money, but we know we must act.   First, we need to raise awareness of the dire threat fentanyl poses  to our Nation. We need to educate the public about it. We need to  elevate the issues to the highest levels of our government and the  governments of the countries from which it comes. To help with that  effort, last week, the Senate adopted a bipartisan sense of the Senate  resolution on fentanyl trafficking that I introduced with Senator Rubio  from Florida. I thank him for his partnership on that resolution. I  thank Senators Toomey, Shaheen, King, Johnson, and Nelson for adding  their support.   The resolution calls on our government to use its broad diplomatic  and law enforcement resources in partnership with Mexico and China to  disrupt the trafficking of fentanyl. We are seeing the signs of some  progress. In October of 2015, China added 116 synthetic chemicals,  including 6 fentanyl products, to its list of controlled chemical  substances. In February of 2017, China agreed to make carfentanil, a  powerful fentanyl analogue, and three other fentanyl analogues illegal.   Earlier this month, I led a group of 10 Senators in urging Secretary  of State Tillerson to secure the votes of the 53 member nations of the  U.N. Commission on Narcotic Drugs in favor of the scheduling of the  fentanyl precursors. Last week, the Commission voted unanimously in  favor of controlling these substances. This international cooperation  is expected to yield meaningful dividends in the fight against illicit  fentanyl.   Fentanyl will require us to build bridges to our international  partners, not walls. Indeed, I recently visited Mexico, where I met  with law enforcement officials at the border, on the front lines of the  smuggling and trafficking of narcotics into the United States. That is  why today, Senators Rubio, Brown, Capito, and I introduced legislation  to help this front line of drug detection at the border. It is called  the INTERDICT Act. It provides badly needed high-tech equipment and  other resources to U.S. Customs and Border Protection to help it detect  and interdict illicit fentanyl being trafficked into the United States.   Here is how it works. There are two principal ways drugs like  fentanyl are trafficked into the United States. First, coming from  Mexico, they are smuggled across the southwest border of the United  States. They are hidden in vehicles, beneath false floors, behind  hidden compartments, and elsewhere. The drugs are also carried into the  United States by people, sometimes hidden in the hollowed-out heels of  their shoes.   Second, illegal fentanyl is also purchased online from overseas  vendors in China and elsewhere--often on the dark web--and then shipped  to Mexico or directly to the United States through the mail or express  consignment carriers.   Fentanyl shipped this way is often concealed inside legitimate goods,  with fentanyl suppliers using various methods to mislabel shipments.  For example, some conceal the powder in those small silica packages  that say ``do not eat'' placed alongside everyday items. Others gift  wrap shipments or label them as household products like laundry  detergent to avoid detection.   Customs and Border Protection has many different methods it uses to  find contraband being smuggled into the United States at the border or  through the mail. These include drug-sniffing dogs, various kinds of  scanners, fiber-optic scopes, and physical searches. When Customs and  Border Protection finds a suspicious substance using those and other  methods, it has had success identifying it as an illicit drug like  fentanyl with the help of high-tech, handheld chemical screening  devices.   So anytime Customs and Border Protection finds a suspicious powder,  pill, or liquid, it can use a handheld device--really something that  looks and feels like a Nintendo Game Boy--to conduct a test, in the  field, with real-time results. That means narcotics like illicit  fentanyl can be detected, identified, and seized quickly and on the  spot. Those rapid results provide vital information for law enforcement  officers to continue their investigation and, if appropriate, proceed  with seizure and arrest. Not only does the use of this technology  disrupt the flow of the drugs into the country, it protects the health  and safety of law enforcement officials from exposure to dangerous  substances like illicit fentanyl.   Often, Border Patrol agents don't know what the powdery substance  they have uncovered is and whether it poses a threat to them. That is  especially alarming with illicit fentanyl, given its strength.  [[Page S1977]]    Exposure to a small amount by contact with the skin or through  inhalation can be fatal. Increased use of these high-tech devices will  provide important protections for our law enforcement officers on the  front lines. The INTERDICT Act also provides for additional equipment  back in Customs and Border Protection laboratories, including more  scientists who analyze and interpret test results.   The INTERDICT Act ensures that Customs and Border Patrol will have  hundreds of additional portable chemical screening devices available at  international ports of entry and mail and express consignment  facilities and additional equipment and personnel available in their  laboratories so that they can provide support during all operational  hours.   Again, I thank Senator Rubio, Senator Brown, and Senator Capito for  working together on a bipartisan basis so we can give these additional  tools to fight this fentanyl epidemic. I urge all my colleagues to  support this bill to fight the scourge of illicit drugs. It knows no  political, geographic, or socioeconomic boundaries. It is the epidemic  of our time.
