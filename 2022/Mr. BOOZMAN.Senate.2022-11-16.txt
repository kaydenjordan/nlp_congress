 Mr. President, I rise to honor the life of Stacey  Allen Jones, who passed away October 8, 2022. Stacey was a native of  Fort Smith, a leader, an educator, and a family man whose advocacy for  the performing arts enriched the lives of people in western Arkansas.   Long-time residents of Fort Smith knew Stacey as a champion for the  arts in the region. I knew Stacey as a fellow Northside Grizzly and a  dear friend.   Before his recent retirement, he served as the associate vice  chancellor of campus and community events at the University of Arkansas  Fort Smith and led the Season of Entertainment on campus and at its  predecessor Westark College for more than 39 years.   Through these programs, he brought nationally touring musicians and  Broadway shows to the area and supported student productions to improve  the quality of life in the community, provide opportunities for young  people, and enhance the mission of the university. Along the way, he  was also a mentor and advocate for thousands of students who  participated in these programs.   Stacey was also well-known throughout the State for his dedication to  the Miss UAFS and Miss Arkansas Programs. Because of his leadership,  Westark College's local pageant became a qualifying event for the Miss  Arkansas pageant. Among the many successful competitors who started at  the Miss Westark pageant was Shawntel Smith, who went on to be crowned  Miss America while representing Oklahoma in 1996.   Outside of the university, Stacey was a critical part of many  community projects. As part of a coalition of local leaders, he  regularly lent his voice and experience to help others in their efforts  to enhance the arts, history, and culture of the region.   I extend my sincere condolences to Stacey's wife of 46 years, Sheila  Jones; his daughters Stacie Kohles and Amanda Echols; his loving  family; and many friends. Western Arkansas is richer because of his  hard work, dedication, and genuine care for the university and the  community. He will be missed.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize  Washington County  [[Page S6737]]  Sheriff Tim Helder who is retiring after 43 years of law enforcement  service in northwest Arkansas.   Sheriff Helder is a dedicated public servant who followed and built  on his family's century-long legacy in public safety.   He began his career in 1979 as a dispatcher with the Washington  County Sheriff's Office. He continued his service for 21 years at the  Fayetteville Police Department before returning to the sheriff's office  as chief deputy.   In 2004, Helder was elected Washington County Sheriff and has  admirably served his neighbors and fellow citizens, who elected him to  eight terms leading the department. During his time as sheriff, he has  instilled a sense of duty, pride, and professionalism within the  department and its officers.   Sheriff Helder also made efforts to ensure his own knowledge and  leadership benefited from world-class training, including at the FBI  National Academy, and partnerships with premiere task forces and other  law enforcement agencies.   Engaging directly and frequently with the people of Washington County  has long been a priority for the sheriff, including staying connected  with community partners and elected leaders by hosting a monthly  breakfast to keep everyone updated on county law enforcement issues and  the importance of working together.   We can be proud of Sheriff Helder's lifelong service both in and out  of uniform. He has embodied what it means to serve and protect and  deserves our thanks for bettering communities in our State.   I applaud Sheriff Helder for his accomplished career and the  leadership and perseverance he has demonstrated.   I wish him the best in his retirement, where I know he will be happy  to spend more time with his wife Holly, their three children, and  grandchildren. I know he will continue working in different but  meaningful ways to build a better Arkansas.                            ____________________
