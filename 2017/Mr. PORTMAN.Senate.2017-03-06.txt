 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                               Opioid Epidemic     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                               Opioid Epidemic     Madam President, this is the 32nd time I have come to  the  [[Page S1594]]  floor in the last year to talk about an issue that unfortunately is  getting worse--not better--and that is the epidemic of opioids; that  would be heroin, prescription drugs, and now, more recently, synthetic  heroin, also known as fentanyl or U-4 or carfentanil.   Every single day we are now losing 144 Americans to drug overdoses.  Think about that, every single day, 144 people. By the way, that means,  during the time it takes to give these remarks, which will be about 12  minutes, on average, we are losing another American to this opioid  epidemic.   It is an issue that is now so serious that it has overtaken car  accidents or even homicides from gun violence as the No. 1 accidental  cause of death in our country.   It is easy to get discouraged because we see these statistics. We  hear about the overdoses. We hear about the deaths. We hear about the  difficulty for people to get out of the grips of this addiction. The  relapse rate is high. It is an issue that is affecting every single  community in this Chamber. By the way, it is affecting our inner  cities, it is affecting our suburbs, it is affecting our rural areas  and every group of Americans out there. No one is immune from this, and  it knows no ZIP Code.   Yet today I want to talk a little about some of the reasons for hope  and some of the models of success out there because this Congress, to  its credit in the last year, has actually gotten much more serious  about this issue. We passed two pieces of legislation to help;  particularly, to provide better prevention and education to keep people  from getting into the funnel of addiction and then, second, to help in  terms of providing the resources: the treatment, the recovery. The  longer term recovery, in particular, it is the first time Congress has  stepped up on that.   We also need to do a better job ensuring that our law enforcement and  our other first responders have what they need to save lives and to be  able to reverse the effects of overdoses through this miracle drug  called naloxone or Narcan. It is part of the legislation that has not  just been passed but is beginning to be implemented.   Fortunately, in my own State of Ohio--although we have one of the  worst addiction problems in the country--we also have a lot of really  compassionate people who have stepped forward and are taking advantage  of these resources, including not only resources from Washington now  but also from State and local governments and from so many nonprofits  out there. They are taking advantage of that to provide better  treatment, better recovery, and better prevention. As a result, they  are saving lives.   On Saturday, I visited a group called Clean Acres in Wilmington, OH.  It is a farm that provides recovery housing for men. These are men who  are struggling with addiction. They work on the farm. They provide each  other support, and it has been very successful for a lot of them.   I met a guy named Dan, who told me how Clean Acres is helping him get  his life back. For over a decade, he was a heroin addict. He shot up  every morning until one day, he was actually at work, and he passed  out. He was digging a ditch, and he passed out.   He was rushed to the hospital. The doctors discovered he had a very  serious infection related to his intravenous drug use. He required  emergency, lifesaving surgery right then.   The doctors told him he might not wake up. He did wake up after that  surgery, and there before him were his three kids. He hadn't seen them  in 5 years because--in so many cases you hear this and as Dan said  this--the drugs became everything. He said, not his family, not his  relationships, not his friends, not his work--the drugs became  everything. These three kids had come to his bedside because they  thought it might have been his deathbed, he said.   He saw these three kids, whom he hadn't seen in 5 years. He said that  even after having experienced this near-death operation and having his  three kids there, the first thought that came to his mind was: Where  can I get another hit? Where can I get another hit? But then, in the  situation he was in, he prayed, and he said his prayer was: ``Lord,  help me get out of here.'' ``Help me get out of here,'' meaning, ``help  me get out of this situation.''   He made a decision. He was going to try treatment again. He had tried  treatment before. So many recovering addicts and addicts I talk to  around my State have been in and out of treatment programs, detox  treatment. It hasn't worked.   He decided this time he was not just going to get into treatment, but  he was going to try something different, which was not to go back to  the old neighborhood, not to go back to his old friends, but instead to  try longer term recovery. That is how he ended up at Clean Acres. That  is this farm where he and other men live together. They work, but they  support each other to try to keep their lives on track after their  treatment is over. It doesn't provide the treatment, but it does  provide them with the meetings they need to be able to have that  support around them in order to keep clean.   As one of the men at Clean Acres told me, it is hard to go through  treatment. It is much harder to stay clean after treatment.   So Dan is healing himself. He is working at the farm. He plans to go  into construction. He has big plans now. That is the hope. That is the  opportunity for people to get their lives back on track whom I see  every day when I talk to the people in my home State of Ohio.   Last week, I was also at Racing for Recovery, outside of Toledo, OH.  I met with Todd Crandell. He has been in recovery from addiction for  about 20 years. He is now giving back in a huge way.   I met with parents who had lost children to addiction. They come to  Todd's organization, Racing for Recovery. They find support there, and  they help other parents to work through this.   I met law enforcement officers there who are working with this  recovery facility to try to ensure that the people whom they are  locking up aren't going to just get right back into the revolving door  again, back in and out of prison, back committing crimes. The No. 1  cause of crime in the State of Ohio is this addiction; people who,  again, put the drug first ahead of everything, including their own  sense and their own conscience, their own sense of what is moral and  right, and instead they are committing burglaries and fraud and  shoplifting--anything they can do to get the funds they need to  continue their addiction.   I met Jessica at Racing for Recovery. She has been clean for 9  months. Before she sought help, she overdosed for 3 days in a row. She  said her life was saved by the police; specifically, a program by the  Lucas County Police Department called the Drug Abuse Response Team,  DART. I am really impressed with DART and what they are doing. It is  now being copied in other communities around Ohio and around the  country. DART is being proactive. They got her engaged in treatment and  recovery. She is now in sober housing. Todd, Jessica, and others there  told me this: Look, you have to have this longer term recovery because  that is what works.    A couple of weeks ago, during the State work period, I held a  roundtable discussion in Fremont, OH, where I met Matt Bell. Matt is an  amazing guy--a charismatic, young guy. He said that for him the gateway  drug was marijuana and alcohol in high school. He ended up overdosing  on heroin three times. He was convicted of 13 felonies, and he went to  detox 28 times. Now he is clean and preventing new addictions from  taking place by working nonstop to raise public awareness about the  dangers of drug use. He goes around to the schools, and he doesn't just  talk to kids who are juniors and seniors. He talks to middle schoolers  because he knows he has to go younger and younger to get kids to think  about their own futures, about the fact that addiction can happen in  one use sometimes, and it is something that can ruin their lives. Thank  God for Todd and thank God for Matt, because guys like that are out  there every day giving back and they are saving lives.   So I want to thank all these compassionate people I have met--Clean  Acres, Racing for Recovery, the Lucas County DART team, and Team  Recovery. They are doing the hard work. They are in the trenches trying  to actually turn the tide on this growing addiction problem we have.  Again, I want to tell them that help is on the way.   Last year Congress did pass the 21st Century Cures Act and authorized  [[Page S1595]]  funding for States--$500 million this year and $500 million for next  year--to fight this epidemic. Another step we took, which I think was  probably the biggest step we have taken in a couple of decades in this  area, was the passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act,  or the CARA Act. Those who know about CARA know that it is a new  approach on treatment, recovery, and prevention. If you don't know  about it, look it up and check it out. Be sure that the groups in your  town, wherever you live, know about the fact that they can apply for  grant money to be able to help on these recovery services that I am  talking about, many of which do not have the funding to be able to be  successful without the increases in rehab. Be sure they know about the  fact that if you have a fire department in your community that is  strapped for cash and cannot afford the Narcan to provide the Narcan  treatments, there is an opportunity to apply for grants there, too, to  be able to save lives from overdoses. Narcan is not the answer. The  answer is to get into treatment. But Narcan is saving lives, and,  therefore, it is necessary today. So let people know that is around and  is available now.   Sadly, the situation is not getting better, even with these new  efforts that are finally being implemented by the new administration.  They started at the end of the Obama administration with a couple of  programs, and now we have a couple more programs coming on line. Within  the next few months, we expect the rest of the programs to be fully  implemented. They are absolutely necessary, but they are pushing up  against something new, which is, I hate to say, even more dangerous  than heroin, and that is this synthetic heroin that is coming into our  communities. It is like a poison coming into our communities by the  U.S. mail system, if you can believe it.   The experts tell us that most of this fentanyl or carfentanil is  being made in laboratories overseas, mostly in China, and it has been  coming through the mail system. Why? Because the traffickers don't want  to use other private carriers--UPS or FedEx or others--because they  require that there be advanced digital information on where the package  is from, what is in it, and where it is going. Guess what. We don't  require that in the mail system. So the bad guys choose to send it  through the mail system instead. That certainly is something the  Federal Government should address.   So we have introduced legislation called the STOP Act. It is very  simple. It says that if you want to send something to the United States  of America, it has to say where it is from--what place in China--what  is in the package, where it is going, and it can only go to the place  they say it is going. That gives our law enforcement a new tool they  are desperate to have because they are not able to look at millions of  packages. But they can look at hundreds and this helps them to ferret  out those packages that look most suspicious.   By the way, this new stuff, fentanyl and carfentanil, is incredibly  powerful and incredibly dangerous. It is believed to be 30 to 50 times  more powerful than heroin. Think about that. I was in Dayton, OH, a  week before last and was meeting with the law enforcement task force  there. They told me the sad story about a little girl, 14 years old,  who was told by her friends: You ought to snort this stuff; it is  called heroin. She did. It was fentanyl, and she dropped dead. She  overdosed and died immediately because it was so powerful. Even a few  flakes of it, they say, can kill you.   According to the Cleveland medical examiner of Cleveland, OH, this  past month of February, which is the shortest month in the year, was  also the deadliest month in Northeast Ohio for fentanyl and heroin. In  other words, what they are seeing is not just more overdoses but more  deaths because of fentanyl being mixed with heroin or sometimes  fentanyl in its pure form. In just 28 days this February, 60  Clevelanders died from overdoses in one month. This is one city in  America. There are another seven cases that are undergoing tests, but  they are suspected to be the result of heroin and fentanyl overdoses.   What is driving the growth of this epidemic is the increasing use of  fentanyl. Drug traffickers are lacing other drugs with it. I was told  by the DART task force in Toledo that they are actually putting  fentanyl in marijuana now, and people are showing up in the emergency  room and overdosing on marijuana because it is sprinkled with fentanyl.  It is more addictive. So the traffickers like it. It is more deadly. So  we need to fight back. The Drug Enforcement Administration says it  takes 2 milligrams of fentanyl to kill you. That is about the same as a  pinch of salt. Many heroin users don't realize that the heroin they buy  on the street may contain these new incredibly powerful synthetic  drugs. So part of the message has to be what one father told me, which  is: You are playing Russian roulette every time you use these drugs  because you don't know what is in it. If there is fentanyl in it, there  is a good chance you won't just overdose, but you will end up as one of  these statistics we talked about earlier.   In Lorain, OH, last Monday, a 29-year-old man drove off the road and  nearly hit a tree. When police arrived they found him unconscious from  an overdose, with a baby in the backseat--a baby in the backseat. It  took several doses of this Narcan and naloxone to reverse the effects  of the overdose. Ordinarily, it would take only one dose, but with  fentanyl-laced heroin it takes more. When police went to his home, a  child answered the door and said: Mommy is sleeping, and we can't wake  her up. Again, this is the guy that overdosed in the car. They take the  kid home and another kid says: Mommy won't wake up. They find out the  mother is also unconscious from a heroin overdose that she had in front  of her four children. According to police, the couple thought they were  using heroin, but tests confirm that it was laced with fentanyl.    This is an opportunity for us in the Congress to pass legislation  that will help to be able to stop some of this poison from coming into  our communities. At a minimum, it will raise the price, because some of  this fentanyl, I am told, is less expensive than even the things that  are less powerful, like heroin.   Fentanyl took the life of Erin Jarvis of Troy, OH. Erin was a prom  queen. Erin was very popular. She was active in student government. She  was captain of her soccer team. She got good grades. She got into Ohio  University, a great school.   She had multiple knee injuries from playing soccer, which required  surgery. She was prescribed Percocet. She became addicted. At Ohio  University, her friend introduced her to a drug that was stronger and  cheaper and easier to get. Of course, that was heroin. This story I  have heard so many times. There is the overprescribing, sometimes  because of an accident and an injury, and, then, somebody becomes  addicted and turns to heroin because it is cheaper and easier to get.  Erin began disappearing for days at a time, stealing from her family.  Her mom Kelly started missing jewelry, credit cards, and even a TV set.  When her sister got her wisdom teeth taken out, she stole her sister's  Percocet. By the way, she never should have gotten Percocet for her  wisdom teeth, in my view.   Erin finally got help. She went to rehab. She decided she wanted to  become a nurse and help others struggling with addiction. After  receiving treatment, she moved back in with her mom. But she relapsed,  and she died. She died at the age of 24 with this promising life ahead  of her. Her last words to her mom were these: I love you. The next day  Kelly watched her daughter get taken out of their home in a body bag.   Tests showed that Erin died of an overdose of heroin laced with  fentanyl. According to the coroner, she hadn't used the full injection.  There was a lot left in the needle. He said: I suspect that what was in  that syringe was not what she thought it was--exactly.   Families who have loved ones struggling with addiction are worried  about the poison pouring into the streets, and you can see why. As  deadly as heroin is, this stuff is even worse.   To keep this poison off the streets, Senator Klobuchar, Senator  Rubio, Senator Hassan, and I have introduced bipartisan legislation,  the Synthetic Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act, or the STOP Act,  which would require the Postal Service to require this simple  information that would give our law enforcement the ability to target  these packages of fentanyl.  [[Page S1596]]    Based on expert testimony in hearings we have had hearings before the  Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, it would  make it easier for them to detect those packages. That is what law  enforcement is asking for. We should provide it to them. There is a  bill in the House that is identical to ours, introduced by Congressman  Pat Tiberi of Ohio and Congressman Richard Neal of Massachusetts.   This is not the silver bullet, as I said. It is not the solution. No  one has that silver bullet, but it would take away a key tool of drug  traffickers and restrict the supply of these drugs, raising their price  and making it harder to get. With the threat of this synthetic heroin  and this poison coming into our communities every day, we need to act  and act now.   So I would urge my colleagues to let their constituents know about  the help that is on the way. Tell them about what is going on with the  Cures Act and CARA legislation. Put it on your website so they know  they can get help with treatment and recovery that was not previously  out there. Our law enforcement, first responders, and firefighters can  get the help they need to be able to get the training and have the  funds for Narcan to save lives. We can do much better in terms of  prevention and education. Some of this grant money is directed toward  letting people know the connection between prescription drugs and  heroin and between fentanyl and heroin.   Finally, to my colleagues, please join us in pushing back against  these new poisons coming into our communities by cosponsoring the STOP  Act and by requiring that this basic information be provided. With more  cosponsors, I think our leadership will be much more likely to take  this to the floor. Once it gets to the floor, it can be passed because  people know that in their communities all over this country this  epidemic must be stopped.   Thank you, Madam President.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.
