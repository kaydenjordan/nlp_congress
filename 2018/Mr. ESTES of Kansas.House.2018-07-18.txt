 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support amendment  No. 62 to H.R. 6147. This amendment modernizes the Endangered Species  Act and recognizes voluntary conservation efforts to protect the lesser  prairie chicken.   In 2015, the species native to western Kansas was inaccurately listed  as threatened under the Endangered Species Act due to a multiyear  drought. Since then, Kansas farmers and ranchers have devoted millions  of dollars toward successful conservation through a range-wide plan.  This along with increased rainfall has led to an increase in the lesser  prairie chicken population.   However, recently, the push to list the species as endangered was  restarted, disregarding these voluntary efforts. I am glad this  amendment recognizes the private conservation efforts toward the lesser  prairie chicken. I cosponsored a similar measure in the farm bill, and  I appreciate Representatives Pearce and Marshall for offering this  amendment. I ask my colleagues to support it.
