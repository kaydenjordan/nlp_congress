 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this week the Senate continues its  consideration of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act.  Among important provisions related to our military readiness and  operations abroad, the NDAA presents crucial opportunities to address  other matters of national security.   In addition to the critical improvements to CFIUS we must make in  this bill, one of the most concerning issues is the decision by the  Trump administration last week to reduce the harsh penalties previously  imposed and then to provide relief to the Chinese telecom giant ZTE,  lifting restrictions on the company and allowing it to continue to sell  its products in the United States. ZTE was guilty of evading U.S.  sanctions on Iran and North Korea and then lying to U.S. officials  about it afterward.    Asked about the decision to relax penalties, President Trump's trade  adviser, Peter Navarro, said: ``It's going to be three strikes you're  out on ZTE.'' Why are we giving ZTE three strikes? If you purposely  evade U.S. sanctions and then lie about it, that is reason enough to  bring the hammer down and leave it there. I have another expression for  the Trump Administration: ``Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice,  shame on me.''   It seems the administration was outmaneuvered by the Chinese on ZTE  once again. Congress should reverse what the administration has done by  reinstituting the hard penalties on ZTE, and we should do it on the  NDAA bill that will be on the floor this week.   You might ask: Why is this related to defense? This is the Defense  bill.   It is precisely related. Cyber security experts, national security  experts, principal government agencies, the Republican-led FCC, the  Republican-led FBI, and the Republican-led Pentagon have all deemed the  sale of ZTE products in the United States a national security threat.  Even if they hadn't violated sanctions and even if they hadn't lied  about it, they shouldn't be here. This gives the Chinese Government-- which in many ways takes advantage of the United States militarily and  economically and is spying on us by cyber warfare--a great opportunity  to get right inside all of our communications.   This is what Director Christopher Wray, appointed by President Trump,  had to say:         We're deeply concerned about the risks of allowing any       company or entity that is beholden to foreign governments . .       . to gain positions of power inside our telecommunications       networks. That provides the capacity to exert pressure or       control over our telecommunications infrastructure. It       provides the capacity to maliciously modify or steal       information. And it provides the capacity to conduct       undetected espionage.    ``Undetected espionage,'' the head of the FBI says, is what allowing  ZTE in America will do. That is the Nation's chief law enforcement  official--a Republican, appointed by President Trump--testifying that  ZTE's technology is an espionage risk. What the heck are we doing  cutting a deal with China--which is no friend of ours on economics and  is stealing our jobs, stealing our intellectual property--letting them  into the United States so they can have a window on hearing what our  companies, our Defense Department, and everyone else are doing?   Does that make any sense? I don't think so. That is why we have had  bipartisan support and concern. I want to salute Senator Cornyn,  Senator Rubio, and Senator Cotton. Their views and mine are not the  same on a whole lot of issues, but on America's security and letting  China spy on us, we are the same.   I urge the Republican leader and the leaders of the bill to include a  bipartisan amendment, offered by Senators Cotton and Van Hollen, to  reverse the agreement made by the administration and prevent it from  being able to provide ZTE relief for at least a year. We have to do  this.   God forbid that this country declines, and if they write a book on  it, this will be one of the key points. We have a chance to stand up to  China, to protect our national security, and to tell the Chinese that  they can't keep taking advantage of us, and we are going to back off,  for no stated good reason, because, clearly, Secretary Ross has said  the deal he has put in is a good one. Forget about it. It is as weak as  a wet noodle--fining them $1 billion. They don't care. They are backed  by the Chinese Government. Putting some outside observers on the  board--come on. They will not know what is going on because the Chinese  Government controls just about all the big companies in China. So I  hope we will stop this.                  Nominations of Thomas Farr and Ryan Bounds    Mr. President, alongside the consideration of the NDAA, we are told  that the majority intends to see the confirmation of more judicial  nominations during this work period. In the next few weeks, the Senate  is likely to take up two highly controversial nominees: Thomas Farr,  for the Eastern District of North Carolina, and Ryan Bounds, for a  Ninth Circuit seat in Oregon.   Thomas Farr has spent a lengthy legal career defending the interests  of corporations against workers. That seems to be a trademark of so  many of the nominees of this administration and this Republican Senate.  He has not once but twice defended the gerrymandering of congressional  districts by North Carolina's Republicans, and probably worst of all,  he defended North Carolina's restrictive voter ID law, which ``targeted  African Americans with almost surgical precision.'' That is not some  politician's words. Those are the judges of the Fourth Circuit Court of  Appeals, a rather conservative court. For somebody to target African- Americans and say, ``let's make  [[Page S3397]]  it less likely they vote and give them less power,'' is such a grand  step backward in this country, no matter what State you come from-- North Carolina, New York, Oregon. And we are going put this guy on the  bench? Shame on us. Shame on us.   By the way, the only reason Farr can be considered for this  nomination is that an Obama nominee, Jennifer May-Parker, was blocked  for nearly 3 years via the blue slip. Our Republican friends used the  blue slip and kept this seat vacant, and now they have undone the blue  slip in an act of partisanship, narrowness, and enmity in this country,  and now they are going to fill it with someone like Mr. Farr--again,  shame.   Like Mr. Farr, Mr. Bounds is also controversial. Recently, we learned  that Mr. Bounds had some rather offensive writings that he failed to  disclose to the bipartisan Judicial Advisory Committee established by  Senators Wyden and Merkley. That certainly validates their decision to  withhold the blue slip. Despite the opposition of both home State  Senators, the majority is moving forward. In doing so, they will  further erode the century-old blue slip tradition that they themselves  used to block an unprecedented number of nominees when Obama was  President.                                Net Neutrality    Mr. President, on another matter, the Republican-led FCC's repeal of  net neutrality goes into effect today. The rules enacted by the Obama  administration to bar large internet service providers from charging  customers more for certain content are gone. The rules to bar large  internet providers from slowing down certain websites are gone. The  rules ensuring an open and free internet with a level playing field for  small businesses, public schools, rural Americans, people without a lot  of money, and communities of color are gone.   Democrats tried to forestall this day by writing and then passing a  CRA Act resolution through the Senate. It is bipartisan; some  Republicans helped us. It couldn't have passed without them. Then, as a  unified Senate caucus, Democrats sent a letter last week urging Speaker  Ryan to schedule a vote, which I believe would have passed had it been  put on the floor of the House of Representatives. Ryan refused to bring  up the companion legislation to restore net neutrality. Once again, our  Republican friends in the Senate, the House, and the administration  have done it over and over, siding with the big, powerful special  interests--in this case, internet service providers--over the average  person, who is sort of powerless. How many of us rail against our cable  bills? How many of us feel helpless when it comes to getting that cable  bill? This increases the power of the same people.   Do our Republican friends really want to do that? I guess so. Let me  put it this way. By refusing to bring up the Senate-passed resolution  to restore net neutrality, House Republican leaders gave a green light  to the big internet service providers to charge middle-class Americans,  small business owners, schools, rural Americans, poorer people, and  communities of color more than they did before.   With the exception of three brave Republicans in the Senate, it  should be crystal clear to the American people that Republicans in  Congress chose to protect special interests.                                  Healthcare    Mr. President, finally, I wish to address a bit of news on  healthcare. On Thursday evening, the Trump Administration made a  startling announcement: It would no longer defend the constitutionality  of protection for Americans with preexisting conditions. This decision  is a shameful capstone in the Trump administration's yearlong  sabotaging our Nation's healthcare system. It is the most dangerous,  most potent example of sabotage to date, even as premium increases hit  double digits in State after State because of Republican actions. If  the Trump administration gets its way, our entire healthcare system  will be thrown into chaos.   A mom goes to a health insurance company: My daughter has cancer.   We are not going to fund you.   She goes to another one.   We are not going to fund you.   The mother suffered. The family suffered. Their child is agonizing,  dying of cancer, and they can't get insurance now because the Trump  administration is no longer saying that we are going to protect people  who apply with preexisting conditions.   What is going on here? What is going on? And our Republican friends  do nothing. The one thing I can tell you is that healthcare is going to  be the biggest issue in 2018. It is far more important to the vast  majority of Americans than any other issue. It is far more important  than the tax cut they get, because for most Americans whatever they got  back in tax cuts--for many, many Americans, and my guess is most--is a  lot less than the amount their premiums are increasing. It is a killer  for small businesses and others who want to insure their workers.   President Trump, when he ran, explicitly and repeatedly said that he  was going to protect folks with preexisting conditions. He has once  again undone what he has promised. He has dropped the ball on  healthcare, letting middle-class Americans, average Americans, and  working families pay an awful price.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I share Mr. Marcus's concerns about  rising anti-Semitism on college campuses and his strong opposition to  the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, which I believe is  infused with anti-Semitism. I voted against Mr. Marcus's nomination,  along with all of my Democratic colleagues, because Mr. Marcus  convinced me in his hearing that he would not be an effective advocate  for students of all backgrounds, including victims of sexual assault on  campus. Mr. Marcus was unable to name a single example of something  President Trump has said or done when it comes to discrimination or  civil rights that he disagrees with, he agreed with Secretary Devos's  Title IX changes, which rolled back protections for campus victims of  sexual assault, and his answers on protecting minority students and  LGBTQ students were woefully insufficient to earn my support.   (At the request of Mr. DURBIN, the following statement was ordered to  be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
