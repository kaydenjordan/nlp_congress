 Mr. President, I object.   We look forward to having a very healthy and serious debate on this  issue in the Armed Services Committee so that we can resolve many  claims by both sides about the best way to deal with this.   I think, through Senator Gillibrand's great efforts, we have moved a  long, long way in terms of addressing the issue of sexual assault  through the UCMJ, but there are still significant issues that have to  be thoughtfully discussed. In the context of that discussion, I object.    Mr. President. the Public Company Accounting Oversight  Board (PCAOB) Enforcement Transparency Act, which I reintroduce today  with Senator Grassley, will bring needed transparency to the  disciplinary proceedings the PCAOB has brought against auditors and  audit firms earlier in the process.   Nearly two decades ago, in response to a series of massive financial  reporting frauds, including those involving Enron and WorldCom. the  Senate Banking Committee held multiple hearings, which produced  consensus on various underlying causes, including weak corporate  governance, a lack of accountability, and inadequate oversight of  accountants charged with auditing public companies' financial  statements. Later, in a 99 to 0 vote, the Senate passed the Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002 to address the structural weaknesses revealed by the  hearings. Among its many provisions, this law called for the creation  of an independent board, the PCAOB, responsible for overseeing auditors  of public companies in order to protect investors who rely on  independent audit reports on the financial statements of public  companies.   Today, the PCAOB, under the oversight of the U.S. Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC), oversees more than 1,700 registered  accounting firms, as well as the audit partners and staff who  contribute to a firm's work on each audit. The Board's ability to begin  proceedings that can determine whether there have been violations of  its auditing standards or rules of professional practice is a crucial  component of its oversight. However, unlike other oversight bodies, the  Board's disciplinary proceedings cannot be made public without consent  from the parties involved. Of course, parties subject to disciplinary  proceedings have no incentive to consent to publicizing their alleged  wrongdoing and these proceedings typically remain cloaked behind a veil  of secrecy. In addition, the Board cannot publicize the results of its  disciplinary proceedings until after the appeals process has been  completely exhausted, which can often take several years.   This lack of transparency invites abuse and undermines the  Congressional intent behind the PCAOB, which was to shine a bright  light on auditing firms and practices, deter misconduct and bolster the  accountability of auditors of public companies to the investing public.   Our bill will restore transparency by making hearings by the PCAOB,  and all related notices, orders, and motions, transparent and available  to the public unless otherwise ordered by the Board. This would more  closely align the PCAOB's procedures with those of the SEC for  analogous matters.   Increasing transparency and accountability of audit firms subject to  PCAOB disciplinary proceedings bolsters investor confidence in our  financial markets and better protects companies from problematic  auditors. I hope our colleagues will join Senator Grassley and me in  supporting this legislation to enhance transparency in the PCAOB's  enforcement process.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Kelly, and Mr. Menendez):   S. 2022. A bill to enable States to better provide access to whole  genome sequencing clinical services for certain undiagnosed children  under the Medicaid program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Finance.
