 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached  legal opinion of the Government Accountability Office, no. B-335488,  titled ``U.S. Department of Transportation--Applicability of the  Congressional Review Act to Notice of Funding Opportunity for the  Department of Transportation's FY 2023-2024 Multimodal Project  Discretionary Grant Opportunity,'' issued on October 18, 2023, be  printed in the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                  Decision       Matter of: U.S. Department of Transportation--Applicability           of the Congressional Review Act to Notice of Funding           Opportunity for the Department of Transportation's FY           2023-2024 Multimodal Project Discretionary Grant           Opportunity      File: B-335488      Date: October 18, 2023                                    DIGEST         On June 23, 2023, the U.S. Department of Transportation       (DOT) published a document titled Notice of Funding       Opportunity for the Department of Transportation's FY 2023-      2024 Multimodal Project Discretionary Grant Opportunity       (MPDG) (Multimodal NOFO). DOT did not submit a report       pursuant to the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to Congress or       the Comptroller General on the Multimodal NOFO.        CRA incorporates the Administrative Procedure Act's       definition of a rule and requires that before a rule can take       effect, an agency must submit the rule to both the House of       Representatives and the Senate, as well as to the Comptroller       General. The Multimodal NOFO announced the availability of       DOT funding for three discretionary grant programs: the       Nationally Significant Multimodal Freight and Highway       Projects program, the National Infrastructure Project       Assistance program, and the Rural Surface Transportation       program. DOT's stated purpose in the Multimodal NOFO was to       fund surface transportation infrastructure projects meeting       the criteria of these programs and aligning with DOT goals.       We conclude that the Multimodal NOFO meets CRA's definition       of a rule and no CRA exception applies. Therefore, the       Multimodal NOFO is subject to CRA's submission requirement.                                   DECISION         On June 23, 2023, the U.S. Department of Transportation       (DOT) published a document titled Notice of Funding       Opportunity for the Department of Transportation's FY 2023-      2024 Multimodal Project Discretionary Grant Opportunity       (MPDG) (Multimodal NOFO), available at https:// www.transportation.gov/qrants/multimodal-project- discretionary-grant-notice-fundinq-opportunity (last visited       Sept. 19, 2023). We received a request for a decision as to       whether the Multimodal NOFO is a rule for purposes of the       Congressional Review Act (CRA). Letter from Senator Ted Cruz       to the Comptroller General (July 27, 2023). As discussed       below, we conclude that the Multimodal NOFO is a rule subject       to CRA's submission requirement.        Our practice when rendering decisions is to contact the       relevant agencies to obtain their legal views on the subject       of the request. GAO, Procedures and Practices for Legal       Decisions and Opinions, GAO-06-1064SP (Washington, D.C.:       Sept. 2006), available at https://  [[Page S5137]]       www.gao.gov/products/qao-06-1064sp. Accordingly, we reached       out to DOT to obtain the agency's legal views. Letter from       Assistant General Counsel, GAO, to Acting General Counsel,       DOT (Aug. 2, 2023). We received DOT's response on August 31,       2023. Letter from Acting General Counsel, DOT, to Assistant       General Counsel, GAO (Aug. 31, 2023) (Response Letter).                                  BACKGROUND       The Multimodal NOFO        The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Pub. L.       No. 117-58, 135 Stat. 429 (Nov. 15, 2021), provided DOT with       funding for three grant programs--the Nationally Significant       Multimodal Freight and Highway Projects grants program, the       Rural Surface Transportation grant program, and the National       Infrastructure Project Assistance grants program. Id.       Sec. Sec. 11110 (Nationally Significant Multimodal Freight       and Highway Projects), 11132 (Rural Surface Transportation       Grant Program); id. Sec. 21201 (National Infrastructure       Project Assistance); see also Multimodal NOFO, at 5. A       general purpose of these grant programs, consistent with the       overall purpose of the IIJA, is to promote ``Federal-aid       highways, highway safety programs, and transit programs,''       IIJA, preamble.\1\ Id. Sec. Sec. 11110, 11132, 21201. The       IIJA authorized appropriations for these three programs       through FY 2026. Multimodal NOFO, at 5.        In the Multimodal NOFO, in order to ``streamline the       process for applicants'' for the FY 2023-2024 grant period,       DOT ``combined [its] solicitations'' for all three of the       above-referenced grant programs. Id. at 5. The Multimodal       NOFO ``encouraged [applicants] to apply for multiple       programs'' and indicated that DOT would automatically       consider applicants for each program ``unless they opt[ed]       out of a specific program.'' Id. at 6. As the Multimodal NOFO       explained, the three grant programs have ``slightly       different'' eligibility criteria, but applicants generally       may include states or groups of states, metropolitan planning       organizations, units of local government, political       subdivisions of states or local governments, and tribal       governments or groups of tribal governments. Id. at 10. The       Multimodal NOFO outlined the precise eligibility and       selection criteria for each program, as well as the types of       projects eligible to receive DOT funding under each one, Id.       at 10, 15. Overall, DOT stated that its purposes were to fund       ``surface transportation infrastructure projects . . . with       significant national or regional impact'' and ``to improve       and expand the surface transportation infrastructure in rural       areas.'' Id. at 1. DOT further stated that it sought to award       projects that ``align with the [National Roadway Safety       Strategy]'', ``reduce greenhouse gas emissions and . . .       address climate change impacts'', ``address environmental       justice'', ``address equity and barriers to opportunity'',       and ``support the creation of good-paying jobs'', among other       things. Id. at 6-7.        As compared with a similar notice of funding opportunity       that DOT issued in FY 2022 for these grant programs, the       Multimodal NOFO used changed ``criteria'' to evaluate       applicants and make award decisions in certain respects. Id.       at 8.\2\ For example, the Multimodal NOFO ``revised how       [Outcome Area] criteria will be rated'' and indicated that       Rural Program applicants requesting less than $25 million       need only address a subset of these criteria. Id. The       Multimodal NOFO also indicated that ``[f]or the first time''       DOT would be using ``a Cost Estimate Review team'' to       ``evaluate in greater detail the cost estimates for any       project requesting $1 billion or more in funding.'' Id.       Finally, the Multimodal NOFO stated that the ``list of       counties qualifying as Areas of Persistent Poverty'' had been       updated in accordance with new census data, and that the       definition of ``Historically Disadvantaged Communities'' had       been updated ``in accordance with the [White House's] Climate       & Economic Justice Screening Tool'', developed ``as part of       the Justice40 initiative.'' Id. The Multimodal NOFO indicated       that applicants planning to ``reapply using materials       prepared for prior competitions'' should ensure they are ``up       to date'' with DOT's revised criteria. Id. at 8-9.        The Multimodal NOFO provided an application deadline of       August 21, 2023, and indicated that DOT would award       ``approximately $5.45-5.575 billion'' to the current       ``round'' of applicants ``from FY 2023 and FY 2024 funding.''       Id. at 2      The Congressional Review Act        CRA, enacted in 1996 to strengthen congressional oversight       of agency rulemaking, requires federal agencies to submit a       report on each new rule to both houses of Congress and to the       Comptroller General for review before a rule can take effect.       5 U.S.C. Sec.  801 (a)(1)(A).\3\ The report must contain a       copy of the rule, ``a concise general statement relating       to the rule,'' and the rule's proposed effective date. Id.       CRA allows Congress to review and disapprove federal       agency rules for a period of 60 days using special       procedures. See 5 U.S.C. Sec.  802. If a resolution of       disapproval is enacted, then the new rule has no force or       effect. 5 U.S.C. Sec.  801(b)(1).        CRA adopts the definition of rule under the Administrative       Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. Sec.  551 (4), which states       that a rule is ``the whole or a part of an agency statement       of general or particular applicability and future effect       designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy       or describing the organization, procedure, or practice       requirements of an agency.'' 5 U.S.C. Sec.  804(3). CRA       excludes three categories of rules from coverage: (1) rules       of particular applicability; (2) rules relating to agency       management or personnel; and (3) rules of agency       organization, procedure, or practice that do not       substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency       parties. Id.        DOT did not submit a CRA report to Congress or the       Comptroller General on the Multimodal NOFO. In its response       to us, DOT asserted that CRA is inapplicable to the       Multimodal NOFO because the Multimodal NOFO is an ``exempt       procedural rule'' and ``not a final agency action.'' Response       Letter at 5-6.                                  DISCUSSION         An agency action is subject to CRA if it meets the APA's       definition of a rule and no CRA exception applies. Because       the Multimodal NOFO meets the APA's definition of a rule, and       because no CRA exception applies, the Multimodal NOFO is       subject to CRA's submission requirement.        The Multimodal NOFO meets the APA definition of a rule. It       is an agency statement, as it is an official document issued       by DOT and posted on the agency's website. Multimodal NOFO;       see also B-334146, June 5, 2023 (finding that a document       issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and       posted on USDA website qualified as agency statement); B-      331560, Apr. 16, 2020. Second, the Multimodal NOFO has future       effect, as its provisions apply to, and announce criteria       for, grantprogram applications submitted after its issuance       and before future deadlines. Multimodal NOFO, at 2; see also       B-334146 (finding that a USDA notice of funding opportunity       document had future effect); B-333732, July 28, 2022 (finding       that a USDA publication had future effect because it defined       criteria for determining future financial assistance       benefits). Finally, the Multimodal NOFO prescribes or       implements law or policy and describes agency procedures, as       it defines the procedures by which eligible entities may       apply for three grant programs, describes the process by       which DOT will evaluate these applications, and specifies the       level of funding that applicants may receive. Multimodal       NOFO, at 1-15; B-334146 (finding that a USDA notice of       funding opportunity implemented law or policy and described       agency procedures when it ``establish[ed] a new grant       program'' with ``eligibility requirements'', ``criteria used       to select proposals'', and ``funding level [s]''); see also       B-333732 (finding that USDA's announcement of a payment-in-      kind program for sugar was a rule because it established       application procedures, payment limits, and sanctions for       future noncompliance with program requirements).        Additionally, none of CRA's exceptions apply:        First, the Multimodal NOFO is not a rule of particular       applicability. Rules of particular applicability are those       addressed to specific, identified entities that address       actions that may or may not be taken by those entities, in       light of the facts and circumstances specific to those       entities. B-334995, July 6, 2023; B-334411, June 5, 2023; B-      334146; B-334221, Feb. 9, 2023. The Multimodal NOFO applies       broadly to states or groups of states, metropolitan planning       organizations, units of local government, political       subdivisions of states or local governments, and tribal       governments or groups of tribal governments, among other       entities. Multimodal NOFO, at 10. Thus, it has general, not       particular, applicability. See B-334146 (USDA notice of       funding opportunity had general applicability because it was       addressed to ``local and state governments, small and large       businesses, and nonprofit entities.''); see also B-334221; B-      330843, Oct. 22, 2019.        Second, the Multimodal NOFO is not a rule relating to       agency management or personnel. ``A rule falls within the CRA       exception for rules relating to agency management or       personnel if it relates to purely internal agency matters,       with no effect on non-agency parties.'' B-334411; B-334146;       B-334221. Here, the Multimodal NOFO relates primarily to non-      agency parties. As explained above, it specifies the means by       which a wide variety of non-agency parties may apply for       funding pursuant to three DOT grant programs, as well as       specifying the selection criteria and funding levels for       those programs for FY 2023-2024. Multimodal NOFO, at 1-15.       Thus, it does not relate to agency management or personnel.       B-334146 (finding that USDA notice of funding opportunities       that ``establish[ed] a grant program for a wide array of non-      federal entities'' did not relate to agency management).        Third, and finally, the Multimodal NOFO has a substantial       impact on the rights and obligations of non-agency parties.       GAO has previously found that notice of funding opportunity       documents associated with agency grant programs can have a       substantial impact on non-agency parties. Most recently, we       found that a USDA notice of funding opportunity document       substantially affected the rights and obligations of non-      agency parties by implementing a new grant program for       nonfederal entities and establishing the program's       eligibility requirements, selection criteria, and funding       ranges. B-334146. As we explained, a notice that       ``determine[s] whether and in what amount [non-agency]       entit[ies] may receive funding . . . substantially affects       the rights or obligations of those non-agency parties.'' Id.       Similarly, we have found that agency rules amending or       clarifying the requirements of financial assistance programs       for non-agency parties substantially affected those parties''       rights  [[Page S5138]]       and obligations. In B-333732, for instance, we concluded that       USDA's 2021 Thrifty Food Plan substantially affected non-      agency parties because it increased the maximum benefit       allotments for qualifying families under the Supplemental       Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).        Here, by reference to the above cases, the Multimodal NOFO       has substantial effects on the rights and obligations of non-      agency parties. While the Multimodal NOFO does not, itself,       establish a new grant program like the USDA notice in B-      334146, it defines the FY 2023-2024 eligibility requirements,       selection criteria, and funding ranges for three existing DOT       grant programs. Multimodal NOFO, at 4-5. Each of these       programs offers potential DOT funding to a wide range of non-      agency parties, as discussed above, which makes DOT's actions       in the Multimodal NOFO comparable to USDA's actions in B-      334146 and B-333732. In the present case, as in B-334146 and       B-333732, the agency's actions ``determine[d] whether and in       what amount [a non-agency] entity may receive funding'',       which ?substantially affects the rights or obligations of       those non-agency parties.'' B-334146.        In its response to us, DOT asserts that the Multimodal NOFO       is an ``exempt procedural rule.'' DOT relies upon four prior       GAO decisions: B-330190, Dec. 19, 2018, B-329926, Sept. 10,       2018, B-329916, May 17, 2018, and B-292045, May 19, 2003.       Response Letter, at 5.\4\ Each of these decisions is       distinguishable, however, because they involved changes to       agencies''internal conduct with only indirect and       insubstantial effects on the rights and obligations of non-      agency parties. See B-330190 (finding CRA inapplicable to       agency memorandum that ``outline[d] the agency's internal       procedure for addressing violations of 8 U.S.C. 51325(a)'');       B-329926 (finding CRA inapplicable to agency manual governing       ``the use of evidence from the Internet'' by agency officials       during adjudicatory proceedings); B-329916 (finding CRA       inapplicable to Internal Revenue Service action that ``shifts       the timing of a step in the agency's process'' for reviewing       tax returns); B-292045 (finding CRA inapplicable to a       Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) memorandum announcing a       change in VA's procedures for disposal of real property       because it ``relat[ed] to agency management'' and did not       ``affect any party's right or obligation''). None of these       actions was directed at non-agency parties or concerned, like       the Multimodal NOFO and the agency actions in B-334146 and B-      333732, with specifying the terms and conditions for non-      agency parties to apply to receive federal funds. B-330190;       B-329926; B-329916; B-292045.        Relatedly, DOT relies on Batterton v. Marshall, 648 F.2d       694 (D.C. Cir. 1980) to distinguish ``legislative'' from       ``procedural'' rules and urge that rules ``may alter the       manner in which the parties present themselves or their       viewpoints to the agency'' without affecting rights or       interests. Response Letter, at 4 (citation omitted). However,       Batterton concerned the distinction between ``legislative''       and other rules for purposes of applying APA notice-and-      comment requirements. See Batterton, 648 F. 2d at 707. As the       legislative history of CRA makes clear, a rule may be       nonlegislative and exempt from APA notice-and-comment       requirements while still being subject to CRA's submission       requirements. A principal sponsor of the CRA legislation       stated that:        Although agency interpretive rules, general statements of       policy, guideline documents, and agency policy and procedure       manuals may not be subject to the notice and comment       provisions of section 553(c) of title 5, United States Code,       these types of documents are covered under the congressional       review [CRA] provisions of the new chapter 8 of title 5.        142 Cong. Rec. H3005 (daily ed. Mar 28, 1996) (Statement of       Rep. McIntosh); see also B-331171, Dec. 17, 2020 (``The       sponsors of CRA intended the definition of rule to be as       broad as possible to ensure congressional review of agency       action.''). Here, as discussed above, the Multimodal NOFO       does more than just alter the manner in which certain parties       present themselves to DOT, it determines whether and in what       amount non-agency entities may receive funding from the       federal government.        DOT also asserts that the Multimodal NOFO's ``requirements       for eligible applicants, cost sharing requirements, eligible       project types, and eligible project costs'' did not originate       with the Multimodal NOFO but come directly from the       ``detailed statutory authorit[ies]'' governing DOT's grant       programs. Response Letter, at 4. In other words, according to       DOT, ``any rights and obligations'' at issue in this matter       ``are prescribed by existing laws,'' not by the Multimodal       NOFO. Id. We acknowledge that the statutes governing DOT's       grant programs are detailed in many respects and establish       eligibility and other criteria outlined in the Multimodal       NOFO. However, it is not the case that the Multimodal NOFO       did nothing more than echo terms and conditions already set       forth in DOT's program statutes. Those statutes left DOT with       clear discretion and gap-filling authority in many respects.       For example, the statute governing the National       Infrastructure Project Assistance program states that       applications shall be submitted ``at such time, in such       manner, and containing such information as [DOT] determines       to be appropriate.'' 49 U.S.C. Sec.  6701 (c). It also       instructs DOT to ``determin[e]'' whether a given project       applying for grant funds ``is in need of significant Federal       funding'' and ``will be cost-effective,'' among other things.       Id Sec.  6701 (f). In the Multimodal NOFO, DOT exercised its       discretion to elaborate upon these statutory terms by       defining the ``time'' and ``manner'' in which applications       must be submitted and specifying detailed ``information''       requirements, See, e.g., Multimodal NOFO, at 1-3 (stating       deadlines and ``anticipated'' funding amounts not set forth       in DOT's program statutes). With respect to the issue of       whether projects will be ``cost-effective,'' for example, the       Multimodal NOFO outlines a ``recommended approach for the       completion and submission of a benefit-cost analysis (BCA)       narrative and calculation file,'' as well as encouraging       applicants to ``review DOT's detailed guidance'' cited in the       Multimodal NOFO. Id. at 42. By providing detailed       instructions in this and other respects, the Multimodal NOFO       affected ``whether and in what amount [non-agency] entit[ies]       may receive funding'', which, once again, ``substantially       affects the[ir] rights or obligations.'' B-334146.        Finally, DOT asserts that the Multimodal NOFO is ``not a       final agency action'' and is ``exempt'' from CRA because no       applicant is ``obligated to apply for'' or ``entitled to       receive''the advertised funding, and because DOT has yet to       make the ``final project selections'' that may result in       grant awards. Response Letter, at 6 (citation omitted).       However, DOT did not distinguish the funding notice in B-      334146, which, like the Multimodal NOFO, was discretionary       and left final award decisions contingent upon further action       by USDA. See, e.g.. USDA, Partnerships for Climate-Smart       Commodities, USDA-NRCS-COMM-22-NOF00001 139, available at       https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view- opportunity.html?oppld=337878 (last visited Sept. 19, 2023)       (outlining an opportunity for ``[d]iscretionary'' grants). A       grant notice need not announce mandatory funding or make       final award decisions in order to have a substantial effect       on the rights and obligations of non-agency parties. B-      334146. Rather, as we have explained, an agency action may be       ``non-binding'' and contemplate ``further action'' without       therefore becoming ``eligible for CRA's procedural       exception.'' B-334032.2, Apr. 5, 2023 (``CRA's requirements       are applicable to general statements of policy that lack       legally binding effects.'') (citation omitted). Here, DOT's       announcement of criteria that ``determine[d] whether and in       what amount [a non-agency] entity may receive funding'' is       sufficient to make the Multimodal NOFO ineligible for that       exception. See B-334146.                                  CONCLUSION         The Multimodal NOFO is a rule under CRA because it meets       the APA's definition of a rule and no CRA exception applies.       Therefore, the Multimodal NOFO is subject to CRA's       requirement that it be submitted to Congress before it can       take effect.        (Signed) Edda Emmanuelli Perez, General Counsel.                                   ENDNOTES         1. Under the general rubric of improving highways, highway-      safety, and transit programs, each program focuses on       particular types of improvement projects, in line with their       titles and corresponding IIJA provisions. Two of these       programs--the Rural Surface Transportation grant program and       the National infrastructure Project Assistance grants       program--originated with the LLJA. LLJA Sec. Sec.  11110,       11132; id Sec.  21201.        2. DOT previously announced and awarded funding for the FY       2022-2023 period via a publication titled Notice of Funding       Opportunity for the Department of Transportation's Project       Discretionary Grant Opportunity, 87 Fed., Reg. 17108 (Mar.       25, 2022).        3. Alternatively, an agency can find for good cause that       notice and public procedure are impracticable, unnecessary,       or contrary to the public interest, and the rule will then       take effect at a time the agency determines. 5 U.S.C. Sec.        808(2).        4. Additionally, DOT urges that the Multimodal NOFO is       distinguishable from the grant notices in B-33416 because       USDA in that case exercised ``general statutory authority''       to ``accomplish certain enumerated statutory ends.'' Response       Letter, at 5. However, GAO's determination that the notice of       funding opportunities at issue in B-334146 did not qualify       for the CRA's third exception was based on the effects of       USDA's actions on non-agency parties, as discussed above, not       on the general or specific nature of USDA's statutory       authority.                            ____________________
