 Mr. Speaker, Joe Biden has been our  President for 25 months. He said he would build an economy for working  families in America.   The largest infrastructure law in U.S. history: Done.   The American Rescue Plan: Done.   The CHIPS and Science Act: Done.   The Inflation Reduction Act: Done.   The United States economy added 517,000 jobs last month alone. The  unemployment rate is 3.4 percent, the lowest in 54 years. Biden created  11 million jobs. That is 440,000 jobs every single month.   According to Bloomberg Business, Biden is now on his way to becoming  the greatest job-producing President in U.S. history.   Mr. Speaker, 35 million Americans today have healthcare because of  the Affordable Care Act, and 92 percent of all Americans have  healthcare that is better and more affordable.   Mr. Speaker, it is no wonder why our Republican House colleagues are  now threatening to destroy the American economy by defaulting on the  very obligations that they voted to create. We are better as a nation,  and we are better as a Congress.                            ____________________
