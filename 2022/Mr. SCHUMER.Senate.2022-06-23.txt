 Madam President, as we approach the conclusion of a  truly consequential work period, the Senate this morning will take the  next major step toward accomplishing something that hasn't been done in  decades, passing a strong gun safety bill.   The bill can be described simply in three adjectives: common sense,  bipartisan, lifesaving. And if Republicans work with us, we could very  well finish the job in its entirety before the day is done.   Later this morning, the Senate will vote to invoke cloture on the  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and I expect that vote to have robust  bipartisan support, just as we saw earlier this week.   We are not going to leave until we pass this bill. After this  morning's vote, it is my intention to work with Republican colleagues  to reach an agreement to secure a vote on final passage before the day  is out.   As the author of the Brady bill nearly 30 years ago, the last  legislative effort to fight gun violence, I am so pleased that we are  at last on the precipice of taking action once again. It has been a  long time, but this breakthrough is welcome. So I urge my Republican  colleagues, let's get this bill passed and pass it today. Let's pass it  so we can send it to the House; they can send it to the White House;  and the President can sign it. Americans have waited long enough. Let  us finish our job today.   As we take the final steps in this process, few could have  anticipated we would reach this point just a few weeks ago. The morning  after the tragedy in Uvalde, the U.S. Senate faced a choice: We could  surrender to gridlock, and we could swiftly vote on a bill with  provisions many of us would have wanted, but because of rigid  opposition from the other side had no hope of passing the Chamber--it  would have failed--or we could choose to try and forge a bipartisan  path forward to pass a real bill, as difficult as that may have seemed  to many.   Over the past 4 weeks, we chose to try and get something done.  Immediately after Uvalde, I spoke with Senator Murphy, who asked me to  give negotiators time and space to do their work. With his deep  experience in this area, he believed that given the opportunity, maybe,  maybe, maybe these  [[Page S3102]]  talks could succeed; although, of course, there was no guarantee.   I was happy to agree because I knew that even if there was a chance  to get something positive and tangible done on gun safety, it was worth  the effort. So I told Senator Murphy I would give him the space he  needed. That quickly became the consensus of our caucus and the  consensus of many of our gun safety advocates who pressed us to secure  real progress. Senator Murphy and I called them the day after Uvalde,  and they agreed, get something done, even if it wouldn't be everything  we would all want.   We were all on the same page. Instead of voting on a bill that would  fail, we would try and get something real passed in the Senate. In the  end, it was the right decision because before long we had a bipartisan  guns framework. A week later, we had legislative text. A few days ago,  that bill came before the Senate with strong bipartisan votes. And  today--today--we can take final steps to passing the first major gun  safety bill in nearly 30 years.   As I said, this is not a cure-all for all the ways gun violence  affects our Nation, but it is a long overdue step in the right  direction. It is significant; it is going to save lives; and it is my  intention to get it done as soon as we can.   I want to thank all of my Democratic and Republican colleagues for  working together to reach this point, and I want to thank the leaders  of the effort: Senators Murphy and Sinema, Senators Cornyn and Tillis,  as well as all of our colleagues on the bipartisan working group, all  of our chairs and Members who contributed their expertise and their  leadership in shaping the bill. I also want to thank every single  survivor of gun violence, every family who has spoken up, every  advocate who has organized, and every voter and concerned citizen who  has pushed this body to take action for so many years. Even with the  holes in their heart, the lost loved ones through needless, cruel gun  violence, so many advocates persisted and persisted and persisted. And  without them keeping that candle burning, even in the darkest of  moments, we wouldn't have gotten this done. I salute them. I thank  them. America thanks them. And I say to all of them, all the advocates  who worked so hard and so long on this, very soon your efforts will  bear real fruit.    We are going to keep going until we finish the job. So I urge my  colleagues to reach an agreement with us to do precisely that.    Mr. President, tonight, the Senate is passing bipartisan  legislation that will keep America's schoolkids fed for the summer.   A hungry child is a horrible thing to see, and because of the  amazing, persistent work of a great team, a great bipartisan team-- Senator Stabenow, chairman of the Agriculture Committee and Senator  Boozman, ranking member of the Agriculture Committee--that won't  happen.   The worst of the pandemic is hopefully behind us, but schools across  the country are still suffering from the challenges that COVID  created--supply chain issues making it harder to provide students free  meals they need to stay healthy over the summer.   It would have been just awful--awful--for the Senate to leave without  taking action to make sure we provided the waivers necessary to make  sure kids can get the free meals they need over the summer.   Kids deserve to be healthy. They deserve to be well fed. And by  extending these nutrition waivers before they expire, we can make sure  that no student will have to worry about where they are going to get  their lunch during the summer.   There is no justification in the world for letting these waivers come  to an end, and the good, persistent, steady hard work of Senators  Stabenow and Boozman made sure that didn't happen.                            ____________________     Madam President, first, let me thank Senator Murphy for  his amazing work and that powerful speech. He did a great, great job,  as did many others.   Now, tonight, the U.S. Senate is doing something many believed was  impossible even a few weeks ago: We are passing the first significant  gun safety bill in nearly 30 years.   The gun safety bill we are passing tonight can be described with  three adjectives: bipartisan, commonsense, lifesaving.   As the author of the Brady bill in 1994--the last legislative effort  to fight gun violence in Congress--I am pleased that this moment has  finally come and that we are finally taking meaningful action to keep  our communities safe. I hope it paves the way for future action on guns  in Congress and at all levels of government.   As I said, this is not a cure-all for all the ways gun violence  affects our Nation, but it is a long-overdue step in the right  direction. Passing this gun safety bill is truly significant, and it is  going to save lives. It was so, so significant that we let the process  work instead of just having one vote, which would divide us and not  accomplish anything. And I hope that portends doing it again on guns  and on other issues as well.   I want to thank my colleagues for their incredible work. This was a  great moment here on a very, very difficult issue. I want to thank  Senators Murphy and Sinema; Senators Cornyn and Tillis, who showed  amazing courage; and all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  for working together to break this logjam. The American people have  waited long enough. Let's finally take action to pass this lifesaving  gun safety bill.
