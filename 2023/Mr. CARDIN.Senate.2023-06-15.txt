 Mr. President, I take this time--and I will be making a  unanimous consent request in regards to the superintendent of U.S.  Naval Academy, but I first want to acknowledge my responsibilities on  behalf of this body.   You see, I serve on the Board of Visitors of the United States Naval  Academy. I was selected to be one of the Senate representatives on the  U.S. Naval Academy Board of Visitors. We are extremely proud of what  that academy has produced, and today it is producing the next  generation of military leaders. It is consistently ranked as one of the  top colleges in the United States, and it should be for training the  next generation of leaders for our military.   I will just give you one example. The U.S. Naval Academy is prepared  to deal with the challenges of AI and cyber security. It has new  facilities there and is training experts to help defend our national  security in that regard.   I also want to acknowledge on behalf of the Board of Visitors Admiral  Buck, the current superintendent, who is retiring. He has done an  incredible service to our Nation as the superintendent of the U.S.  Naval Academy and now has completed 40 years of service to this  country.   Rear Admiral Yvette Davids is exceptionally qualified to be the next  superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy. Admiral Davids is a career  professional military officer who has sworn an oath to support and  defend the Constitution and our country. She has consistently put  service before self and the Constitution before politics.   Admiral Davids graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1989 with a  B.S. in oceanography and was commissioned as an ensign. She later  received an M.A. in national security and strategic studies from the  Naval War College in 2002 and an M.S. in national resource strategy  from the Industrial College of the Armed Forces in 2012.   She has had a distinguished career at sea, highlighted by commanding  multiple U.S. warships as well as a carrier strike group. Ashore, she  has served in increasing roles of importance, including as a senior  military adviser at the State Department and as the chief of staff at  U.S. Southern Command.   Admiral Davids has led men and women in combat, and her extensive  experience will be vital to leading our next generation of officers at  the Naval Academy.   Admiral Davids' confirmation as the next superintendent will be the  culmination of a 34-year career dedicated to defending our country, and  it will be historic, as she will become the first woman to lead the  Naval Academy.   The incoming class of 2027 reports to the Naval Academy for induction  on June 29, just a few days from now, and the fall semester begins on  August 24. Admiral Davids should be confirmed as superintendent without  delay in order to complete the turnover with the ongoing superintendent  and prepare for the fall semester.   The last time the Naval Academy superintendent did not have a summer  change of command was over 59 years ago. It occurred in 1964 when the  incumbent superintendent had a heart attack that resulted in early  retirement.   The Senate needs to confirm the promotion of Rear Admiral Davids now.  The U.S. Naval Academy superintendent is charged with the moral,  mental, and physical development of our 4,500 U.S. Naval Academy  midshipmen across four classes who represent roughly one-third of the  naval officers we commission each fiscal year. The position provides  direct oversight to the commandant of midshipmen, who serves as the  dean of students and supervises all military and professional  development training of the brigade of midshipmen, and direct oversight  to the civilian academic dean, who manages the academic programs and  student facilities at the U.S. Naval Academy.   The superintendent is the public face of a premier academic  institution and consistently hosts government officials, international  symposiums, and liaises directly with alumni and distinguished Members  of Congress on all matters pertinent to the institution.   If Rear Admiral Davids is not confirmed, it would force potential  courses of action that are not in the best interests of the  institution. This could include having the O-6 commandant of midshipmen  act as superintendent or temporarily assigning another flag officer to  act as superintendent. Neither of these options provides the continuity  and leadership and seniority required to oversee a world-class academic  institution. The other option could be to require an involuntary  extension of the current superintendent of the academy, who has already  selflessly served his country for over 40 years.   I think we all recognize that the United States Naval Academy is a  unique institution. It provides us the trained leadership for future  generations in our military. It is an academic institution that needs  the full-time attention of a CEO to manage all the aspects that go on  at the Naval Academy. We need to have that person in place before the  beginning of this academic year, which is just a few days off.   Delaying this promotion will adversely affect the morale and  readiness of the Naval Academy and beyond. Delaying this promotion is  unfair to the young men and women already at or entering the Naval  Academy who have signed up to put themselves in harm's way to serve our  Nation in uniform. Delaying this promotion is a gratuitous, self- inflicted wound to our national security.   So, Mr. President, I am going to make this unanimous consent request.  I do that, as I said earlier, with my experience on the Board of  Visitors representing this institution, charged with doing everything  we can to make sure we are as supportive as possible to our men and  women who wear the uniform of this Nation and to those attending the  U.S. Naval Academy.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration  of the following nomination: Calendar No. 192, Rear Admiral Yvette Anne  Davids, to be vice admiral; that the Senate vote on the nomination  without any intervening action or debate; that, if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, and  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President.    Mr. President, obviously I am deeply disappointed by the  objection being heard here. I really feel compelled to explain one  factor of my colleague's comments.   We don't want the military involved in politics. We do everything we  can to keep them insulated from the internal politics of the Congress,  the Senate and the House, and that is exactly what my colleague is  doing by this hold.   We are responsible to make sure that we support our men and women in  harm's way. Having the military academies properly managed is part of  our responsibility so that they have the tools they need to defend our  Nation.   One last point that was mentioned by my colleague about having up-or- down votes on these nominations, that he would not hold that up. Well,  he is. He is requiring the break of a filibuster. What he is suggesting  is that he is not letting us have an up-or-down vote. That is what my  unanimous consent request would have allowed. My unanimous consent  request would have allowed us to have an up-or-down vote on the  nomination so we don't have to go through a cloture motion, which is  exactly what my colleague is suggesting we need to go through, in order  to vote on hundreds of these promotions within the military; that if we  followed the course he is suggesting, those plebes who are entering  this month at the Naval Academy will be in their second year before we  get around to voting on that nomination.   So for all those reasons, I regret that we are playing politics with  our military and affecting our ability to defend our Nation.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, Ella Winter famously remarked to  author Thomas Wolfe, ``Don't you know you can't go home again?'' The  remark, in abbreviated form, became the title of one of his most famous  books, published after he died. The two writers never met Martha D.  Nathanson, who grew up in Park Heights, went to Indiana University in  Bloomington to earn her bachelor's degree and J.D., and then returned  home and dedicated her life to making Baltimore a better, safer,  healthier, and happier place.   Martha is retiring from LifeBridge Health, where she has been  responsible for government relations, focusing on legislative and  regulatory policy at all three levels of government, covering all  aspects of healthcare delivery and community and economic development  in the areas surrounding all of LifeBridge Health's facilities,  including Sinai Hospital of Baltimore. Martha's expertise, political  skills, finesse, and natural ability as a community organizer have made  her a formidable force for bringing better healthcare and other vital  services to underserved communities, including Lower Park Heights. I  don't know whether LifeBridge's Northwest Hospital would be the  outstanding facility it is today without Martha's tireless advocacy.   Before Martha joined LifeBridge some 25 years ago, she was director  of risk management and legislative and regulatory affairs for Kirson  Medical Equipment Company, where she developed legal, regulatory, and  joint commission--JCAH--compliance programs and drafted and negotiated  contracts with providers. She also worked as an attorney advisor at the  Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services and as an associate attorney  at Ober Kaler in Baltimore. I have relied on and am grateful for  Martha's wise counsel on healthcare and community and economic  development issues in Baltimore over the years.   Martha's vocation and avocation are one and the same. In addition to  her professional career, she serves on the board of CHAI--Comprehensive  Housing Assistance, Inc.--served as chair of the Board of Park Heights  Renaissance and is a founding member of the Northwest Baltimore  Partnership. She also serves on the board of advisers of the University  of Maryland School of Social Work and the Safe Streets Community  Advisory Board. She has bought, renovated, and sold houses in her  neighborhood and is active in CREW Baltimore, which promotes the  business interests and professional advancement of women in all  disciplines of the commercial real estate industry by providing  educational and networking opportunities and contributing resources to  support the local community. Given all of this, it is no surprise that  Martha was named as one of Maryland's 100 Top Women by the ``Daily  Record'' in 2017.   We make a living by what we get; we make a life by what we give.  Martha Nathanson has given so much to her beloved hometown, and  Baltimore is so much better for her tireless efforts. Since she is not  the ``retiring'' kind, I know she will stay active in community  affairs. But now, she will have more time for biking and trekking and  environmental causes and, most important, for her family. I know that  she is especially ``over the moon'' about being a grandmother. I want  to thank her for her service and friendship and wish her all the best  as she begins the next chapter in a wonderful life of service.                            ____________________
