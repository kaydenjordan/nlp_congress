 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the Massillon  Tigers high school football team as Ohio's 13th Congressional District  champion of the week.   With a record-breaking season of 16-0, the Tigers won their first- ever Ohio High School Athletic Association Division 2 championship last  week.   In a repeat of the Massillon versus Archbishop Hoban High School,  another Ohio 13th District high school, playoff rivalry for the fifth  time in 6 years, the Tigers edged out their opponents with a hard- fought 7-2 victory.   More than 14,000 fans filled the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium to  cheer on the best of Ohio's 13th Congressional District, demonstrating  just how much this team and this championship mean to the entire  district.   This victory is a testament to the hard work and determination of  these exceptional student athletes both on the field and in the  classroom.   Once again, our phenomenal student athletes in Ohio's 13th  Congressional District are reaffirming our district's legacy as the  Birthplace of Champions and the City of Champions, which is the motto  of Massillon.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Massillon Tigers for their hard work,  and I hope they continue to dominate the world of sports one play at a  time.                            ____________________
