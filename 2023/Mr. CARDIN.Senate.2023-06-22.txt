 Mr. President, earlier this week, we commemorated the  158th Juneteenth, which celebrates the liberation of the last remaining  enslaved Black Americans at the end of the Civil War. On this date in  1865, U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in a Confederate  outpost in Galveston, TX, where he delivered the news to 250,000 still- enslaved Texans that all slaves were free.   Though President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in  1863, the final emancipation of African-American slaves was not reached  until 2 years later, with the end of the Civil War and then  ratification of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.  [[Page S2208]]    African-American communities have celebrated Juneteenth as  Emancipation Day as far back as 1886 in Texas, but it was not until  June 2021 that Congress voted to make Juneteenth a Federal holiday,  which President Biden signed into law.   Maryland has had its own complicated history when it comes to the  abolition of slavery. Indeed, President Lincoln limited the application  of the Emancipation Proclamation only to States that had seceded from  the Union during the Civil War. Maryland itself was divided on the  issue of slavery in the Civil War.   According to the 1860 census numbers taken before the Civil War,  Maryland's population contained almost an equal number of free and  enslaved African Americans. Slavery had deep roots in Southern Maryland  and Eastern Shore. As described by the University of Maryland historian  Ira Berlin, the ``Free State'' even saw cases of its own households  divided, where brothers were fighting in battle on different sides of  the Civil War.   Baltimore was growing into a center of trade and industry. It was  populated by a mostly free workforce, with one of the largest urban  populations of free Blacks in the United States, larger than in  Philadelphia or New York, Professor Berlin said. And it was the  political epicenter of the Maryland abolition movement, with a leading  newspaper, the Baltimore American, instrumental in the push to end  slavery.   But outside the city, in the vast agricultural areas of Southern  Maryland and the Eastern Shore, slavery was a way of life, much as it  was in the rest of the White South, where tobacco was giving way to  labor-intensive crops such as cotton, rice, and sugar.   Professor Berlin goes on to say:         Southern Maryland was certainly a southern state; it is       agriculture, plantations . . . in some ways it is not much       different from Mississippi, both in size and in their       lucrative nature. Slaveholders' determination to maintain       their human property was a crucial element in the white       southern culture.    Let me just go on and point out, other large swaths of Maryland, from  Prince George's to Montgomery County, north to Frederick and west, were  also pro-slavery, although Frederick itself was a divided community.   After the Civil War broke out, President Lincoln called for soldiers  to be raised from the militias of the States in order to put down the  insurrection. According to an account from the National Park Service:         These troops were to be transported to Washington, D.C., so       that they might protect the Capitol. At this time, the most       efficient means to transport such large numbers of men was by       rail, and the only routes to Washington passed through       Baltimore.        Marylanders were divided in their sympathies. While many       disliked the idea of secession, they felt that it was a       state's right to secede from the union if it chose to. Many       also felt that Maryland should not permit troops to pass       through the state to attack a sister state, and others       mistrusted the President's intentions, suspecting that the       troops would be used to force Maryland to remain in the       Union.        On April 19, 1861, only five days after the surrender of       Fort Sumter, the situation in Baltimore exploded into       violence. The 6th Massachusetts Infantry arrived at the       President Street Station and began the process of changing       trains. The cars were disconnected and pulled by horses down       Pratt Street to Camden Station. As the process continued, a       crowd gathered and with each moment it became more and more       unruly. All but two of the cars had been transferred when the       crowd blocked the tracks with timbers and anchors.        The two cars returned to the President Street Station and       the soldiers disembarked to the howls and jeers of the mob.       The troops then marched back down Pratt Street, led by a man       carrying a rebel flag, and followed by the mob. At Gay Street       some of the mob began tearing up paving stones and throwing       them at the soldiers. Other men were seen brandishing pistols       and muskets. Someone fired a shot.        The frightened officers ordered the troops to fire into the       crowd. This angered the mob further, and they began to attack       the soldiers with considerable ferocity. Citizens threw       stones and bricks and fired shots at the soldiers. The       soldiers returned the fire. Rioters, soldiers, and innocent       bystanders fell dead and wounded. The Mayor bravely attempted       to stop the battle without success. Then the police arrived.        [Baltimore police intervened and placed policemen] between       the two groups and escorted the troops to Camden Station,       where they boarded the train and left Baltimore. The Pratt       Street Riot was over. The riot resulted in the first casualty       list of the war. Eight rioters, one innocent bystander and       three soldiers were killed, twenty four soldiers and an       unknown number of civilians wounded.    The city of Baltimore was later placed under military rule, with  military positions strengthened in Federal Hill and Fort McHenry. As  you see, we had divided paths in our State and in Baltimore.   Maryland later very narrowly approved a constitutional amendment in  1864 which abolished slavery, by a vote of over 30,000 to just under  30,000. Soldiers voted both in person and by absentee ballot, but  Marylanders supporting or fighting for the Confederacy who would not  sign loyalty oaths were not permitted to vote. This amendment took  effect in November of 1864, just a few months before Congress proposed  the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in January of 1865, which was  ratified in December of 1865.   On a holiday that celebrates our fundamental right to life, liberty,  and the pursuit of happiness for all Americans, it is important to  remember that those rights have not and are not always applied equally  to every American. Redlining, health disparities, police brutality, and  other areas of disenfranchisement are relics of our Nation's original  sin and the Jim Crow laws that followed. These inequalities shape the  African-American experience today.   Celebrating Juneteenth, or Freedom Day, means not only celebrating  the victory but also understanding and reconciling with the hard  truths. This Freedom Day comes at a time when there have been targeted  attacks on facts and truth. Censoring textbooks, banning conversations  about race and gender, and misrepresenting the truth systematically  sanitizes our Nation's history.   As a society, we must stand together to resist hiding from the  darkest parts of our past. Confronting a difficult past and having an  uncomfortable conversation allows us to better address issues of  inequality head-on so we can move forward, creating a culture of  inclusion and belonging.   As we join the country in recognizing the importance of this  anniversary, we should also celebrate how far we have come. In my home  State of Maryland, for the first time ever, the first Black Governor,  the first Black attorney general, and the first Black speaker of the  house are all serving at the same time. The election of Vice President  Kamala Harris and the appointment of Supreme Court Justice Jackson show  that this country more broadly wants to see the diversity of America  reflected in the highest levels of government.   Embracing diversity is in the best interest of our country. It is how  we get landmark legislation like the Civil Rights Act, the Voting  Rights Act, and President Biden's historic Executive order to advance  effective, accountable policing and strengthen public safety.   My faith teaches me that we have a responsibility to make the world a  better place. That can only be done through civility, understanding,  and respecting each other. As we come together to participate in a  longstanding tradition of celebrating freedom, let us also celebrate  knowledge, hope, and continuing to work toward a more perfect Union and  a better future for every American as promised by the preamble to our  Constitution.
