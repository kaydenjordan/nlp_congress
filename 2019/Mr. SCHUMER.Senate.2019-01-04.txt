 Mr. President, on December 19, as Congress was preparing  to leave for the holidays, the Treasury Department notified Congress of  its intent to terminate within 30 days a set of Russia sanctions  imposed on En+ Group plc (``En+''), UC Rusal plc (``Rusal''), and JSC  EuroSibEnergo (``ESE''). Each of these firms were sanctioned because  they were owned or controlled by Oleg Deripaska, a notorious Russian  oligarch and trusted agent of Vladimir Putin. As Treasury noted when it  sanctioned him: ``Deripaska has been investigated for money laundering,  and accused of threatening the lives of business rivals, illegally  wiretapping a government official, and taking part in extortion and  racketeering. There are also allegations that Deripaska bribed a  government official, ordered the murder of a businessman, and had links  to a Russian organized crime group.''  [[Page S28]]    In its notification letter, Treasury argued it had secured an  agreement with Deripaska, the companies and other stakeholders involved  to significantly restructure the companies and make corporate  governance changes. Under the agreement, Deripaska will remain  sanctioned, and his property will remain blocked. The Treasury  Department proposes to remove the three firms, including the huge  Russian aluminum producer Rusal, from the sanctions list in the belief  that the agreement will effectively separate the companies from  Deripaska, eliminating his control over them and sharply limiting his  influence. The proposal also reportedly places limits on any family  members of Deripaska who are also significant investors in the  companies.   I noted in December that Treasury's decision raises critical  questions that the Administration must answer about whether the  structural and governance changes made by these companies are  sufficient to ensure that Deripaska is no longer directing or even  influencing these firms. I have also said that it remains to be seen  whether Treasury's approach can succeed in Putin's Russia. Serious  questions remain about whether Treasury can monitor and enforce the  agreement even with the monitoring mechanisms proposed.   The timing of Treasury's notice compressed an already tight 30-day  review timetable provided for in sanctions law, giving Congress until  January 17 to make its own independent assessment of whether it  adequately protects US economic and national security, especially with  respect to Russia. The Congressional review provisions of CAATSA were  designed for precisely this kind of circumstance. They were imposed by  Congress after serious questions had arisen about President Trump's  relationship with Russia. Members on both sides of the aisle wanted an  opportunity to independently assess the Administration's actions to  lift, terminate or issue licenses on Russia-related sanctions. Those  questions still linger, and have become even more pronounced in recent  days.   The formal review process is underway. The Banking and Foreign  Relations committees are assessing the terms of the agreement, and the  documents that have been provided by Treasury. But time is short, and  if we did not introduce a resolution today we would have been overtaken  by events, since any resolution must be pending in committee for ten  days before it is subject to discharge to the full Senate. So today I  am introducing such a resolution. I do so not because I have concluded  that Congress should act to disapprove this agreement--I have not made  that determination yet--but to preserve the procedural option of moving  to bring up such a resolution at the end of the review process, if  necessary, for expedited review and a vote by the full Senate.   I intend to consult with my colleagues on the Banking, Foreign  Relations, and Intelligence Committees, and others, before making a  judgment on whether to call for consideration, under expedited  procedures provided for in CAATSA, of this disapproval resolution. I  know my colleagues will carefully review the proposal, and I look  forward to hearing their conclusions once that assessment is complete.   I ask unanimous consent that the Treasury Department's report  provided pursuant to section 216 of CAATSA be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that       the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no       objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in       the Record, as follows:                                S.J. Res. 2         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress       disapproves of the action relating to the application of       sanctions imposed with respect to the Russian Federation       proposed by the President in the report submitted to Congress       under section 216(a)(1) of the Russia Sanctions Review Act of       2017 on December 19, 2018, relating to terminating sanctions       imposed on En+ Group plc (``En+''), UC Rusal plc (``Rusal''),       and JSC EuroSibEnergo (``ESE'').

Mr. President, as we near the third week of the Trump  shutdown, the impacts on the American people are getting worse with  each passing day. Nearly 400,000 Federal workers have now been  furloughed. Food safety inspectors, vital to our health and safety, are  working without pay and with limited resources. American farmers can't  get loans from the USDA. Working families trying to buy a home are  finding out their FHA loans are on hold.   I just heard from a constituent of mine in the capital region, near  Albany--a fire police dispatcher, whose wife is pregnant. They closed  on their first house, joyously, last week. But now their loan is  delayed until the government reopens. That story can be repeated over  and over again.   Our Federal courts are running out of money. Our national parks are  suffering; we have seen the piles of debris and garbage in these  beautiful places. Maybe most ironically of all, as the President is  talking about making the border more secure, his shutdown is making it  less secure. Border Patrol agents are going without pay. E-Verify is  offline. Immigration cases are on hold. New immigration judges are not  being hired. So with all the talk that the President has about making  the border more secure, the Trump shutdown is making it less secure.   We have provided a way for him to continue to debate this wall issue  but keep the government open. All of this means that we should be doing  everything we can to bring this Trump shutdown to a swift end.   My friend, the Republican leader, quoted me this morning. So let me  now quote my friend, the leader. He has said repeatedly: ``Nobody likes  a shutdown.''   Leader McConnell has shown himself to be an adept negotiator during  previous shutdowns. Why is he abdicating his responsibility now? Why is  Leader McConnell shuffling off to the sidelines, pointing his fingers  at everybody else, and saying that he will not be involved? Probably  because he realizes this President--President Trump--is erratic,  unreliable, and sometimes even irrational. In sum, President Trump is a  terrible negotiator.   Given the unfortunate traits that reside in our President, I  understand Leader McConnell's reluctance to get involved. But in truth,  they are all the more reason for him to get involved. America needs  Leader McConnell to get involved to stop this shutdown. He can't keep  ducking this issue.   Left to his own devices, President Trump can keep the government shut  down for a long time. The President needs intervention, and Leader  McConnell and Senate Republicans are just the right ones to intervene.   Fortunately, we have a way to end this shutdown with the help of our  Republican friends in the Senate. Last night, as expected, the House of  Representatives passed two pieces of legislation to end the Trump  shutdown--a six-bill package to provide appropriations for eight  shuttered Cabinet Departments and a 30-day continuing resolution for  the Department of Homeland Security. Both bills received bipartisan  support in the House.   The logic behind those two pieces of legislation is very simple. We  have disagreements on how to best secure the border. President Trump  wants an expensive and ineffective border wall. He promised that Mexico  would pay for it but now demands that American taxpayers should foot  the bill.   Democrats believe that a border wall is an obtuse public policy and  that we have much better, more effective, less wasteful ways of  securing the border.   We don't have to have eight unrelated Cabinet Departments closed  while we sort out our differences. We can reopen the 25 percent of the  government now closed and continue to debate our border security. That  is why we split the bills in two--one to reopen the government and  another to keep DHS running short term while discussions continue about  the border.   Neither piece of legislation should be controversial, and the House  majority--I give them credit and Leader Pelosi credit--went out of its  way to avoid controversy. They didn't send over a bill with lots of  poison pill riders, lots of things our colleagues here wouldn't like.  They sent the very bills that Republicans crafted and voted for. The  majority went out of its way to avoid controversy by choosing the  legislation crafted and supported by Republicans.   Let me emphasize that. The six appropriations bills passed by the  House last night are the same bills--the very same bills; they have not  changed a bit--that Republicans here in the Senate drafted--they were  in charge--and approved. Four of them passed this Chamber by more than  90 votes, and the other two passed nearly unanimously in committee.  Leader McConnell voted for every one of them and spoke glowingly about  their passage last year.   So there is nothing--I repeat, nothing--in the six appropriations  bills that Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans oppose. There is  nothing--absolutely nothing, I repeat--about a continuing resolution  for Homeland Security that now Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans  refuse to put on the floor--because that was Leader McConnell's idea.  He put it on the floor, and it passed the Chamber unanimously last  Christmas.   Now we are seeing some real cracks in the Republican wall. Some of my  friends in the Senate on the other side of the aisle in this body, to  their credit, are already saying that we should take up and pass these  two bills. Seven House Republicans, newly elected, under huge pressure  not to, voted with these bills. Every Democrat voted for the bill;  there is no dissension there. But a handful of Republicans did too.   It is time for Leader McConnell and President Trump, who is the  ultimate reason we have this shutdown--it is time for Leader McConnell  and President Trump to support this package of bipartisan legislation  and reopen the government.   In a short time, Speaker Pelosi and I will head to the White House to  meet with President Trump and congressional leaders about the  government shutdown. I will be joined by my very  [[Page S33]]  able colleague, Senator Durbin. Senator McConnell will be joined by  Senator Thune. Speaker Pelosi will be joined by Leader Hoyer and, of  course, Leaders McCarthy and Scalise will be there as well.   At the meeting, we Democrats hope to convince the President and  Leader McConnell to take up and pass the two House-passed bills, both  of which have already been approved by Senate Republicans. That is the  quickest, least controversial way out of the Trump shutdown. It  separates the fight on the wall from the government shutdown.   President Trump is holding hostage, using as leverage, hundreds of  thousands of Federal workers and millions and millions of other  Americans, like the gentleman and his spouse in Albany, who can't get  their FHA mortgage approved. That story, in many ways, can be repeated  over and over again.   So I say to my Republican friends: Don't let President Trump hold  hostage all of these fine people who have done nothing wrong  themselves. Don't let him use the government shutdown to try and get  his way. That is not how it should work, and that is not what is going  to happen.   Instead, let's reopen the government, start paying our food safety  inspectors, park Rangers, air traffic controllers, Federal courts, and  our Border Patrol agents, so they can do the work they are supposed to  do for the American people. All we have to do is take up legislation  that Senate Republicans already support.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
