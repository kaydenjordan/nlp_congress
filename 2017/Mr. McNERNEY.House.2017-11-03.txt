 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3922.   Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we authorize CHIP and community  health centers, but slashing essential public health funding is not the  right way to do it.   Treatment of chronic diseases accounts for 75 percent of our Nation's  healthcare spending, and many of these diseases can be prevented.  Unfortunately, H.R. 3922 does not do that at all. This bill cuts in  half the ACA Prevention and Public Health Fund that plays a critical  role in preventing and treating chronic diseases, including keeping  kids healthy.   The massive cuts to this funding will be devastating to my Central  Valley of California district. My district has the largest number of  tuberculosis cases in California for children under 5 years old.  Children in this age group are more likely to develop life-threatening  forms of TB since their immune systems are less mature. Public  officials in my district are relying on funding from the Prevention  Fund to address TB outbreaks.   It is troubling that Republicans are using CHIP reauthorization to  take core public health services away from kids. It is also  frustrating, but not surprising, that the Republicans are making  another attempt to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. This legislation  is robbing Paul to pay Peter, and I urge my colleagues to vote against  it.
