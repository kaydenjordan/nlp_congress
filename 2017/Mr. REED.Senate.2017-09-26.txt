 Mr. President, I wish to talk about the latest attempt from  my  [[Page S6109]]  colleagues on the other side of the aisle to upend our health care  system. They have been trying to sell this as a new and better health  care bill, but in fact they somehow have managed to come up with  something even worse than the previous TrumpCare bills. It would repeal  the Affordable Care Act, gutting key protections for people with  preexisting conditions and ending Medicaid as we know it.   I want to recognize some of my colleagues, however, on the other side  of the aisle who already stood up to this effort, because no matter how  many changes have been made to gain the support of Senators, this bill  would be devastating to every State, including my home State of Rhode  Island.   Senate Republicans are trying to hide the impact of the bill,  potentially forcing a vote before the nonpartisan Congressional Budget  Office is even able to publish a full score and analysis of the bill,  including estimates for how many people would lose coverage and how  healthcare costs would be affected.   Late yesterday, we received a preliminary estimate from CBO saying  that, similar to previous TrumpCare bills, this proposal would leave  millions more Americans without health insurance because of massive  cuts to Medicaid. We will not see a more detailed score for weeks. Yet  the majority is attempting to rush this through in order to use budget  rules that expire on Saturday that enable passage of this bill with  just 51 votes.   Fortunately, a number of nonpartisan organizations are publishing  data on the latest bill, and they all agree that this bill would have a  similar impact as the previous TrumpCare bills. Tens of millions of  Americans would lose coverage, State budgets would be decimated, and  costs would increase--especially for those with preexisting conditions,  who would be priced out of the market entirely. According to one of  these organizations, Avalere, Rhode Island is slated to lose $3 billion  by 2027, and the cuts only get worse from there. Medicaid would be cut  drastically, meaning our most vulnerable citizens would lose access to  health care, including children, people with disabilities, and seniors.   Over 60 percent of nursing home residents in Rhode Island access care  through Medicaid, and half of Medicaid spending is on these long-term  care services.   It would become impossible to protect these programs from the cuts  projected under this bill. In fact, States would be forced to cut not  only health care but also education and infrastructure and other  priorities to make up or try to make up--and I think ``try to make up''  are better words to use--the difference. This would be nothing short of  a crisis in every State in this country.   We have already spent so much time this year having this fight--time  we could have spent working across the aisle to improve health care, to  end sequestration, and to ensure a stable Federal budget to improve our  economy.   In fact, after the efforts to pass TrumpCare failed just 2 months  ago, Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Health, Education, Labor,  and Pensions Committee joined together in a bipartisan fashion to come  up with a bill that would improve our healthcare system and lower costs  for everyone. Significant progress on this effort has been made.   However, by resurrecting this TrumpCare debate, we are again on the  brink of voting on whether to kick millions of Americans off of their  health insurance. With this effort, Republicans are taking our health  care system hostage again, as deadlines approach this week for  finalizing insurance rates for the next year. Health insurance  commissioners and other experts have already said that the instability  in Washington has caused rates to increase. Yet my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle continue down this destructive path.   What is especially egregious is that in addition to the jettisoned  ACA stabilization efforts, we also need to extend funding for other  critical bipartisan health care priorities, such as the Children's  Health Insurance Program and the community health centers, whose  Federal funding expires in just a couple of days. In fact, the Chairman  and Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee had come to a  bipartisan agreement to extend funding for CHIP for 5 years, providing  stability and assurances for States and families across the country.  However, that work is now on hold, just like the critical ACA  stabilization effort.   We must continue to make our voices heard and show the majority that  this is not what the American people want. They want us to work  together to strengthen health care, increase access, and keep costs  down. The enormous outpouring of citizen opposition and health care  experts criticizing TrumpCare over the summer was a very powerful  statement about what the American people--my constituents and people  across the country--believe should be the path forward on health care.   As my colleagues work to make last-minute changes to the bill and  conceal the real impacts by refusing to hold substantive hearings and  rushing new versions of the bill to the floor with little or no  warning, my constituents are not fooled. They continue to write to me,  urging me to keep up the opposition to TrumpCare.   Just a week or two ago, I heard from Barbara in Middletown, RI. Her  mother has Alzheimer's diseases and relies on Medicaid for long-term  care. Her sister has Down syndrome and has recently been diagnosed with  Alzheimer's disease as well. She also relies on Medicaid for her health  care. This new proposal, just like the previous proposals, would be  devastating to Barbara and her family.   I urge my colleagues to really think about who would be impacted by  this legislation. Whether or not you like ObamaCare or voted for it 7  years ago, this latest TrumpCare bill is not the solution.   I will continue to oppose these efforts and hope to work with my  colleagues to improve our health care system and lower costs for  everybody.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
