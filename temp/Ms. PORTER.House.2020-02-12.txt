 Madam Speaker, when Donald Trump was running for  President, he promised that he would balance the budget, eliminate the  national debt, and protect programs that support American families.   He continues to promise to balance the budget, but his latest math is  based on fantasy. The President's budget cuts the programs that  Americans rely on and those that Americans have invested in in order to  fund more tax cuts for the wealthy, a bigger defense budget, and an  ineffective border wall.   If it isn't clear yet, the President failed to be truthful. He is  putting special interests above the health and safety of hardworking  American families.   Our national debt is bigger than ever, and taxpayer dollars have been  wasted paying for tax cuts that benefit the rich and powerful.   Here is the stone-cold truth: President Trump is reneging on his  promise to protect older Americans and those with disabilities. His  proposed budget cuts billions from Social Security and Medicare. These  drastic cuts and his failure to keep his word will devastate millions  of Americans.    Social Security has lifted millions of older Americans out of  poverty, but the President doesn't think it is necessary to continue  supporting our most vulnerable older Americans.   The President would also slash the budget for the Administration for  Community Living. Americans need this agency to support those who are  aging and those who have disabilities, as well as their caregivers, so  that they can age in place and live their best life every day of their  lives. I have heard countless times from Orange County residents that  they want the choice to grow older in their homes in our beautiful  community that they have spent much of their lives in. The President's  budget takes these choices away.   Right now, our country is struggling to keep up with our global  competitors. And apparently right now the President thinks this is a  good time to gut funding for medical research and innovation.   The President wants to cut investments in medical research at the  National Institutes of Health that provide the pipeline for new cures  and that spur innovation.   The President wants to cut funding for the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention, the Health Resources and Services  Administration, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration. These agencies ensure that there are qualified health  professionals who can move new medical discoveries into healthcare and  public-health delivery, support Americans while they are awaiting new  [[Page H1115]]  cures, and prevent them from getting sick in the first place.   The President also wants to cut funding for the Food and Drug  Administration and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.  Americans need the Food and Drug Administration to approve new, safe,  and effective treatments and the Agency for Healthcare Research and  Quality to provide evidence on what treatments work best, for whom, and  in what circumstances.   If you follow the President's budget proposals over his years in  office, Madam Speaker, you know that this is a pattern that just keeps  repeating, because the President doesn't care about securing healthcare  for older Americans, for children, or for everyday Americans, he  doesn't care about ensuring that older Americans have a secure and  comfortable retirement. He doesn't care that millions of Americans  depend on these programs to survive.   The cuts as proposed are untenable for America's health and are a  radical change from how we funded these programs in decades past.   It is my responsibility as a Representative to provide Federal  funding in 2021 that aligns with our core values as a nation and that  supports the American people, and I promise to put Orange County  families first. Unlike the President, I will never break this  longstanding promise to my constituents.   The President's budget shows willful ignorance of the climate crisis  that is threatening our country's natural resources, our communities'  health, and our global prosperity. He proposes cuts to environmental  protection programs that would only further exacerbate the worst  effects of the climate change. Countries around the world are  experiencing their warmest winters in history. Antarctica saw  temperatures of 65 degrees for the first time in history.   We have watched Australia and the rain forests burn. We have watched  our home State of California burn. We have seen communities devastated  by hurricanes and other adverse weather caused by climate change. The  President's proposed budget would slash the budget for the  Environmental Protection Agency by 26 percent and cut in half funding  for energy research and development. This would gut critical programs  like the Land & Water Conservation Fund and tax credits for electric  vehicles by millions of dollars each.   People are dying, entire species are on the verge of extinction, and  communities have been destroyed; but the President wants to devastate  bipartisan programs established to protect our natural resources, our  communities, and our planet.   Who is this budget for?   Who are these proposals for?   The oil industry, special interests, and the few in this world who  gain more from harming our planet than from supporting it. This budget  is not for Californians, and it is not for Orange County families.   As a mother of three, I fear for the world my children will grow up  in, and I cannot stand by and let this President destroy programs that  would protect it.   On the topic of our children's future, I am disgusted by the  President's decision to cut funding for public education while  providing yet another tax break for the wealthy and largest  corporations. The President's proposal is an outright attack on our  public schools which are a real point of pride in the 45th  Congressional District.   To make matters worse, the budget would make higher education less  affordable and less accessible than it already is for too many  students. The budget makes a $170 billion cut to student loan programs  over the next 10 years.   What does this mean for our college students?   Increased costs for new students because subsidized student loans  would be eliminated, difficulty getting jobs on campus because of cuts  to funding for Federal workstudy, and difficulty repaying loans because  of the elimination of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. This  program is based on a simple premise that dedicating yourself to making  this country better by responding to emergencies, by educating our  students, and by providing care for the sick is an honorable and deeply  needed service.   These are just some of the many professions performed by those who  pursue a career in the public sector. By eliminating the Public Service  Loan Forgiveness Program, the President breaks our promise to our first  responders, our teachers, and our nurses. These borrowers have  tirelessly committed themselves to improving our communities, and we  must keep our commitment to them.    Despite being in the middle of a historic affordable housing crisis  which we feel acutely in Orange County, President Trump wants to make  dramatic cuts to the housing and community development programs that  serve those in need. The proposal slashes funding for the Department of  Housing and Urban Development by 15 percent. That is $8.6 billion. That  money is coming out of essential housing assistance programs that lift  up our communities. In a State like California where the affordable  housing crisis hits especially hard, these cuts will hurt thousands of  families who rely on them to make ends meet.   In California, a minimum wage worker would have to work 116 hours a  week to afford a two-bedroom apartment or have the good fortune to find  a job that pays $35 an hour. But in my district of Orange County, make  that $39 per hour, or $80,000 per year. The median cost for a single- family home in Orange County is over $800,000.   Do we want to live in a country where only millionaires can afford  shelter?   Until we address the severe lack of affordable housing in America, we  will need programs like community block grants and the HOME Investment  Partnerships Program to help families. Those funds support affordable  housing for low- and moderate-income families, and the President's  budget completely eliminates them. His proposal would, quite literally,  leave families out in the cold. Taking a chunk out of HUD's budget when  home and rental prices are hitting new highs across the country is  irresponsible and, frankly, cruel.   President Trump says he is for our business owners, but he clearly  means mega corporations--Big Oil, Big Pharma, and Wall Street banks-- because his budget eliminates funding for the Economic Development  Administration's grant program, and it cuts the Small Business  Administration by 11 percent. This budget would harm U.S. innovation  and growth and hurt small business owners who are the backbone of our  economy.   President Trump also wants to cut our foreign aid budget by over 20  percent. That money is about keeping Americans safe and keeping us out  of never-ending wars. Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  Admiral Mike Mullen, raised similar concerns earlier this week: ``The  more we cut the international affairs budget, the higher the risk for  longer and deadlier military operations.''   The President's budget puts Americans and our military at risk,  rather than funding foreign aid that keeps us safe and secure.   We have a responsibility as elected officials to be good stewards of  working Americans' hard-earned dollars, and that means funding programs  to get families the help that they need, programs that invest in our  children, and priorities that keep us safe. Giveaways to special  interests and wasted dollars on proposals not grounded in evidence are  slaps in the face of our hardworking taxpayers.   If this budget is a reflection of the President's values and of his  goals and vision for our country, then I am afraid of what policies may  come out of this White House next.   I constantly seek opportunities to work with my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle, and I look for chances to work with this  President as well. But I cannot and I will not support gutting the  programs that serve our families and our communities.   It is Congress' responsibility to make sure that we spend taxpayer  dollars wisely on programs that support economic growth rather than  things that line the pockets of special interests and hurt our future.   Congress was given the power of the purse as part of a system of  checks and balances on the President's power, and it is our  responsibility on both sides of the aisle to fight for a real budget  grounded in our values and a budget that works for the families and the  American people that we represent.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).  [[Page H1116]]                                     time  1730     Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Costa).    Madam Speaker, the administration's Muslim ban has ripped  families apart. Orange County families have endured this Muslim ban for  3 long years; yet, the President has doubled down, making it so much  worse.   Make no mistake, this policy is based on hate. It is based upon  dividing us with fear.   President Trump showed hostility to Muslims during his campaign. He  called for a ``total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the  United States.''   Just 7 days into office, the President signed the first version of  the Muslim ban. This was never about national security. It was about  anti-Muslim hate and discrimination.   The families in my community, as well as families across the United  States, are suffering. Families in my district are being torn apart by  the ban. It is separating husbands from wives, mothers from children,  and adults from their dying parents.   Let me be clear: No individual or family should be discriminated  against based on their religious beliefs. It is why I backed the  Freedom of Religion Act, which would prohibit religious discrimination  in our immigration system and protect Americans of all faiths--not just  Muslim Americans.   I am proud that so many Americans have stood together to protest the  administration's Muslim ban, to push back and to vote in  Representatives like me who will fight discrimination.   Today, because the American people made their voices heard, the House  of Representatives began the process to repeal this shameful ban. I am  proud to be a backer of that legislation, the NO BAN Act, and I will  always support and celebrate the vibrant Muslim community in Orange  County.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
