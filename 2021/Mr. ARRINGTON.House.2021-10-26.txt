 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of a  remarkable young man named Luke Siegel, who inspired so many with his  strength of spirit and will to live in the face of tremendous  adversity.   On July 28 of 2015, Luke suffered severe brain damage as a result of  a tragic golf cart accident that changed his life forever and left him  immobile, lifeless, and even without the ability to speak. Doctors  said, Madam Speaker, that he would stay in that condition as long as he  lived.   But, through the love and support of his family, the prayers of our  wonderful community, and the relentless and tenacious fight that Luke  brought every day, he defied all odds and the diagnoses of numerous  doctors, recovering to a life no one believed was possible.   Sadly, on August 19, our hero and west Texas warrior, Luke Siegel,  went home to be with his Heavenly Father. Luke is survived by one  amazing family: father, Tim; mother, Jenny; and sisters Alex, Kate, and  Ellie.   Madam Speaker, Luke never gave up. He was a symbol of hope for people  throughout the country whose families have struggled with the  challenges of traumatic brain injury. Luke is an inspiration to us all  to live every day to the fullest and never give up no matter what the  circumstances.   I am confident that Luke Siegel heard those beautiful and sweet words  of our creator and Lord of heaven and Earth.   Madam Speaker, Luke fought the good fight, he finished the race, and  he kept the faith. May Luke enter into his eternal rest. God bless Luke  Siegel, coach, your family, and God bless west Texas.                           Recognizing Nancy Liles     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  accomplishments of an outstanding lady, Nancy Liles, who recently  retired after an illustrious 36-year career as executive director of  the Abilene Convention and Visitors Bureau.   Ms. Liles' passion for hospitality embodies the spirit of west Texas  and has made Abilene a thriving tourist destination where visitors feel  right at home.   West Texas is known for its friendliness and hospitality, and Ms.  Liles has exemplified these attributes in her service to our community  and the Key City.   Abilene, Texas, is a warmer and more welcoming place because of the  leadership and service of Nancy Liles. We wish Nancy well as she spends  more time with her family and continues to be a champion for the Big  Country in Abilene, America. God bless, and go west Texas.                         Recognizing Mindy Patterson     Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize an outstanding west  Texan, Ms. Mindy Patterson.   Mindy has served the city of Abilene for three decades, from her  start as an entry-level accountant to her current position of deputy  city manager.   This year marks her 30th year of service for the city of Abilene, and  her colleagues know her as a servant leader and a tireless worker who  will do anything for her beloved community.   The city manager, Robert Hanna, describes Ms. Patterson as somebody  who is, ``simply indispensable to my leadership team.''   I am grateful to Ms. Patterson for her service to Abilene and look  forward to even more successes from her in the future and for our great  city and community.   God bless Ms. Patterson, who is keeping the wheels turning out in  west Texas. And go west Texas.                            ____________________
