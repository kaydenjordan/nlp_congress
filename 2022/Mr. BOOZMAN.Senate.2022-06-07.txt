 Mr. President, I rise to recognize Colonel Leland  ``Tony'' Shepherd on his selection as Arkansas Army National Guard's  6th Land Component commander and his promotion to the rank of brigadier  general on June 5, 2022.   On June 12, 2022, General Shepherd will assume command of Arkansas  Army's eight land power units with a force size of 6,700 personnel  tasked with operational readiness, training, mobilization, and  deployments supporting my great State and in defense of an even greater  Nation. This historical selection makes him the first African-American  man to hold such a prestigious position and only the second African- American man to be promoted as a general officer in the history of the  Arkansas National Guard.   General Shepherd began his military career in the U.S. Army Reserve  in Philadelphia, PA, on July 23, 1992. He then transitioned to the  Arkansas Army National Guard as an enlisted soldier in October 1995 and  was commissioned to second lieutenant in August 1998. General Shepherd  has served in several positions over the past 27 years, including  assignments as a signal officer in the 212th Signal Battalion in Little  Rock and as part of the 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team in Malvern,  AR. General Shepherd also deployed twice to Iraq where he oversaw Camp  Victory's post signal capabilities. Prior to this selection for the 6th  Land Component Command, he served as the State's deputy chief of staff  G-6 overseeing the planning, strategy, network architecture, and  implementation of command, control, communications, and networks for  Army operations.   General Shepherd received the Order of Mercury, Bronze for the  highest standards of integrity, moral character, professional  competence, and selflessness for those who have made significant  contributions to the U.S. Army Signal Corps. This award reflects his  superior performance and devotion to duty throughout his entire  professional career.   I would like to recognize General Shephard's wife Zandral and  children Anthony, Ryan Wells, Logan, and Lukas for their sacrifice and  service. It is their steadfast support of their husband and dad that  enabled his continued service, ultimately leading to this historic  promotion. As the son of George and Gwendoline Shepherd of Guyana,  South America, General Shepherd is the epitome of the American dream  which is founded on the belief that we all can attain our own version  of success and achieve prosperity through hard work.   General Shepherd, congratulations on this new chapter in your career.  I join my colleagues in the Senate and all Arkansans as we express our  appreciation for you and your family's continued service to our  country.                            ____________________
