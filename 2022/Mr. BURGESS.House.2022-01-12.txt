 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, this bill we got in short order tonight does not  reflect the actual text, and once again, the Rules Committee had very  short notice to consider the text without really any chance of being  able to read it. Certainly, we are now on the floor with no chance to  amend it.   It is supposed to be a NASA-focused bill, but it is actually a Trojan  horse, a Trojan horse the Democrats are using to drastically change  election law and do it without any input from Republicans, no input in  the Rules Committee, no input here on the floor, and no chance to amend  it in the House Administration Committee.   It is a messaging bill from Democrats to get a bill quickly passed in  the Senate while they have an agreement. We saw how difficult their  chaotic attempts to pass Build Back Better became and how that bill  eventually failed.   It is ridiculous that such large changes to longstanding law would  happen approaching the middle of the night when the American people  likely won't realize until after the fact what we have done. And that  could be no surprise.   Does anybody really think the American people voted for 8 percent  inflation, for gas lines, for gas at over $4 a gallon, and for a  chaotic foreign policy that has caused the death of many of our allies  and many of our servicemen as the exit from Afghanistan showed?   No. No one voted for that. Yet we are told that there is no problem,  that we will just push ahead and we are going to get this done.   We have a lot of issues that we could face, that Americans are facing  right now. There is no oversight of the COVID relief bills amid  reporting of waste and abuse. Inflation is sky-high; grocery shelves  are empty; and the crisis continues on our southern border.                                time  2200    Congress has provided over $5 trillion in coronavirus relief funds,  but no oversight. Billions of dollars remain unspent, and inflation is  at its highest level in decades.   Right before Christmas the President said everybody ought to get a  COVID test and, by golly, he would make them available. They are not  available today. I went online and ordered some because I thought, this  may be important. I received them 2\1/2\ weeks later. Of course, I paid  for them. These weren't free from the government.   But there aren't enough COVID tests, and the hospitals and healthcare  facilities are on life support.   What is our administration doing? What is our Democratic leadership  in Congress doing? Nothing.   Our response should not be so uncoordinated and ineffective going  into the third year of this pandemic. And let me just point out, we  have not had a single hearing in the Energy and Commerce Committee,  where we have jurisdiction over this, on this very issue.   Another national crisis are the hundreds of thousands of migrants  pouring over our southern border since President Biden took office and  declared an open border. Our frontline border officials are overwhelmed  and under-resourced. The open now sign remains on.   And even more concerning, we require our Federal agents to take a  vaccine. It is a mandated vaccine. And yet, the people coming in, it is  voluntary. We will give them a vaccine if they would like, but of  course, they don't have to take it.   And I will tell you, being down in El Paso last week, it is all about  getting these kids in the ORR facility, getting them pushed through and  getting them placed with families. The average length of stay now at  Fort Bliss is down to 12 days. That means no background check.   What are you going to do when the stories start emerging about how  these children have been misplaced and abused in the locations that we  now--the government--are sending them? We are providing the last mile  to the cartels' business.   These crises remain unresolved. Congress could work on these. We are  supposed to do that. We are the people's Representatives, and yet we  spend our time in the middle of the night doing something that will  never become law.
