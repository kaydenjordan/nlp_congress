 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding the time  and for managing it.   This is very important. We take 1 week a year to acknowledge the  importance of the Bible in America. The Bible was at the foundation of  the great awakening in the first half of the 1700s, the second great  awakening in the first half of the 1800s, the 1700s. Many attribute  that to leading to the liberty that drove the Revolution.   The second great awakening leading to the desire for liberty that  brought a war that ended slavery, no country had ever done that before.  Fight a war? Lose 500,000, 600,000, 700,000 people in a war that would  free people who were called slaves at the time?   It took this Bible at the basis of an ordained Christian minister  named Dr. King fighting for civil rights that brought us more freedom,  that brought the Constitution into a fuller embrace of what this  country is supposed to be about.   C.S. Lewis talked about in this world, as the Bible teaches, that the  prince of this world is not God. But Lewis said imagine being behind  enemy lines and you get messages from your home headquarters, and you  don't pick them up and read them. Well, we have a book of messages from  our home headquarters. You don't have to believe that. We have the  freedom to believe or not to believe so long as we don't run this out  of American society.   This has to be the basis of morality. Otherwise, we lose the rights  that are afforded us under our Constitution.
