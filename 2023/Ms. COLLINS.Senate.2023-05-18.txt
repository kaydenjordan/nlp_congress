 Madam President, I rise today to introduce the STEM  Education in Accounting Act, which would help address workforce  shortages in the accounting profession by recognizing accounting as  part of a STEM education and adding accounting education programs as an  allowable use of K-12 Federal grant funding. I want to thank Senator  Rosen for coleading this bill with me.   Accountants play a key role in today's economy. They serve as trusted  advisers for companies large and small, assist in measuring business  performance, help individuals and businesses file their taxes in an  accurate and timely manner, and even investigate instances of financial  fraud. Yet, the United States is facing a shortage of accountants  willing and able to fill this important economic role. In Maine, for  example, municipalities have struggled to find public accountants to  conduct their annual audits.   Recent trends suggest this shortage will continue. According to the  Bureau of Labor Statistics, job openings for accountants and auditors  are expected to grow by 6 percent from 2021 to 2031--about 136,400  openings each year. At the same time, fewer students are pursuing  accounting degrees than in prior years.   The STEM Education in Accounting Act seeks to improve the accounting  pipeline by expanding K-12 students' exposure to accounting programs.  As with other areas of STEM education, this bill would qualify  accounting instruction for Federal funds. This recognition aligns with  the increasing need for accounting professionals to have high-level  math and technology skills, including the ability to analyze big data,  ensure data security, and manage cybersecurity risk.   In particular, this bill would allow States and school districts to  use a portion of their Federal student support and academic enrichment  grant funding to support accounting education, including accounting  career awareness. The Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grant  Program was created as part of the Every Student Succeeds Act and aims  to help States and school districts offer a well-rounded educational  experience to all students. The STEM Education in Accounting Act would  also allow school districts to use this flexible grant to strengthen  accounting curricula, including increasing access to high-quality  accounting courses for members of groups underrepresented in the  accounting profession.   Businesses and individuals rely on accountants to help them develop  and reach their financial goals. The STEM Education in Accounting Act  would help address the shortage of accountants by promoting accounting  education and improving the pipeline of future accountants. I encourage  my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Shaheen, and          Mr. Kelly):   S. 1735. A bill to amend the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act  of 2002 to improve assistance to community wood facilities, and for  other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and  Forestry.
