 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the service of  Francisco Sandoval, a Fullerton educator honored as one of Orange  County's Teachers of the Year.   Francisco began teaching at the Orangethorpe Elementary School over  10 years ago, where his students have ranged from kindergarten through  sixth grade. He teaches with the belief that each and every student has  their own set of strengths and the ability to succeed.   For Francisco, he is both an educator and caregiver for each and  every one of his students. He begins every day by checking with his  students on a one-to-one basis to ensure that they are doing well both  in school and at home.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Francisco for the job he's done for each and  every one of our students and for our community as a whole. We  congratulate Francisco on being named as one of Orange County's  Teachers of the Year.                            ____________________
