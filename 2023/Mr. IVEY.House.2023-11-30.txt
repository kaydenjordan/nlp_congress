 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on this solemn occasion to urge  my colleagues to take the rare step of exercising the expulsion clause  of the United States Constitution.   Congressman George Santos has failed to uphold the principles of  scrupulous, selfless public service. He has violated the law and he has  violated this body's ethics rules.   As a member of the Ethics Committee, I can report that the evidence  against him is substantial and damning. I can also report that there  was no rush to judgment.   During the course of our investigation, the Ethics Committee  authorized 37 subpoenas, issued 43 requests for information, obtained  and reviewed over 172,000 pages of documents, interviewed over 40  witnesses, and reviewed relevant public information, including the  Federal indictments in the criminal case in New York.   Our bipartisan investigation revealed that he laundered $50,000 of  his campaign donors' money through two personal accounts and spent it  on himself on designer clothes, a car payment, a credit card, and  personal debts.    He cheated the government out of $24,000 in unemployment benefits  during the pandemic when he was earning a salary of $120,000 from an  investment firm.   He lied and said he loaned his unsuccessful campaign for Congress  over $80,000, and repaid himself for the fictitious loan, netting a  personal profit of $27,000.   In the second--this time successful campaign for Congress--he lied  again, this time to the tune of $500,000.   He also transferred and hid from the FEC a sum of $50,000 from his  congressional campaign to his State Political Action Committee. He  spent over $40,000 of campaign funds on personal expenses, like  expensive travel and meals, casino stays, an adult website, and  cosmetic procedures, personally enriching himself at his donors'  expense--all of this on top of his constant lying about his resume and  his family history.   There are charges of fraud, identity theft, credit card skimming, and  swindling a disabled veteran.   In short, the evidence of criminal and ethical violations is  extensive and overwhelming.   Mr. Santos has complained that he has not received due process. He  also suggested that he was unaware of the fraud and misconduct,  apparently trying to shift the blame to his treasurer and others.   Mr. Santos worked closely with his treasurer, who pled guilty just  last month to her role in this scheme. The text messages they exchanged  about the fake loans show that he was a knowing and active participant  in the misconduct.   The campaign staffers we interviewed as part of our investigation  also made clear that he was certainly aware of the campaign's financial  abuses.  [[Page H5996]]    In addition, his campaign consultants gave him a 141-page  vulnerability report that detailed many of his frauds and lies. They  demanded that he drop out of the race. When he refused--just like he is  doing today--three of his staffers quit in protest.   The Ethics Committee also offered Mr. Santos a chance to meet with us  for an interview or deposition to explain his side. He has done  countless interviews and gave a press conference just a few feet from  here earlier this morning, but somehow he never found time to meet with  us. Somehow he never even tried to offer a plausible explanation for  his conduct. In fact, all he said today was that he would address our  report at a later time.   He said something over the weekend that stuck with me. He said he  would wear expulsion as a badge of honor. When all this is over, I am  afraid he won't be wearing a badge of honor, he will be wearing an  orange jumpsuit.   This is a historic moment. The House has only expelled five Members  in our entire history.   The Constitution is clear that we don't have to wait until Mr. Santos  is remanded to the Bureau of Prisons before we can vote to expel him  from the House of Representatives.   The Constitution is also clear in the safeguards it provides to  ensure that the power to expel a duly elected Member was not abused.  The Framers--in their wisdom--set the high bar of a two-thirds vote.   Unlike some of the rushed motions to censure that we have seen here  on this floor just in the past year, Mr. Santos received a full and  extensive investigation, and a detailed report from the Ethics  Committee. The evidence of criminal and ethical misconduct is  extensive, overwhelming, and undisputed.   Finally, the Ethics Committee's investigation and report was  bipartisan, and its findings were unanimous.   Given all of these safeguards and all of this evidence, now is the  time to hold Mr. Santos accountable. Now is the time to show the  American people that we can hold ourselves to at least a minimal  standard of conduct. Now is the time to vote to expel George Santos  from the United States House of Representatives.                            ____________________
