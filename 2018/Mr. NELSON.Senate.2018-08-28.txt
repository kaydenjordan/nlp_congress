 Mr. President, when you walk by Senator McCain's desk and  see the black drape and the bowl of white roses, it really underscores  the loss. We lost a colleague. We lost a friend. The country lost a  true public servant.   We have heard the stories. After being shot down, spending all those  years in the Hanoi Hilton, beaten nearly to death when he was fished  out of the lake in downtown Hanoi, he continued to serve his country-- in the Navy, in Congress, in this Senate, and, of course, as the  party's nominee for President.   His call to serve and his sense of duty and honor is the legacy of  John McCain. He is an example for all of us.   He was a fighter, and he was funny too. Maybe it was the years in  prison or the long line of military service or the sometimes tense  humor of fighter pilots. Maybe it was that legacy of his family in the  military, but he knew in his soul how special the United States was and  what the United States could do for its people and for the world.   Sometimes we forget the stories of the excruciating pain that Senator  McCain went through as a POW. In 2000 David Foster Wallace, in Rolling  Stone magazine, wrote an article. I want to give you some of the  graphic details after he had been nearly beaten to death and his weight  had gone down to 100 pounds. When they found out that his father was a  four-star admiral and his grandfather was a four-star admiral, they  decided they were going to offer him early release. This is what the  author writes:         McCain, 100 pounds and barely able to stand, refused       [release]. The U.S. military's Code of Conduct for Prisoners       of War said that POWs had to be released in the order they       were captured, and there were others who'd been in [that       prison] Hoa Lo a long time, and McCain refused to violate the       Code. The commandant, not pleased, right there in the office       had guards break his ribs, rebreak his arm, knock his teeth       out. McCain still refused to leave without the other POWs.       And so then he spent four more years in Hoa Lo [prison] like       this, much of the time in solitary, in the dark, in a closet-      sized box called a ``punishment cell.'' Maybe you've heard       all this before . . . [there have certainly been] profiles of       John McCain. But try to imagine the moment between getting       offered early release and turning it down. Try to imagine it       was you. Imagine how loudly your most basic, primal self-      interest would have cried out to you in that moment, and all       the ways you could rationalize accepting the [commandant's]       offer. Can you hear it? If so, would you refuse to go? You       simply can't know for sure. None of us can. It's hard to even       imagine the pain and the fear in that moment, much less how       you'd react.    That was written 18 years ago about John. In that moment, you could  summarize his courage, his strength, and his will to overcome. But here  in the Senate we saw a leader who thought that public service was a  noble calling,  [[Page S5967]]  a leader who always tried to do the right thing, who always put the  people of his country ahead of himself--an individual who always  believed that we, as Americans, can subscribe to a cause greater than  ourselves.   America is certainly going to miss John McCain. For this Senator and  for Grace, as well, it was certainly a privilege to know the McCains  and to look up to him as a role model, not only for this Senator but  for the entire country.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I voted yea on the confirmation of  Lynn Johnson of Colorado to lead the Administration for Children and  Families under the Department of Health and Human Services. As the head  of the agency that oversees the Office of Refugee Resettlement, Mrs.  Johnson now faces the daunting and critically important task of  overseeing the ongoing reunification of hundreds of children and  parents who were forcibly and cruelly separated by this administration  at the southern border.   This nightmare is far from over. As of today, hundreds of children  have still not been reunified with their families. According to  information I received from the Department of Health and Human Services  yesterday, 43 of these children are being held in facilities in my home  State of Florida. I am outraged at the slow pace of reunification, and  I am furious that these children are still being subjected to the  unimaginable trauma of separation at the hands of our government.   I conveyed these serious concerns to Mrs. Johnson when I met with her  last month. It is my hope that she understands the gravity of the  situation she has now inherited. I expect her to immediately put  forward a plan to reunify all remaining separated children with their  families and to ensure that these children are treated humanely while  they are held in facilities that she now oversees. I will continue to  monitor this crisis, and I will continue to hold this administration  accountable for its policies.                            ____________________
