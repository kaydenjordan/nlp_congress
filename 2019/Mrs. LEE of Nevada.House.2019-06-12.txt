 Madam Chairwoman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Chairwoman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Chairwoman, our amendment would provide an increase in funds  for graduate medical education.   Just today, the Commonwealth Fund rated my home State of Nevada as  the 48th State, overall, for healthcare performance. We trail the vast  majority of States in access, affordability, and use of preventive  care. Preventable hospitalizations are up, and adults with a regular  doctor are down.   Our amendment would invest in graduate medical education slots,  expanding access for Nevadans to get a primary care doctor or family  physician.   I am grateful for the help of Chairwoman DeLauro on this amendment,  as well as Congresswoman Porter for cosponsoring it with me.   Madam Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support the amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I again thank Chairwoman DeLauro for  helping with this amendment, and I urge all of my colleagues to support  it.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
