 I reserve the right to object, Mr. President.   Let me just clarify. I think the ranking member of the Committee, who  is managing the bill, also wanted some time. Is that correct?    All right.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, a lot of our colleagues on the other side  have come to the floor today and have talked about why they don't like  our tax reform bill. Many of those arguments have been focused on who  benefits from it. Of course, as is usually the case when you start  talking about any kind of an attempt to reduce taxes on the American  people so they can keep more of what they earn, keep more dollars in  their pockets so they can decide how to spend it rather than send it to  Washington, DC, Democrats complain that it is tax cuts for the rich.   Well, again, I want to point out--and this, of course, is based upon  the Joint Committee on Taxation, which was just alluded to--where they  find the benefits of the tax relief goal. As you can see from this  chart, these represent different income groups. The highest percentage  tax cuts actually go to those in the lower and middle-income groups. If  you look at who benefits from this, every income group gets a  significant tax cut, but middle-income Americans do particularly well  percentagewise under this tax reform proposal.   So the argument, again, that this is somehow simply a tax cut for the  rich just doesn't pass the smell test. It doesn't comport with reality.  Clearly, the numbers tell a very different story.   The other point I wish to make is that if we look at what we tried to  accomplish in the design of this tax bill, we see that we tried to  maintain the existing progressivity in the tax bill. We have one of the  most progressive tax codes in the world. We have a lot of people in  this country who don't have any income tax liability and some who  benefit from refundable tax credits that help to eliminate or partially  eliminate their payroll tax liability as well. But this chart shows  who, under our bill, when it is all said and done, bears the tax burden  in this country--in other words, the percentage of the tax liability  paid by each different group in different income groups.   When we look at this, we can see that those in the $20,000 to $50,000  range--this is their tax burden as a percentage of the entire tax  burden levied on Americans around the country--the rate drops from 4.3  percent to 4.1 percent. So those in the $20,000 to $50,000 income  group, as a percentage of tax burden in the country, pay less under our  proposal than they do today.   If we look at the group from $50,000 to $100,000, that income group  also, as a percentage of the entire tax burden borne by Americans, pays  less under our proposal than they do today. They pay 16.9 percent  today, and under our proposal they will pay 16.7 percent of total taxes  in this country.   Those, on the other hand, making $100,000 or more will pay slightly  more of the overall tax burden. Today they pay 78.7 percent, and under  our proposal they will pay 78.9 percent.   So people under $100,000 are going to be paying less as a share of  the overall tax burden than they currently do today. I don't know how  anyone can, with a straight face, argue that somehow this is a tax bill  that benefits those in the upper end.   With respect to the arguments that are being made right now regarding  the Joint Committee on Taxation release of the dynamic score, I would  say the same thing that my colleague from Texas said. I think the good  news in all of this is what it demonstrates is that what we are trying  to do actually generates economic growth. It actually generates  additional revenue for the Federal Treasury. We can argue about how  much.  [[Page S7535]]    We happen to think that the assumptions used by the Joint Committee  on Taxation are not accurate because they assume that we are going to  continue to grow for the next decade--our economy--at 1.9 percent.  Historical averages in the American economy going back to the end of  World War II show that we have averaged somewhere between 3 and 3.5  percent growth. So if we take the assumption that we are never going to  do any better than 1.9 percent growth in the economy, then perhaps  their estimate could be accurate. We happen to believe we are going to  do a whole lot better than that. We believe that if we put the right  policies in place and we make America an attractive place in which to  invest, we are going to see considerably higher growth than 1.9  percent.   So what does it take to cover the number that we created in this tax  bill that would have to be paid for with additional growth in the  economy? Well, it takes about four-tenths of 1 percent of growth-- increase in average annual growth--over the next decade. What does that  mean? That means that instead of growing at 1.9 percent a year for the  next decade, we are going to have to grow at 2.2, 2.3 percent-- somewhere in that ballpark--to not only cover this but actually start  generating revenue above and beyond what the impact of the tax cut  would be on the Federal budget.   What I would simply say to my colleagues is that when we look at  these various models that are done and the assumptions that are made,  remember that the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Congressional Budget  Office--the numbers they are using assume 1.9 percent economic growth.  I can't believe that we wouldn't have more confidence in the American  economy that we could generate higher than 1.9 percent economic growth.  That is the straitjacket that constrains their models.   There are other models out there that have looked at the same  information, the same data, looked at the same tax bill, considered the  behavioral effects of that, how it would affect the entire economy, and  come to a different conclusion. In fact, the Tax Foundation has  suggested that the tax bill we have in front of us today would generate  an additional $1.26 trillion in revenue over that same time period  because of the additional growth that would come with it.   What we tried to do is design a tax bill that not only delivers tax  relief to middle-income families--I think the two charts I just showed  demonstrate that we do--but secondly to put policies in place that will  create conditions that are favorable to economic growth so we can get  growth back up to a more historic level. When the economy is growing at  a faster rate, it means that companies and businesses are creating  better paying jobs. And if there is a competition for labor in this  country, and I believe there will be--when companies start to expand,  start to grow their operations, it increases the demand for labor, and  the price for labor goes up, and wages go up. That is what we want to  see.   That is the other thing about this bill that doesn't get talked about  enough. The reduction in rates on businesses means that they have more  to invest in their businesses, and one of the byproducts of that is  that it goes into higher wages for their employees. The President's  Council of Economic Advisers suggests that that impact would be about  $4,000 a year in additional income for average households in this  country. There is another study done by Boston University in which they  have concluded that it would result in $3,500 a year in additional  income per household in this country.   So the impact of the tax cuts is really twofold. One is that American  families would have more in their pockets. Why? Because we double the  standard deduction. In our bill, we double the child tax credit. We  lower rates. All of those actions impact lower and middle-income  families in this country. Those are all features they can take  advantage of that generate additional benefits to them.   Those benefits, by the way, if you are an average family in this  country--a typical family of four with a combined annual income of  $73,000--result in a $2,200 tax cut. That is a 60-percent tax cut over  what they would pay under current law. So that is $2,200 in that  family's pocket that they will be able to spend on themselves and their  families instead of sending that to Washington, DC, and having somebody  decide how to spend it here. We happen to have a lot of confidence that  the American people are better prepared and better equipped to decide  how to spend their own money rather than the Federal Government. So  that is a direct benefit, No. 1.   Secondly, as I said earlier, if you give the benefit of not only a  tax cut that comes to middle-income families but also the additional  growth in the economy that generates better-paying jobs and generates  higher wages, that increases your overall household income. That is how  American families benefit directly from the legislation we are  considering today.   My colleague from Ohio is here, and he pays a lot of attention to  economic trends. I think it is interesting to note that the  Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Tax Committee, which, in their  analysis, assume 1.9 percent growth in the economy for the next  decade--we think we can do a lot better.   I ask my colleague from Ohio, aren't we already starting to do better  economically? I think we have seen a significant improvement in growth  in the economy just in the last couple of quarters. If we continue to  stay on that track or a similar track, which I think this tax reform  legislation helps enable, we might be able to get to a point where we  are growing at a more historic rate.   What was the growth rate, for example, just in the last couple of  quarters that we have seen in this country?    Mr. President, that is based upon an assumption that the  growth rate in the economy for the next decade is going to be 1.9  percent.    We are already seeing that, right? The economy is already  starting to pick up.    We are already seeing that, right? The economy is already  starting to pick up.    And, too, some of our colleagues--and I count myself, and  I am sure the Senator from Ohio does as well, among those of us who  consider ourselves fiscal conservatives--realize that in order to deal  with debt and deficits, yes, we have to get our arms around out-of- control Washington spending, and we have to do something to make those  programs that are driving that out-of-control spending more sustainable  in the long run. We also have to do the other side of this, which is to  restrain spending. But in order to deal with debt and deficits, we  really need that growth in the economy because higher growth, the  economy growing at a faster rate, means people are working, people are  paying taxes, people are taking realizations and paying taxes, and  government revenues go up. So we need growth, and that is what this  bill will accomplish.   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.   The question is on agreeing to the King motion to commit.    Mr. President, today I recognize the hard work of my  Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee law clerk Lucy Kelly.  Lucy hails from Seattle, WA, and is a second-year law student at  American University.   While clerking for the Commerce Committee, Lucy assisted the  Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and  Data Security. She is a dedicated worker who was committed to getting  the most out of her clerkship. I extend my sincere thanks and  appreciation to Lucy for all of the fine work she did for the committee  and wish her continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________
