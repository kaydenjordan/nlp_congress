 Madam Speaker, it has been 41 days since Putin's  invasion of Ukraine in February. That means 2,685 civilian casualties,  and more than 4 million fleeing Ukrainian refugees scrambling to the  aid of the EU.   Twenty-five days after watching bloodshed, riots, and tears, the  Biden administration finally came to their senses and released a  statement to aid $1 billion in funding humanitarian assistance for the  Ukrainian people, allowing the U.S. to accept 100,000 fleeing refugees;  25 days of watching; 25 days of letting other countries handle it; 25  days of fear. This is 1,081 Ukrainian citizens no longer breathing,  lost in those 25 days.   Silence speaks louder than action. The Biden administration is  responsible for this delayed deterrence.   After striking down a deal with Poland to aid the relocation of MiG- 29 planes for Ukrainian use, the President also hesitated to provide  military assistance to President Zelenskyy of Ukraine.   Two weeks of waiting into the invasion, President Biden delayed  sanctions on Russian oil after much pressure from the House. Therefore,  it ruined any chances of deterrence against Putin's aggression.   These actions have been shown on the world stage, and the U.S. now  appears weaker than ever as a result of this hesitancy.   We need to bring aid hastily to the Ukrainian people; the help they  deserve.                            ____________________
