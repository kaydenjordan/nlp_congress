 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition, although I am not  opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of this amendment  and actually thank the gentleman for bringing this amendment to the  floor.   As I had said yesterday, I certainly understand the concerns and the  potential misuse of Census data, but by law the Census Bureau cannot  and it will not disclose anyone's response or share data from which an  individual can be identified with ICE or any other agency.   Thankfully the law is already on the books. Census data sharing is a  felony punishable by up to 5 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.  Census data is important, and it is confidential.   Fortunately, the Census Bureau is deploying expert communicators and  trusted messengers all across the United States to work in each  community to motivate each and every person to respond to the Census,  and it would also help to spread the word that a person's response that  they are not a citizen of the United States does not provide the  government with really any reliable information about whether they are  lawfully present in the U.S.   So, even if this information was sent to ICE, it would really have no  use. It would be of no use to them. A successful 2020 Census will  provide a full, accurate, secure account of every person living in the  U.S. while gathering the data vital to both understanding our Nation's  changing demographics and bolstering the enforcement of the Voting  Rights Act.   Therefore, I join my colleagues in opposing any funds that would be  made available to violate the confidentiality laws governing our  Census, and I thank the gentleman for raising this issue  [[Page H4931]]  and certainly support a ``yes'' vote on this important amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, a vote for this amendment is a vote to  effectively decriminalize the action of crossing the border unlawfully.   The passage of this amendment would directly undermine the  sovereignty of the United States, and furthermore, if passed, the  amendment would immediately be seized upon by every criminal human  smuggling organization and used as a selling point to convince migrants  to come to the United States in an unlawful manner.   It would trigger a flood of illegal immigration unlike anything we  have ever seen, which will cause most of the most vulnerable  individuals to attempt to embark on a dangerous journey. Cartels and  human smuggling organizations will profit. Our borders will be less  secure. And the American people will pay the cost of open borders for  years to come.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I do not oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the gentleman's  amendment. I have seen firsthand the positive impacts of NASA's Space  Grant College and Fellowship Program in my home State of Alabama, and  because of the good work that has come out of that, I urge adoption of  the amendment, to further our students' STEM education opportunities. I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I  am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, it should be noted here that the  comprehensive opioid addiction grants in this bill have been increased  by 360 percent since they were created in 2017. Of course, opioid abuse  and addiction is a very big problem in this country, and, certainly, we  need to work on that, so I do not oppose the gentlewoman's amendment.   But please know, it should be noted that we have increased this by  360 percent, but we want to work with both sides to make sure that we  have the appropriate funds necessary to make sure we fight this opioid  addiction that has taken over so many parts of the country.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, the goal of the Department of Justice is to  house inmates in the least restrictive environment that is possible and  at the same time provide safety and security for the staff, for the  inmate population, and to the public in general.   Just as in the community, disruptive individuals occasionally need to  be placed in a jail or a holding facility to maintain the safety of its  residents. The Bureau of Prisons has to place disruptive inmates in  restrictive housing in order to maintain safety and security for the  overall well-being of all the inmates.   The appropriate and reasonable use of restrictive housing is critical  to the safety of the staff and to the Bureau's policies and procedures,  and they try to strike an appropriate balance between the safety of  those individuals who are on the staff there working at the Bureau of  Prisons but also for the inmates themselves.   Restrictive housing involves two inmates per cell, in the vast  majority of cases, and the inmates have daily access to staff and to  programming. It is only in very rare cases that inmates are in a single  cell in restrictive housing--for example, an inmate who has killed a  cellmate or an inmate who has made repetitive or credible threats to  kill anyone who is housed with him.   Every year, we mourn the loss of dedicated corrections professionals  who lose their lives while they are working to ensure our Nation's  inmates can no longer harm members of the community and harm each  other.   We must not attempt to substitute our judgment here on this House  floor for that of the highly trained corrections professionals at the  Bureau of Prisons and the United States Marshals Service. I think to do  so would be a disservice and would make their jobs even more dangerous.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, but I don't  oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, but I don't  oppose the amendment.   I think that this is a very important issue, and I think this needs  to be dealt with. Increased funding to reduce the sexual assault kit  backlog is very important, so we support the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   This administration remains committed to providing more affordable  healthcare options to all Americans, and debating the prospects of  future judicial action will not help us, as a Congress, deliver on our  promise to bring better healthcare to our constituents. The  administration has promised to ensure that, regardless of the outcome,  they will support the legislation to address any legal determination.   In addition, let me say, it is not appropriate for Congress to tell  the executive branch what positions it should take in court. Litigation  strategy is the responsibility and the prerogative of the Department of  Justice.   As the Attorney General recently testified during one of our  committee hearings here on Capitol Hill, he said that they should be  able to advance what he believes are defensible and reasonable legal  positions, and I believe that certainly to be the case.   The Attorney General has concluded that the position of the States  that challenge the ACA and the district courts is a defensible and  reasonable legal position for the Department to take.   Questions of constitutionality should be determined by the courts and  not through a partisan debate on funding limitation to an  appropriations bill. So, therefore, Mr. Chair, I would urge a ``no''  vote on this amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of the gentlewoman  from Texas, and I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Spano).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.          Amendments En Bloc No. 3 Offered by Mr. Bishop of Georgia
