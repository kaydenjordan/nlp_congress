 Madam Speaker, I rise today with deep sadness to pay  tribute to two highly-skilled U.S. Steel workers, brothers, Ben and Max  Morrissey, who tragically lost their lives at the British Petroleum  Refinery in my hometown. Yesterday, while on the job at the BP Husky  plant in Oregon, Ohio, their lives were cut short in a horrific  explosion.   Responsible citizens, husbands, and fathers who performed America's  essential work that drives progress and our American way of life  forward, these brave men will never again return home to their dear  families. They leave behind very young children who will come to  understand the gravity of their fathers' loss.   My heart goes out to their precious families and with their brothers  and sisters in the United Steelworkers Local 1-346 who lost two beloved  friends.   In our grief, we also extend our deep gratitude to the brave first  responders who rushed to the scene, provided aid, and helped keep our  community safe.   Today is a heartbreaking day for the people of northwest Ohio. We  have flown flags in honor of Ben and Max Morrissey high above the U.S.  Capitol today. We lift up the memory of them to their loved ones in our  hearts, and we pray that they may find solace and comfort in the  memories that they will always have of their treasured husbands,  fathers, and sons, and that together they may heal.   May God be with them all.                            ____________________
