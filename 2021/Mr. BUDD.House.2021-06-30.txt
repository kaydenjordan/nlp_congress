 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Arkansas for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, my amendment would re-implement a Federal Transit  Administration policy that ensured that Federal loans were not counted  towards State contributions for capital investment projects.   This is particularly important as the FTA considers the Gateway  project between New York and New Jersey. Secretary Buttigieg recently  made a verbal commitment to approve this project, but he has yet to  provide any details on the Federal share. If it mirrors the Obama  administration's plans, Federal taxpayers would be footing half of the  bill for this project while New York and New Jersey would cover the  rest. But the States are planning to cover most of their local share  with billions in Federal loans.   In essence, New York and New Jersey are demanding that taxpayers in  my State of North Carolina pay for their project.   My amendment makes sure that drivers in North Carolina are not overly  subsidizing potentially wasteful transit projects in New York, L.A.,  San Francisco, or Chicago.
