 Mr. President, those following the proceedings of the  Senate may be wondering what we are doing. Technically, we are  considering the nomination of Congressman Tom Price of Georgia to serve  as Secretary of Health and Human Services--a position he has been  nominated for by President Trump. Other Members have come to the floor  and discussed other nominees, as the junior Senator from Arizona just  discussed the Supreme Court nominee, but I wanted to make sure I came  to the floor for a few minutes to put my thoughts on the record about  the nomination of Congressman Tom Price to be Secretary of Health and  Human Services.   It almost seems like a natural fit. He is an orthopedic surgeon. This  man obviously is gifted and talented and educated and skilled when it  comes to the healing arts, and he made a living before his election to  Congress dealing with complex surgeries. On that alone, he needs to  have honest consideration from all Members of the Senate as we advise  and consent to his nomination to Secretary of Health and Human  Services. But he will not be entering surgery when he goes to the  Health and Human Services Department, at least not the kind of surgery  experience he has had in the past; he is going to be in charge of the  most important health care programs in the United States of America.  They are programs that literally tens of millions of Americans count  on; 50 or 60 million Americans count on Medicare.   Medicare is that program created in the 1970s under President Lyndon  Johnson that said: You don't have to reach a point in life where you  are so old that you can't work anymore and therefore can't qualify for  health insurance at your employment. We are going to create a program  that is available for people who are 65 years of age called Medicare.  You are going to be able to have health insurance coverage at age 65.   It was a dramatic change in the way we looked at health care in  America, and it was controversial. The medical professions opposed  Medicare. They argued that creating this health insurance plan for  senior citizens--and later it was expanded to the disabled--meant  socialized medicine, which meant that the government was going to make  the decision about your health care--no longer you and your doctor; it  would be the government making these critical decisions. So the  American Medical Association and many others opposed the creation of  Medicare.   Despite that opposition, the bill went forward and passed and became  law. I would go out on a limb today as a politician and say it may be  the most popular single political program, perhaps only second to  Social Security, in the history of the United States. Overnight, it  changed the treatment of our parents and grandparents. There was a  time--and there aren't many left who can remember it--when it reached  the point where Grandma had to come and live with you because there was  no place for her to go. She perhaps worked in life and perhaps hadn't.  She had a limited amount of retirement. She had very modest, if any,  Social Security. She was in and out of the doctor's office and  hospital. And she was in the spare bedroom. I can remember that growing  up as a kid. That was considered somewhat normal at the time.   In the 1970s, that started to change. It changed, obviously, with  Social Security but also with Medicare. Now your grandmother had access  to a doctor and a hospital, and it didn't cost her life savings. What a  big change it meant. As we learned when Medicare was created, almost  half of the seniors in America had no health insurance. Now that number  is 1 or 2 percent.   Medicare has worked, and it has worked to give people longer lives.  That is the real proof. I can brag about it all I care to, but the  bottom line is that senior citizens, starting with the creation of  Medicare, started living longer, more independent lives. Isn't that  what every senior wants--decent, good health and independence in the  way they live? Medicare has been the key to that.   It is hard to imagine that here in 2017 we are going to initiate  another debate about whether America should have Medicare. Fifty years  later, we are going to go through this debate all over again?  Apparently so, because the nominee of President Donald Trump to be the  head of the Health and Human Services Department, Congressman Tom Price  of Georgia, has said some troubling things about Medicare.   In Politico, he said: ``Nothing has had a greater negative effect on  the delivery of health care than the Federal government's intrusion  into medicine through Medicare.'' What was he thinking? He obviously  never looked at it from the perspective of someone of limited means who  finally had a chance for the protection of health insurance at age 65.  I met those people. One of them is a friend of mine. Her name is Judy.  Judy lives in Southern Illinois. I met her because she is a sweet lady  who is head of hospitality at a motel where I stay in Southern  Illinois. She is a happy person with a big smile, and I have gotten to  know her over the years. We became friends.    I came to learn one day that Judy has spent most of her life in jobs  just like that. She is not a lazy person at all, but she is lucky to  get part-time jobs. And when I met her at age 63, Judy told me,  whispered to me once, ``Senator, I have never had health insurance in  my life.'' That is a heartbreaking statement when you think about it,  isn't it? This lady lived 63 years never once having health insurance.  Then a couple of things happened. She asked me about the Affordable  Care Act, ObamaCare. Was it good  [[Page S983]]  for her or not? I told her that because her income was at a certain  level, she was going to qualify for health insurance under the  Affordable Care Act with no premium. She was brought into the Medicare  Program at age 63. For the first time in her life, she had health  insurance through the Affordable Care Act--a low-income wage earner,  eligible for Medicaid at no expense to her.   And it didn't come a moment too soon. On one of my next trips down  South, I saw Judy. She didn't look as healthy as she once looked. Turns  out she had been diagnosed with diabetes. And at age 64, she was in  need--desperate need of ongoing medical care or complications were  likely to set in. It was shortly after that she qualified for Medicare.  So Judy has coverage. Judy has a doctor. Judy has people who care about  her in her life.   That is why I wonder what Congressman Price, who wants to be  Secretary of Health and Human Services, is thinking. What is he  thinking about people just like her?   Let's take a look at what we have before us with his nomination. This  Department touches the lives of virtually every American, Health and  Human Services. I talked about Medicare and Medicaid, but this is the  Department that is responsible for medical research too--the National  Institutes of Health, for example. This is the Department that oversees  the Centers for Disease Control, and that is the agency which had to  fight the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa. This is the Department that  is in charge of promoting healthy births of babies in America and, of  course, caring for our seniors I have spoken about.   On many of these issues I have just outlined, Congressman Tom Price  of Georgia has made his views very clear. His legislative record and  his core values as a Republican Congressman from Georgia are in  contrast with the missions of the very Department President Trump has  asked him to lead. Let's take a look.   New York Times said Congressman Price's views on the role of  government in health care can ``be summed up in one word: Less.''   Congressman Price has spent his political career opposing many of the  basic Federal health programs he is now being asked for permission to  oversee. He has repeatedly voted against the Children's Health  Insurance Program, which is a program that provides health insurance to  8 million kids in America. Even before passing the Affordable Care Act,  we decided we were going to extend health insurance coverage to  children, making a real commitment at the Federal level on a bipartisan  basis to do it. Eight million kids are covered nationwide, 300,000 in  Illinois.   Congressman Price has spent the last 6 years in a desperate attempt  to repeal the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare. If he were successful in  that effort, it would eliminate health insurance for 30 million  Americans and lead to dramatic premium increases for those with health  insurance. Last year, it was Congressman Price of Georgia who authored  the repeal and retreat reconciliation bill that, thank goodness, was  vetoed by President Obama. Bound and determined Congressman Price was  to eliminate ObamaCare. And for 6 years, Republicans have never had a  replacement. That is why they are changing their rhetoric. It went from  repeal, to repeal and replace, and now it is repair. I can't keep up  with them. But I will tell you, starting with repeal is inviting a  disaster in health care in America and calling into question the health  insurance coverage of 30 million people in our country. So if  Congressman Price had his way, it would mean less funding, fewer  services, and fewer people covered.   In addition to wanting to repeal our health care law, Congressman  Price wants to fundamentally and negatively change Medicare and  Medicaid. Those two programs together serve about one-third of the  people living in America, 120 million. He wants to eliminate the  Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid.   Remember Judy? Her income was too low. She couldn't pay any health  insurance premiums. But because her income was so low, she qualified to  be brought into the rolls of Medicaid in Illinois. Over 600,000 people  just like her were brought into protection of health insurance for the  first time in their lives. This is one of our best tools for primary  care for people who are in low-income situations--Medicaid.   Because we included in the Affordable Care Act a guarantee that  health insurance would cover mental illness and substance abuse  treatment, in some parts of my State where opioid addiction and heroin  deaths are so prevalent, people with health insurance have access to  substance abuse treatment. Congressman Price, who would repeal  ObamaCare, would eliminate that guarantee in health insurance.   Repealing the Medicaid expansion that I mentioned earlier would put  650,000 Illinoisans out of insurance, and our State would lose $37  billion in Federal funding over the next decade.   What impact does it have if a person shows up at an emergency room  sick, with no insurance? In America, that person still receives care,  but who pays for it? Everybody else. People with health insurance end  up paying for those who receive care and don't pay for it. Medicaid  makes sure that hospital receives a payment. So when Congressman Price  wants to eliminate the coverage of Medicaid under the Affordable Care  Act, it means less money coming into the hospitals across America. Some  hospitals are big and prosperous, and they can take it; others cannot.  In downstate Illinois, where I hail from, smalltown America, hospitals  in those communities losing Medicaid, which Congressman Price would  eliminate, are going to have a tough time staying open.   The Illinois Hospital Association tells us we will lose 90,000 jobs  if Congressman Price's plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act goes  forward--90,000 in Illinois. I need not tell you they are the best  paying jobs in downstate communities. So it is a job-killer, and sadly  it endangers the health of the people who count on these hospitals.   What is he thinking? He is a doctor. He should be thinking in terms  of what it means when you don't protect people with basic health  insurance. Right now, if you qualify for Medicaid, you are guaranteed  to get health care. Under Congressman Price's plan--the man who wants  to be head of Health and Human Services--the guarantee is gone.  Illinois would have lost $14 billion in Medicaid funding if Congressman  Price had his way.   Faced with far less Federal funding, the States would have to be  forced to find ways to save money, even worse than what we currently  have in our State. They might start Medicaid waiting lists or work  requirements or cut benefits. Think about it. A person nominated to  lead the Nation's premier health agency supports proposals that would  take health care away from people.   It gets worse. Congressman Price wants to privatize Medicare. Be  careful when you hear a politician stand up and say: I want to  guarantee your access to health insurance. Well, I have access to a lot  of things. I can walk onto the showroom floor of people who are selling  $85,000, $95,000 cars. I mean, I have access to those showrooms. Can I  buy one of them? No. I can't afford it. Most people couldn't. But I  have access to it. So when they say you have access to health  insurance, the obvious next question is, What kind of health insurance?  And how am I going to pay for it? Watch out for that word ``access.''  It is a loaded political word.    Just the other night my colleague Bernie Sanders was debating Senator  Ted Cruz of Texas, and darned if Senator Cruz didn't come up with that  word, saying we have to make sure every American has access to health  insurance. No, we have to make sure every American has health  insurance. How about that? Health insurance they can afford that is  worth buying.   Congressman Price wants to privatize Medicare. So instead of having a  government-run program for tens of millions of Americans, he wants to  put seniors and the disabled in America back in the loving arms of  health insurance companies. How about that? Do you remember a time when  you or your family was on the phone with somebody, begging them for  health insurance coverage, waiting and waiting and waiting for your  turn? That is what he thinks is access, and that is what he believes is  good health insurance. I don't. Ending the guarantee of Medicare for  hardworking American seniors and handing them a voucher  [[Page S984]]  and wishing them good luck on finding their own insurance--that may be  access, but it is not protection.   The point of voucherizing Medicare is to save the government money by  forcing seniors to pay more out of their own pockets. That is  Congressman Price's approach, and now he wants to head up the agency in  charge of Medicare. Don't take my word for it. He said: ``Nothing has  had a greater negative effect on the delivery of health care than the  federal government's intrusion into medicine through Medicare.''   Since 1965, when we created Medicare, listen to what has happened.  Before Medicare, 51 percent of Americans 65 or older had health care  coverage and nearly 30 percent lived in poverty. That is before 1965.  Today, 98 percent of seniors have health care coverage, primarily  because of Medicare. Fewer than 10 percent live below the poverty line.  It has made a dramatic difference in their quality of life, the length  of their lives, and the independence they enjoy in their lives.   In addition, by ensuring access to care for more people, Medicare has  contributed to life expectancy--5 years higher today than it was in  1965. So Medicare has helped ensure more seniors have health insurance,  fewer seniors are living in poverty, and people are living longer. Is  that what Congressman Price considers a ``negative effect on the  delivery of health care''?   There are so many different issues where Congressman Price has taken  what I consider to be radical and extreme views, particularly when it  comes to health care. I won't go through the long list, but I will say  this. We debated the future of Medicare when I was a member of the  Simpson-Bowles Commission. We were looking at the deficit situation  facing our country and looking, as we should, at entitlements. Many of  us said at the time: Be careful about raising the eligibility age for  Medicare. For a Congressman or a Senator, a couple more years at a desk  before you qualify for Medicare is not a big ask. But if you happen to  be a waitress on her feet every day, suffering from arthritis or some  other issues, 2 more years in the workplace literally are backbreakers.  If you happen to be driving a truck, making deliveries, changing the  Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 or 70 is where you are going to  get in trouble. That is where people actually are going to face a  hardship.   Sadly, Congressman Tom Price of Georgia doesn't get it. He doesn't  understand that part of it. Because he doesn't, I am going to be  opposing his nomination and watching carefully and closely.   There is going to be a battle royal on the floor of the House and the  Senate about funding important programs in America. The Department of  Defense, as important as it is for America's security, wants all the  money it can get its hands on, and I want to make sure we always spend  enough to keep us safe. But the battle is going to be between defense  and nondefense. Nondefense includes health care. Nondefense includes  medical research. Nondefense includes education.   Now we are going to have someone here at the Department of Health and  Human Services who, sadly, is not committed to the basics of Medicare  and Medicaid. That is not good news for seniors and disabled people  across the America. That is why I am going to oppose Congressman Price.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
