 Madam Speaker, this is my 29th year in  Congress. I have followed the issues since my early teens more than 50  years ago. I have never seen anywhere close to the anger and hatred  there is on political issues today.   Yesterday, on the ``Chris Plante Show,'' he mentioned a professor,  John Griffin, from the Art Institute of Washington. Last month,  Professor Griffin posted a link to a Washington Post column, with the  professor commenting that all Republican Members of the House ``should  be lined up and shot.'' He added, ``That is not hyperbole. Blood is on  their hands.''   That was in support of a Washington Post column by Paul Waldman  saying the Republican healthcare bill was an ``act of monstrous  cruelty'' that should ``stain those who supported it to the end of  their days.''   Those who have so much hatred and anger in their hearts and minds  seriously need to seek religious or psychiatric help.                            ____________________
