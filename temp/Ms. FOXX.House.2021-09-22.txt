 Madam Speaker, Israel's Iron Dome has saved countless lives  from barrages of missiles launched by Hamas.   One would think that the majority would understand this fact and  recognize the Iron Dome's significance. However, after caving to the  demands of several of their own fringe members yesterday, it is clear  they don't have a clue.   Israel has always been a longstanding ally to the United States, and  now is not the time to turn our back on Israel.   Madam Speaker, without question, House Republicans are proud to stand  with Israel and the Jewish community. Our alliance with them is a  testament to our shared values, and it should not be forsaken under any  circumstance.                    Washington Liberals' Pernicious Grasp     Madam Speaker, there is no issue small enough to escape  Washington liberals' pernicious grasp. For one, anonymous bureaucrats  demand disgustingly low levels of salt and fat in school lunches even  though dieticians acknowledge these ingredients are part of a well- balanced diet.   House Democrats have also passed a bill that would skim the top off  workers' paychecks to line the pockets of union bosses, even though  those workers are not even union members.   And most recently, Congressional Democrats are pushing a $3.5  trillion socialist wish list, which the New York Times said ``would  touch virtually every American's life, from conception to aged  infirmity.''   While these micromanagers are busy finding new ways to interfere in  your personal decisions, dangerous totalitarian nations like China,  Russia, and Iran threaten individual liberties and global prosperity.  Democrats ought to turn their attention to these existential concerns  instead of seeking to impose their agenda on free Americans.                         Now is the Time for Answers     Madam Speaker, the American people deserve to know  [[Page H4870]]  about the failures that led up to the disastrous Afghanistan  withdrawal. This is an issue that cannot be swept under the rug and  forgotten. Unfortunately, this administration has already decided to  move on and look the other way.   Thirteen patriots lost their lives just a few short weeks ago, and  countless Americans who wanted to leave were left behind. The whole  world watched this crisis grow, and America's strengths and leadership  were called into question by our closest allies. This crisis should  have never unfolded the way it did.   Now is the time for answers, Madam Speaker. The American people  demand them and the world expects them.                            Real Cost of Inflation     Madam Speaker, American families are feeling the immense  strain that has been caused by President Biden's economic crisis. From  the gas pumps to the grocery store, prices for even the most basic  commodities are skyrocketing to obscene levels.   The cost of gasoline is up almost 43 percent. The cost of beef is up  almost 12 percent. The cost of propane is up almost 23 percent. Even  the prices of used cars are up almost 45 percent.   Madam Speaker, increased spending by the Federal Government is not a  remedy to solve this crisis, nor is a $3.5 trillion spending bill that  will cripple the American economy even further. Congress must get its  fiscal house in order.                            ____________________
