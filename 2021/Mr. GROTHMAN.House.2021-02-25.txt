 Mr. Speaker, in the past, I have taken time to discuss  Black Lives Matter, a powerful group in this past election, which I  think was very instrumental in the Democratic Party retaining their  majority, and talking about the Marxist roots of their founders. In  their statement, ``What We Believe,'' they, Black Lives Matter, clearly  state that one of their goals is to disrupt the Western-prescribed  nuclear family structure.   First of all, to say that the traditional family is a Western family  is insulting to all the people from East Asia, the Indian subcontinent,  the Middle East, Latin America, and sub-Saharan Africa that already  have mothers and fathers at home. This is not a Western thing.   Nevertheless, it is apparent that the founders of Black Lives Matter  did consider the traditional nuclear family something to be disrupted.  And that is part of Marxism, to get rid of the traditional families.  And it is scary that one of our two major political parties held its  majority by closely aligning itself with this group.   I have asked for a hearing before the Education Committee on the Pell  Grant Program, which already brazenly penalizes nuclear families--no  hearing as of yet. But, today, I ran across an article in the City  Journal called ``Failure Factory,'' talking about the influence of, to  a certain extent, Marxist ideology and, to a certain extent, critical  race theory on their curriculum.   This curriculum itself denigrates the traditional family. I don't  know why we would, in schools--and they are talking about the Buffalo  Public Schools here--why in schools we would denigrate a traditional  family with father at home.   This curriculum appears designed to make young people bitter,  defeatist, and antipolice. Our poor children--and by poor, I don't mean  materially poor. Our poor children have to put up with this sort of  curriculum.   In other countries, strong families are the norm, and children are  excelling at math, reading, and science. They immigrate here, children  from all different racial, religious, and cultural backgrounds, and  they will outperform our homegrown students who get this antifamily,  antipolice drivel.   I would also ask my good friend Education Chairman  Bobby Scott to  hold a hearing on critical race theory, which is infecting our schools,  before any more damage is done. The Federal Government puts $40 billion  into K-12 in this country, and we are spending a total of over $12,000  a child. If teachers are going to teach the students that families with  fathers are not good, the police are racist, and that it is so  difficult to achieve in this country, it doesn't matter how much we  spend. Please, chairman of the Education Committee,  Bobby Scott, hold  a hearing on critical race theory and the influence it has on our  public schools.   Again, I will mention the article describing the curriculum in the  Buffalo Public Schools would be called ``Failure Factory'' in the City  Journal. So if you want to Google ``Failure Factory,'' City Journal,  you can read about what goes on in our Buffalo Public Schools.                                Ice Age Trail     Now, I would like to talk a little bit about an  amendment that was done in a bipartisan fashion, and I know far too  many people outside of Washington don't realize that the vast majority  of things we do here are in a bipartisan fashion.   The amendment concerns the Ice Age Trail, a trail that winds  throughout the Midwest. But in the State of Wisconsin, it begins in the  eastern part of the State in Door County and winds its way out the  western part of the State on the Minnesota border. The Ice Age Trail  goes through Manitowoc, Sheboygan, Fond du Lac, Columbia, Marquette,  and Waushara Counties in my district.   According to a study by the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, the  trail has had an annual economic impact of $113 million, drawing 1.2  million visitors.   Currently, the Ice Age Trail is not categorized as a unit of the  National Park System administered by the Department of the Interior.  The bipartisan amendment, which I worked on with my friend Congressman  Pocan from the Madison area, would allow the Ice Age Trail that  opportunity.   As a unit of the National Park System, Federal funds will be allowed  to go to Wisconsin for maintenance and improvement of these trails,  which drive tourism and provide outdoor recreation opportunities for  Wisconsinites and visitors alike.   More than thousands of years ago, an immense flow of glacial ice  sculpted a landscape of remarkable beauty across Wisconsin. And let me  tell you, I think Wisconsin is the most beautiful State we have. So,  please, everybody come visit our Ice Age Trail.   As the glacier retreated, it left behind a variety of landscape  features. These glacial remnants are now considered among the world's  finest examples of how continental glaciation sculpts our planet.   The Ice Age National Scenic Trail is a thousand miles that highlights  these landscape features as it travels through some of the State's most  beautiful natural areas. The trail is entirely within Wisconsin.   The Ice Age Trail is more than a path through the woods. It is a  place for mental and physical rejuvenation, a place to unwind after a  hard day and enjoy the landscape of Wisconsin. More than a million  people use the trail each year to hike and snowshoe, to backpack, to  disconnect, and to reconnect.   Behind the scenes, a vibrant community of volunteers across the State  work to build and maintain the trail, making it one of the country's  best hiking experiences.   I sincerely hope that the bill that is going to come up that we are  going to vote on tomorrow, that this amendment becomes part of that  bill. I am confident that it will.   It is going to improve the Ice Age Trail, making it even more  consumer-friendly for the millions of Wisconsinites who have taken  advantage of the trail. Particularly this year, where we have way too  many people sitting inside, it is going to be a great year to tour the  trail.   The trail was begun in the 1950s as the dream of Milwaukeean Ray  Zillmer, who had a vision of a long, linear park winding through  Wisconsin  [[Page H720]]  along the glacier's terminal moraine. This will be a great addition to  the trail, and it will improve the experience of those who use it.                            Benefits of Vitamin D     Let's address COVID. While it appears we have turned  the corner on COVID, it still appears as though we have over 2,000  deaths most days.   For whatever reason, the CDC and the public health establishment have  refused to inform the public of the huge benefits of vitamin D. Almost  40 percent of American adults are vitamin D deficient.   This is a bigger problem in winter in the North, where people don't  get as much sun, and also a bigger problem with darker skinned  populations and a bigger problem with older populations since older  people don't produce as much vitamin D.   You should take 5,000 units of vitamin D a day. If you have COVID,  you should immediately take additional vitamin D. Countries such as  England already inform their population of the benefits of vitamin D,  and in India, there is a study showing potentially huge benefits of  large amounts of vitamin D given to people as soon as they know they  have this disease.   It is unfortunate that our public health establishment has not pushed  vitamin D as much as you would think they should. Please, America, look  up the website vitaminDforall.org. Over 200 experts, led by Dr. Karl  Pfleger of California and Richard Carmona, Surgeon General under  President Bush, are advocates of vitamin D. They believe science is on  our side, and they believe that if we had adequately informed the 40  percent of the population that was vitamin D deficient, we could have  saved hundreds of thousands of lives in this pandemic. Please, we do  not want any more patients to die with a vitamin D deficiency.   An interesting thing about vitamin D, a lot of times the medical  establishment is reluctant to push something forward because something  horrible would happen to a given percentage of the population who take  it, but there really is only a minimal downside to taking vitamin D, so  I really wish the CDC would step up to the plate, as they have in other  countries, and spend some of the time they spend talking about social  distancing or masking, which we hear about all the time, educating  people to take vitamin D.   Dr. Fauci himself let it slip in an interview with a Hollywood  actress that he takes vitamin D. But while he let it slip in kind of a  fun interview, he doesn't routinely tell the American public that, and  I wish he would do that. I don't know why Dr. Fauci would be so quiet  about vitamin D when he, himself, has admitted that he takes a  significant amount of it.   The failure of CDC to issue guidances encouraging people to take  vitamin D is one of the reasons why we have had so many fatalities.  Let's not lose anyone else.   Again, remember to look at the website, vitaminDforAll, and make sure  you take vitamin D both for yourself and for your family.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
