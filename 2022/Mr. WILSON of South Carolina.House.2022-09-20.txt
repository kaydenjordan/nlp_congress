 Madam Speaker, American families are  paying the highest electricity prices in over 40 years with a 16  percent increase from a year ago. Additionally, natural gas prices to  heat homes are up 30 percent as winter nears due to the extremist Biden  energy failing policies.   According to a HelpAdvisor survey in the last year, a quarter of  Americans reduced food and medicine so they could pay the energy bill.  Unfortunately, one in six people, more than 20 million households, are  behind on utility bills and in danger of losing utility services. The  Energy Information Administration anticipates an additional increase  this year.   The policies of Biden and Democrats are responsible for high utility  costs and destroying jobs.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from a safe haven in Afghanistan to America. With the open Biden border  for terrorists, American families today are at a greater risk of mass  murder than ever before.                            ____________________
