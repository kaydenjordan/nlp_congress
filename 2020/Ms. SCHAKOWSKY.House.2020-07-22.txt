 Madam Speaker, one of the greatest honors of my life  has been to serve alongside John Lewis in this House of  Representatives. John was my friend, and I know that thousands of  people say the same thing, and guess what? They are all right.   John was my leader. I sat down in the well of this House with him in  the morning, and we didn't get up again until the next morning because  we were fighting, with him in the lead, to end gun violence. I got  arrested with John Lewis, he probably for the 60-something time and me  for the first, because we were fighting for immigration reform.   My husband and I had the honor of walking behind John to cross the  Edmund Pettus Bridge three different times at a place where the State  troopers in Alabama nearly took his life.   Over the years in our Democratic Caucus meetings, there was a tone  that would get gloomy sometimes, and those were John Lewis moments.  John would stand up and, in no uncertain terms, he would remind us of  our mission. What people really wanted to hear from us, he told us, was  hope, and no one could deliver hope like John Lewis.   I give you his words, words we needed to hear: Do not get lost in  despair. Be hopeful. Be optimistic. Our struggle is not a struggle of a  day, of a week, of a month, or of a year. It is the struggle of a  lifetime.
