 Let me thank Congresswoman Jayapal for yielding and for  holding this important issue on this existential threat to our  democracy. Also, I just have to say that she has just hit the ground  running here on behalf of the American people, on behalf of working men  and women, on behalf of peace and security in the world, on behalf of  our democracy. So I thank her for her leadership.   The constant stream of allegations and scandals springing from 1600  Pennsylvania Avenue is really quite shocking. I have to admit that,  after watching President Trump fire the FBI Director who was  investigating him, I thought things could not get any worse. But just  days later, President Trump blundered into sharing classified  intelligence with Russian officials.   As the Nation and the world grappled with the aftermath of this  revelation, yet more shocking news was breaking. The New York Times has  alleged that, before he was fired, Director Comey was pressured by  President Trump to shut down an ongoing investigation into General  Michael Flynn's possible collusion with the Russians.   Mr. Speaker, I want to be very clear with the American people. If The  New York Times report is true, President Trump's attempts to influence  a Federal probe can only be described in one way, and that is  obstruction of justice. And, yes, we all know obstruction of justice is  an impeachable offense.   Right now, one thing, though, is crystal clear: The President's abuse  of power has plunged this Nation into a full-blown constitutional  crisis. This crisis goes far beyond party interests. Every American,  Democrat or Republican, should be concerned by these allegations.   President Trump's actions have threatened national security, the rule  of law, and the independence of our Nation's justice system. His  actions dishonor the Office of the Presidency and place this Nation and  our allies in danger.   The reports of last week underscore the need to establish a  bipartisan, independent commission to get to the bottom of Russian  interference in our elections once and for all. It is vitally important  that Director Mueller--and I am very pleased that the Department of  Justice appointed him; this is one step in the right direction--be  given the resources and the autonomy to conduct an investigation.   Unfortunately, President Trump said that this investigation is a  witch hunt. Nothing could be further from the truth. The American  people deserve to know the facts about possible collusion between  Russia and the Trump campaign. Our democracy must be defended at all  costs.   I thank Congresswoman Jayapal for giving us a chance to speak tonight  about this very dangerous moment that we are in, about Presidential  abuse, and, really, about the preservation of our democracy. The  Congressional Progressive Caucus continues to lead on so many issues  that are important to this country and to the world.

Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from California?   There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, I rise today, along with my colleagues, to  talk about restoring Congress' constitutional oversight on matters of  war and peace. I invite all of my colleagues to join me in demanding  that this House immediately repeal the 2001 Authorization for Use of  Military Force.   Nearly 16 years ago, Congress passed an open-ended, blank check for  endless war. This authorization gives any President the authority to  wage limitless war at any time, anywhere, for any reason in perpetuity.  The vote to relinquish our constitutional authority occurred just 3  days after the horrific terrorist attacks on 9/11. The American  [[Page H4352]]  people were angry and anxious to take action.   Madam Speaker, I was just as outraged and devastated as every other  American, but I voted against this 2001 AUMF because I believed then-- as I believe now--that it was a blank check and set the stage for  perpetual war.   This House rushed to pass the 60-word authorization with little  debate. Sixty words, Madam Speaker, drastically altered history. In the  almost 16 years since its passage, the 2001 AUMF--which was designed,  mind you, to punish the perpetrators of the brutal and deadly attacks  on September 11--has been used now by three Presidents to wage endless  war around the globe. A recent report from the Congressional Research  Service shows that this authorization has been used more than 37 times  in 14 countries to justify military action.                                time  1800    These include operations at Guantanamo Bay, warrantless wiretapping,  and recent military actions in Libya, Syria, Somalia, Yemen, and many  more. This report only looks at unclassified military actions.   I would like to now yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs.  Watson Coleman), who has been such a leader on so many issues,  especially around issues of our constitutional responsibility, issues  around war and peace.   Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the Congresswoman  for having this Special Order to address this issue and for continuing  to be such a leader on behalf of this great democracy that we have.   Although I was not in Congress when this AUMF was established, more  than 15 years later, it is clear this authorization is not designed for  this endless and perpetual war on terror.   I commend the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) for her bravery  and her unwavering stance for what is right.   Sadly, what the gentlewoman feared is now our reality. Just today,  U.S. forces participated in an airstrike against the Assad regime under  the umbrella of the same AUMF. This is just the latest example of this  virtual endless war we are able to wage in the Middle East and beyond.   As of January 2013, DOD reported 7,008 U.S. military deaths in the  war on terror in addition to the over 50,000 that have been wounded.  This does not include the huge numbers of civilians killed and families  that have been impacted by the U.S. military machine. This is  compounded by the harsh reality that, according to Pentagon statistics,  suicide, not combat, is the leading killer of U.S. troops deployed to  the Middle East to fight Islamic State militants. Between 2001 and  2010, the rate of suicide in the military has doubled.   When we decide to commit our troops to our mission, it needs to be  with clear goals and the explicit approval of Congress, approval that  aligns with the goals of the administration and the Commander in Chief.  Anything less puts personnel at risk, draining vital resources,  finances, and our military.   We are taking our military away from readiness everywhere. We are  making tactical and deliberate actions less feasible by spreading our  military capacity thin. We are not doing our job if we allow carte  blanche to any President to wage a nebulous war.   This is not just a bipartisan issue, this is an American issue.   I have voted against funding bills that maintain operations under the  2001 AUMF under the previous administration and feel no differently  today. Quite frankly, based on the actions of this President, I have  even less confidence that he has a reasonable and targeted plan to deal  with such a complex military issue.   We need a deliberate process. We need a new AUMF that establishes  strict parameters, attainable goals, and, most importantly,  accountability. There is a real cost here, a human cost here; so  whether it is an additional 1 or 1,000, our troops demand more, our  allies demand more, and this country of ours deserves more.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs.  Watson Coleman) for that very powerful statement and also for reminding  us that this should not be a partisan issue.   With that, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), who has  been very diligent in his effort to repeal the 2001 Authorization for  Use of Military Force.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Yoho for his clear and  concise statement laying out how explicit the Constitution is as it  relates to matters of war and peace and how we must debate both if we  are going to continue to use force. We look forward to a bipartisan  effort this year to get us where we need to be, and that is to repeal  this authorization. I thank the gentleman.   Madam Speaker, I yield now to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Engel), who is the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and  whom I served with on the committee for many years, and who really has  a very clear understanding of foreign and military policy and has been  such a leader on so many issues and someone on whom we rely on so many  fronts.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Engel) for that very powerful statement and for really laying out  the fact that Congress is missing in action and that this resolution,  this AUMF, must be repealed so that we can move forward and make some  determinations as to what Congress' role will be and what we think  should happen in terms of our strategy as it relates to going to war.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) for  being here tonight and I thank him for his leadership and his  expertise.   Madam Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Jones), who has been a friend, a supporter, who constantly is talking  about why we need to protect our troops, support our troops, keep them  out of harm's way, support our veterans. He is a great American, and I  have the pleasure of working with him on so many issues.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Jones) for his statement tonight and for his leadership. I think,  listening to him, listening to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho),  and working with our colleagues in a bipartisan way, you know, we have  to keep hope alive on this because our young men and women, our  Constitution, our country, deserves it. You have been here from the  beginning in terms of trying to help put Congress back into action  because we have been missing in action.   Madam Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Khanna), my colleague from the Silicon Valley, right next door to my  district, who has come to Congress and has hit the ground running. He  is a true advocate on so many issues as it relates to peace and justice  and security.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from California  (Mr. Khanna) for those kind words, but also for his clarity and his  vision and understanding that we must repeal this authorization to use  force and put Congress back in the mix where we should have been from  day one. I want to  [[Page H4355]]  thank him again very much for being here.   Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time I have left.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee)  has 1 minute remaining.    I will close now. Once again, I ask our Speaker a very  simple question, and that is why he has not scheduled a debate on this  vital issue that affects our national security.   We asked over and over again for a vote to repeal this authorization.  We want a debate and we want to have a new vote based on the current  realities of what is taking place as it relates to the use of force by  our own government.   In February of 2015, Congressman Eliot Engel mentioned that President  Obama sent to Congress an ISIS-specific AUMF, and it was never taken  up. There were no actions, no hearings, no formal debate. Not one vote.   We have a new President that is continuing to use the outdated 2001  AUMF in expanded ways, including justifying sending more troops to  fight ISIS in Syria and spending more taxpayer dollars on war and  putting our young men and women in harm's way.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank all of the Members who were here  last night. Let's hope that this discussion will help more Members come  to the floor and talk about why we need the Speaker to bring up the  bill to repeal the authorization to use force.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 29 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, May 19, 2017, at 9  a.m.                            ____________________
