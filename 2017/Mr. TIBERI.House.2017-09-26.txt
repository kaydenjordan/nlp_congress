 Mr. Speaker, on roll call No. 537 (Passage of H.R. 2824-- Increasing Opportunity and Success for Children and Parents through  Evidence-Based Home Visiting Act), I did not cast my vote. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on passage of this bill.                             personal explanation
