 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I  rise today to anchor the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour.   I would like to thank the Congressional Black Caucus chairman, Cedric  Richmond, for his leadership in this effort.   For the next 60 minutes, we have an opportunity to speak directly to  the American people about issues of great importance to the  Congressional Black Caucus and the millions of constituents whom we  represent.   Tonight's Special Order hour topic is gun violence and gun violence  prevention.   Mr. Speaker, how many more lives?   Mr. Speaker, there are 13,000 gun homicides a year in the United  States. On an average day, 96 Americans are killed by guns.   Sadly, our children are not untouched by this senseless violence. On  an average day, seven children and teens are killed with guns, and  since 2013, there have been 311 school shootings.   Kyle McLeod;   Angelique Ramirez;   Chris Stone;   Jared Black;   Kimberly Vaughan;   Sabika Sheikh;   Cynthia Tisdale;   Glenda Ann Perkins;   Shana Fisher;   Christian Garcia.   On Friday, eight children and two of their teachers were slaughtered  during the early morning hours of the schoolday, and those were their  names.   Many students thought it was a drill when a fellow student wearing a  ``Born to Kill'' shirt opened fire at his school. Throughout the  weekend, witnesses and survivors recounted the sheer terror of the  shooting and its frenzied aftermath.   This is unacceptable, Mr. Speaker. Enough is enough. We know that  there are ways to reduce gun violence in our communities and in our  schools. There are solutions.   Today, the movement is being led by young people from around our  country, including the Ninth Congressional District of New York that I  am honored to represent. In April, I met with students from March for  Our Lives NYC.   In my hands are the postcards. I have nearly 100 letters from my  constituents calling for us to take up some of these solutions. My  constituents are calling on me, their Representative in this esteemed  body, and upon all of us to do something now.   One student wrote:         We shouldn't have to be marching for this. Children are       dead, lots of them. Do something. Anything.    ``Please help,'' wrote another.   Mr. Speaker, that meeting was nearly 2 months ago, and this President  and this Congress have done absolutely nothing.   Since the Parkland shooting, countless numbers of children have died  in their schools and in their communities because of our inaction. Our  inaction puts our children in danger.   One student wrote:         It is time to serve the American people and not the gun       lobby.    One teacher stressed the need to protect kids and staff. Another  said:         Schools and teachers need more funding for books, salaries,       social support programs, and counseling, not more guns.    One letter came from someone who had actually been shot:         One in three people in the U.S. knows someone who has been       shot, and I am one of them.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, am a survivor of gun violence. While serving in  the New York City Council during the year 2003, all colleagues were  coming back from a recess period, and we were excited to see one  another. One of my dearest and closest colleagues, the Honorable James  E. Davis, came to work that day as we all did, excited about doing the  work for the people of the City of New York.   Unfortunately, James E. Davis had befriended his assailant. His  assailant walked into the chambers of the New York City Council and  unleashed a violent attack on Mr. Davis that took his life. That attack  took place in the workplace in front of all his colleagues.    To this very day, I need to just close my eyes, and I can transport  myself back into that moment where members had to scramble to the  floor, where members ran out of the chambers and barricaded themselves  in the speaker's office waiting to be rescued, not knowing whether we  were being attacked or it was a lone assailant, not knowing whether our  colleague would survive or whether he would perish.   Mr. Speaker, since 2003, we have continued to see senseless death due  to uncontrolled unwillingness in this body to do what we know we can  do: to do background checks, to make sure that we provide a pathway for  those who have mental health concerns to receive treatment, and to ban  AK-47s and AR-15s.   If you are 18 and have to be registered to drive in the United States  of America, you should also have to be registered to carry a firearm.   We know there are plenty of stories of gun violence that are not  shared on the House floor, and many more receive no media coverage.   The gun epidemic has hit underserved communities of color  particularly hard. Gun homicide rates in these neighborhoods have  reached a critical point, where homicide rates often reach 10 times the  national average.                                time  2015    While gun-related deaths have fallen in New York, in parts of my  district, the death toll has risen since last year. In Brownsville,  Brooklyn alone, murders are up.   Mr. Speaker, we are in the midst of a national crisis. Urban violence  has too often been left out of the national conversation about guns,  gun running, and gun trafficking, and instead, too often, the epidemic  in urban centers is used by many as a misguided, misdirected  distraction so that our conversations on gun reform, racial justice, or  police tactics are disregarded. But gun violence intervention programs  have been shown to be effective at breaking the cycle of violence and  impacting communities.   The question is: Will Congress truly get serious about supporting  these programs? Will we get serious about universal background checks?  Will we get serious about limiting access to weapons of war?   Nine out of 10 Americans agree that we should have universal  background checks, including three out of four NRA members. But this  Republican Congress has shown to be spineless.   In the East Room of the White House, the President expressed his  solidarity with the people of Santa Fe and said his administration  would do everything in its power to protect schools and keep guns away  from those who should not have them.   Just earlier this year, he also vowed to take action after the  Parkland shooting. At that time, the President said he would look at  stricter background checks and raising the minimum age for buying an  assault weapon. But Donald Trump did not press for  [[Page H4276]]  any action on any of those initiatives. Lies, once again, to the  American people. Congress did not follow through. Shame on us for our  inaction. We are well past time for action, Mr. Speaker. The time is  now.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the Second District of  Louisiana (Mr. Richmond) to address this Special Order hour of the  Congressional Black Caucus, our chairman.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for those  very thoughtful words. I hope that our colleagues on the other side of  the aisle will heed his admonition because, indeed, action needs to be  taken, and it needs to be taken now.   Without further ado, it is my honor and privilege to yield to the  gentlewoman from the Second District of Illinois, Ms. Robin Kelly, who  has been an ardent defender, an outspoken advocate for gun violence  prevention.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Illinois for her words and for really laying out the framework for  which this Congress needs to act. She said that it is a shame and a  disgrace. I agree wholeheartedly. But I think that even more, our  Republican colleagues need to search their souls, particularly those  who claim to be of the Christian faith, which is the faith that I  practice. Indeed, they are going to be called to account for their  inaction. All I would ask is that the Lord have mercy on their souls,  because there is blood on their hands.   Mr. Speaker, having said that, I yield to the gentlewoman from the  Third District of Ohio, Mrs. Joyce Beatty, an outspoken advocate, one  who comes from a State where, again, gun rights are something that  people pride themselves in. Commonsense gun measures are something that  everyone is crying out for.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) for bringing her plea to the floor. She is  absolutely correct. The inaction of the Speaker of the House of  Representatives on the matter of gun violence in America is appalling.   So we call on him to bring bipartisan legislation to the floor. We  have the votes to pass it. The question is: Do we have the will? Do we  have the spine? Do we have the courage to do what needs to be done in  the 21st century to protect our communities from this onslaught of gun  violence?   Having said that, it is now my honor and my privilege to to yield to  my coanchor to share his thoughts with us this evening, none other than  the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Dwight Evans.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for his words of wisdom and for his  statistical data.   And just to add to the conversation is that we have not counted those  who were injured in all of these gun violence episodes across this  Nation, those who have been traumatized by exposure to such carnage  that is unfolding right before their very eyes. There are individuals  in hospitals right now, as we speak, trying to recover from the most  horrific gun violence that has ever hit their communities. We don't  know that all of them will heal, and, you know, this should be  motivation to everyone in this Chamber to act.   We are all just a moment away from a tragic occurrence. And as a  matter of fact, it wasn't that long ago that our colleagues were set  upon at a Congressional Baseball Game practice. It boggles the mind.  You have to ask yourself, where is the sanity when individuals who were  gunned down at a Congressional Baseball Game practice have not mustered  up the courage to bring a bill to the floor? Unbelievable.  Unforgivable.   Having said that, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina,  Alma Adams, the 12th District, who is an advocate as well for  commonsense gun measures in this Nation to come and bring her comments  at this time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the  12th District of North Carolina, the Honorable Alma Adams, for bringing  her comments to the floor. At this time, clearly across this Nation, we  represent very different districts, but there is one thing that we all  have in common, and that is a reverence and a real concern about the  human condition; and the fact that here we are, once again, coming to  the floor to plead with the leadership of this body to bring  commonsense gun violence prevention laws to the people of this country.  We won't stop until that occurs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson  Coleman), an outspoken advocate, who has done everything within her  power to bring a voice to the voiceless, particularly those who are  trying to come to grips with the violence that is unleashed in this  Nation, and the lack of action coming from the leadership here in the  House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  those comments. I feel her sense of frustration, I feel her outrage,  and I think many Americans--as a matter of fact, the majority of  Americans--do when they hear the outcries of the parents who have  learned that their children have been gunned down in school; when they  see their children on lifesaving equipment in hospitals because they  are hanging on to life by a thread; when they see their children duck  down under their beds because they hear a car backfire, having  flashbacks from the trauma they experienced in school, hearing mass  gunfire taking place before their very eyes; when they don't want to go  to school because they remember the rivers of blood that they witnessed  as children and teachers' lives were being sucked out of them, due to  the gun violence that was unleashed in a place that is supposed to be  safe for them to learn, to grow, and to mature.   Mr. Speaker, we can't hear you.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott),  someone who the Congressional Black Caucus looks to for a lot of our  legislation when it comes to criminal justice, and when it comes to  understanding the role that we can play in advancing progressive  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the  Third District of Virginia, the Honorable Bobby Scott, for those  comments.   Mr. Speaker, I neglected to mention that he is the ranking member on  the Committee on Education and the Workforce, and has really brought  forth to us the real tangible information that we have about what  happens to our young people in school when such tragedies occur, and  what all of the fallout and by-products can be when we institute  nonsensical policies, like having teachers arm themselves in the  classroom, or the overreliance of law enforcement in the school  environment.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for bringing those facts  to the floor and really laying out for the American people what it  really means for our students to have to experience this violence  within what is supposed to be the sanctity of their classrooms.                                time  2100    Having said that, let me just close this evening's Special Order hour  by expressing sort of the collective outrage of the members of the  Congressional Black Caucus for the inaction of our Speaker and our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle in the Republican Party who  are not stepping up to show courage and determination to really bring  an end to what we see as a violent epidemic in our Nation at this time.   Our colleague called upon colleagues in the body today to stand with  him if they had witnessed or have experienced gun violence in their  communities, to stand with the families whose names he read off today  of children who perished in Texas. I found it interesting, when I  looked at the floor--I didn't go to the floor because I knew it was  just a ploy. But when I looked and saw how many colleagues were  standing there with him, I said, if only they brought some legislation  to the floor to end all of this, it would pass, because just about  every colleague has been impacted by this outbreak in horrible gun  violence across this Nation.   We need our legislation to be brought to the floor. Not doing so is  really an affront to the American people, and it is certainly  uncivilized and, some would even say, barbaric, because we have the  knowledge, the wherewithal, and the ability to make a difference in the  lives of the American people. It is up to us, the people who they have  elected, to do the work that must be done on their behalf.   Enough is enough, Mr. Speaker. Lives are being lost minute by minute,  hour by hour, day by day, month by month, year by year in America  because of the inaction of the Republican majority in the House of  Representatives.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
