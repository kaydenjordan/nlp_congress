 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the  accomplishments of Navy Midshipman Third Class Duke Anthony Carillo,  who died suddenly and unexpectedly, training to serve his country in  the United States military.   Duke was just 21 years old but had already distinguished himself as a  hardworking, patriotic American. Duke was a gifted student and athlete  from Flower Mound, Texas, where he was captain of his high school  football and wrestling teams and earned the highest rank of Eagle  Scout.   Kind, generous, and fun-loving, Duke enriched the lives of his  friends and family as well as the lives of his classmates at the Naval  Academy.   I knew Duke personally. He was my son Ryan's roommate and best friend  at Annapolis.   We mourn his loss. Our country lost a dedicated public servant, one  of those special people whose entire purpose was the defense of our  great country so the rest of us can live in peace.   Duke never expected acclaim or accolades. He was doing his duty, just  like his twin brother, Dylan, and younger brother, Jake, also  midshipmen at the Naval Academy, a strong testament to the faith and  devotion of their parents.   Though he left us at a young age, we can all learn from Duke's  example.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family.                            ____________________
