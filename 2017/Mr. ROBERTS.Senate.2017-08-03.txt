 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs be discharged from  further consideration of S. 1616 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be  considered read a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill.    Mr.  President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.  Mr.  President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time.  I know of no  further debate on the bill.  I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I rise also to talk about my dear friend  and mentor, Bob Dole. Senator Dole just celebrated his 94th birthday,  and I think it is obviously right and proper to honor his contributions  to our Nation.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S4805, August 3, 2017, near the top of the second  column, the following language appears: . . . items.   Mr. President, I rise . . .      The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . items.  Mr. President, I  rise . . .    ========================= END NOTE =========================     Let me tell you a little bit about Bob Dole. He comes from Russell,  KS. You can't get any more Kansas than Russell. Growing up during the  Great Depression, Bob Dole learned the values of hard work and  discipline, which is the mark of a Kansas upbringing and the heart of  what I call Kansas values.   In 1941, Bob Dole enrolled at the University of Kansas as a premed  student. During his time at KU, he played for the basketball, football,  and track teams. Being a K-State alum, I don't always hold that against  him, but his collegiate studies were interrupted by World War II. And  when he answered the call to duty, he joined the U.S. Army. During a  military offensive in Italy, he was very seriously wounded while trying  to save a fellow soldier. Despite his grave injuries, Bob recovered and  was awarded two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star with an Oak Leaf  Cluster for his service. He is indeed a warrior and a hero.    After the war, Bob returned to Kansas, studied the law, and was  elected to the Kansas House of Representatives. He soon moved to the  U.S. House of Representatives and served two Kansas districts from 1961  to 1969, including my old district, if I can refer to it in that way,  ``The Big First.''   In 1969, Bob Dole was elected to the U.S. Senate and served until  1996. Now, over the course of this period, he served as chairman of the  Republican National Committee, chairman of the Finance Committee,  Senate minority leader, and then Senate majority leader.   During his time in Washington, Senator Dole was known for his ability  to work across the aisle and embrace practical bipartisanship on the  issues, such as tax reform, Social Security, and many other pressing  issues. I would call this the Kansas approach to legislating. He has  been a lifelong advocate for the disabled and was a key figure in the  passing of the Americans with Disabilities Act back in 1990.   After his appointment as majority leader, Bob Dole set the record as  the Nation's longest serving Republican leader in the Senate of the  United States. Several Presidents of the United States have especially  honored Bob for his hard work and leadership in the public sector. For  example, President Reagan awarded Bob Dole the Presidential Citizens  Medal in 1989.   President Reagan stated:         Whether on the battlefield or Capitol Hill, Senator Dole       has served America heroically. Serving as Senate Majority       Leader during one of the most productive Congresses of recent       time, he has also been a friend to veterans, farmers, and       Americans from every walk of life. Bob Dole has stood for       integrity, straight talk and achievement throughout his years       of distinguished public service.    So said our former President, Ronald Reagan.   As I said, they are Kansas values.   Likewise, in 1997, President Clinton awarded Senator Dole with the  Presidential Medal of Freedom saying:         Son of the soil, citizen, soldier and legislator, Bob Dole       understands the American people, their struggles, their       triumphs and their dreams. . . . In times of conflict and       crisis, he has worked to keep America united and strong. . .       . Our country is better for his courage, his determination,       and his willingness to go the long course to lead America.    So said our former President, Bill Clinton.   Senator Dole remains active today, serving as the national chairman  of the World War II Memorial Campaign, a memorial that simply would not  be in existence today had it not been for his perseverance, leadership,  and cochair of the Families of Freedom Scholarship Fund.   In 2007 President George W. Bush appointed Bob to cochair the  President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded  Warriors, which inspected and reformed the system of medical care  received by U.S. soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.   He remains the strongest advocate for veterans, having volunteered on  a weekly basis for more than a decade on behalf of the national Honor  Flight Network.   As a person who has gone to the World War II Memorial, along with Bob  Dole, I know I greet the veterans at the bus. They immediately get off  the bus. Whether they are from Kansas or any other State, they are very  proud to come to see their memorial. The first question they ask is  this: Where is Bob? Is Bob here? Then, they flock to him like a mother  hen. Maybe, that is not the best example, but it certainly shows the  pride and the desire of our veterans to meet the man who did so much  for their memorial.   I am also proud that he serves today as the finance chairman of the  campaign for the national Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial, leading the  private fundraising effort to memorialize President Dwight David  Eisenhower, our favorite son in Kansas, here in Washington, something  near and dear to both of us. I am privileged to be the chairman of the  Eisenhower Memorial Commission.   It is abundantly clear that throughout his long service to our  country, Bob Dole has embodied the American spirit of leadership and  determination, and he serves as one of the most prolific role models  both in and outside of politics.   I am reminded of the time when I was stationed at Quantico as a young  marine and my dad, Wes Roberts, who was  [[Page S4806]]  a friend and adviser to Bob, said: I want to take you up to the Hill to  meet Congressman Bob Dole. I consider him to have the highest potential  to be whatever he wants with regard to public service.   So I went up to the Hill, and I met this handsome young man. He  didn't sit on his hands very long in terms of what he wanted to  accomplish. I first met him then, and, then, as a staffer for my  predecessor, the Honorable Keith Sebelius, a congressman from ``The Big  First'' and, then, as a Member of the House for 16 years.   I tell the story that most people in the House thought that whatever  I proposed or whatever I was for, Bob Dole was for me. Well, about 50  percent of that was true, but I never told them about the other 50  percent. So I was really able to get a lot done.   Bob, thank you for that.   I am so proud--so proud--to call him friend. I am proud to serve his  State. I am equally proud today that each Senator--each and every  Senator and colleagues on both sides of the aisle--have joined me in  honoring Senator Bob Dole with a Congressional Gold Medal--all 100. It  didn't take very long.   I yield the floor   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
