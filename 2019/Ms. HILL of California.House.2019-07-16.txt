 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself as much time as I  may consume. I rise in support of an amendment to H.R. 3494.   I believe strongly in the principle of government transparency. It is  something I ran on and talk about. I have spent my time in Congress  working to deliver on accountability and transparency as the vice chair  of the Oversight and Reform Committee and through other legislation.   Today, I am introducing this amendment to clarify what Congress  already believes to be the law, that Federal whistleblowers have the  ability to make protected disclosures to the appropriate congressional  committee of jurisdiction, not just members of the Intelligence  Committee.   At a time like this, we cannot afford ambiguity. This technical  change will allow congressional committees to conduct their business in  a more timely and effective manner.   This amendment is not my first effort to protect whistleblowers, nor  will it be my last. Those with the courage to stand up and say  something is not right should have every single protection that we, as  Congress, can offer to them.   Madam Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
