 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for  the great work he has done and for his leadership on this issue.   I do agree with my colleague from California, yes, we need to do  modernization. If you will remember, President Obama pledged to  modernize our nuclear forces in return for the Senate passing the New  START Treaty.   The current national posture review, which has been endorsed by  security officials from several administrations going back, both  Democratic and Republican, says this:   Maintaining and operating our current aging nuclear forces now  requires between 2 and 3 percent of the DOD budget. The replacement  program to rebuild the triad for decades of service will peak for  several years at only approximately 4 percent beyond the ongoing 2 to 3  percent needed for maintenance and operations.   This 6.4 percent, just slightly under the 7 percent that the chairman  mentioned, of the current DOD budget required for the long-term  replacement program represents less than 1 percent of the overall  Federal budget. That is a bargain.   Nuclear warfare is, God forbid it should ever happen, an existential  threat. One percent of our Federal budget devoted to preventing that is  truly worth investing in. The modernization needs to take place. It is  well within the moneys that are going to be available to the Department  of Defense in the coming years.   I agree with the chairman that projecting 20 or 30 years out contains  so many potential inaccuracies, it would be kind of an unnecessary and  burdensome exercise, and not very useful. We do have and will have the  money. It is a vital investment.   I agree with the chairman. Let's turn this amendment down.    Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for  the great work he is doing on this.   We all agree that we want a strong nuclear deterrent, and we all  agree we want that deterrent to be as stabilizing as possible. We don't  want destabilizing trends. We all agree with that.   General John Hyten, Commander of U.S. Strategic Command, testified  before the House and said:         We require a mix of yields and improved platforms to       credibly deter the threats of the near future. The National       Posture Review directs near-term fielding of a low-yield SLBM       capability and, in the longer term, pursuit of a modern,       nuclear-armed, sea-launched cruise missile.    So the commander of U.S. Strategic Command says we do need this  option.   And let me also quote James Miller, Undersecretary of Defense for  Policy  [[Page H4562]]  under the Obama administration, the principal author of President  Obama's Nuclear Posture Review: ``Secretary of Defense James Mattis'  2018 Nuclear Posture Review offers continuity with past U.S. policy and  plans, including those in the 2010 NPR. It deserves broad bipartisan  support. Its proposal for a low-yield SLBM weapon and a new nuclear- tipped, sea-launched cruise missile are sensible responses to changed  security conditions, especially Russia and North Korea.''   Well, things have changed since 2010. That is what the 2018 NPR  addresses. So, from both administrations, from both sides of the aisle,  we have agreement that we do need this low-yield option. That is a  stabilizing influence, to have more tools in the toolbox. When you have  fewer tools, you have fewer options, and that is destabilizing.   Mr. Chair, I ask for a rejection of this amendment.
