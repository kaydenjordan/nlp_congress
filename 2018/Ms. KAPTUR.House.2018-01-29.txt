 Mr. Speaker, I rise to call out our Republican colleagues  for still having left community health centers falling off a funding  cliff for this year.   Long-term funding for community health centers expired last September  30. These health centers serve more than 25 million patients in all  States in this Union and U.S. territories and employ over 50,000  professionals in the health field nationwide.   In Ohio, more than 85 percent of health center patients fall below  200 percent of the poverty line--the poorest of the poor. In 2015, Ohio  health centers served over 600,000 patients--over half a million.   Don't our Republican colleagues understand an ounce of prevention is  worth a pound of cure?   Community health centers remain the Nation's largest source of  primary, comprehensive care for medically underserved populations. They  are fundamental to life in our communities and neighborhoods, whether  they be urban, rural, or small town.   In 2015, America celebrated 50 years of the success of community  health centers. This Congress and its Republican majority should not  continue to let our constituents down who rely so heavily upon these  health centers in life-and-death situations.                            ____________________
