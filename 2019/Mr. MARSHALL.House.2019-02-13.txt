 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call upon all Members of  Congress to stand beside Israel and confront anti-Semitism, ethnic  hatred, and prejudice-driven boycotts, whether at home, abroad, and  certainly for Members of this Chamber.   We, as a country, cannot tolerate this behavior, and certainly this  Chamber has no room for bigotry. Furthermore, I must warn the general  public that despite the warranted outcry we saw in response to the  Representative from Minnesota's irresponsible comments, this is the new  normal for the liberal base in America.   To be clear, anti-Semitism has become an all-too-common occurrence in  politics among the Democrat base and the far left who see Israel as  nothing more than an extension of phantom corruption and colonialism.   Politicians who appeal to this type of ignorance are simply shoring  up a new Democratic constituency. That is the ethos that primed the  Minnesota Representative's ludicrous and insulting accusation of  ``bought-and-paid-for'' politicians who stand with Israel.   It is that type of loose, cheap, anti-Semitic rhetoric that led to  the rise of the Third Reich. It is clear to all of us, there are a  couple of our new colleagues across the aisle that need to be reminded.  In fact, they need to admit that the brutal regime of Iran continues to  be the chief obstacle to peace and security in the Middle East, and  thus, the root of most all terrorism that threatens our homeland.   For decades, Iran's funding of terrorism and extremist groups in the  region has fueled violence, civil war, and bloodshed. The Iranian  Parliament literally burned the U.S. flag on their parliament floor and  chants, ``death to Israel,'' and ``death to America'' in their streets.   At home, all Americans must oppose the radical and xenophobic  boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement which are promulgated by  the left. This BDS campaign is peddled by intellectually dishonest  anti-Semites whose sole purpose is to attack Israel, attempting to  delegitimize and isolate it from the rest of the world.   Any Member of this congressional body with ties to the BDS movement  should renounce them immediately. We must hold our elected officials  accountable. Whether on Twitter or in the Halls of Congress, disgusting  insinuations and bigotry must be condemned in all forms. Those who  continue the use of anti-Semitic rhetoric should be held accountable  for their actions.   The Democrats should follow the high standards and the high bar that  the Republican leader has taken when it comes to committee assignments  to those who make bigoted remarks.   America must continue to stand together in support of Israel and in  support of peace in the Middle East and the world. We must build upon  our unbreakable alliance with Israel and overcome the challenges that  come with building a better, safer world.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, since I was a freshman in high school, I wanted to  become a physician. I was blessed to get to do that. By the time of my  second year in medical school, my wife and I had our first daughter,  and most of us were trying to decide what type of doctor we were going  to be. The moment that little girl was born, I knew that I wanted to  spend my medical career delivering babies.   I think my wife can attest that, for the next 30 years of my life,  most of my waking moments were spent with somebody in labor. I was so  blessed to get to participate in that wonderful moment.  [[Page H1563]]    I was blessed to get to go to Congress and represent the people of  Kansas.   I woke up a couple weeks ago to the cheering of State legislators  from New York and their Governor. I turned up the volume to see what  the fuss was. The fuss was they were celebrating their ability to  murder the same babies that I had been trying to protect and deliver  for the last 30 years of my life.   I don't think there are any Americans--I have never met such an  American--who would think that it is right to murder a baby moments,  days, or weeks before its due date. It is the most barbaric law I have  ever heard of in our society.   If this wasn't enough, I turned the news on a week later, and now  they are talking about murdering babies after they were born from so- called failed abortions.   I cannot believe that I live in a society that would even think about  this. So I went to my office the next day, and I got my staff together  and said, look, we have got some legislation that is going to take care  of this. We have our born survivor abortion bill that protects babies  after they are born, and then we have a pain-capable bill as well to  protect babies who are able to feel pain from being aborted.   My staff looked at me: Right, we have got that legislation.   I said: All we will need is 20 or 30 Democrats to sign on to this.  Surely, the Speaker of the House is against late-term abortion. Surely,  she is against infanticide.   My staff looked at me with bewildered eyes and said: Congressman, I  don't think we are going to find any Democrats to do that.   I wanted to talk a second about the moms, too. No one is talking  about how horrible this is going to be for mothers. Moms are going to  die from these late-term abortions. As an obstetrician, I never did an  abortion, but guess who takes care of complications from abortions. It  is obstetricians.   I remember the first week I was in residency. I was called to the  emergency room, and there before me was a lady in shock. I apologize if  this is too graphic, but the situation is so graphic, I have to tell  you the details.   This young lady was bleeding out buckets of blood. I found out what  had happened is she just had had an abortion done hours before, and now  she was hemorrhaging.   I looked at the nurse. I said: What is going on here?   I knew that we needed to take her to the operating room. We found out  during the procedure that a piece of that baby was still inside her  uterus, and the uterus couldn't clamp down, so she was hemorrhaging.   This is a story I would see over and over again. The later the  abortion procedure is done in the pregnancy, the more often we are  going to see this. People are going to get perforated uteri. It will be  catastrophic for women.   Mr. Speaker, we can't allow this to continue.
