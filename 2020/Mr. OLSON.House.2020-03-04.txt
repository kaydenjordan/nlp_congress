 Madam Speaker, last Thursday night, as the House was  recessed, I stood at this podium with a future President of the United  States of America. His name is Hank Wolgamott. He is on the right in  this picture.   Hank is one of my bosses in Texas 22. When he was 9 years old, his  left arm was in a cast. The doctors said he had fractured his elbow.  They were wrong. Blood was going into his elbow joint. He had severe  hemophilia.   With the love of his mom, Amanda; his dad, Jesse; and his brother,  Jack, Hank went to war against his condition, even though he was too  young to know what was happening inside his body.  [[Page H1477]]    At 16 months old, he had a port placed in his left chest as part of  his immune tolerance induction therapy. That was there for over 6  years. A fever or a fall meant a trip to the hospital to stop the  bleeding. But Hank soldiered on.   My dad always told me: There are no guarantees in life. I have been  alive now for 57 years and 3 months, and my dad has never been wrong-- until I met Hank. There is a new guarantee in my life: Never bet  against Hank Wolgamott. Hank always wins.   Vote for Hank in 2048. You will be glad you did.                            ____________________
