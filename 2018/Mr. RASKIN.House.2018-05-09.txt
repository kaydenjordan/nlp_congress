 Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be leading this Special  Order hour on the SNAP program and the current threats against it in  the farm bill.   SNAP, of course, is America's most important antihunger program,  serving more than 42 million Americans and delivering improved  economic, health, and nutrition outcomes for millions of our families,  reducing poverty and food insecurity.   To kick us off tonight, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great  State of Washington, Pramila Jayapal, my distinguished colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jayapal for her  terrific leadership on the SNAP program and for defending the ability  of all of our families to not send their kids to bed at night hungry.  That is really what this is all about.   People on the SNAP program receive an average of only $1.40 per meal,  and in order to get assistance, of course, they have got to complete a  detailed application process with meticulous documentation of their  name, their legal status in the country, their identity, their income,  their address, and so on. Ninety percent of participants are in  households with children under the age of 18, or with elderly people,  or with individuals with disabilities.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to yield next to our distinguished colleague  from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Ellison) very much. He makes an excellent point which is, more than  two-thirds of SNAP participants are in families with children, and in  the majority of those, you have at least one working adult in the  house.                                time  1700    So despite efforts to portray this as some kind of welfare, we are  talking about millions of Americans who are working but still can't  afford to feed their families. That is what the SNAP program is about.  It is about helping working families meet the basic nutritional  standards of our people.   We are the richest society in the history of the world, and we can  certainly support working families, through the SNAP program, to  benefit from the great bounty that is the agricultural output of the  United States of America, which is the breadbasket of the world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield now to our colleague from California, Nanette  Barragan. I thank Ms. Barragan very much for joining us.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Barragan very much for her  leadership in defending the SNAP program. She talked about California.  I just want to add to her point, a point about my home State in  Maryland, where the SNAP program reaches 684,000 residents of my State,  which is more than 1 in 10 people who live in the State.   Nationally, of course, it is 42 million people who participate in the  SNAP program, which is 13 percent of the total population. And that is  not a stagnant, permanent pool of Americans; that is a transient group  because people move in and move out according to their economic  circumstances.   The SNAP program is a reflection of our investment in ourselves as a  people and our determination that here, in the wealthiest country on  Earth, nobody should be sending their kids to bed at night hungry.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield to our distinguished colleague  from New Jersey, Bonnie Watson Coleman.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Coleman for her comments. She  has made some very important points, and I wonder if I would pursue a  couple with her before she goes, perhaps have a moment for colloquy.   The first is the point she was making about the growing economic  inequality in the country. That is something that has been on the minds  of Americans, at the very least, since the Occupy movement took place  after the 2008 mortgage meltdown crisis, which cost 11 million  Americans their jobs, 12 million Americans their homes, and created an  economic dislocation panic across the country, which thankfully  President Obama and his administration moved to address, unleashing 60  straight months of economic growth and expansion in the country.   Today we have an administration which vowed to drain the swamp when  it came to Washington. It seems like they have moved into the swamp and  they are just draining the treasury instead: $1.5 trillion added to our  budget deficit from the tax scam giveaway, which you referenced.   I wonder if she would reflect for a moment on the relationship  between a vision of government, which is that it is a money-making  operation for a handful of people, and growing inequality and poverty  among other parts of the population.    Mr. Speaker, let me ask Mrs. Coleman one final question  before she goes. She made a point before which I thought was profound,  [[Page H3872]]  which is that millions and millions of people on the SNAP program are  working, but they are not making enough money to support their family  in a dignified way, in a way that lives up to even the most minimal  expectations for health and nutrition. That is what the SNAP program is  all about. In a way, you could view the SNAP program as a subsidy to  the employers of these people because we are taking care of them  because their salaries don't.   Now, I could understand someone saying: Let's get rid of the SNAP  program and make those employers pay a real living wage to these  people, or let's make them pay a full living wage and give them all  healthcare. But that is not the proposal that we are getting from our  friends from across the aisle. They want to reduce the SNAP program at  the same time that they don't want to increase the minimum wage and  give people benefits.   I wonder if she could just explain what the theory is about how these  people are going to survive.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Coleman for her strong voice  and for participating in tonight's Special Order hour.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield to our distinguished colleague  from Connecticut, Rosa DeLauro, who has been one of Congress' leading  champions for the security of America's working people and for building  an American middle class that includes everybody.   I am thrilled that Ms. DeLauro could join us, and I yield to her now.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. DeLauro, and I would ask if she  would be willing to stick around just for a little colloquy.    Mr. Speaker, Ms. DeLauro made some really striking  points, and I wanted to explore them a little bit more.   The tax bill, as we know, created a windfall bonanza of hundreds of  billions of dollars for the wealthiest corporations and the wealthiest  people in the country. Eighty-six percent of the benefit from the tax  cut went to 1 percent of the people.   The interesting thing to me was that because it went overwhelmingly  to investors, and one-third of the investment in our companies is held  by foreigners, a third of the benefit of this tax cut just left the  country. It went to foreign investors in Saudi Arabia or China or  Mexico or wherever it might be.   Now, does it make sense for us to confer this extraordinary bonanza  on the wealthiest people in the country and wealthy people abroad, and  then turn around and start cutting the major antihunger assistance  program we have got, the SNAP program? I mean, what is the morality of  that? What is the logic of that?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut.    Mr. Speaker, I would say to Ms. DeLauro that that came  out of the Agriculture Committee, as I understand it, on a party line  vote.    Mr. Speaker, this used to be bipartisan. It used to be a  bipartisan commitment, and now, suddenly, it fell apart with no  participation from Democrats. It comes flying out with the idea of  targeting the SNAP program. What is going on here?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut.    Mr. Speaker, they are both from farm States.    Mr. Speaker, I want to follow up on something Ms. DeLauro  said, which I think is very important.   She pointed out that it was Senator Robert Dole, a Republican from  Kansas; and Senator George McGovern, a Democrat from South Dakota, who  came together and said: We have this extraordinary agricultural bounty  and surplus in America.   We could be feeding the entire world. Certainly we could be feeding  the people of America. Most people are able to afford it, but not  everybody, and not at every point in their life. We should make sure  that, in the wealthiest society that has ever existed, everybody has  the opportunity to eat three meals a day for $1.40.   Ms. DeLauro said that we don't have the giants that we had then. I  don't know if that is true. I consider the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro) a giant.   But I think what has changed is the public philosophy that is  governing in Washington. I think there is a public philosophy that  survives in town, which says that government is a moneymaking  opportunity for the President and a handful of people: the President's  friends and the people who surround the President. People are actually  making money coming into government.   Whereas, the traditional ideal--the one I think Ms. DeLauro invoked  with Senators Dole and McGovern and the new deal and Franklin  Roosevelt--was government is an instrument of the common good to  benefit everybody to advance the general will.   What has happened to our concept of government in America?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro) for her leadership, for her vision, and for her writing.  It is incisive and useful for us all.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Adams).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Adams so much for her insightful  remarks. Before Ms. Adams leaves, I would like to ask her a question.   Working in Washington and coming here several days a week, as Members  of Congress do, we are often treated to the spectacle of lifestyles of  the rich and famous and political corruption. We see Scott Pruitt, the  EPA chief, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on first-class air  travel with a security detail of a dozen people, something nobody has  ever seen before for an EPA chief. He built, I think it was, a $40,000  soundproof booth in his office in order to make secret phone calls.   Last night, we saw on TV, or pick up the paper this morning to read  about, millions of dollars flowing into an up-till-now secret bank  account that Michael Cohen had. Part of it was used as a slush fund to  pay off a porn star, who had a relationship, allegedly, with President  Trump. But then hundreds of thousands of dollars flowing in from one of  the oligarchs in Russia with U.S. corporations involved.   There is a lot of money in this town. The power elite seems to have a  lot of money, and gave hundreds of billions of dollars back to the  wealthiest corporations and people in the country in the most recent  tax legislation. Yet they get through with that, and then they turn and  they want to pound the SNAP program, which is used to give a modicum of  dignity and security to the poorest people in the country so that they  can feed their families.   What is going on here?   How is it possible that we can see one kind of America operating in  the Halls of power with the wealthiest people in the country, and  another for the working people of the country who are trying to get by?    Mr. Speaker, three-quarters of SNAP benefits go to  families: households with children in them. That should be what people  think of when they think of the SNAP program.  [[Page H3875]]    We heard a lot today in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee  hearing that was referenced earlier, basically about lazy people  sitting around. I tried to alter the image a little bit. I said: You  can have lazy people who get a paycheck in public housing and  they spend all day watching TV, tweeting, and filing for bankruptcy.  You have lazy people in the middle class. You have rich lazy people and  you have poor lazy people.     Mr. Speaker, we are not going to be able to eliminate  laziness, but maybe we can take care of hunger in America so that kids  don't go to sleep without food.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ms. Adams for her leadership and her  strong voice on these issues. It is very impressive to see how hard she  has been fighting.    Mr. Speaker, in my district, I have urban, suburban, and  rural. I have urban places like Rockville, Maryland; I have suburban  places like Bethesda and Silver Spring; I have rural places in  Frederick County like Middletown and Carroll County. I have sort of the  full gamut of America in my district, and there is poverty in all of  them. There are people struggling in all of them, just like there are  people who have become very prosperous in all of them.   But our job, I think, as Representatives in Congress, is to keep the  country unified and see what that beautiful, magical phrase in the  beginning of the Constitution ``We the people'' means. For us to stand  together in all of our magnificent diversity of ways of life and  different kinds of communities that we have across the country, what is  it that binds us together?   I think the goodness of the American people is that we are invested  in the success of everybody, not just this or that group, not just our  business buddies, not just our partners, not just people in our  political party, but we are invested in the success of everyone, and  that is our job.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Adams for participating.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee),  my distinguished colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Jackson Lee for her really  profound and important remarks tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I would close out our session here by just making an  observation about the importance of this SNAP question.   It is important legislatively because our friends across the aisle  have broken from a bipartisan tradition going back a very long time now  in the passage of the farm bill just to make it a partisan power grab  and a push over everybody else in the body, but it also goes to the  question: What kind of government are we going to have? Will this be  government for the few or will it be a government for everyone?   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
