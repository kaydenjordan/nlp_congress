 Madam Speaker, with all the respect in the world to my  colleague from Pennsylvania, to the extent he wants to talk about Joe  Biden's America, let's stick to the facts.   In Joe Biden's America, wage growth is up, and unemployment is down.  In Joe Biden's America, family income is up, and prescription drug  pricing is poised to go down.   That is why I am excited to be here today, Madam Speaker, to support  the Build Back Better Act and speak in support of this transformative,  historic legislation that will inure to the benefit of each and every  American.   There is a lot to be proud of in this bill, such as the tax cuts for  working families that it will deliver, the jobs that it will create,  and the costs for working families that it will lower.   But for me, personally, the part that I am most enthused and excited  about is universal pre-K because, as the Speaker knows, I am a father.  I have a young 3-year-old daughter who started preschool this year.  There is nothing that can bring a smile to my face more than seeing my  daughter after a day at preschool, seeing how much she has enjoyed it  and how much she has learned. We are lucky to be able to send her to  school, but many families in Colorado and across the country are not.   Thanks to President Biden's vision, universal pre-K for every 3-year- old and 4-year-old in the United States of America will be a reality.   So let's pass this bill. Let's send it to the Senate. Let's get it  across the finish line. And let's deliver for the American people.                                time  1815
