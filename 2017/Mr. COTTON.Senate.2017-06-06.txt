 Mr. President, I wish to add my support this morning for  Courtney Elwood as the next general counsel of the CIA--not that she  really needs it. In her many years of public service and private  practice, Courtney has earned the esteem of her colleagues across both  parties and two administrations. David Kris, an Obama appointee, calls  her ``a first-class lawyer.'' Ben Powell, a Bush appointee, calls her  ``one of the finest lawyers of her generation.'' Caroline Krass,  another Obama appointee, calls her ``an excellent choice.'' And Wan  Kim, another Bush appointee, says she is ``careful, brilliant, and  highly accomplished.''   In other words, you don't need me to tell you Courtney Elwood is a  first-rate attorney. In fact, you don't need anyone to tell you that  because her accomplishments speak for themselves.   She graduated from Yale Law School in 1994 and went on to clerk for  both Judge Mike Luttig on the Fourth Circuit and then-Chief Justice  William Rehnquist at the Supreme Court. After spending some time in  private practice, she worked for 6 years in the George W. Bush  administration, rising from associate counsel to the President, to  deputy counsel to the Vice President, to Deputy Chief of Staff and  Counselor to the Attorney General.   We are not talking about a rookie lawyer who is inexperienced in the  ways of Washington or in the corridors of power. Her commitment to the  law is unquestioned and unquestionable. She is just the person we need  for this position.   The general counsel of the CIA will help Director Pompeo navigate the  many twists and turns of the thorny legal terrain as our intelligence  community defends our country against a wide range of threats:  terrorism, cyber warfare, and good, old-fashioned espionage. We need  people of the highest caliber serving at our national security  agencies, and there is broad agreement that Courtney Elwood fits the  bill.   I am happy to support her nomination, and I thank her and her family  for answering the call to serve once again.   (The remarks of Mr. Cotton pertaining to the introduction of S. 1297  are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills  and Joint Resolutions.'')   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, in the critical debate about the  balance between national security and rights to privacy, the truth must  be paramount. Time and again, President Trump has misled the American  public about national security matters, including torture,  surveillance, and intelligence. Trump has claimed that ``torture  works'' and that ``we should go much stronger than waterboarding,''  despite widespread evidence that enhanced interrogation techniques are  not effective in acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from  detainees. Without any evidence, President Trump alleged that President  Obama illegally wiretapped the phones of Trump Towers. Former FBI  Director James Comey soundly rejected this conspiracy theory, a  statement that likely played a role in his firing. President Trump  repeatedly dismissed intelligence that Russia interfered in our 2016  elections and derided our intelligence community for its assessments.  His rejection of truth, to stoke fear and resentment in the American  public, is unethical and dangerous. It is a threat to American  freedoms.   In this extraordinary environment, the CIA's leadership must not only  provide objective and sound intelligence assessments to the President,  it must faithfully ensure that the President is adhering to the law.  The role of the General Counsel is particularly critical at this  moment, when our sitting President has openly denounced or displayed  alarming ignorance of existing laws on intelligence matters. As the CIA  General Counsel's guidance is provided entirely in secret, with no  public transparency, it is imperative that the American public have as  clear an understanding as possible of the nominee's prior record of  legal interpretation.   On this point, Courtney Elwood's history under President George W.  Bush is troubling. At the Department of Justice, Ms. Elwood was  involved in discussions regarding the legal justification for the  ``warrantless wiretapping program,'' in which the Bush administration  collected telephonic and email communications of U.S. persons on U.S.  soil without a court order. The Bush administration, in memos that are  now declassified, argued that the President has inherent constitutional  power to monitor Americans' communications without a warrant in a time  of war. Given the perennial nature of America's war footing, this  argument afforded the President a virtually unlimited authority to  surveil Americans. When asked for her views on this legal justification  in testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Ms.  Elwood asserted that the program was ``carefully reasoned'' and that  the Justice Department was ``thorough in its analysis.''   Ms. Elwood's record on torture is also cause for concern. While I was  pleased with Ms. Elwood's testimony that the reinstatement of torture  would be illegal under existing law, I am concerned with her prior work  on cases involving the detention of enemy combatants, military  commissions, and the constitutionality of national security programs  under President Bush. For these reasons, I cannot support her  nomination.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, the attacks in London last weekend exposed  in a matter of minutes just how vulnerable free societies truly are.  All it takes is a van or a knife and an unsuspecting bystander to turn  a fun night out on the town into a horrific nightmare.   Of course, we shouldn't need any reminders, but let me give one yet  again: We are at war with Islamic extremists. We have been for years,  and I am sorry to say that there is no end in sight. It is easy to  forget this as we go about our daily lives, but our enemies have not,  and they will not. They have never taken their eyes off the ultimate  target, either--the United States.   Yes, we are at war with a vicious and unyielding foe, and just as our  enemy can attack us with the simplest of everyday tools, the strongest  shield we have in our defense is just as basic: It is the  intelligence--information--of knowing who is talking to whom about  what, where, when, and why.   After the 9/11 attacks, our national security agencies developed  cutting-edge programs that allow us to figure out what the bad guys are  up to and stop them before they can perpetrate such heinous attacks.  Very often, the intelligence they have collected has made the  difference between life and death for American citizens. But one of  those programs is going to sunset later this year. I am talking about  section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This is a  program that collects information about foreign persons on foreign soil  and, as a result, saves American lives.   Unfortunately, this and other programs were distorted in the public  debate by a traitor, a disgruntled ex-NSA contractor, Edward Snowden,  who now sits in the warm embrace of Russian intelligence services. Ever  since his very damaging leak of classified material many years back,  many Americans have grown doubtful about these programs and about  section 702 in particular, which is why it bears repeating just what  section 702 does. It allows our national security agencies to collect  internet or phone communications from a source within the United  States, like an internet service provider, but only under a very  specific set of conditions. It cannot target American citizens--not  even lawful permanent residents. It can't even target foreigners  communicating on U.S. soil. It can target only people discussing a  specific list of topics preapproved by the FISA court, which is made up  of Federal judges with life tenure. We are not talking about what they  are picking up at the grocery store or when they are checking in on the  kids. We are talking about things like weapons of mass destruction.   It is true that this program occasionally does collect information  about American citizens. That will be true of any attempt to stop any  kind of homegrown terrorism. But if you are concerned about protecting  Americans' privacy rights, then you should support extending 702. It  puts in place a host of privacy protections to scrub raw intelligence  of any unnecessary identifying information. To allow this program to  expire on December 31 would hurt both our national security and our  privacy rights.   That is why today I am introducing a bill that would reauthorize  section 702 permanently, as is, with no changes. We can't tie the hands  of our national security officials at the precise moment that our  enemies are taking the gloves off around the world. Terrorists don't  plan to sunset their threats to our way of life, so why should our  important counterterrorism tools sunset?   I am glad to say that my legislation has the support of every  Republican Senator on the Intelligence Committee, and I look forward to  earning the support of my colleagues in the weeks ahead because we  can't afford to let this program expire. It is not too much and it is  not an exaggeration to say that American lives depend on section 702.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the attacks in London last weekend exposed  in a matter of minutes just how vulnerable free societies truly are.
