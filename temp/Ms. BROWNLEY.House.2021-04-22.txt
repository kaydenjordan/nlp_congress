 Madam Speaker, on this Earth Day, I rise to recognize  the crucial significance of President Biden's international climate  summit.   After 4 years of neglecting our responsibilities to the planet and to  future generations, the U.S. is back on the world stage and ready to  take the bold and urgent action that the climate crisis demands.   There is no ``go it alone'' approach when it comes to climate change.  To mitigate the impacts of the climate crisis, the entire world must  come together with a common goal of stopping pollution, protecting  public health, and building a clean and just economy.   The consequences of neglecting our duty to protect the planet have  never been more clear.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to advance the ambitious climate plans of the summit and come  together to create a cleaner and better tomorrow.                            ____________________
