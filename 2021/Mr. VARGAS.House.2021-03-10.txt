 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleague,  Congresswoman Sara Jacobs, to honor San Diego leader Dr. Willie Blair.   As a San Diego community leader, Dr. Blair left a legacy for those  demanding social justice and equity. He served his country as a Vietnam  combat veteran; a former congressional staffer; and locally as a leader  of Black American Political Association of California-San Diego  chapter, or BAPAC.   From 2008 to 2017, Dr. Blair served as board chairman for BAPAC, an  organization that strives to ensure the Black community in San Diego  County remains a relevant economic, social force in southern  California.   In 2017, he was elected as BAPAC's president, where he continued his  work in civil and human rights and used his stature to promote quality  leadership in the community.   Dr. Blair is survived by his daughter, U.S. Air Force officer Deborah  Smith; his siblings Janet, Trece, and Roger; and several nieces.   We are very lucky to have a leader like Dr. Blair, who paved the way  for future changemakers. All of us who knew Dr. Blair loved him and  respected him dearly. We are saddened by his passing.                            ____________________
