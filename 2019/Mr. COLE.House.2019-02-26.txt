 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Woodall), my good friend, for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act. If we defeat the previous question, we will  bring up the text of this important piece of legislation to defend  life.   Frankly, Mr. Speaker, I am mystified as to why the majority is loath  to actually make this vote. Indeed, they have been doing backflips to  avoid allowing the House to actually go on record on this important  issue.   This bill is a commonsense approach to protecting our Nation's most  vulnerable. It amends the Federal Criminal Code simply to require that  any doctor present when a child is born alive following an abortion or  attempted abortion must provide the child with the same degree of care  as he or she would provide any other child. The bill also requires that  any such child is immediately admitted to a hospital.   Mr. Speaker, as we have seen in recent weeks, many people in elected  positions do not appear to appreciate the need to provide for  protections for our most vulnerable Americans newly born, but it is  clear that current law fails to provide adequate protections for  newborns who survive an abortion attempt. This bill draws a sorely  needed bright line of protection around abortion survivors and requires  that they be given the same level of care as any other premature  infant.    As stewards of the law of this country, Mr. Speaker, protecting the  most vulnerable, including the unborn, should be one of Congress' basic  responsibilities.   Since entering Congress, I have made the protection of life one of my  highest priorities. I believe that all Members should have that same  priority. Today, we can take a step toward making this a reality by  defeating the previous question and bringing up the Born-Alive  Survivors Protection Act for a vote.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the previous question.
