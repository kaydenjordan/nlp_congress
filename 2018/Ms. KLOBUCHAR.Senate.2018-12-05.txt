 Mr. President, today, along with Senator Roy  Blunt of Missouri, I wish to honor Rebecca ``Becky'' Weichhand, a  fierce and tireless advocate for adoption.   From an early age, Becky knew she wanted to be a lawyer to help  children, and for almost 10 years, she pursued that dream as the,  director of policy and later as the executive director of the  Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, CCAI. As Senate co- chairs of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, we had the privilege  of working with Becky and witnessed firsthand how her work changed the  lives of children around the world. Becky was a mentor to foster youth  and advised 10 classes of foster youth interns on Capitol Hill, who  helped to research and develop policy proposals informed by their own  experience to help our Nation's foster children. She also led efforts  to help Members of Congress promote adoption and foster care around the  world, organizing nine domestic and international delegation trips. In  addition, Becky spearheaded the Angels in Adoption Program, which  honors organizations and people who have had an extraordinary impact on  children, their families, and communities across the country. During  her tenure, 1,257 people and organizations were recognized with this  honor.   Becky dedicated her career to the belief that every child deserves a  loving and stable home. She was instrumental in efforts to preserve the  adoption tax credit, including working to establish a coalition of more  than 150 organizations and advocating to make the adoption tax credit  permanent in 2012.   Becky's faith, compassion, and kindness were evident in everything  she did, and she will be dearly missed. Her life was a blessing to  many, and we will honor it by continuing her work of bringing loving  families together with children in need.                            ____________________
