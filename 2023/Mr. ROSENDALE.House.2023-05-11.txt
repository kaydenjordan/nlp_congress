 Mr. Speaker, after 3 years of government overreach,  which was blamed on COVID-19, we can all agree that the pandemic is  over. The fact is, this very body passed H.R. 382 to end the national  public health emergency, the Senate agreed, and the President signed it  into law.   The Biden administration is going so far as to allow title 42 to end  at midnight tonight, removing the ability of our Border Patrol agents  to turn immigrants away due to public health concerns.   Yet, every week, I receive calls from veterans who are being denied  care at VA health clinics across Montana over mask mandates. Let me  repeat that. The pandemic is over, yet veterans are being denied  medical care over mask mandates.   Denying anyone, particularly a veteran, medical care over a personal  decision is outrageous and violates the Hippocratic Oath.   In March, I had the opportunity to question the individuals from the  VA and sent them multiple letters over their mask mandates. They  responded by allowing each clinic to set its own guidelines.   Unfortunately, instead of eliminating masks, the Montana VA  healthcare system doubled down and has dictated that every clinic in  the State requires masks.   In Billings, Iraq war veteran Travis Norby has consistently been  denied care every time he walks into the local VA clinic. Is this the  respect that we show our veterans after they have put their life on the  line to protect our freedoms?   First and foremost, we have a duty to ensure that our veterans have  access to the medical care they need. It is not just a matter of  obligation; it is a matter of respect and gratitude for the sacrifices  that they have made. Denying veterans access to medical care over mask  mandates is a betrayal of our Nation's core values.   If we can agree that the pandemic is over, to the extent that the  Biden administration is allowing title 42 to expire, then we must stop  turning our back on our Nation's heroes and stop mask mandates at the  VA health clinics.                            ____________________
