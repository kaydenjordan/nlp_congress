 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Eden Prairie  boys football team for winning their 11th  [[Page H9456]]  Minnesota State championship this last week.   The Eagles prevailed 38-17 in the championship matchup. They finished  their 2017 season with an undefeated 13-0 record.   Eden Prairie was led by senior running back Solo Falaniko, who rushed  for 90 yards on 22 carries and scored a touchdown, as well as senior  all-purpose Antonio Montero, who had 58 yards rushing with three  touchdowns.   Mr. Speaker, it takes commitment, perseverance, and hard work to  become State champions. It is even more impressive, considering that  these team members and student athletes consistently and successfully  balance schoolwork and other extracurricular activities with their  athletics. That is why I commend these athletes.   Congratulations to the players, the coaches, the parents, and all the  fans of the Eden Prairie football team on your State title. Our entire  community is very proud of your accomplishment.   Go Eagles.                            ____________________
