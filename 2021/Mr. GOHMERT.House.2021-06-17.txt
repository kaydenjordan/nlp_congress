 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Gaetz).                                time  1215          Remembering the Life of Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Lombardo     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs.  Miller-Meeks).                      Recognizing Muscatine High School     It is wonderful to hear that about Iowa.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert).                           New Spending Initiatives     Would the gentleman yield for a question?    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Schweikert's ongoing  analyses of the way we mismanage money around Washington, D.C. And I  was reading about proposals to go after the billionaires, the mega- rich, and I recall what Ronald Reagan's economist, economic adviser,  Arthur Laffer, had said. Dr. Laffer said--he told a small group of us  years ago--if you want to produce money--of course, I am asking you  this because I have such great respect for your monetary analyses.   If you want to go after money, you want to produce tax revenue, the  one place you will never get it is going after the super-rich because  they are the only people in America who have the wherewithal to avoid  whatever tax you put on them.    What is your thought about that analysis?    That would be people who would pay income tax if they  didn't lose their jobs.    I know you would have----    No, no. I appreciate my friend from Arizona, Mr.  Schweikert's excellent analysis, because we do want to have a vibrant  economy. As the saying goes, it lifts all boats. And I really  appreciate the analysis on where the Medicare spending is going. That  is something we need to deal with.   I hear solutions of throwing money at the problem, but the real  problem is we don't have the proper money to throw at it because the  economy is not doing as it should.    And then I still hear our friends talk about the need to stop climate  change. Unfortunately, the climate has been changing since the Earth  ever appeared. And I have got a lot of friends out there. And I say  friends facetiously. People on the left--I am beginning to understand  that sarcasm is a tool that is appreciated by the intelligent. So the  left, the alt-left, they don't get it.  [[Page H2919]]    But this is an article from Ethan Hunt back in August of 2019. It  says: NASA admits that climate change occurs because of changes in  Earth's solar orbit; not because of SUVs and fossil fuel.   Well, it really can be a combination of things. But having found out  from the former NASA Director that the Moon's orbit is slightly  changing and the Earth's orbit is slightly changing and, as the term  was, it is becoming more squashed, well, that would mean there are  times when we are closer to the Sun and we are further away from the  Sun.   And I know there are some leftists at NASA that said: Oh, no,  changing Earth's orbit doesn't affect our climate at all.   And I would humbly submit that you don't have to be a rocket  scientist to understand that if you get closer to the Sun, or if you  get further away from the Sun, it is absolutely going to affect your  climate; just as more solar activity, more solar flares, they are going  to affect our climate. And there is not a lot that we can do about more  solar flares, solar activities, solar hot spots.   And I would sarcastically ask a question regarding the Bureau of Land  Management and National Forest Service, since they were going to be  spending so much time on climate change, and we had heard the Earth's  orbit was changing slightly and the Moon's orbit was changing slightly.   Could they do anything about that?                                time  1245    For those who thought I was really challenging BLM, the Bureau of  Land Management and the National Forest Service, like they were going  to do something about the Earth's orbit, the National Forest Service  and Bureau of Land Management, they are not going to do anything about  the Earth's orbit because they can't. That is not their job.   Although there is some professor that thinks we might could adjust  our orbit, I think that is still yet to be arrived at scientifically.  It is an interesting concept, but I had no belief that it was about to  happen by the Bureau of Land Management and National Forest Service.   It is interesting to look back. I missed this article back in 2019.  It goes into much more detail about not only the changing orbit but the  changing tilt from time to time.   Then if you do more digging, you find out that actually, going back  millions--some say 56 million; some say billions--that the planet was  much hotter, and the planet's orbit was closer to the Sun. It has moved  back some, according to some, over the millions or billions, whatever  you believe, number of years.   I also want to mention this article from The Washington Times, June  16, 2021, Stephen Dinan, about ``Smartphone smugglers: How social media  is reshaping border crime.'' It is really intriguing. The author does  an amazing job of pulling these things together.   It is interesting. The drug cartels south of our border, apparently,  we are informed, have workers in every city in America. Of course, we  have heard before that the Border Patrol, ICE, the U.S. Government is  considered to be the logistics for the multibillion-dollar drug cartels  in Mexico because the drug cartels get them across illegally into the  United States. And I have seen people in the middle of the night, as  they are being processed by the Border Patrol, long lines of people. I  have watched them comparing addresses and sometimes switching  addresses.   They are the addresses that the drug cartels have given them as to  where the drug cartels want them to go work in order to earn enough  money, either drug trafficking, sex trafficking, or human trafficking,  to pay off the rest of their debt to the drug cartels for getting them  into the United States illegally. Many times, it is the U.S.  Government, which means U.S. taxpayers, that end up paying to send the  drug cartels' employees, or indentured servants, to the cities where  the drug cartels want them.   It is incredible that we, as a U.S. Government, are helping the drug  cartels in Mexico make the tens of billions of dollars that they use to  keep different levels of government corrupt in Mexico, that keep the  Mexican people from having the economy that would allow them to have  across-the-board wonderful homes, have wonderful jobs, and be one of  the top economies in the world. The corruption of the drug cartels  keeps Mexico from having their true place in the top economies in the  world.   They have some of the hardest-working people in the world. They have  incredible natural resources, a fantastic location--actually, better  than the U.S. because they are between North and South America, and  they are between the Pacific and the Atlantic. Incredible location,  hardworking people, great natural resources, good ports, but the  corruption that the American people are funding through their U.S.  Government and through the purchase of drugs that are massively coming  into this country--if somebody truly has compassion for the people of  Mexico and Central America, they would demand that our southern border  be secured, that we continue to provide visas in greater numbers than  any country in the world, but we secure the border so that we cut the  tens of billions of dollars from flowing to the drug cartels that then  corrupt and destroy lives, kill Americans with fentanyl and other drugs  that are pouring into our country. And the Mexican people would come to  the United States on vacation to spend the significant, wonderful money  they had earned without fear of the drug cartels and what they will do  to them if they are not subservient.   There was a time in Mexico when people who were wealthy knew the drug  cartels would normally leave them alone. There was a time in Mexico  when the drug cartels basically had a wink-and-nod agreement: Look, we  won't have attacks in tourist attractions because we know how important  that money is.   Well, all of those days are gone. If we were really a compassionate  neighbor, we would secure our border. We would stop drawing off people  with the potential to be the best citizens that Guatemala, Mexico,  other countries have, drawing them up here because of the corruption  below our border that we in the U.S. Government are helping fund.   It really needs to stop. But it is getting worse, much, much worse,  as we are seeing numbers that no one has seen in many, many years.   There has been so much appropriate concern about January 6 and what  happened that day. Unfortunately, we don't know all that happened that  day. There are some major questions that need to be answered.   We know that the former chief of the Capitol Police testified that  they got no intelligence from the FBI about potential violence on  January 6. There were lots of stories about people who were here at the  Capitol on January 6 that may have carried a Confederate flag, may have  had red on and MAGA or Trump.   But the Capitol Police had told me the day before: Hey, we have heard  there are going to be people who hate Trump that are going to be trying  to blend in, and there is going to be violence, and we are concerned  about it.   But the chief of the Capitol Police said they got no intel like that  from the FBI.   An article a few days ago from Revolver says: ``Unindicted Co- Conspirators in the January 6 Cases Raise Disturbing Questions of  Federal Foreknowledge.'' That is June 14. I saw my friend Tucker  Carlson covered this last night.   But this is really disturbing, and this is something that I know from  my time here in Congress has disturbed Democrats and Republicans alike  across the aisle because we don't like to see government agents  stirring up trouble or find that there are criminal acts that would not  likely have occurred had not the Federal Government been participating,  whether they were actual agents or undercover agents or informants that  were working for the Federal Government.    But this is scary stuff. This is kind of third-world stuff. This is  not only third-world stuff, but this is like Putin kind of activity.   If there were Federal agents that were involved on January 6, we  really need to know what the FBI knew and when they knew it. Not only  that, we need to know how much participation did any of our Federal  friends, either at DOJ, FBI, or any of the intel community, what kind  of role were they playing.  [[Page H2920]]    There is information that came out about the effort to kidnap the  Michigan Governor, and it has been said that there were Federal agents  that were involved in that. It would seem, if you have 14 people that  are involved in a conspiracy to commit a crime, and over a third of  them, including people in leadership, are Federal agents, undercover  agents, or people that are working for a Federal entity, that we have  got some serious problems, and we have not done adequate oversight.   It disturbs me greatly that there was not more information  forthcoming from our Federal law enforcement intelligence, DOJ, than  was received here on Capitol Hill because, surely, if they had known  the level of planning by a small group to actually commit violence and  break into our U.S. Capitol, they would have been better prepared.   I know some of us have had extreme differences with the Speaker, but  I just feel sure if she had known the level of violence that was being  talked about and planned and monitored by DOJ and FBI, surely she would  not have allowed the Sergeant at Arms to turn down National Guard  support on January 6.   This article pulls from documents, legal documents, that have been  filed by the Federal Government in some of these different cases. This  article says: ``To address the matter directly in the following three  questions: In the year leading up to January 6 and during January 6  itself, to what extent were the three primary militia groups--the Oath  Keepers, the Proud Boys, and the Three Percenters--that the FBI, DOJ,  Pentagon, and network news have labeled most responsible for planning  and executing a Capitol attack on January 6 infiltrated by agencies of  the Federal Government, or informants of said agencies?''   Question 2: ``Exactly how many Federal undercover agents or  confidential informants were present at the Capitol or in the Capitol  during the infamous `siege,' and what roles did they play--merely  passive informants or active instigators?''   And, third: ``Finally, of all of the unindicted co-conspirators  referenced in the charging documents,'' the official Federal pleadings,  ``of those indicted for crimes on January 6, how many worked as a  confidential informant or as an undercover operative for the Federal  Government--FBI, Army Counterintelligence, et cetera?''                                time  1300    ``If the narrative about January 6 does not conform to the questions  above, the American people will never learn the most important truth  about what January 6 is, and what kind of country they're really living  in.   ``If it turns out the Federal Government did in fact have undercover  agents or confidential informants embedded within the so-called militia  groups indicted for conspiring to obstruct the Senate certification on  January 6, the implications would be nothing short of seismic.  Especially if such agents or informants enjoyed extremely senior-level  positions within such groups.''   And the thing is, like I said, they have got documentation, the  Federal pleadings that the United States Government has filed in some  of these cases, that really raised serious issues. Yeah, there is no  question, there were radical groups there, and those three seem to be  the most prominent. But from the pleadings from the Department of  Justice itself, it appears that they had significant presence and  participation in what went on.   We do need to see the 14,000 hours of security video, seeing Ashli  Babbitt killed by an officer standing off to the side. There were  officers in front of the window, but then there were officers on the  other side where Ashli was; and it appeared it was John Sullivan, a  Trump hater, that told them if they will move out of the way they won't  get hurt, and the officers appeared. Well, they moved out of the way,  and these guys broke through the glass.   And yet with all of the people that the FBI has sought information on  and put up pictures--and it appears they were probably wearing masks,  but there is another 14,000 hours of video. These guys were around in  the Capitol, around the Capitol. They didn't have their masks up at all  times. But it doesn't appear that the FBI has asked for assistance in  identifying those people that broke through the glass or that were  right there, at least when Ashli was shot in the neck and killed.   And that normally means if they are not asking for help in  identifying somebody that they know who they are--and maybe they are  person 1, person 2, person 3, person 15--that are referred to in the  pleadings of people that were working with the FBI or Federal  authorities of some kind.   But this is very unsettling stuff. It was bad enough to have our  Capitol attacked. As a former felony judge, I would have no problem  sending people to prison that broke into this Capitol, that literally  broke in or that did damage or that stole things here. There is no  place for that, and they do need to be severely punished.   But were some of those people doing those things working for the FBI?  Were they egged on by Federal authorities? Because it sure looks like  from some of these legal documents they filed and the masking of names  and referring to them as something other than their real names that we  have a serious problem with some of the people that were involved that  day that it appears were either working for Federal authorities or were  informants for Federal authorities and had leadership positions in  those groups and quite possibly, in some cases probably, helped to egg  them on.   This article says in many cases the unindicted co-conspirators appear  to be much more aggressive and egregious participants in the very so- called conspiracy, serving as the basis for charging those indicted.  The question immediately arises as to why this is the case and forces  us to consider whether certain individuals are being protected from  indictment because they were involved in January 6 as undercover  operatives or confidential informants for a Federal agency.   So another place further on in the article it points out: ``This  would be far worse than the already bad situation of the government  knowing about the possibility of violence and doing nothing. Instead,  this would imply that elements of the federal government were active  instigators in the most egregious and spectacular aspects of January 6,  amounting to a monumental entrapment scheme used as a pretext to  imprison otherwise harmless protesters at the Capitol--and in a much  larger sense used to frame the entire MAGA movement as potential  domestic terrorists.''   There is so much more. Let's see, further on, I guess this is page 8/ 26. ``In one of the plot's climactic scenes, in the main van driving up  to look at Governor Whitmer's vacation home''--and that is of course  the plot to kidnap the Governor--``three out of the five people in the  van--60 percent of the plot's senior leaders--were Federal agents and  informants.''   ``FBI infiltrators comprised, at the very least''--talking about  overall in that plot--``26 percent of the plotters. That is, at least  five FBI operatives have been disclosed, against just 14 suspects  indicted.''   So looking at some of the pleadings by the DOJ themselves, but just  to give an idea of what we are dealing with, it says, ``On December 30,  2020, Watkins and Caldwell exchanged the following text messages:   ``Watkins: Looks like we are green light to come to D.C. on the 6th.  The rally point still at your place?   ``Caldwell: Not that I am aware. Have been contacted by no one.  Typical (Person one). Here's the rub: (Person two) and I will be in a  hotel within striking distance of the city starting on the 4th, so we  won't even be here. There will be some stuff going on during the 5th,  and we want to be a part of that whenever it shakes out.''   Person one and person two were apparently working for the Federal  authorities, some Federal agency.   Another place it references person two, person three, person one, and  they seem to be significant leaders in what is going on.   Another place: Person three--emailed person three several maps along  with the message. These maps will get you from the hotel into D.C.   I mean, person 10 checked into the Hilton Garden Inn in Vienna.   Person three, another reference.   Person 15 and person 20 are referenced.   These are people that they are covering up their names because they  are working for the Federal authorities.  [[Page H2921]]    If you look at some of the video on January 6, there were a lot of  people walking around. They had no business being in the Capitol. But  it is quite concerning that people that were extremely active at all  should have been or were working for Federal entities such that they  have to cover up their names because of their complicity with the  Federal authorities during that day.   So that is United States versus Caldwell, Crowl, and then there is  one Government's Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Reconsideration  of Detention.   They are holding some of these people still. Some with 23 hours, 24  hours a day in solitary. Some were just walking around, they did no  damage. They should not have come into the Capitol, but it remains to  be seen why the government has their stinger out so much for people no  matter how mild their participation on January 6.   And yet the biggest damage done to the United States in protests was  last summer, and those folks aren't being treated the same way that  others are.   So there are some very serious questions that need to be answered. We  do need the answers. We need to know how many Federal agents; how many  informants had given information to Federal agencies and why in the  world all of that information was not provided to people that needed to  protect Capitol Hill.   So we need an investigation. We don't need one that has an entire  Democrat staff. It needs to be truly bipartisan to get to the bottom of  just what happened that day and who caused it to happen.   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
