 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of the U.S. Wants to Compete for a World  Expo Act. Let me thank our chairman, Ed Royce, for his leadership of  the Committee on Foreign Affairs. I also want to thank my colleagues  from Minnesota, Ms. McCollum and Mr. Emmer, for their hard work on this  measure.   World Fairs and World Expos explore and bring millions of people  together from around the globe. They drive billions of dollars of  investment to host cities, and they provide a forum for working toward  new and creative solutions to serious problems. Across more than a  century, these Expos have given us some of the world's most iconic  architecture: the Golden Gate Bridge, the Space Needle, and the Eiffel  Tower. They have brought together world leaders and experts to discuss  topics ranging from nutrition to the future of energy.   The last Expo held in the United States was in 1984, and Minnesota is  a potential candidate to host the 2023 World Expo. This Expo could  bring in about 12 million visitors and $4 billion of revenue to  Minnesota and connect the public and private sector to discuss Wellness  and Well-Being for All.   Mr. Speaker, we are at a grave disadvantage in competing for this  event. In 2001, at the direction of Congress, the State Department  withdrew from numerous international associations, including the Bureau  of International Expositions, or BIE. Then-Secretary of State Colin  Powell warned that this action could force the U.S. to pay a higher fee  for participation and decrease the chance of an American city being  selected as a host city.   We are currently facing these consequences. As a nonmember of the  BIE, the United States faces significantly higher costs to participate  in expositions and will also face substantial barriers in hosting since  preference is given to member nations.   Mr. Speaker, the remedy is simple. We must rejoin the BIE. Private  sector companies have shown interest in paying membership dues, so  rejoining the BIE would not be an additional burden to taxpayers.   Hosting the World Expo would increase revenue and tourism to  Minnesota and the U.S. generally, put us at the forefront of  international discussion on health, and increase our chances to hold  specialized and World Expos in the future. I am proud of the hard work  that has gone into this by my colleagues. I am glad once again that we  are working in a bipartisan manner to pass legislation that advances  our interests.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong support for H. Res. 187,  Relating to Efforts to Respond to the Famine in South Sudan, as  amended, which passed out of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and has  received bipartisan support.   As always, Mr. Speaker, I thank and appreciate the leadership of  Chairman Royce, Chairman Smith, and Ranking Member Engel.   The United Nations has declared what is going on now in four  countries as potentially the worse humanitarian crisis since the U.N.  was formed in 1945. Famine has been declared in one country, and three  others are at risk of famine. Famine might be averted in Somalia if the  rains come. In Nigeria and Yemen, famine might be averted if the world  acts in time.   But South Sudan, which is the world's newest nation, is currently  experiencing famine. The United Nations defines famine as meaning over  20 percent of the population has access to only 2,100 calories per day.  Thirty percent of children are malnourished. And 2 to 4 people die per  day because of lack of food. Tragically, South Sudan meets all three  conditions.   Over the years, the U.S. has played a leadership role in the region.  The U.S. has helped South Sudan throughout their struggle for  independence, and has tried to help the world's newest nation over the  last several years before and during the conflict.    The tragedy is the people of South Sudan are in the midst of a  famine, not because of a drought or other natural disaster, but because  of ongoing conflict. There is heavy responsibility on all sides of the  fighting. There is no innocent party here.   In South Sudan, the U.N. has reported roughly 5 million people who  are in urgent need of food and nutritional assistance. There are almost  2 million internally displaced persons in camps in South Sudan, and  2,400 South Sudanese refugees arrive in Uganda every single day.   If the world does not act, 5 million people will be at risk for  starvation by mid-2017. Without urging humanitarian intervention, more  civilians will continue to die from acute malnutrition, and millions  more will remain at risk.   If we fail to act prior to the upcoming rainy season, which is May to  August, this will create additional problems that will further impede  humanitarian efforts. Unfortunately, the areas where famine has been  declared have also seen some of the most intense fighting.   The amendment to H. Res. 187 calls for USAID to continue providing  desperately needed and locally appropriate food aid through the Food  for Peace and Emergency Food Security Programs, and calls on the  Government of South Sudan to declare and observe a cessation of  hostilities to allow food and essential supplies to reach affected  civilians.   The resolution urges the Government of South Sudan to allow immediate  and unrestricted humanitarian access to the southern unity region,  where the famine is currently underway.   The amendment also condemns all threats and violence against civilian  populations and aid workers, including over 70 humanitarian aid workers  that have been killed since the conflict began.   The resolution condemns the brutal attack by the South Sudanese  military on humanitarian aid workers, including Americans at the  Terrain Camp in July of last year.   The resolution condemns the multiple instances in which security  forces have looted humanitarian assistance destined for civilians in  need, and supports the effort of the U.S. Government working with  partners in the international community, including the U.N., the  African Union, and the European Union, to facilitate humanitarian  access to affected areas, and encourages greater diplomatic pressure on  the parties to return to the negotiation table to stop the violence and  to allow full humanitarian access.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Crowley), my good friend and Democratic Caucus chairman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Payne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), my good friend and colleague and the chair of  the Nigeria Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Suozzi), my fellow colleague on the Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers. I propose to close.   Mr. Speaker, this crisis can be stopped in its tracks. There is no  need for millions to die. The world needs to step up as it did in the  Ebola crisis.   The U.S. needs to continue to lead. Our contribution is vital and is  based on the size of our economy and the fact that other countries who  are not as fortunate contribute in different ways. But the entire world  should and does participate.   In 2011, 200,000 people had to die in Somalia before the world took  notice and acted. This should never happen again.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
