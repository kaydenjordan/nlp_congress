 Mr. President, I was unavoidably absent for  rollcall vote No. 209, on the nomination of Ajit Varadaraj Pai, of  Kansas, to be a member of the Federal Communications Commission. Had I  been present, I would have voted nay.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
