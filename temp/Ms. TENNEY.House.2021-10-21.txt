 Mr. Speaker, in the words of Saint Teresa, ``Death is  nothing else but going home to God, the bond of love will be unbroken  for all eternity.''   I rise today with great honor to recognize the extraordinary life of  Attorney Donald Snyder of West Winfield, New York, who passed away last  month.   Don was a gem of a man and a wonderful servant to our community. Don  was also admired by his peers.   I remember Don being a very close friend of my father, the late  Honorable Justice John R. Tenney, who always spoke so highly of Don as  a person to model your career and your gift of service on.   Don served our Nation in the Army, and he returned home to start a  country law practice in little West Winfield, New York, in Herkimer  County.   Don was a wonderful servant who served on the board of Herkimer  College for over 22 years and the chair for 12.  [[Page H5738]]    Don was involved with so many organizations and schools and church  organizations, but he was also a very dedicated husband to his wife,  Mary Theresa Higgins, and a dedicated father of four and grandfather of  12.   Nine people in Don's family are attorneys. They were all sworn in on  the very same day by the U.S. Supreme Court, which made the front page  news in our little town. Don was very proud of this.   Don was a man who devoted his life to service, to happiness, and he  couldn't have been a kinder person to me and a better friend and mentor  for me as an attorney when I first started out many years ago.   I can't express enough my deepest condolences to his family, his  friends, and our community. This is truly the loss of a great man. I  wish them all the best, and it was an honor to call Don Snyder my  friend.                            ____________________
