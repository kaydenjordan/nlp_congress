 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member  Engel for his leadership and for yielding me time. I thank Chairman  Royce for his leadership and the way that he has worked with our side  of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Russia, Iran, and North Korea  Sanctions Act, legislation that is desperately needed to prevent this  administration from rolling back sanctions tied to Russia's invasion of  Ukraine and interference in our election.   This bill's enhanced sanctions on Russia are important in light of  the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin, not to mention the  many ties between the Trump administration and the Kremlin.   In a recent development, the Treasury Department confirmed that  ExxonMobil violated existing Russian sanctions while under the  leadership of Rex Tillerson, who is now Donald Trump's Secretary of  State. Indeed, in 2014, Exxon signed documents related to oil and gas  projects in Russia with Igor Sechin, president of Rosneft, a Russian  state-owned oil giant. Sechin was one of the individuals subject to  sanctions. Exxon was fined a mere $2 million--a slap on the wrist for a  company that earned $7.8 billion in profits in 2016.   Russia is continuing its aggression in Ukraine. It is supporting the  murderous regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. It interfered in the 2016  U.S. election. That is why we must strengthen the sanctions against  Russia, and we must block Rex Tillerson and Donald Trump from waiving  or lifting those sanctions without review.   Before closing, I would also note that the legislation before us also  includes several measures championed by Democrats on the Financial  Services Committee. These provisions will focus the government on  creating a national strategy to combat the financing of terrorism,  enhance Treasury's tools for combating money laundering vulnerabilities  such as the well-known risk in high-end real estate, and help address  the de-risking trend that is driving fund transfers into the shadows.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.J. Res. 111 is an affront to hardworking Americans  across the country. Using the Congressional Review Act, this joint  resolution repeals the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's final  rule to curb forced arbitration clauses in contracts for consumer  financial products.   Today, many banks require consumers wanting to open a bank account,  get a credit card, or take out a private student loan to enter into  forced arbitration agreements that take away their rights to  collectively sue the bank for any harm. Instead, consumers must go  through bank-friendly arbiters to resolve their grievances. These  contracts are literally buried deep into the fine print, enshrouded in  legalese. Consumers don't know what they are giving up--but the banks  do.   Arbitration proceedings, which happen behind closed doors, have no  judge and no jury. Their proceedings and their outcomes heavily favor  big businesses and Wall Street. Studies have shown that forced  arbitration favors big business and results in less compensation for  American consumers who have been abused or defrauded, if they receive  any at all.   Simply put, forced arbitration is an instrument that benefits large  corporations and Wall Street banks, and it  [[Page H6270]]  hurts consumers. For example, everybody remembers Wells Fargo. Wells  Fargo continues to use forced arbitration to prevent consumers from  working together to sue the bank for opening up millions of fraudulent  accounts using their personal information. Just weeks ago, the Consumer  Bureau used a critical rule to finally clamp down on forced arbitration  clauses. The Consumer Bureau should be applauded for taking this step  to help consumers by fully restoring their legal rights.   Once again, the Consumer Bureau has acted to make our financial  marketplaces fairer and transparent. As is their practice, the Consumer  Bureau issued this rule after careful deliberation and exhaustive  review. As part of this deliberative process, they issued a 728-page  report on the issue, considered views from all stakeholders, and  consulted carefully with the other Federal financial regulators.   The Consumer Bureau's final rule has widespread support, including  from over 310 consumer, civil rights, faith-based, and senior groups,  256 law professors and scholars, and the Military Coalition, an  organization that represents 5.5 million current and former  servicemembers and their families.   Now, this rule was just finalized, but congressional Republicans are  already shamefully forging ahead to cut it off at the knees. This  resolution wouldn't just nullify the rule, it would also prevent the  Consumer Bureau from ever issuing a rule that is ``substantially  similar.'' That means, if Republicans pass this resolution into law,  then, for the foreseeable future, consumers will be robbed of important  legal rights and generally left at the mercy of industry-friendly  auditors.   Let's be clear. There is absolutely no valid public policy rationale  for repealing this rule. It is a part of a pattern from congressional  Republicans of irrational hostility toward the Consumer Bureau and its  work and a callous disregard for the issues facing America's consumers.  But just as they have with the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act, Republicans are  pushing an anticonsumer agenda that puts profits over people.   Enough is enough. We must hold true to a fundamental principle of our  democracy that each of us has a right to trial if we so choose. The  rule fully restores this right to American consumers by giving them a  choice between arbitration or the free exercise of their Seventh  Amendment right to a trial by jury through whatever means they choose.   So I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this senseless and  harmful resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes  to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), who is a  senior member of the Financial Services Committee and ranking member of  the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman  an additional 10 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, the Republicans are  siding with Big Business again, against our consumers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi), the distinguished leader and a strong supporter of consumers  and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez), a senior member of the  Financial Services Committee and ranking member of the Small Business  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison), a leading member on this  consumer issue.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano), a senior member of the  Financial Services Committee and a strong progressive member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman), a senior member of the  Financial Services Committee and Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster), a member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am sick and tired of  my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle talking about this $32.   Republicans keep discussing that consumers get $32 in class action,  but they ignore how few consumers win in arbitration. Big banks win  93.1 percent of the time in arbitration. The deck is stacked against  consumers, not Wall Street.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Johnson), a leading member on this consumer arbitration issue.    Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the  opposite side of the aisle hate Mr. Cordray so much because he has been  so effective, returning $12 billion to consumers, that they would harm  the American public rather than admit that they are wrong.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Scott), the ranking member of the Committee on Education and the  Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), the ranking member on  the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), the leader of the Democracy  Reform Task Force.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis), the ranking member of the  Higher Education and Workforce Training Subcommittee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), the vice ranking member of the  Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), a senior member on the  Committee on Education and the Workforce.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. McEachin), a member of the House Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright), a member of the Committee  on Appropriations and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano), a Member who is outraged by  the attack on consumers by the opposite side of the aisle.    Mr. Speaker, I am now prepared to  close, and I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, today we have heard Democrats speak about the importance  of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule to stop forced  arbitration clauses in contracts for consumer financial products and  the harm that would result from this joint resolution to repeal the  rule.   Forced arbitration clauses severely limit consumers' legal rights and  prevent groups of consumers from holding financial institutions  accountable for wrongdoing. The Consumer Bureau's rule helps to ensure  that financial institutions are held accountable and fully protects the  legal rights of consumers, including servicemembers and veterans.   The majority has shamefully moved to nullify the Consumer Bureau's  good work in a move that ultimately enables financial institutions to  get off the hook when they commit wrongdoing, with less redress for  consumers.   Studies have shown that forced arbitration favors big business and  results in less compensation for American consumers who have been  abused or defrauded, if they receive any at all.   This resolution steamrolls over the Consumer Bureau's sensible rule  without regard for the harm that will result for American consumers and  families. This is also despite the broad support for the rule from  consumer advocacy, civil rights, and faith-based groups, legal  scholars, and advocates for servicemembers.   Congress must not curtail the legal rights of consumers, must not  repeal the Consumer Bureau's forced arbitration rule. Vote to protect  consumer rights. Vote to fully restore the American principle of right  to trial by jury. Vote ``no'' on H.J. Res. 111.   Mr. Speaker, I would simply like to say that I keep hearing my  colleagues talk about how fast consumers are taken care of under the  arbitration rule. Yes, because they are getting railroaded.   As I mentioned, they are in the back room without representation.  These are people who have been forced to sign these arbitration  agreements, not even knowing that they signed them.   Most people who go out now to get a credit card or to get a loan of  some kind, they are forced into these agreements and they don't even  know it. They are shocked and surprised when they cannot join with  others who have been ripped off in class action lawsuits.   So don't pay attention to all of the information that you have  received from the opposite side. Remember that the banks and big  businesses win 93.1 percent of the time, not consumers.   Whose side are you on? Are you on the side of consumers or are you  protecting big business?   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded  vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
