 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  the cowardice of my Republican colleagues, who should be standing  across the aisle right now but have fled D.C. and their sworn duty to  their constituents to avoid forcing our Nation onto default on our  debt.   A catastrophic default should not, under any circumstances, delight  MAGA Republicans, but these horribly bad actors are in contempt. They  can hardly contain their excitement as the Nation stands on the brink  of ruin.   Make no mistake, the MAGA movement has abandoned all pretext. They  are not here to govern.   Eight million American jobs will be slashed in the blink of an eye.   Retirement savings will be devastated overnight, and there will be an  all-but-certain recession.   This catastrophe is not just looming, but primed to collapse on our  communities, and Speaker McCarthy refuses to keep the House in session.   Are he and his party really so eager to preside over our Nation's  default on her debt? The answer is a resounding, yes, they are.  Remember, their cruelty is the point.                            ____________________
