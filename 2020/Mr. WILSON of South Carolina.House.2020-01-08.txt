 Mr. Speaker, last week, I traveled  across  [[Page H22]]  the Second Congressional District of South Carolina visiting the  Midlands, Aiken, North Augusta, Barnwell, and Orangeburg to present my  2020 legislative agenda.   At each stop, I was grateful to share my priorities and answer  questions from the media. In this new legislative year, I will continue  to advance legislation to create jobs for American families and reduce  the harmful regulations that destroy jobs.   I will promote working with local chambers and agencies. In 2020, I  will advocate for future and current missions at the Savannah River  Site and Savannah River National Laboratory.   We also must protect the economic future for our children and  grandchildren to address the debt by supporting the most conservative  budget options. I am also focusing on promoting peace through strength  to support our troops and keep American families safe by defeating  terrorists overseas in the global war on terrorism.   This year, I will also serve as the ranking member of the Commission  on Security and Cooperation in Europe, where I will work with my  colleagues across the aisle to maintain our international partnerships.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may we never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism with the courageous  leadership of President Donald Trump.                            ____________________
