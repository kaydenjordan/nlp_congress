 Mr. President, I rise to commend a great public servant,  John Swartout, for his dedicated service to the citizens of Colorado.  After more than three decades of tireless service in the public policy  arena, I congratulate John on the occasion of his retirement.   John worked as an adviser to Colorado Governors Bill Owens and John  Hickenlooper and U.S. Senator Wayne Allard on environmental, natural  resource, energy, and public lands policy. John was instrumental in  Federal land negotiations involving the Roan Plateau settlement, the  closing of Rocky Flats, and the designation of Browns Canyon National  Monument, James Peak Wilderness, Great Sand Dunes National Park, and  the Spanish Peaks Wilderness Area. He also served as the head of policy  for the State of Colorado on habitat protection efforts for the greater  sage grouse and the Gunnison sage grouse. In these efforts, he showed  an uncanny ability to balance habitat conservation goals with the  private property rights of landowners.   John grounded his work in integrity, trust, humor, and an innate  ability to form coalitions and partnerships among even the most diverse  groups. John himself would probably tell you his greatest  accomplishment was helping people find common ground that then allowed  them to work toward collaborative policy solutions that benefited their  community and region. The fact that he worked for governors from both  parties demonstrates his ability to work in a strong bipartisan manner  to deliver results for Colorado.   In addition to his roles working for elected officials, John also led  multiple Agencies and nonprofits. He served as executive director of  Great Outdoors Colorado--GOCO--helping to guide millions of dollars of  investments in public recreational amenities like trails, playgrounds,  parks, fishing ponds, and campgrounds. As the executive director of the  Colorado Coalition of Land Trusts, he helped preserve and protect  thousands of acres of open space, wildlife habitat, and working  agricultural lands.   John most recently served as executive director of Colorado Counties,  Inc.--CCI--a nonprofit organization that provides advocacy and  education for county governments around the State. Under John's  leadership, CCI negotiated an opioid settlement with Colorado's  Attorney General and various pharmaceutical companies that provided  millions of dollars for local addiction counseling and treatment. He  also successfully steered CCI through the COVID-19 pandemic. CCI was  integral in assisting county commissioners provide frontline health  services and invest millions of dollars from the American Rescue Plan  Act and CARES Act in community programs, business retention, and  infrastructure improvements.   John served as the campaign manager for my opponent in my first race  for the U.S. Senate. In Colorado, we believe in working together  despite different political beliefs, and I came to know and respect  John for his ability to work in a pragmatic fashion with everyone. John  became a dependable ally and friend as we worked together to advance  the interests of Colorado.   Throughout his career, John embodied the notion put forward by  Wallace Stegner, that the American West is still ``the native home of  hope.'' Our great State is better for his vision, his compassion, and  his service, and I wish him well in his retirement.                            ____________________
