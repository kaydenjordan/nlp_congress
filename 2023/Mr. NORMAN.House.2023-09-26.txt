 Madam Speaker, it is interesting here, my colleagues on  the other side saying, shutdown, shutdown, shutdown; that is all you  hear.   What about the shutdown that occurred for the COVID virus for over a  year and a half? What about the shutdown that kept children out of  school for over a year and a half?   It is outrageous that here we are on this floor trying to pass  legislation to cut spending to put money back in the pockets of the  taxpayers.   Folks, we are in an economic crisis. We are in a national security  crisis. The fact is my colleagues are continually against a shutdown,  which is never good, but in this case, we are fighting for the American  people.   As Representative Roy mentioned with Homeland Security, go to the  border. Go to the border and see what is happening there. See the rape  trees. See the people coming across this border that now number in  excess of the 5.2 million from my State of South Carolina.   Think about the medical crisis. We don't know what they are coming  with. Think about the hundreds of programs that they are automatically  going to be enrolled in.   Think about the Social Security numbers and the driver's licenses  that are given to illegals that occurred in New York City. Think about  the flights paid for by taxpayers' money to go all over this country  illegally.   It is un-American, it is an invasion, and my good friends on the  other side of the aisle will pay a price as they are being booed in  different parts of the country because of leaving this border open,  leaving this country unsecure. We have never faced this kind of crisis  that we face right now just on that issue alone.   On the spending issue, I would like for those listening today to  realize it boils back to our $32 trillion, $20,000 per second it is  costing the taxpayers.   They don't want to cut anything. They want to go on with a bloated  Federal Government and continue spending as we have done before. We are  saying no.                                time  1900    I am proud of my colleagues. We will sit up here and fight if it  takes all night long. It is a sad day that we are arguing over things  that should be common sense. It is un-American what they are trying to  do.   Now, the four appropriations bills, the Homeland Security bill, tying  H.R. 2 to it, is exactly the right thing. My good friends on the other  side of the aisle talk about reduced funding. They are not enforcing  anything.   Mayorkas is not enforcing anything. Why pay him? All this does is  say: Unless you enforce the border and include  [[Page H4489]]  it, we are not paying Mayorkas a dime for homeland security.   Look at the Department of Defense. Look at the cuts, yet the  increases overall which we have given our Department of Defense. The  FDA, we have made some legitimate cuts on the FDA on some things that  should have been.
