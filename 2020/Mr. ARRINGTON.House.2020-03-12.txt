 Madam Speaker, today, I rise in opposition to H.R.  5518, the Access to Counsel Act.   This bill would provide illegal immigrants the right to counsel  immediately upon crossing our sovereign border, and American taxpayers,  by the way, would be picking up the tab.   This legislation doesn't address the humanitarian crisis at the  border. It doesn't help women and children being exploited by the drug  cartels. It doesn't  [[Page H1667]]  fix our broken immigration system. It doesn't secure the border. It  doesn't give resources to our law enforcement to keep them safe and  successful in doing that job.   This bill puts the interests of illegal immigrants before the rights  of American citizens.   Furthermore, it will overwhelm an already broken court system,  charging hundreds of millions of dollars to U.S. taxpayers, and provide  nothing to protect our citizens and the safety of our communities.                            ____________________
