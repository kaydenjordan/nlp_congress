 Madam Speaker, you are not God. Your will does not bend  the forests or shake the mountains. And let me assure you, your will  does not bow the knee of millions of my countrymen who refuse to heed  your calloused command.   To threaten arrest on others for their own personal medical decisions  is nothing short of a medical apartheid, and I will not let it stand.  For if I am to cowardly bend a knee here, like those on the left wish,  then what is to stop you all from taking your tyranny to the rest of  this country that I love?   How dare anyone in this institution attempt to dictate to the  patriots of my staff how they may live their lives. For one to think  that because they have the title ``honorable'' attached to their name  means that they may dictate what others may say and think repulses me.   What makes this Nation special is that in this free land the people  are the royalty. So arrest us if you will, but I will not cower and I  will not bend.   Madam Speaker, you have come to take away our liberties but, Madam  Speaker, in this country you are outnumbered.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I hereby remove my name as cosponsor of  the bill, H.R. 4390.
