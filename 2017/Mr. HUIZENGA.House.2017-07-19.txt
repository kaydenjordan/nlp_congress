 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a humble  public servant and someone, frankly, I am proud to call a friend, Chief  James Carmody of the Wyoming, Michigan, Police Department, who was  recently named Michigan Police Chief of the Year.   Jim Carmody began his career in 1975 as a police officer in Port  Huron, Michigan, where he rose to the rank of deputy chief. In 2006,  Jim made the decision to join the Wyoming Police Department as chief  and call west Michigan home.   Chief Carmody has led the charge to strengthen the relationship  between police officers and the community that they serve, while  providing the residents of Wyoming, Michigan, with topnotch law  enforcement.   Chief Carmody's relentless commitment to public safety doesn't end  there. He also chairs the Michigan Police Chiefs' Traffic Safety  Committee and was recently appointed to serve on the Governor's Traffic  Safety Commission.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Second District of Michigan, I  congratulate Chief Carmody on being named the top Michigan Police Chief  for 2016. We thank him for his 42--and keep counting--years of service  to Michigan and to our Nation.                            ____________________
