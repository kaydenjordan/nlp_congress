 Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Scott for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 987. I am proud that we are  about to follow through on key campaign promises: lowering drug costs  by removing barriers to generic drugs coming to market, reversing the  sabotage of the ACA, and rescinding the administration's rule to expand  junk plans.   As we all know, Congress sometimes engages in hyperbole, but this is  not hyperbole: These plans are truly junk. They are not required to  include essential benefit coverage requirements of the ACA. They can  deny consumers coverage or charge more based on age, gender, or health  status. They come with no guarantees for basic benefits like maternity  care, mental healthcare, prescription drug coverage, and other  preventive services. They are not subject to the out-of-pocket  limitations of the ACA that are designed specifically to protect  consumers.   I know a bit about these junk plans because I spent time over  Mother's Day weekend desperately helping my 26-year-old son find  insurance coverage. In March, he turned 26 and found himself uninsured.  He is in a sandwich situation between his 26th birthday and when he  will again become eligible for employer-provided healthcare.   Only because I have read countless insurance policies over the years  of my legal career did my son avoid the trap of paying $6,000 for a  policy that would afford him almost no coverage with a $10,000  deductible. That deductible would have applied even to his prescription  drugs, of which he needs one.   Just as important, my son is exactly the kind of person we need in  the marketplace.   Let's encourage robust participation in marketplace plans, which was  the intent of the Affordable Care Act. These junk plans lure young,  healthy people away from the ACA pool of plans, resulting in more  expensive premiums for the rest of Americans.   Let's pass this bill.    Madam Speaker, this week, my community and communities  across our Nation are paying tribute to law enforcement officers who  made the ultimate sacrifices in our defense.   National Police Week is a moment to reflect on those sacrifices and  the men and women who put their lives on the line for ours.   It is a moment to recognize the families who live with this  immeasurable sacrifice, and it is a moment to reaffirm our commitment  to working with local and State leaders to support these families.   We owe it to the memory of fallen officers and to the majority of men  and women in uniform who carry out their responsibilities with skill  and professionalism every day to make sure that officers are safe.   We all need to do our part to ensure that the communities they serve  are safe as well.   In this same spirit of progress, let's commit to working to shape a  more secure future for officers and for the communities they serve.                            ____________________
