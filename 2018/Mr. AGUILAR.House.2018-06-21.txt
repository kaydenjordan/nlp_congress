 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time.   Mr. Speaker, I am here today to ask every Member who believed in  bipartisan, open debate on DACA here in the House to vote ``no'' on the  previous question.   Every one of the 216 Members who signed the discharge petition should  join me. Why? Because a vote against the previous question is a vote  for queen-of-the-hill rule, and because if we defeat the previous  question, we will immediately offer the queen-of-the-hill rule and  finally start this debate.   There will be no more waiting for the last two signatures on the  discharge petition to materialize. There will be no more waiting until  the next discharge Monday comes up in the calendar. There will be no  more waiting. We will end this process and vote on queen of the hill  now.   Today, Republicans are bringing up two partisan, anti-immigrant  bills. Democrats were completely cut out of the process that produced  these bills, and, as a result, they will not get any bipartisan  support. It is questionable if either of these bills can actually pass  this House. If that is the case, then what is the point of all of this?   Is the goal to have a fake debate on DACA and have everything fail so  we are in the same place as the Senate? What good does that do?   Dreamers are still left wondering when and what Congress will do to  help them stay in this country.   Let's end this charade and actually have a bipartisan debate, and  let's pass a bipartisan bill to provide a pathway to citizenship for  Dreamers.   Mr. Speaker, this has been a crazy week for sure. But one thing is  clear: If we want to pass a fix for DACA, then we need to come together  and pass a bipartisan bill. This previous question vote gives us the  chance to do just that. Vote ``no'' on the previous question and bring  up the queen-of-the-hill rule.
