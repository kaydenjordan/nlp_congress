 Mr. President, I came here this afternoon to give my  customary weekly climate speech urging that it is time to wake up here,  and I was planning to speak about a legal brief that a number of  scientists, led by Robert Brulle and Naomi Oreskes, filed in the Ninth  Circuit detailing the long history of the oil industry knowing about  climate change, doing its own research to confirm what it knows about  climate change, telling the public something they knew was false, and  yet taking what they knew to be true and using it in their own internal  planning. But something even better than that came up, so I come here  to react to the--well, for starters, the Wall Street Journal editorial  calling for a vote on the Green New Deal.   Let's go back a bit as to what the Wall Street Journal editorial page  has been up to for the last, say, 20 years on climate change.   The Wall Street Journal editorial page has been a mouthpiece for the  fossil fuel industry's climate denial. The messages of the fossil fuel  industry are echoed and amplified through the Wall Street Journal  editorial page. All the way up until 2011, if I recall correctly, they  were simply denying that this was a problem. They constantly behave  like what I would call the one-eyed accountant--looking only at the  costs of responding to climate change, never the costs of climate  change.   On this subject, for those who may be interested, I would actually  like to incorporate by reference two previous climate speeches I gave  on this completely bogus effort that has been maintained by the Wall  Street Journal editorial page. The first was my speech of April 19,  2016, and then I went back at them again on July 24, 2018. They have  been making it up for a very long time, and sure enough, up comes this  latest in which just yesterday, February 12, they said: Let's have a  vote in Congress on the Green New Deal as soon as possible. Then they  went on with a lot of their usual one-eyed accountant stuff, never  looking at the costs of climate change, only looking at the costs of  preventing those harms, and they concluded: ``Let's not hesitate. Take  the Green New Deal resolution and put it to a vote forthwith.''   Along the way, they went into some of their usual canards about  renewables, saying that ``solar costs remain about 20 percent higher  than natural gas while offshore wind is two-thirds more expensive''  without subsidies--well, unless you look at the subsidy for fossil  fuel, which of course they don't, and the subsidy for fossil fuel has  been quantified by the International Monetary Fund at $700 billion per  year--$700 billion per year in the United States--propping up the  fossil fuel industry. By contrast, the little tiny tax adjustments that  we get for solar and wind, which the fossil fuel industry is always  pushing back against, are nothing. There is a monster of a subsidy in  the energy space, and it is the fossil fuel subsidy, but will the dear  old Wall Street Journal editorial page ever admit that? Not a chance.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in  the Record at the end of my remarks.   That came out in the Wall Street Journal that morning. Then Leader  McConnell went out here to the Ohio Clock for his midday press  conference, and guess what he said:         I've noted with great interest the Green New Deal, and       we're going to be voting on that in the Senate. That'll give       everybody an opportunity to go on record and see how they       feel about the Green New Deal.    I am in the habit of pointing out here how the string-pulling takes  place and how the fossil fuel industry directs certain things and the  mouthpieces say certain things and then we behave certain ways, but  this may be the land speed record for a response. The Wall Street  Journal says it wants a congressional vote, and that very day the vote  gets announced. It is almost funny, if the topic weren't so serious.   The whole idea that this is the Republican response to climate change  is really classic. It is really classic. Since the Citizens United  decision, which powered up the fossil fuel industry to have real  bullying dominance in Congress--at least over the Republican Party--no  Senator here today has been on any bill to meaningfully reduce carbon  dioxide emissions. It is never a topic. Nobody wants to talk about it.  It is like the unwelcome, embarrassing guest at the dinner party: Oh,  my gosh. Climate change. No, we can't possibly talk about that.   Never mind that NASA--which, by the way, RIP, Opportunity. The  Opportunity has been driving around on the surface of Mars for 15  years, sending back information to us about that planet. NASA  scientists built that thing, sent it to Mars, landed it safely on Mars,  and has been driving it around for 15 years. My God, what a project  that was. What a brilliant thing. So when NASA scientists say, ``Oh,  and by the way, climate change is serious. You ought to listen,'' and  we don't, that behavior is hard to explain. When we are listening to  the flacks of the fossil fuel industry and not the scientists of NASA-- and, by the way, 13 or 14 Federal Agencies in the latest report that  came out under the Trump administration--we are way past there being  any serious factual or scientific dispute here. There are just  political demands by the industry with the biggest conflict of interest  ever that we can't bring this up.   For pretty much 10 years, since Citizens United, nobody has brought  up a serious piece of legislation to limit carbon dioxide emissions on  the Republican side. Not one. Zero. Now, the majority leader is going  to break this streak and bring up the first carbon-related bill. It is  actually not a real bill. It is a resolution, but he is going to bring  it up with the intention of voting  [[Page S1317]]  against it. I kid you not. The majority leader has announced the  intention of bringing up a resolution with the intention of voting  against it. Who does that and why? Who had that brainstorm and where?   We will never understand this until we understand better how the  anonymous dark money stuff flows around Washington. We need to clean  that up. We need to pass the DISCLOSE Act. We need to make sure people  know who is behind spending, who is behind advertising. We have to do  all of that, but in the meantime, you do get these amazing moments in  which the Wall Street Journal says--the editorial page, by the way. I  think their correspondents, their reporters, are totally legitimate,  and they do terrific work. It is the editorial page that is the problem  child here.   So the Wall Street Journal editorial page says we need to have a vote  on the Green New Deal. It takes less than a day for the majority leader  to say we are going to have a vote on the Green New Deal, and he is  calling up the first piece of climate legislation they have ever called  up in the majority here, and they are calling it up to vote against it.   Isn't it finally time to have a real conversation about this? Isn't  it finally time for there to be a Republican proposal? It has been  nearly 10 years since Citizens United. I get it. The fossil fuel  industry has enormous sway, but there comes a time when you even have  to tell the biggest influencers in Congress that your day is over. It  is time for us to treat with the facts and to work in a bipartisan  fashion and to do what the people sent us here to do, which is to  legislate.   So where is the Republican proposal? Where is the Republican plan?  There isn't one. Nothing. Nada. Zip. Nihil. Nitchevo. They are going to  call this up. They are going to call this up for a vote. I can hardly  wait for this discussion. Bring it on, please.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 11, 2019]                         Vote on the Green New Deal                          (By The Editorial Board)         Every Member of Congress should step up and be counted.        Democrats rolled out their Green New Deal last week, and by       all means let's have a national debate and then a vote in       Congress--as soon as possible. Here in one package is what       the political left really means when it says Americans need       to do something urgently about climate change, so let's see       who has the courage of those convictions.        Thanks to the resolution introduced last week by New York       Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Sen. Ed       Markey, there's already official language. While it's       nonbinding, the 14 pages give a clear sense of direction and       magnitude in calling for a ``10-year national mobilization''       to exorcise carbon from the U.S. economy.        President Obama's Clean Power Plan looks modest by       comparison. The 10-year Green New Deal calls for generating       100% of power from renewables and removing greenhouse gas       emissions from manufacturing and transportation to the extent       these goals are ``technologically feasible.'' Hint: They're       not.        The plan also calls for ``upgrading all existing buildings       in the United States and building new buildings to achieve       maximal energy efficiency, water efficiency, safety,       affordability, comfort and durability, including through       electrification.'' That's all existing buildings, comrade.        Millions of jobs would have to be destroyed en route to       this brave new green world, but not to worry. The resolution       says the government would also guarantee ``a job with a       family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave,       paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the       United States.'' Good that they're starting small.        Sorry to mention unhappy reality, but renewable sources       currently make up only 17% of U.S. electric-power generation       despite enormous federal and state subsidies. Wind and solar       energy have become more competitive over the last decade as       costs have plunged. But without subsidies, solar costs remain       about 20% higher than natural gas while offshore wind is two-      thirds more expensive. The bigger problem is solar and wind       don't provide reliable power, so backup plants that burn       fossil fuels are required to run on stand-by.        Germany has been gracious enough to show what can go wrong.       Despite aggressive emissions goals, Germany's carbon       emissions have been flat for most of the last decade as the       country had to fall back on coal to balance off-shore wind       generation. Last year Germany derived 29% of its power from       wind and solar, but 38% from coal.        Meantime, taxes and rising power-generation costs have made       Germany's electric rates the highest in Europe, slamming       small manufacturers and consumers.        ``The drag on competitiveness is particularly severe for       small and middle-sized firms,'' Eric Schweitzer, President of       Germany's Chambers of Commerce, told Bloomberg News last       year. German manufacturing has become less competitive due to       soaring energy costs. Electric and natural gas prices in       Germany are two to three times higher than in the U.S.        By contrast, the U.S. is having a modest manufacturing       renaissance as shale drilling has created a cheap source of       lower-carbon energy. Natural-gas prices have plunged by half       over the last decade as production has increased 50%, mostly       in the Marcellus and Utica formations in Pennsylvania, Ohio       and West Virginia. Carbon emissions from power generation       have fallen by 30% since 2005, mostly due to the substitution       of coal with natural gas.        Meantime, oil production in Texas's Permian and North       Dakota's Bakken shale deposits has soared 80%. Demand for       drills, pipelines and other mining equipment has also boosted       U.S. growth.        The Green New Deal means that all of this carbon energy and       all of these jobs would have to be purged--at least in the       U.S. China would suffer no such limits on its fossil-fuel       production. Conservatives have long suspected that       progressives want to use climate change to justify a       government takeover of the free-market economy, but we never       thought they'd be this candid about it.        Yet, remarkably, the Green New Deal has been met with       hosannas from liberal interest groups and in Congress. It       already has 67 co-sponsors in the House and the support of 11       Democrats in the Senate including presidential candidates       Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren and Amy       Klobuchar.        So let's not hesitate. Take the Green New Deal resolution       and put it to a vote forthwith on the House and Senate floor.     With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
