 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the proposed  United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, commonly known as USMCA.   This new trade agreement, as negotiated by President Trump's  administration, is critical to our Nation's economic growth. NAFTA is  outdated, and this modernization to the world's largest free trade  agreement is vital to building an economy that maximizes opportunity  for all Americans--indeed, all of North America and Mexico.   The United States, Canada, and Mexico, for decades, have fostered a  working trade relationship. This trade agreement is crucial to the  manufacturers, fabricators, farmers, distributors, retailers, and all  other businesses in Pennsylvania's Ninth Congressional District and  across the country.   So much of Congress' energy this year has been focused on messaging  votes and nonbinding resolutions. It is time that Democrat leadership  here in the House put aside partisan politics and put the needs of the  American people first.   The benefits to our economy are obvious and significant. I urge  Speaker Pelosi to bring USMCA to the House floor for a vote.                            ____________________
