 Madam Speaker, I am going to do a couple of things  right now, and one of the first ones is a little conversation about  someone we lost in my community who actually was a friend and a  neighbor and had an impact in ways that are hard to describe. I  desperately wish the Members of this body could have spent time with  him and his wife.   It is Rev. Dr. Professor C.T. Wright. What was so unique about him is  that he was a big man, and he had a voice that carried. You would have  conversations with him, Madam Speaker, and realize just how incredibly  brilliant he was.   He was born in Georgia. He struggled and worked his way up. He ended  up with a Ph.D. in history from Boston College. He became a civil  rights leader, yet when you would talk to him about that, Reverend  Wright--Dr. Wright--actually often wouldn't refer to himself as a civil  rights leader. He would say: I want to lead for humanity.   He loved people. It was a different view. He took his struggles, his  success, and his academic prowess and said: We are going to make  people's lives better. Why would you dare focus on the color of their  skin?   I remember one of the most interesting conversations I had with him  where he and I were in the back of the room and talked, and he saw many  of--actually, almost an example of what we just saw on the floor--the  discussions of politics and race, and said: David, it is class and  opportunity that divides us. It is not our color; it is our  opportunity.   Dr. Wright was just a powerful and brilliant man.   Madam Speaker, you see his wife there, Mary. They were married in  1974. Mary was the epitome of love.   How many of us in our life have that one person?   I am blessed to have a 5-year-old little girl. But even when she was  younger, when she would see Mary, Mary would sort of scream, and the  two of them would run over and hug each other. She was just the epitome  of love.   That made them incredibly powerful, as you felt good by just knowing  Dr. Wright and Mary Wright in your community.   The other thing that also made him unique was that he was a  passionate conservative. He was a Republican elector. He was the  chairman of our clemency board, and he was on my community school  board. He was brilliant, and he cared about humanity. He ran charities  and foundations to help all people. They helped people on the continent  of Africa and even people all through our community. He was a powerful  force for good because he was good, because he was passionate, and  because he was caring.   We lost both Mary and Dr. Wright last year.   I am going to put in a much more detailed CV because his history goes  on page after page, and we will put that in the Congressional Record.   Individuals like them bring us together and also make us better. It  breaks my heart that more will not get to spend time with him because,  after a couple of minutes with him and Mary, you felt different.   The last thing I will say is he loved to give the opening prayer at  Republican meetings. What was always so fascinating, Madam Speaker, is  you would watch the room, and the room ends up standing and clapping. I  was waiting for an altar call. Now, I am Catholic, so I am not used to  the concept of an altar call, but watching someone be able to have so  much energy, vigor, enthusiasm, love for people, and love for believing  that conservatism is how you free people, he made an impact. He made an  impact on my life, my family's life, my community, and my State, and I  believe he made an impact on this country.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Dr. C.T. Wright, a  passionate, faithful, and devoted public servant and valued neighbor.  C.T. will be remembered as a mentor and true leader throughout the  education, criminal justice, and faith communities in Arizona. He  devoted much of his life to civil rights and education, working for  many of the country's historically black colleges and universities,  where he then moved on to his passion to help with human rights. He  founded the Light of Hope Institute, which promotes human rights around  the world. He also served as a delegate for the Electoral College and  met six presidents. C.T. frequently led prayers at campaign rallies and  promoted faith. He proudly served as the Chairman of the Board of  Executive Clemency.   C.T. Wright had great passion for his family, education, faith, and  freedom. Many will always remember and consider him as their brother.  He leaves behind a great legacy that has reached out to communities  across Arizona. He was a thoughtful, compassionate, and kind man who  always cared for others while ensuring a good future for all.   C.T. Wright served countless communities unselfishly and served and  as a great leader. May we continue to honor his memory through our  passion and service to our communities.                          Revisiting Net Neutrality     Madam Speaker, I want to do a handful of other things  because, with the craziness of our schedule, we haven't had a chance to  sort of walk through a lot of policy thoughts. But there was one that  has been bugging me. I have the hour, so I was going to share something  that has just been in my craw for a while.  [[Page H1607]]    Do we all remember a few years ago--ancient history; in politics, we  seem to have, shall we say, the attention span of a gnat--one of the  pop culture debates we on the right and left were having was something  called net neutrality? The Democrats were all into net neutrality, even  though, I will debate, most of this body had no idea what net  neutrality was. I want to sort of argue that thank heaven and thank the  internet gods that the Democrat net neutrality push only lasted 1 year  or think about how miserable this last year would have been.   We should be held accountable for our policy beliefs. This is an  occasion where I have heard no one get up here and talk about what  society would have looked like in the United States during the pandemic  if the Democrats' net neutrality policy--remember, they did it for 1  year, through regulatory fiat.   The only reason I show this chart is, do you see, Madam Speaker, the  crash here in spending? It was scheduled to continue to crash in  spending. That spending was the internet--the pipes, the robustness,  the speed, and the carrying capacity of the internet--which crashed  during the Democrat administration's FCC 1 year of functionally doing  an administrative fiat of net neutrality.   If that line had continued, how many of you were educating your kids  on Zoom? How many of you were holding meetings on the internet? How  many of you had to work from home? How many of us in this body were  doing committee hearings over the internet?   Yet, the internet in the United States in 2017, 2018, and 2019  actually got dramatically more robust and dramatically faster. In many  communities--particularly on the East Coast, oddly enough--there are  communities that doubled their speed and the robustness of the pipes.                                time  1330    It happened because of the massive investment because, thank heaven,  the crazy policy of what was net neutrality was taken away.   We need to be honest. Sometimes one needs to be willing to walk up  and admit, hey, that was a really stupid idea. The one reason this  country was able to have this disruption and transfer to basically a  knowledge-based, web-based, internet-based economy was because the  crazy policies that came with net neutrality of having a robust  internet only lasted 1 year.   You can actually see that this is what happened. This is us. This is  America trying to survive economically and educationally. When you see  these charts, this was not possible. If that trend, regulatorily, and  then therefore investment-wise that started in 2016, when the policy  shift happened, if it had lasted more than a year, this year would have  been a lot different.   It is just an occasion where 4 years ago, 5 years ago, some of us  would get up here and try to explain what it would mean to the  efficiency, the robustness, the opportunity for even gamers being able  to use the internet, and we would get great rhetorical comments back,  often having nothing to actually do with how the internet worked. Thank  heaven another bad policy only lasted a short time.                          Building a Robust Economy     Madam Speaker, the other thing I also want to talk  about is why so many of us who actually own calculators are intensely  concerned about the left's policy in the last couple of months.   This is one of those things that I genuinely believe both sides here  passionately care about and want society to do well, to have  opportunity, the working poor to become less poor, the poor to become  less poor, the middle class to be able to thrive; but we just see the  basics of economics differently.   I want to spend just a couple of moments and walk through what is  fact, and we have the facts. Now, first off, how many times over, and  over, and over do we hear, Hey, post-tax reform, the rich are getting  richer; the poor are getting poorer?   That is mathematically absolutely not true. It is a lie.   It turns out, policies like we have been engaged in just recently  make the wealthy wealthier. It is a simple thought. When you pump  massive amounts of liquidity into a society, into an economy, those  people who own assets get richer. Their stocks go up, their house  values go up, and other assets they have go up.   But if you are part of the poor or working poor, how many stocks do  you own? How much real estate do you own?   Yet the basic economic principles that you get to look at over and  over, the $1.9 trillion spending bill violated almost all of the  principles.   So you say, okay, so we are going to deliver actual checks. Great.  Okay. That will have an impact for several months. It will reduce  poverty for several months, but it doesn't change the base.   A year later, are you being paid more? Are there more job  opportunities? Is your labor valuable?   Because the remarkable thing that happened in 2018 and 2019 is the  working poor, their labor became valuable. They became essential to the  society, to economic growth.   I sat through joint economic hearings in previous years and listened  to the arrogance of the economists, the arrogance of the political  class who said: Well, they didn't finish high school. They are going to  be part of the permanent underclass. We will just find a way to  subsidize them and write them off in society instead of making them  valuable.   And that is what we have gone back and done again. And the problem is  that we have done it in a way where we think we have big hearts. We are  going to send checks.   But what about the year after? Did they make their labor, their skill  sets, or their lack of skill sets, desirable in the economy?   So a simple point--and if I actually even had better data, this would  even be more dramatic--in 2013 to 2019, you can see the orange there,  and that is actually pretty much the wealthy in our country.   Under the previous administration, you can see--and when I say  ``previous,'' I am talking Obama--the wealthy got substantially  wealthier than the poor, and it is because the lack of understanding of  what creates economic vitality. This here is almost solely 2018 and  2019. The poor got wealthier; not the rich, the poor.   The working poor moved up dramatically faster than the rich.   Why?   Well, it turns out, tax reform moved lots of capital into making  plants and equipment more efficient, meaning you pay people more.   You all remember your basic economics class. What are the two things  that raises someone's wages?   Inflation--which means you paid more, but you didn't get anything  more--and productivity.   When you raise a business's, the society's, the community's  productivity, people get paid more. That is what was happening here. We  made the working poor less poor through tax; regulatory; and  immigration policy, which is something I will touch on at the end  because it is very uncomfortable for a lot of people to talk about.   Immigration policy is complex from an economic standpoint, but if you  love and care for those who are just struggling and trying to survive,  they may not have had the opportunity to go to grad school or college.  They may not have even graduated high school, but they are out there  trying to provide for themselves and their families and the people they  love and care for.   Why do we adopt policies like this that don't make their labor  valuable, and then we choose to flood the market with similar skill  sets to devalue the labor?   There is this weird duplicity that happens here, where we talk about  helping those who need help, and then we engage in policies, whether it  be immigration policy, regulatory policy, particularly tax and spending  policy, that ends up crushing the very people we claim we are trying to  help.    I know charts are annoying, but the math is the math. If you look at  this one, you start to see the percentage of American households that  were in poverty. We had substantially plateaued. We weren't getting  better as a society. And then all of a sudden over here, you see we  started doing what was necessary to expand, create opportunity. And,  yes, it meant getting businesses to have to compete with each other by  putting money into more efficient equipment and doing things that  lifted Americans and created value for labor, even the very low-skilled  labor.  [[Page H1608]]    You start to see in 2018 and 2019, America hitting its lowest poverty  rates ever; income, food insecurity, the lowest ever. The working  poor's labor became valuable. And if you actually want to go into the  subsets--which I have chart after chart after chart--if you claim you  care about African-American females or this subset or that subset, you  see that some of those subsets have movement in the value of their  talents and their labor, which was remarkable.   We had, I think, a quarter in early 2019, or it was late 2018, where  African-American women had almost a double-digit rise in wages in an  entire year. It was like a 7.3 percent rise in wages.   I know, as a Republican, we have this bad habit of sounding like  accountants on steroids, but these numbers really do mean something. It  is people. It is how they feed their family, how they save for  retirement, how they have an opportunity. There were amazing things  happening.   We talk a lot about income inequality, which I actually have a  personal fixation on this. And if you actually look at the first time  we had major movement in the drop of income inequality in this society,  it was 2018 and 2019. And it wasn't because rich people got less rich.  It was because the poor, the working poor got dramatically less poor.   We adopted policies that made their labor valuable. Then the pandemic  hit and we had to rebuild.   But are we rebuilding in a way that makes their labor valuable?   I am going to make an argument that what we just did, we are going to  get a nice little sugar high, but for a very short time.   And then the next day, what are their job prospects?   If you are someone who didn't finish high school, but you are willing  to work your heart out, you are willing to learn, what opportunities  did the last spending bill provide for that person? How many new jobs  did it help create? How much economic expansion? How many capital  expenditures to make their jobs more productive so they can be paid  more?   Instead, what we did is we said: Here is some money, and, oh, by the  way, we are going to raise taxes over here coming later this year and  those things, so your job prospects--it is a technical economic term-- you are screwed in the future.   Do we think more than just the next election cycle?   If we are going to make the poor less poor in this country, you need  opportunity. We just spent $1.9 trillion and not a dime of it creates  opportunity, creates what the future should look like.   So we say we care. We both care. The problem is, I have the numbers  that show what worked. The other side has decades of doing the same  thing and income inequality and poverty didn't get better. They are  blips. But those blips were from direct cash, unless the plan is just,  hey, we are going to do direct cash forever and ever and ever, and that  is really going to be great for society and the psyche of our society.   Once again, I am sorry to do this, and I hate this term, but it is  the only one the economists around here all use, which is  ``quartiles.'' Here is the lowest income quartile. Take a look at 2019,  if you are willing to embrace math.   I always thought that would be the great Christmas gift around here,  is to buy everyone a calculator. A family joke is: Daddy works in a  math-free zone.   It was a remarkable change in the value of those workers and what  they were paid, and it is because their talent, their labor that they  had to offer became more valuable.   Look at what happened in 2019. That is what changes a society,  because the idea is, you build a base, and then the next year you build  on it, and then the next year you build on it, and the next year you  build on it. That is one way to remove lots of your society out of  poverty.   The other is to do what the Democrats are doing right now and saying:  We are going to send you a check.   Okay. What happens the day the check is gone? Did you make society  more prosperous? Did you take the working poor of our country and make  it so the value of their labor that they offer is more valuable the  next day, and the next day, and the next day?   You didn't. The only way you basically have to backfill is you have  got to send another check. It is just societal suicide and lunacy.   I understand pandering and politics, but at some point you wish you  had a quiet room with some economists to say: How do we have a  revolution in our society that we have dramatically less poor and the  working poor are dramatically less poor? And how do we get there? And  how do we do this over the next decade?   Because I will make you the argument that what was happening  particularly in 2018 and 2019 were remarkable numbers. So let's go to  the next quartile up. It turns out the same thing was happening.   And when you actually look at the stratification of these quartiles-- I am sorry, it is geeky--the lowest quartile, a traditionally very,  very low skill set. Second quartile, up some skill set. And you  actually see remarkable--I mean, a $2,600 increase in the value of  their labor for the second quartile, which is still poverty. It is  working poor, but this quartile, if you look at that, that is  remarkable.   This is actually accounting for earning of tax credit and transfer  payments, working through what was economic, and it was the value of  their labor.                                time  1345    Once again, for all of us that keep coming behind these microphones-- and, you know, particularly the darkness of this body right now, we see  so much of the debate being about the pigment of someone's skin instead  of the economic circumstances, the class, as Dr. Wright would often  refer to, and what we do to create opportunity.   And this chart here basically is just pure salary. What happened to  the mean weekly, real earnings? Now, remember, these are inflationary  adjusted. So I do my best to make sure the math is as honest as  possible. And when you actually start to see the quartiles of African- American wages taking a huge spike up in 2018 and 2019--Anglos,  Hispanics--really the growth rate in their wages was remarkable. And  there are some other charts, which are really hard to read, that are a  little geeky, that say, okay, here is the level of skill set,  educational attainment, those things.   It turns out, we had such a robust economy that those who are often  at the tail end of educational attainment actually had the fastest  growth in wages.   So you go back to the earlier chart, saying, turns out the working  poor got substantially less poor, the rich got richer, but nothing at  the same percentages. And that is why the economic inequality shrank.  That is the honest math. Yet, you don't hear it in the rhetoric here,  because the rhetorical divide of our society is so much more powerful  and desired, because it is about winning the next election than  actually doing what is important to make society great.   So right now--and this is a hard one to talk about, because we have  so politicized it that trying to look at it through an economic lens is  really hard. I will get folks--whenever I start to walk through these  numbers, folks will send me crazy stuff. And I am trying to say this  isn't about ethnicity; this is--I am doing labor economics.   Janet Yellen is supposed to be a brilliant labor economist, yet when  you hear her speeches recently--or now that she is Treasury Secretary-- it rips your heart out, saying, at least take a breath and compliment  what happened in the previous couple of years, but that would mean  saying something nice to free market economics.   Right now, we estimate--and this is the best number I can get my  hands on--that about 4\1/2\ percent of the labor force is undocumented.   In a society right now where, if you actually really dive into labor  force participation numbers, unemployment is probably double the number  we post. You know, people who should be in the labor pool aren't there,  the folks who were the miracle of, particularly, 2018 and 2019, the  number of folks who came back into the labor force--remember, we  actually had some quarters there with some weird numbers where  unemployment actually sort of flatlined, but the number of workers in  the United States exploded. How does that happen?  [[Page H1609]]    It means you have such a robust economy that you are drawing people  back in.   The crisis we live in today is so many Americans, particularly female  workers, are now out of the labor force, with almost no intention of  coming back in. What is devastating about that is we just passed  legislation here that will reinforce the incentive not to come back in.  Because, instead of designing the Democrat's $1.9 trillion spending  bill saying, We are going to incentivize; we are going to help you; you  can keep some of this money; and we are going to incentivize an  employer to hire you, building that type of economy. It is, Here is  something; you can have it if you work; you can have it if you just  choose to stay home. There is no incentive there to come back into the  labor market.   And why is this so darn important? Why do I fixate on this?   Post-tax reform, if you actually looked at the changes in revenues-- remember, we had the second and third highest, adjusted for inflation,  tax receipts in U.S. history post-tax reform, post the lower rates. It  is because the economy, the pie, got so much bigger. But what was so  special about that is the trust funds that so many of us had worked on,  that--we were really worried how fast the Medicare trust fund was  collapsing, the Social Security trust fund was collapsing. The  actuarial life of them popped, it got longer. It is because we had so  many more workers who were paying into it.   Remember, we have a pay-as-you-go system. When you hear the words  ``trust fund,'' there is really very little cash in those trust funds.   If you care about protecting Social Security, if you care about  protecting Medicare, if you care about society and these promises we  have made, you would think the economics, the policy we are adopting  here, are about maximizing opportunity employment, not trying to patch  over pain that we are suffering right now in a way that makes the next  day painful again.   So the last thing--and it actually does tie in. I am going to  personalize this a little bit. I am blessed to live in a community  where my school is open.   The greatest gift that has ever been given to me in my life, and my  wife, is we have a little girl. Many know we struggled for years, and  we were able to adopt a little girl. She is the greatest joy you can  imagine.   She is in higher education now. She is in kindergarten. And this  summer, for her first month--this is back in August--she had to sit at  home behind a little laptop doing Zoom class, as a kindergartner. At  that time she was 4\3/4\. She tested in early.   And she was miserable. I had a little girl--I didn't know this could  happen, that a child that young could be depressed. She was miserable.   ``Daddy, can I go to Washington with you?''   ``Daddy, can I go to work with you?''   ``Daddy, don't make me sit behind the computer.''   ``Daddy, I don't like this.''   And then after about 3\1/2\ weeks, the school district actually  followed the science. Not the politics; they followed the science. Not  the teachers' union; they followed the science. They started letting  the little people into school. They took the proper precautions, and my  little girl wears a mask and they sterilize their hands. They follow  rational precautions.    Within just days, it is like I had a different little girl. She was  joyful. She was happy. She announced she had a boyfriend. Daddy is not  happy about that.   If that is my personal experience, what have we done to our society?  What have we done to the next generation?   I came here last week and did a series of presentations of what we  have done to individual future earning power, particularly the  categories we just talked about, the working poor, their future  earnings, their future income. We have crushed them, because today's  success builds on the next. What happens when you take an entire year  away from so many people's career paths, from building their base?   Now, this is international, but we came across this; it is a sense of  well-being of young people and older people from around the world.   We all saw that article from about a month ago about Las Vegas County  and the number of suicides of children. And this one, when you look at  it, it is our kids. We have devastated our kids.   My fear is we are going to spend decades making up for the schools  being closed, the access to nutrition, the access to counseling, and  the access to just human relationships. Why would we ever allow our  public policy to do this sort of violence to the health and well-being  and psyche of the children that we claim we care about, because the  teachers' union has a different agenda?   I hope we, as Members, and I hope America remembers what happened  here. I also hope the next time the left comes with a massive spending  bill, they understand how much that money needs to go into repairing  the damage we have done to our children, to the next generation, and  being willing to recognize that we didn't follow the science; we  followed the politics.   Madam Speaker, I wish us all a fine time at home. I hope now that the  world is getting healthier, we can spend time with our constituents.  Maybe when we come back in a couple weeks, we can still be partisan, we  can still duke it out, but we actually make policy by rational math  instead of the wedge of politics.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
