 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the hardworking students, teachers, and staff at DuBois Area  Middle School. For the fourth consecutive time, DuBois Area Middle  School was one of over 465 schools from around the country named as a  school to watch by the National Forum to Accelerate Middle-Grades  Reform.   The Schools to Watch recognition is based on a comprehensive 3-year  review of the entire school. Only one other middle school in  Pennsylvania has remained at the top with DuBois for their continuous  designations.   The students, teachers, and faculty members have joined together to  create a learning community where everyone is supported. Every year,  the community is challenged to maintain their success by continuing to  put their best foot forward. This week, they were recognized for their  12 years of excellence at the National Forum Schools to Watch  Conference here in Washington, D.C.   I look forward meeting representatives from the DuBois Area Middle  School later today. Madam Speaker, the entire 15th Congressional  District of Pennsylvania is proud of their continuous success.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  to take from the Speaker's table H.R. 3401, with the Senate amendment  thereto, and concur in the Senate amendment. This bipartisan bill  passed the Senate with 84 votes and can be sent to the President's desk  for his signature today.
