 Mr. Chair, I miscast my vote on rollcall No. 112 this  evening on Amendment No. 3 offered by Representative Jared F. Golden  (D-ME) and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA) to H.R. 185. My vote was  recorded as ``No'' when I intended to vote ``Aye.''                     Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Rose
