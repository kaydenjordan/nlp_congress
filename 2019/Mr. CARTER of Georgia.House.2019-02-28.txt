 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Tybee  Island in the First Congressional District of Georgia for breaking  ground on a brand-new Marine Science Center.   After years of hard work and planning by Tybee residents, local  officials, business leaders, engineers, and so many other individuals,  a ceremony was held on February 25 to celebrate the start of  construction.   Scheduled to open in March of 2020, the programs at the current  Marine Science Center have been enormously successful. One program  called Sidewalk to the Sea has been able to reach more than 40,000 kids  and educate them about the nearby Atlantic Ocean, which sits only a few  hundred yards away from the facility.   Additionally, the new Marine Science Center will include interpretive  exhibits, an amphitheater, a shark school, animal rescue activities, a  dune habitat trail, and more.   It is so encouraging to see the residents of this local community  taking steps to appreciate our oceans, while educating old and young  alike on ways that they can pitch in to preserve them.   Congratulations, and keep up the good work.                            ____________________
