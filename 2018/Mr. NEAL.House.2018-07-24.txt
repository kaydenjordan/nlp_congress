 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today's debate reminds me of the words of Will Rogers  who used to say that: ``The only difference between death and taxes is  that death doesn't get worse every time Congress meets.''   Although I concede that he had a point during most of the past year,  hopefully, today will be an exception to the Rogers rule. That is  because we are taking up H.R. 3500, a good bill that would prevent the  IRS from rehiring employees who have previously been terminated due to  poor conduct or performance.   I want to say at the outset that I know most, if not overwhelmingly  all, IRS employees tend to be ethical and diligent public servants who  have, in recent years, been asked to do much more with much less. That  is exactly what the American people deserve and expect from them and we  all appreciate those efforts.   The IRS employees collecting our Nation's revenue enable the Federal  Government to support veterans benefits, pave roads, protect the  environment, fund medical research, care for needy children, and meet  all of the other needs our Federal Government asks. This is an enormous  task, and we need intelligent men and women of integrity in those roles  who will administer our Tax Code in a fair, even-handed, reasonable,  and ethical manner. Most IRS employees meet this standard with the  utmost attention to their professional responsibilities and we honor  their contributions to the country.   When we learn of situations that fall short of those high standards  or employees who have conducted themselves dishonorably, though, it is  critically important to rectify the situation swiftly. Jobs at the IRS  are positions of great public trust, and last year the Treasury  Inspector General for Tax Administration alerted us to a practice of  hiring individuals who had previously violated that trust.   During 15 months covering parts of 2015 and 2016, TIGTA found that  the IRS hired almost 7,500 people, including 2,000 rehires. About 10  percent of the rehired employees, who were mostly seasonal workers, had  been terminated or separated while under investigation for  substantiated conduct or performance issues. Four of the more than 200  rehired employees failed to file their own tax returns. Four were under  investigation for unauthorized access to taxpayer information. Twenty- seven failed to disclose a prior termination or conviction on their  applications, as required.   Although these hires represent but a fraction of IRS employees  overall, it is important that we rectify the situation swiftly and  prevent this from happening in the future.   So I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3500, and at the same time  remind them that the outliers we are addressing today should not  diminish our respect for the men and women at the IRS who serve the  public with, I think, dignity every single day.   Mr. Speaker, let me thank those Internal Revenue Service employees  for their hard work.   Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues on both sides to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6084, which will provide  needed assistance to victims of identity theft. The Committee on Ways  and Means has been engaged for some time on the issue of identity  theft. In particular, we are stewards of the Social Security  [[Page H7115]]  number which is a target for identity thieves because it is the key to  unlocking a stolen identity.   Identity theft is a growing problem and online hacking has led to  major security breaches in both government, and extensively in the  private sector. Americans of all ages, even children, are vulnerable to  having their identity stolen. This can wreak havoc in people's lives.   One thing we can do, which we are doing today, is to make sure that  individuals can get the assistance they need from the Social Security  Administration, SSA, when identity theft has caused problems with their  benefits, or if their number has been severely compromised.   For example, fraudsters have been able to steal a Social Security  number and use it to file a fraudulent benefit application or to file a  false tax return and claim a refund. For some individuals, the theft of  their identity creates such damage that they are forced to request a  new Social Security number.   Right now, identity theft victims trying to resolve an issue related  to the misuse of their Social Security numbers may have to contact SSA  multiple times, speaking to several different people, before the issue  can be fully resolved.   This legislation provides individuals with a single point of contact  in the Social Security Administration that will be responsible for  resolving all Social Security-related issues in connection with a  theft. This unit will be accountable to identity theft victims until  completion, and will track the individual's case and coordinate with  other units to resolve all of these issues as quickly as possible.   I certainly support this legislation, which was reported out of the  Ways and Means Committee by a unanimous vote. I urge support for H.R.  6084, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the sponsors for their hard work, and I  urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4952,  the Improving Seniors Access to Quality Benefits Act.   More than 19 million Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in Medicare  Advantage plans in 2017--that is almost one-third of all Medicare  beneficiaries--and that number is growing every year. This bill would  require the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a study  and submit a report to Congress on the effect of including quality  bonus payments in the benchmark cap.   The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, believes the  benchmark payments made to Medicare Advantage plans include the bonuses  Medicare Advantage plans may earn from delivering care that meets  certain basic quality standards. On the other hand, plans argue that  these quality bonuses should not be included in the benchmark cap. The  Medicare Payment Advisory Commission has recommended, among other  things, that this interaction be investigated.   This bill, by requiring a study of the issue, will help Congress come  to a conclusion on possible solutions.   In closing, I thank the sponsors for their hard work. I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 4952, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the House has passed this bill before, making  clarifications on existing religious exemptions for healthcare. I  understand that religious groups have important healthcare concerns  that should be taken seriously.   While I support this bill, we should be talking about issues in  healthcare that our constituents bring up every day: skyrocketing  prescription drug costs, increasing premiums, and threats to guaranteed  coverage.   I just wanted to make those points, never losing the opportunity.   This bill is pretty simple, Mr. Speaker. Right now the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, has an advisory panel for  hospital outpatient issues that is comprised of outside experts. The  problem is this panel does not include representation for an ambulatory  surgical center, or ASC, in its membership, despite the panel  counseling on Medicare or ASC payment issues.   This legislation would require the addition of someone from ASC on  the advisory panel on hospital outpatient concerns.   Given that Medicare pays ASCs more than $4 billion a year through the  outpatient payment rule, it just makes sense that ASCs be represented  on this panel.   The bill requires more transparency in determining what types of  surgeries are safe to perform on an outpatient basis. More than 3  million Medicare beneficiaries receive care at an ASC for cataract  surgery and other surgeries. This bill makes sure that Medicare hears  the voice of the ASC provider, so that millions of Medicare  beneficiaries can continue to receive the outpatient care they want.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 6138, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6124, which closes a  longstanding gap in Social Security coverage for members of Indian  Tribal councils.   Let me thank Representatives Dave Reichert and Suzan DelBene for  their good work to resolve this issue.   H.R. 6124 allows Indian Tribal councils to voluntarily cover their  members under Social Security in a way that is similar to how State and  local governments do so today. This would allow individuals employed as  members of Tribal councils to contribute to Social Security and  Medicare and, therefore, earn benefit protection.   I want to emphasize that the decision to participate would be  voluntary. Each Tribal council will have the right to decide for  itself.   In addition, because there has been confusion around this issue for  many years, the legislation allows Tribal council members to receive  benefit credit if they have erroneously paid Social Security taxes in  the past, even though they were not required to. This is only fair, and  I am pleased that the legislation addresses this problem as well.   Social Security and Medicare coverage are valuable protections for  all Americans. I am pleased that this bipartisan legislation is moving  forward, and I urge its support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to thank the sponsors for their hard work. I urge colleagues  on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this week has been dubbed ``health week'' on the House  floor. However, based on the legislation we are considering, it is hard  to take that challenge seriously. The bills before us today simply  don't do very much. Instead, we should be considering measures that go  to the heart of what Americans need: lower healthcare costs and high- quality care. That includes lower drug costs and prescription benefits  that should be extended to all members of the American family based on  the following notion that we should continue to make sure that  preexisting conditions remain part of the Affordable Care Act.   More and more families are facing difficult healthcare decisions. All  too often, it comes down to not going to an important doctor  appointment or cutting pills in half or stopping the taking of  prescription medicines altogether. This, coupled with other challenges  Americans face at home, like retirement security, addiction issues, and  education costs, will make it harder, not easier, for them to move  forward.   At home in western Massachusetts, I hear about how people need to  make complicated decisions for their families. Congress can simplify  these things by bringing bills to the floor that truly address the cost  of healthcare without making consumers shoulder more of the cost and  give tax benefits to the wealthy, leaving patients to ever growing  medical bills.   Unfortunately, I have not seen any efforts to address these growing  costs in a meaningful way. Instead, our Republican colleagues continue  to lead efforts to sabotage critical health programs. This has led to  more uncertainty for American families. This uncertainty also impacts  the marketplace and leads to premium increases and adds to the burden  for American families already having trouble making ends meet.   Instead of placing more anxiety on individuals facing discrimination  for preexisting conditions, we should protect and strengthen already  existing programs like Medicare and Medicaid.   The legislation before us is another billion, billion, billions of  dollars in unpaid tax cuts. This is on top of the $2.3 trillion this  Congress has already passed into law, all with borrowed money.  Republicans are using the deficit, which they keep making larger, to  justify the deep cuts they plan to make to Medicare, Social Security,  and Medicaid. These bills will only intensify Republican calls for  further cuts to those critical programs.   American families need certainty, Mr. Speaker. What is happening to  our Nation's healthcare at the moment is anything but. It is another  obstacle for families to get a leg up and ensure their children and  grandchildren are safe and have opportunities well into the future.   The same is true for our seniors and those working to prepare for  retirement. They should be in a place knowing they can retire without  anxiety and have health programs they can count on in their later  years.   The bills before us this day do nothing to solve problems for  everyday Americans. Instead, it leaves them further behind, with  increased healthcare costs, lower coverage, and certainly sacrifices  the quality of care they might receive.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  [[Page H7121]]  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), who is a well-known champion of Americans'  healthcare plans.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, anybody who doesn't understand what $2.3 trillion of tax  cuts and further tax cuts of this measure mean as a threat to Medicare  and Social Security and Medicaid down the road, that is a short-term  view of where we are headed financially in America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Correa).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, but I am  prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to address the reference that my friend from  Minnesota offered a moment ago when he referred to the device tax as  mythology.   I negotiated that agreement with the industry. They asked for the  following: that it be applied to foreign competition. We said yes. This  was done in Speaker Pelosi's office with the industry.    They suggested at the time that the 5 percent tax be cut to 2.3  percent. We went along with that. Even though the United States Senate  had sent over a revenue package of $40 billion, we cut it by $20  billion.   So that wasn't mythology. It was the way the institution once worked,  how we negotiate, go back and forth, discuss, and then come to rational  conclusions that might help and acknowledge the 20 million more  Americans who have coverage now under the Affordable Care Act--20  million Americans.   I want to say something at this point, Mr. Speaker, if I may.   In the State of Massachusetts, do you know what we are really proud  of on this day? One hundred percent of the children in Massachusetts  are covered with health insurance, and 97 percent of the adults in our  State are covered with health insurance. It is a remarkable statistic,  and it is based, in some measure, on the negotiations we had with  respective industries to get this legislation over the goal line.   So I know exactly what happened here, and I understand fully what  negotiations mean. But we rejected the $40 billion price tag that came  from the U.S. Senate, cut it in half and said to the industry: This is,  we hope and expect, your share of making sure that 20 million more  Americans have health insurance.   That is what this issue is about: accessibility, earlier stages of  prevention, getting people into health insurance earlier in life. That  is precisely what we did with the Affordable Care Act.   And let me just say this, if I may, as well. Let me talk about the  mandate, while they are waiting for their next speaker to arrive. Here  is what makes the mandate and its importance.   Why should the rest of us in America pay $1,000 a year in our health  insurance plans because there are those who don't want to buy health  insurance and end up in the emergency rooms of America, and they thumb  their noses at us on the way out because of uncompensated care and they  don't pay the bill?   So do you know what would be great, Mr. Speaker? If we all knew the  day that our house was going to burn down, then--do you know what?--the  day before, we would buy homeowners insurance.                                time  1630    If we all knew the day that we were going to get in that accident, we  would buy automobile insurance. But the truth is that insurance spreads  risk, and we all know we don't know when those things might occur, so  we buy insurance in advance.   So, today, 20 million more Americans have insurance because of what  we did with the Affordable Care Act. This idea that you can continually  sabotage it and take it apart piece by piece makes no sense.   On this particular issue with the device revenue, I can tell you and  I can state to you, under oath, Mr. Speaker, what we did to negotiate  this contribution to making America's healthcare more effective and  better for all members of the American family, the understanding being  that, at the end of life, if you have earlier intervention with  healthcare, the end of life might be a heck of a lot more pleasant  along the way.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted that the gentlewoman from Indiana, my  friend, just mentioned the tax cut, so let me just point this out. We  have gone from a rate of 35 percent in the corporate world to 21  percent, a 14 point cut in the corporate tax rate, and we are being  asked to do this on top of it.   Now, Medicare purchases most of the medical devices in America-- taxpayer supported. It is an earned benefit. But here is the other  important part of it that I think bears some noting today. It is a  terrific industry. It is not in dispute. It is an important industry in  America.   But when the gentlewoman says: ``Well, the economy is booming because  of these tax cuts,'' a reminder, a fact, not from my Twitter account,  but stated on the House floor: The American economy has been growing  for 94 straight months.   The idea that this all happened 500 days ago doesn't stand up  underneath the magnifying glass of critical analysis. The stock market  has been going up since March of 2009.   So when I look at the corporate cut--astounding, by the way-- remember, President Obama said we should have a corporate rate of 28  percent and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, a good friend  of mine, a Republican, he said, no, we should have 25 percent.   So what did the other side do? Let's see, the difference between 28  and 25? Aha, it is 21. I mean, I haven't figured that out yet.   So, day after day, we roll through here with another tax cut  proposal, and we watch the deficits and the debt go to $20 trillion.  Whatever happened to the Republican idea of fiscal rectitude, which  year after year they lectured us on?   We negotiated this agreement over the device tax, Mr. Speaker,  guaranteed. It was accepted by the industry. Again, we applied it to  foreign competition. They would be taxed at the same rate. Medicare  would remain the largest vendor, the largest purchaser of medical  devices.   This is a step backward on America's healthcare plan. If they would  just give the Affordable Care Act a chance to  [[Page H7124]]  work, instead of these deliberate efforts day after day to sabotage it,  we could move on with the business of the country.   Mr. Speaker, I gladly yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, what did the Republican majority do to the  cost subsidies for those people?
