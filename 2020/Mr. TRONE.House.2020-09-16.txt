 Madam Speaker, one in seven people will experience  addiction in their lifetime.   Last year, over 70,000 people died from a drug overdose. Over the  last 3 years, it is over 200,000 people.   Addiction is a national crisis for which we will not find a vaccine.   Last week, I spoke with patients in recovery across western Maryland.  The reality of COVID-19 is making recovery much harder.   Today, we are coming together in Congress as Team America for a day  of action we are calling Congress Goes Purple.   Together, we are wearing purple to show our support for those in  recovery. Together, we are raising awareness to combat the stigma  around addiction. And together, we will do everything we can to support  those in recovery.   Madam Speaker, to those in recovery, never be afraid to speak up and  ask for help.                            ____________________
