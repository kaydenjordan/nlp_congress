 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  my friend and colleague, Representative Ocasio-Cortez, but most of all,  I rise in support of basic human decency.   I condemn remarks that are disrespectful and offensive; and recent  remarks reflected a hostility that should alarm my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle.   It is not expected that everyone in this Chamber agrees with each  other. It is expected, however, that we treat each other with dignity  and respect. There should never be a reason that anyone fails to meet  this low bar.   Turning policy disputes into personal disputes is dangerous. As  leaders, we risk inciting violence in others. As Congress Members, it  indicates a focus more on fighting than governing.   We should never utter comments that are misogynistic and hateful to  any Congress Member. This week, it was Congress Member Ocasio-Cortez,  but if we don't speak out against this, tomorrow it could be any  Congress Member who is a woman or person of color; and that is why this  must end now.   If any such ugly curse words are uttered, decorum dictates that there  should be an apology, a real apology, a sincere apology, not words that  simply deflect and blame others.    On the great seal of the United States, it says, ``e pluribus unum;''  out of many, one. Disagreement and different perspectives were baked  into this country, and it is our ability to work with others that we do  not always agree with that has allowed America to be the beacon of  hope. We should never betray these values of unity, despite  disagreement.   Congress Member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez deserves respect. Congress  Member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez deserves a real apology now.
