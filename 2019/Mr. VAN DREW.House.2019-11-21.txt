 Madam Speaker, today I want to recognize AtlantiCare, a  major health system in south Jersey for over one century. The group  started with one hospital in 1898 and has now expanded to over 100  different locations across the region to fulfill the medical needs of  our community.   AtlantiCare improves the health and happiness of the people of south  Jersey by providing high-quality medical care, which has recently been  celebrated with the Critical Care Gold Beacon Award, the Emergency  Nurses Association's Lantern Award, and many more.   Beyond health services, AtlantiCare has been a staple to south Jersey  because of their focus on community outreach programs, which are so  very important. They have tackled a variety of issues facing our area.   AtlantiCare has installed programs to supply healthy school lunches  to children, to bring fresh produce to those struggling with food  insecurity, and to provide residency opportunities for local medical  school students so that they stay in the area.   In south Jersey we are very lucky to have AtlantiCare's accessible  medical services and outreach programs to better our region. I thank  AtlantiCare and all the staff and all the volunteers for caring about  our community in south Jersey.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I am honored to be joined by my colleagues today on National Rural  Health Day to express the importance of rural healthcare across  America.   Nearly 57 million Americans, or about one out of five, call their  communities rural communities, and they call these places their home.  That includes many residents of my district in south Jersey.   The State of New Jersey Department of Health defines a rural  community as an area within the State that has a population density of  fewer than 500 persons per square mile. Most of these areas tend to not  only have a lack of healthcare but more need for accessible, affordable  care.   The populations in rural communities tend to have more households  with people over 65 years of age, many of whom live alone.  Additionally, they have higher rates of suicide, cancer, diabetes,  asthma, and obesity. Most do not have any health insurance at all.   We must act on health legislation that not only supports the  development of community health centers and their accessibility but  also finds creative ways to support these rural communities.  Ultimately, we will save their lives.   It is important that we address these life-threatening rural health  concerns and foster available and accessible health services for all of  these rural Americans.
