 Madam Speaker, let me thank Chairwoman  McCollum for her leadership on this issue as we try to get the  government open.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the fiscal year 2019  Interior appropriations bill, which provides $35 billion to partially  reopen the government.   Now, this bill would also reopen our beautiful national parks and the  Smithsonian museums. The situation in our parks right now, it is just  not acceptable. Sixteen thousand Park Service employees are not  working. Let me repeat that: 16,000 employees. The National Park  Service is losing $400,000 a day from this shutdown, while uncollected  garbage is piling up.   Madam Speaker, this is horrible. It is ridiculous.   We need this bill to reopen our parks, our museums, and our visitors'  centers right away, and we need to pass this bill to keep visitors safe  and end the furlough of law enforcement personnel in our national  parks.   Madam Speaker, these closings are impacting every district in our  Nation. Near my own district, for example, in the beautiful bay area,  Muir Woods had to close this week.   In addition to wreaking havoc on Federal workers' lives, their  families, their children, and their livelihoods, this Trump shutdown is  also having an effect on tourism and the economy.   So I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill and ``yes'' to  reopening the government. The public deserves this. The Federal workers  deserve this. Contractors deserve this. The parks and our museums  should be open for visitors to visit, and we need to get this  government working again.   Madam Speaker, I thank, again, Chairwoman Betty McCollum for yielding  me time.
