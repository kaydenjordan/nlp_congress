 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  legacy of Norma Comnick of Anderson, California, a friend of mine I  have known many years in the political scene. She was born in Texas,  and she made some fine Texas chili for me, too.   Norma moved to Anderson in the mid-eighties and was first elected to  the city council in 1996, where she served for 21 years and five terms  as mayor. She loved civic duty in her hometown. She was a fierce  advocate for veterans and seniors, as well as bringing housing  opportunities to the area.   Her passion for her city extended well beyond her service on the city  council. She dedicated much of her time to the Anderson Rotary, where  she was inducted as one of the first two female members of that club,  as well as a group called Anderson Explodes, which raises funds for  Anderson's annual Fourth of July celebration, which they hold on the  third, a massive fireworks display for the 12,000 people who attend.   She was a small business owner, having an insurance agency in  Anderson until retiring from that in 2004.   I had the opportunity to attend her memorial service just a few days  ago. It was beautiful. It was moving. Her great friends were there.   Indeed, she was always, to the last, when I visited not too long ago,  concerned about how her citizens were doing in her area. Indeed, she  has a great legacy and will be missed. She was a blessing.                            ____________________
