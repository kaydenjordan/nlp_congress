 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 21.   House Republicans are taking our next step to protect the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve and put American energy dominance back on track.   First, we are going to stop selling a national security tool to  China, and second, we are going to leverage our domestic natural  resources to protect against emergency supply disruptions.   The President's decision to exploit the SPR to cover up his own  energy crisis was nothing short of a political stunt, and I heard that  word used when I first walked in.   After draining 40 percent of our reserve, the President has left  Hoosiers in Indiana's Sixth District vulnerable in the event of a true  supply emergency.   The SPR is critical to helping respond to natural disasters,  hurricanes, or severe supply disruptions. It was never intended to be a  solution to the Biden energy crisis facing Hoosiers and all Americans.   If the President was truly concerned about high energy prices, he  would work with Republicans to support the domestic resources we  already have at our disposal.   H.R. 21 is a clear, simple way to leverage our assets and refocus the  SPR on its original intent, responding to emergency supply disruptions.   I look forward to continuing our efforts on the Energy and Commerce  Committee to hold this administration accountable and reestablish  American energy dominance.   Mr. Chair, I urge support for this legislation.
