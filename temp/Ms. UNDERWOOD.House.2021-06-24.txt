 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  239, the Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act, led by the  chairwoman of the Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Health,  Congresswoman Julia Brownley.   Chairwoman Brownley and I have worked together on this issue for  years. It is about fairness, fairness for the nearly 2 million women  veterans who currently don't have access to the same healthcare as  civilian women.   The Affordable Care Act requires private insurance plans to provide  contraceptive services without copays, but veterans using VA care have  to pay out of pocket for those same services. It is unacceptable that  women who have served our country bear financial burdens that most  other Americans don't have to worry about.   This fix is long overdue. And last week's unconscionable delay by our  Republican colleagues harmed our veterans even more.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  put partisanship aside and vote for H.R. 239.
