 Mr. Speaker, Texas businesses are putting more money in  their employees' pockets because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  Companies that employ tens of thousands of my constituents in north  Texas are giving bonuses to their employees, increasing investment in  their operations, and donating millions of dollars to charities.   These Texas companies are joining thousands of others across the  country and doing the same for their workers. They are growing the  American economy because of tax reform. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  reforms an unfair and uncompetitive Tax Code, and that is being fixed  in this Tax Code. It provides tax relief at every income level and  helps Americans and American businesses to succeed in the future.                            ____________________
