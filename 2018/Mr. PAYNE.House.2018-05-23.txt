 Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring  the life and legacy of Rutgers Law School Professor Alfred Slocum.   Professor Slocum was a titan in the legal and civil rights  communities. While still a student at Rutgers Law, he spoke out on  behalf of minorities and people of color. He worked with professors and  other students to help create the Rutgers Law Minority Student Program,  which is the most extensive and renowned program to train minority  lawyers in this country.   During his career, Professor Slocum served many roles in the legal  profession and in the public service sector. He was an executive  director of the Council on Legal Education Opportunity. He served as  public advocate of the State of New Jersey in 1986 and, later that  year, was appointed public defender.   For 5 years, Professor Slocum championed the causes of the voiceless  and the indigent. Then in 1990, he returned to law school, where he  taught until retiring from the faculty in 2001.   I speak for myself, for the city of Newark, and for the State of New  Jersey when I say that Professor Slocum's life was well lived. I ask my  colleagues to join me in honor of this great man's legacy.   Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned, Professor Alfred Slocum was a champion  for the voiceless and for people in need. Mr. Speaker, the people who  are in the greatest need in this country rely on our social safety net  for food, for shelter, for healthcare, and for many necessities that  help them scrape by. We cannot leave them to despair.   These people are not just a statistic. They are not just an idea.  They are human beings. They are Americans.  [[Page H4588]]  They are people who just need a helping hand.   I have said this before, but let me say it again. I have never met a  person who wakes up in the morning and says, ``I want to be poor  today.'' That is just not a reality.   Let me add this. I have never met a person who wakes up at 5 a.m. to  go to her first job, comes home at 1 p.m. to take a nap, and heads out  to her second job at 4 p.m., yet still lives paycheck to paycheck,  still relies on SNAP and Medicaid to make ends meet, but thinks to  herself, ``I like to struggle.'' She does not exist, because that is  just not how the world works.   Programs like SNAP, Medicaid, housing assistance, our entire social  safety net is a supplement that helps people struggle just a little bit  less.   Yet my colleagues across the aisle and their friends in the White  House keep pushing the false narrative that people who rely on  government assistance to make ends meet are just freeloaders who take  advantage of the government handouts and buy drugs. The majority party  and the 45th President keep pushing their callous, immoral narrative in  order to tear apart the social safety net.   Mr. Speaker, the United States Government should be making it easier  for Americans to maintain a decent standard of living. We have to  protect our most vulnerable and those who are in need. Let us end this  administration's war on the working poor and help make lives better for  our constituents.   The American people deserve A Better Deal.                            ____________________
