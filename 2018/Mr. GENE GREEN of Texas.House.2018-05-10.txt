 Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague, our  ranking member, for allowing me to speak.   I rise in support of H.R. 3053, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments  Act of 2018. Congress, back in 1982, passed the Nuclear Waste Policy  Act, directing the Department of Energy and Nuclear Regulatory  Commission to open a permanent repository for our Nation's spent  nuclear fuel. Now, Congress is slow, but this is amazing how we haven't  dealt with this.   Over three decades later, America is still without a repository,  leaving tens of thousands of tons of nuclear waste vulnerable to acts  of terror or other catastrophes.   If you say you are for all-of-the-above for power generation, then  you need to vote for this bill, because if we are really going to use  nuclear power, which we get about 20 percent in Texas, we need a place  to put that waste, and not just on the sites where we produce it.   There was a decision made in the 1980s it would be out in Yucca  Mountain, and that wasn't our decision, but that is there, and it is  Federal property. That is where we exploded atomic bombs during the  testing. Nobody is going to build condos on that property, because I  was out there with the chairman of the committee.   Until the day we find interim storage to ensure 70,000 tons of spent  fuel sitting in our Nation's nuclear plants are safe from harm at an  interim storage facility, there is one proposed in west Texas that the  folks out there want it.   I ask my colleagues to support this bill so we ca finally move the  ball forward on safely storing our Nation's spent nuclear fuel.
