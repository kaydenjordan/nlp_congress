 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1215  and to express my extreme concerns with this bill.   I am from California, and I am an attorney, and I can tell you that  this bill goes beyond medical malpractice. It goes way beyond that. It  includes cases involving unsafe drugs and nursing home abuse and  neglect. That is not happening in California.   If passed, it would prevent cases where seniors have endured tragic  deaths and injuries, like an 88-year-old California woman who was  sexually assaulted by her nursing assistant after she suffered a  stroke, resulting in lifelong mental and physical pain.   Over 80 senior and healthcare groups, including the American  Association for Justice and the California Advocates for Nursing Home  Reform, have come out against this bill. They recognize that we need to  protect our vulnerable seniors.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
