 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for  yielding and for his leadership on this issue.   I rise in strong support of S. 47, the Natural Resources Management  Act. And as my colleague from Utah so eloquently stated, this landmark  public lands legislation is the product of years, decades of work at  the committee level, and months of bipartisan, bicameral negotiations.  It includes support from key conservation, sportsmen, and environmental  stakeholders.   The outstanding provisions in this bill will enshrine and safeguard  our Nation's conservation legacy for decades to come. This begins with  permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. It  should never have expired. Permanent reauthorization of LWCF will mean  this program and its important work can continue unimpeded for future  generations.   Almost 20 years ago, John Dingell led the first effort to permanently  reauthorize it with his friends   Don Young, George Miller, Billy  Tauzin, and Chris John, a geographically and diverse group of leaders  who happened to like the outdoors and, yes, hunting and fishing.   LWCF funding has protected some of our country's most treasured  natural resources, while creating jobs, supporting local economies, and  providing countless opportunities for recreation. Since 1965, LWCS has  provided over $3.9 billion for over 40,000 projects in every county  across this country, with every $1 invested returning $4 in economic  value.   This benefits every congressional district, every county, and every  State in this country. Preserving our beautiful and iconic places  matters to us all and was the reason for initially starting it.    Being here today with this bipartisan group of people  working to preserve our land, he is looking from up above and saying:  Well done, all of you.
