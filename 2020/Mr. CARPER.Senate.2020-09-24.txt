 Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague Senator Enzi  for allowing me to be his wingman on this particular postal naming  bill.   I never met Robert Brown. I certainly know his daughter Bobbi, and I  certainly know his son-in-law, John Barrasso, my colleague.   Just listening to what Senator Enzi has said--service in World War  II, service in the Korean war, service in the U.S. Postal Service--that  is a lifetime of service. That is a lifetime of service.   In my own family, my dad and my uncles all served in World War II, a  number in Korea as well, and a cousin in the U.S. Postal Service for  many years. I like to say--I know this isn't original to me--that  service to others is the rent we pay for the space we take up on this  Earth. Think about that. Service to others is the rent we pay for the  space we take up on this Earth.   I would say to Robert L. Brown, if you are listening--I think you  probably are--thank you for your extraordinary service, and thank you  for Bobbi. And we ought to thank Bobbi, your daughter, Mr. Brown, for  sharing your husband with us. He is a good man. It is a good package,  and we are grateful for that.   None of us can live forever. Senator Barrasso was telling me--gosh-- not even a month ago about driving his father-in-law I think it was 400  miles or something from Wyoming up to maybe Montana for medical care,  medical attention. I thought: What an extraordinary act of love and  kindness. I don't think his death was imminent at the time, but it was  a great opportunity, I bet, for the two of them to just renew and bond  one more time.   It is sad to say good-bye. None of us can live forever, though, and  for those who lived lives of service like Bobbi's dad, we just say  this, especially in Navy talk--I am a retired Navy captain, Vietnam  veteran. In the Navy, we like to say of folks in the Army: Different  uniform, same team.   When folks do extraordinary things in service to our country, whether  it is in uniform of the Army or whether it is in uniform of the Navy or  the Postal Service, we say Bravo Zulu. Bravo Zulu.   Thank you for allowing me to join you.    Mr. President, I want to add one thought. I was about to  run and jump in my minivan and head to Delaware. The thought occurred  to me, your father-in-law served all those years in uniform with the  Army and then many more years in uniform with the Postal Service.   I want to say to the men and women who serve in the Postal Service  today, around the country and, literally, around the world--to the men  and women who are serving in uniform, the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine  Corps, Coast Guard--I just want to say to the Postal Service, thank you  for enabling our men and women in service, in uniform, who are serving  around the world, to actually vote this year.   When I was a naval flight officer in Southeast Asia during my first  and third tour, I was in a P-3 squadron, and we did service  surveillance for engineer aircraft--land base, South China Sea, the  Gulf of Thailand, and off the coast of Vietnam. I was asked by my  commanding officer to be the voting officer--and not once but in 1970  and again in 1972. We had 300 men. We had no women in our squadron  then. But my job was to get 300 men signed up, registered to vote in  their States--and they are from all over the country--and I did the  same thing again in 1972.   It was a source of great joy to me to know that we were able to  exercise our right to vote on the other side of the world and made  possible by the Postal Service.  [[Page S5869]]    That thought occurred because your dad has been both on the sending  and receiving side as a member of the Army and at the Postal Service.   May he rest in peace. God bless.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:   S. 4703. A bill to amend the West Los Angeles Leasing Act of 2016 to  authorize the use of certain funds received pursuant to leases entered  into under such Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Veterans' Affairs.   Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the ``West Los Angeles  VA Campus Improvement Act,'' which I introduced today. Representative  Ted Lieu (D-CA) has introduced similar legislation in the House.   In 1888, the 388-acre parcel that is now home to the West Los Angeles  VA Medical Center was deeded to the Federal government by Arcadia  Bandini de Stearns Baker and Senator John P. Jones, to establish a home  for disabled Veterans (civil war Veterans, at the time).   For nearly a century, the land served primarily to house Veterans,  and the campus long represented the largest Veteran housing development  in the nation. In the early 1970s, 2,800 Veterans living on the West LA  VA campus were displaced when the Sylmar Earthquake caused major damage  on campus. Rather than repair the housing units, the VA eventually  leased portions of the property to non-VA tenants.   In 2011, homeless Veterans and advocates sued the VA for illegally  leasing facilities on campus and failing to use the property to support  Veterans, as required by the original deed.   A U.S. District Court subsequently ruled that many leases on campus  were illegal under the terms of the original deed, and in 2015, the VA  agreed to facilitate the development of 1,200 housing units for  homeless Veterans on campus.   In 2016, Congress enacted the ``West Los Angeles Leasing Act of  2016'' to set up an oversight framework for the housing development and  to ensure that lease revenues from ongoing leases stayed on campus.   In 2018, the VA selected a ``Principal Developer'' to complete  housing renovation and construction projects on campus, allowing for a  more streamlined and efficient building process.   However, the VA has determined that current law restricts it from  contributing to housing construction, maintenance, or services. The VA  has determined that clarifying language is needed to ensure that funds  generated on campus can be used for these purposes.   Giving VA the flexibility to use locally-generated revenue in this  way could significantly reduce the time it takes to get homeless  Veterans into housing.   The West LA VA Campus Improvement Act authorizes the VA to use any  funds collected pursuant to leases, easements or other use-agreements  at the West LA VA for the development of supportive housing and  services on campus.   The bill would also increase the time period for enhanced use leases  on the campus from 75 to 99 years. Increasing the length of the leases  would align with other leasing terms the VA has, and help reduce the  financing costs for new housing.   This year, the regional homelessness count reported that more than  3,900 Veterans are experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles. It is long  past time for this land to be returned to its intended purpose: to  serve as a home where Veterans can receive the care and treatment they  deserve. This bill will help move us closer to that reality.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill. Thank you,  Mr. President, and I yield the floor.       By Mr. McCONNELL:   S. 4706. A bill to amend the Intermodal Surface Transportation  Efficiency Act of 1991 with respect to the Louie B.
