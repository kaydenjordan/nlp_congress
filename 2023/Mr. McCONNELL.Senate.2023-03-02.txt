 Mr. President, the American people are deeply  concerned about the collapse of law and order in our country. Thirty- nine percent of New York residents say they feel less safe than they  did 1 year ago. Last month, 63 percent of likely voters in Chicago said  they felt personally unsafe from gun violence and crime. By the way, on  Tuesday, those Chicago voters tossed out the incumbent mayor. Americans  see this problem going from bad to worse. More than 70 percent of the  country expects we will see crime rates rise even higher this coming  year.   Unfortunately, my fellow Kentuckians know this as well as anyone  else. In my hometown of Louisville, youth homicides tripled between  2018 and 2021. In fact, since the onset of the pandemic, Louisville has  seen the second worst increase in youth homicides among more than a  dozen similar U.S. cities. Total homicides have slightly subsided from  their record high in 2021, but they are still sitting in the triple  digits.   One Louisville couple whose 19-year-old son was murdered by a  convicted felon in 2019 summed up the way everybody is feeling. Here is  what they said:         [Homicides] may be down, but it's not down enough.    Of course, crime is not limited to the most callous acts of murder;  there is also a literal rash of brazen theft. Just 2 days ago, the town  of Somerset in my State was stunned when their local car dealership was  robbed point-blank. A group of masked thieves stormed the showroom and  drove no fewer than six high-end cars right off the lot.   The nationwide decline in law and order hasn't been happenstance.  Today's Democratic Party has made a deliberate decision to make public  safety and innocent citizens a lower priority than repeat criminal  offenders. This has happened at the Federal level, where prominent  Democrats have spent years amplifying anti-police rhetoric that  tangibly and provably hurts law enforcement and certainly leads to more  crime.   It has happened at the local level, where liberal mayors and city  councils around the country have waged rhetorical wars against their  own police departments and sometimes actually followed through on  cutting funding.   The left's ``soft on crime'' campaign has even infiltrated the legal  system itself. Far-left political donors have worked to get radical  district attorneys elected in and around major cities. Many of them  have promptly instituted what amount to blanket amnesties to whole  classes of crimes.   For example, in Los Angeles, the district attorney's refusal to go  after major misdemeanor offenses has brought his office prosecution  rate down to half of what it was under his predecessor. The  Commonwealth's attorney over in Fairfax County has repeatedly declined  to pursue justice against perpetrators of child sexual assault. The  former district attorney in Boston who made headlines for declaring  that charges involving 15 different serious crimes would be ``outright  dismissed'' was actually rewarded by President Biden with a promotion  to be the U.S. attorney for her whole State.   To make matters worse, in the midst of the violent crime surge that  Democrats' actions have helped cause, their administration's Department  of Justice has focused on many of the wrong things. A year and a half  ago, Attorney General Garland instructed the Department, including the  FBI, to go sniffing around stories of concerned parents voicing  opinions at local school board meetings. In the middle of a violent  crime wave, the administration's priority was extra security for moms  and dads exercising their First Amendment rights.   Just last fall, armed FBI agents were sent to rural Pennsylvania to  arrest a father at home in front of his young children because the man  had defended his son during an earlier minor altercation outside an  abortion clinic. Apparently, under this administration, the crime of  protesting while conservative can bring FBI agents to your house with  guns drawn.   Then just a few weeks ago, a memo leaked from the Bureau's Richmond,  VA, office that talked about needing to put informants in church pews  so the FBI could spy on Catholic Americans whose religious views they  deemed overly traditional.   Our major cities are beset with murders and carjackings, but these  Democrats are focused on subjecting God-fearing Americans to this  junior-varsity J. Edgar Hoover act. It is nonsensical. And don't think  for a minute they have simply turned up the security evenly, across the  board. In fact, it has been quite the opposite.   While the Biden-Garland DOJ seems fanatically overzealous about  harassing conservative citizens, they are currently asleep at the  switch when far-left activists are flouting actual Federal laws.   When fringe activists advocated for violence against sitting Justices  of the Supreme Court, when crowds spent months picketing outside  Justices' private family homes in direct contravention of Federal law,  the Attorney General didn't lift a finger. The Biden administration  simply refused to enforce black-letter Federal law that prohibits  picketing and protesting at judges' private residences. That is the  law. This willful failure to enforce the law effectively made the  President and the Attorney General willing partners in the improper  pressure campaign that the leak of the draft opinion was surely  designed to spark in the first place.   Get this--as the senior Senator from Utah has pointed out, there have  been more than 80 recorded attacks on pro-life pregnancy centers since  the start of last year and 130 attacks on Catholic churches.   Do you know how many of the offenders Attorney General Garland's DOJ  has managed to charge? A grand total of two, just two. Suffice it to  say the Attorney General had a lot to answer for at his oversight  hearing before the Judiciary yesterday, but, unfortunately, Senators  saw no evidence that a course correction is coming.   For example, the Attorney General wouldn't give Ranking Member Graham  a straight answer on designating Mexican drug cartels as foreign  terrorist organizations. He wouldn't give a straight answer about  whether we should expand mandatory minimum sentencing laws to address  the fentanyl crisis. He seemed to imply the status quo is OK, and the  DOJ already has the tools it needs to address the problem, which I  would add, if true, would make the administration's failures all the  more galling.   He also couldn't satisfy questioning from Senator Cornyn about  whether the Department is deliberately not charging drug traffickers  with offenses that would already entail mandatory minimums under  current law; in other words, basically cherry-picking their way around  existing penalties to make current law even softer on lethal drugs.   Look, the American people want and deserve law and order. Getting  murderers off our streets and foreign poison out of our neighborhoods  are among the most basic governing responsibilities you could possibly  think of. Evidently, the Biden administration either does not agree or  just cannot deliver.
