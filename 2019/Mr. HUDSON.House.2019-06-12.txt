 Mr. Chairman, I thank distinguished Ranking Member  Granger for her strong leadership on the committee and for yielding  this time to me.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to call attention to a serious issue of  mismanagement between the Community Development Institute, known by its  acronym, CDI, and the Office of Head Start.   I wholeheartedly support the Head Start program, and I know it has  the power to change lives. In fact, my mother is a retired Head Start  teacher, and I know the impact on her students was profound.   However, I have also seen, firsthand, the damage that can quickly  happen to a community when proper oversight is not conducted over local  Head Start programs, especially once CDI assumes control.   In Cabarrus County, my home county in the Eighth District of North  Carolina, we have witnessed CDI continuously demonstrate an inability  to ensure the federally mandated guidelines outlined in the Head Start  Act are met.   While I have been impressed by the new Head Start national Director,  Dr. Deborah Bergeron, I adamantly believe Congress needs to exercise  more oversight when it comes to Head Start and CDI--not just in my  congressional district, but across the Nation.   I would like to ask Congresswoman DeLauro to work with me to make  sure Head Start and CDI are held accountable and ensure the most  vulnerable children in our communities receive the best preschool  education possible.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut.    Mr. Chair, I look forward to working with the gentlewoman  and my other colleagues to protect the Head Start program and ensure  this does not happen again in my district, but I also want to help make  sure it doesn't happen to any child who is denied access to these vital  education programs.
