 Mr. President, I am prepared to deliver remarks, but  I see that the majority leader is on the floor, and I do not want to  intrude on his desire to take the floor if he wishes.    Mr. President, tomorrow the Environment and Public  Works Committee will have an opportunity to question Environmental  Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt at an oversight hearing.  Oversight of the executive branch is one of the Senate's great  responsibilities. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership of this body  has shown little interest in holding the Trump administration  accountable, despite the fact that this administration is more  ethically challenged, more riven by conflicts of interest, more  captured by special interests, more defined by cronyism than any other.   After a year of Pruitt at the helm of EPA--a tenure that has been  marked by mass staff departures, a slowdown in enforcement actions,  questionable travel and other personal spending, rolling back critical  clean air and clean water protections, a purge of scientists, an influx  of industry insiders, a smorgasbord of meetings with industry bigwigs,  many of whom coincidentally also bankrolled his political career back  in Oklahoma, an obsession with secrecy, and heaps and heaps and heaps  of climate denial--Pruitt will finally be appearing before our  committee. I urge my Republican colleagues on EPW to bring some good  questions to tomorrow's hearing.   Judging by Pruitt's first year, he is running dangerously amok. He  has turned EPA into perhaps the swampiest Agency in a very swampy  administration. Pruitt's record at EPA demands the sort of oversight  this body used to exercise. If you don't believe this about Pruitt's  record, just take a look at what some distinguished Republicans have to  say. William Ruckelshaus, who under both Presidents Richard Nixon and  Ronald Reagan ran the EPA, has criticized Pruitt's penchant for secrecy  in this Washington Post op-ed contrasting it with his own more  transparent management style. He said:         We release[d] my full schedule and the publication of       written communications on a daily basis . . . Scott Pruitt is       taking the absolute opposite approach. Pruitt operates in       secrecy.    In an interview with HuffPost, former New Jersey Governor and  chairman of the 9/11 Commission, Tom Kean, is also troubled by Pruitt's  fixation with secrecy. I think this New York Times op-ed makes his  opinion clear. He writes:         [T]o satisfy his penchant for secrecy, [Pruitt] is       installing--at a cost of nearly $25,000 to taxpayers--a       secure phone booth in his Washington office to keep people,       including staff members, in the dark.    Imagine that. While demanding massive cuts to EPA's budget, Pruitt is  spending thousands of dollars to build himself, like Maxwell Smart, a  cone of silence. He doesn't run the CIA. He doesn't run the FBI. He  doesn't even run the State Department. What possible purpose could this  very expensive, secure phone booth have at the Environmental Protection  Agency?   Governor Kean believes Pruitt is doing this to keep his own staff  members in the dark, which begs the question: What does Pruitt have to  hide from his own staff? It sounds like a question my Republican  colleagues on EPW should ask him tomorrow.   Pruitt's wasteful spending isn't just limited to his cone of silence.  As Governor Kean points out, Pruitt has used private jets costing  taxpayers another $58,000. His princely habits have even prompted  questions from Senator Grassley. So I ask my EPW Republican colleagues:  If Senator Grassley is troubled by Pruitt's wasteful spending of  taxpayers' money on personal luxuries, shouldn't you ask him about it  at tomorrow's hearing?   Pruitt's penchant for secrecy goes well beyond the expensive cone of  silence that was designed to keep his own staff in the dark. It also  extends to his schedule, where he tries to keep the American people in  the dark. Unlike Ruckelshaus and previous EPA Administrators, Pruitt  will not even disclose whom he is meeting or when he is traveling. As  Governor Kean notes, our only idea of the folks he is meeting comes  from the Freedom of Information Act. Once EPA finally released the  first few months of Pruitt's calendars in response to a FOIA request,  that is when we learned he was meeting with scores of industry fat cats  and almost no environmental groups.    As for his travels, we only find out about them after the fact, which  of course prevents the press from covering Pruitt, say, when he jets  off to Morocco to lobby for American natural gas producers. One of my  Republican colleagues on EPW might want to ask Pruitt why he is jetting  around the world playing Commerce Secretary for the fossil fuel  industry when he should be working here at home in America to protect  people's health and their environment.   What does Governor Kean have to say about Pruitt's industry ties?  ``He has elevated cronyism to new heights.'' Those are Governor's  Kean's words, not mine.   In an interview with HuffPost just this past Friday, Mr. Ruckelshaus  echoed this concern that Pruitt cares more about his political ties  than protecting the environment. ``He's just like Trump,'' Ruckelshaus  said. ``He's got an ideological approach to it, an approach that  affects the large contributors in his party in Oklahoma.''   Here again, Republican colleagues on EPW might want to ask Pruitt  about his close ties with industry and whether he is working for the  fossil fuel interests that donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to  his political activities back in Oklahoma or working for the American  people. Governor Kean goes on to say that Pruitt ``built his  [[Page S532]]  political career by attacking clean-air and clean-water rules'' and  that he is ``blocking scientific input,'' which brings us to science.   Science, of course, gives society its headlights to look ahead and  see oncoming hazards. Without science, if we ignore it or block it, as  Governor Kean says Pruitt is doing, the decisions we make are simply  uninformed and irrational, and Governor Kean and I aren't the only ones  who think this.   Yet another high-profile Republican, the former New Jersey Governor  and George W. Bush EPA Administrator, Christine Todd Whitman, agrees.  Pruitt claims he will pursue so-called ``red team/blue team'' exercises  instead of the long-established gold standard peer review process for  rigorously evaluating science. Governor Whitman sees right through  that.         [D]ecisions must be based on reliable science. The red team       begins with his politically preferred conclusion that climate       change isn't a problem, and it will seek evidence to justify       that position. That's the opposite of how science works.    Pruitt doesn't want to follow the scientific method, at least not  when it comes to climate science or any other science, for that matter,  that his industry backers object to. He wants to fabricate a case for  his industry backers' politically preferred hypothesis. This isn't  science. This is a counterfeit of science. As Governor Whitman writes,  ``True science follows the evidence. . . . Government bases policy on  those results. This applies to liberals and conservatives alike,'' or  at least that is the way it used to be before Scott Pruitt turned the  keys over to polluting industries.   So, EPW Republicans, there is another question for you to ask Pruitt  tomorrow: How does he justify throwing out the real scientists and the  real science in order to arrive so predictably at the fossil fuel  industry's preferred conclusions?   Governor Whitman calls Pruitt's climate denial scheming ``a waste of  the government's time, energy, and resources, and a slap in the face to  fiscal responsibility and responsible governance.'' It is, in her  words, ``shameful,'' ``unjustifiable,'' and a ``wild goose chase.'' It  sounds like more great questions for EPW Republicans to ask Pruitt  tomorrow: How does he justify spending taxpayers' money on his backers'  climate denial schemes.   This question is particularly relevant in light of Pruitt's campaign  to radically cut EPA's budget and staff. Under his tenure, EPA staff  has been reduced to the lowest level in more than 30 years. EPW  Republicans, take note because here is another question you can ask  Pruitt tomorrow: How can he justify spending taxpayer money on  frivolities like his Maxwell Smart cone of silence or personal luxuries  like exorbitant private travel or crazy climate denial schemes all  while demanding drastic cuts to the people who do the real work of  protecting the public at his Agency?   In an interview, Governor Whitman said she ``would like to see  [EPA's] budget have enough in it to ensure we are enforcing the  regulations we have in place,'' a fairly conservative notion. As she  notes, EPA enforcement actions are slowing down ``in some instances  fairly dramatically because they've cut the budget for the number of  enforcement agents.'' You can't do cleanups or police polluters without  money and people, both of which Pruitt is looking to cut. Simply put,  Pruitt's so-called back-to-basics campaign is a smokescreen to hide his  attempts to gut the Agency he is supposed to lead because it will make  his industry backers happy.   Once again, I ask my EPW Republican colleagues: Will you confront  Pruitt about his sham promises to get back to basics while he is really  just cutting staff and resources and reducing enforcement?   Governor Kean speaks for many Americans when he writes, ``For the  sake of our children's health, it's time for Scott Pruitt to go.'' When  you are hearing that from the Republican side, it is worth listening.   Pruitt's tenure at the EPA has been an unmitigated disaster for  public health, for the environment, and for the future of the planet we  call home. Its only value is if you have some peculiar connoisseur  interest in government corruption to watch all the many ways in which  industry can work its will within its supposed regulator.   Tomorrow, those of us who sit on the Environment and Public Works  Committee have an important opportunity to put the Senate's oversight  authority to good use and expose how badly Pruitt is in the pocket of  the polluters he is supposed to police. I sincerely hope that my  Republican colleagues on EPW will seize the opportunity. You can be  sure that my Democratic colleagues and I will.   I yield the floor.
