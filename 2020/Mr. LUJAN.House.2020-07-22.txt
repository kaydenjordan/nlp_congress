 Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of our friend  and colleague John Lewis, the gentleman from Georgia, a great man, a  treasure, and our brother.   Congressman Lewis spent his life fighting for justice. When Mr. Lewis  spoke, he did so with a force and moral clarity.   He was an original freedom fighter who embodied what it means to be a  humble public servant.   John never let anything stand in the way of doing what was right. His  legacy will continue by the generations of brothers and sisters he  inspired to get in good trouble.   It was a blessing to have known Congressman Lewis, and I know his  light will continue shining bright in the courage and conviction of the  American people. As we lay our friend to rest, the torch of justice  shines bright. Let us honor Congressman Lewis by continuing his fight.   Rest in power, my friend.
