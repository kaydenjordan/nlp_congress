 Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of so many  western New Yorkers and Americans who are outraged by the President's  executive order on immigration.   The story of America is defined by the struggle of immigrants  overcoming  [[Page H758]]  incredible odds to claim their piece of the American Dream. The  executive order on immigration is callous, unlawful, and  unconstitutional. An immigration ban on anyone that is based on  religion or country of origin is in conflict with basic American values  and who we are as a people.   Inspired by the work of the International Institute, Catholic  Charities, Jericho Road, Jewish Family Services, and so many more, my  western New York community continues to be welcoming to refugees and  immigrants from all over the world, including from those countries that  are directly affected by this order. I know my community will continue  to lead by example and proudly project American values.                            ____________________
