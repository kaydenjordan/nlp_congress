 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and his  continued leadership.   We are on the cusp of something truly historic that will make life  better for millions of people across the United States. By reforming  the Tax Code, we will be able to put more money in people's pockets and  create a fair and simpler tax system.   Under the current Tax Code, well-off individuals and big businesses  can higher lobbyists and lawyers to help them find loopholes and  special interest giveaways, all at the expense of working Americans.   With our plan, the Tax Code will be simplified, loopholes will be  closed, and the playing field will be leveled.   I want to make one thing clear: if you are looking for a tax plan  that benefits the elite, the well connected, and the 1 percent, then  you need to look at the current Tax Code.   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are going  to great lengths to defend the current Tax Code that truly benefits the  top 1 percent. For example, the Democratic leader has called the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act ``the end of the world.'' So, apparently, giving the  hardworking people in this country a tax cut is, to her,  ``Armageddon.''   Let's stop with all the doomsday political rhetoric, cut to the  chase, and say what this bill really does:   It cuts taxes on hardworking Americans and allows them to keep more  money in their pockets;   It supports American families by increasing the child tax credit and  doubling the standard deduction;   It grows the American economy by making the corporate Tax Code  actually competitive with other industrialized countries;   It benefits Main Street businesses in Alabama and across the country  with a new 20 percent tax deduction for passthrough income;   It will lead to greater economic growth, higher wages, and more jobs,  which is exactly what the American people sent President Trump and the  Republican Congress to Washington to do.                                time  1100    So let's save the political hyperbole for another day. Let's pass the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and let's give the American people a real  Christmas present and put more money in their pockets.
