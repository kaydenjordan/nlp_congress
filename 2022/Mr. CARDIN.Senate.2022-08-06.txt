 Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a colloquy with  the distinguished chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator  Wyden. I want to comment on the transferable tax credit provisions  supporting sustainability in the bill and, in particular, the  application of general limitations that already exist in current law  for various tax credits. As the chairman knows, the bill includes a  historic investment in tax credits and incentives to promote the  development of various clean energy technologies and provides a broad  regime to permit eligible credits to be transferred from the project  owners to another unrelated taxpayer.   Under current law, the ability to claim general business tax credits  is subject to a number of potential limitations in section 38 of the  Tax Code based on the taxpayer's income tax liability. The bill  language does not appear to apply the section 38 limitations to reduce  the amount of the credit eligible to be transferred by the transferor  of tax credits. This would be consistent with the goal of encouraging  additional investment by expanding the availability of these tax  credits to project owners without regard to their ability to claim the  credits themselves.   I expect that the Treasury Department will develop technical guidance  for these transferable credits in a manner that reflects the intent  that the section 38 limitations under current law will not apply to the  transferor.    I welcome the chairman's leadership and support to  clarify this issue, ensuring that the amount of the tax credits  eligible for transfer are not limited by section 38 so that they will,  in fact, expand investment in projects that will achieve the broader  climate goals of this bill.    Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a colloquy with  the distinguished chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator  Wyden.   I want to ask for a clarification of the provision in the underlying  bill regarding the corporate book minimum tax. Is it the chairman's  understanding and intent that, because the corporate alternative  minimum tax is based on financial statement income, it does not include  Other Comprehensive Income?    I thank the chairman for that clarification.    Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a colloquy with  the distinguished chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator  Wyden.   There is some question as to the proper ordering of the calculation  of  [[Page S4167]]  the credit under section 53 and a taxpayer's liability under section  59A, the base erosion and anti-abuse tax. Does the Treasury have  authority to issue regulations dealing with potential issues with the  ordering of the calculation of the credit under section 53 and the tax  under section 59A?    I thank the chairman for that clarification.    Mr. President, the legislation being considered today  includes a historic expansion of the section 179D commercial buildings  energy-efficiency tax deduction. The deduction, made permanent in 2020,  is an important tool to tackle climate change by encouraging  investments in energy-efficient buildings.   I have been made aware of a discouraging trend among those who use  section 179D that some entities attempt to receive payments in exchange  for providing section 179D allocation letters to private sector  building designers.   As I have said before, entities seeking to avail themselves of the  tax benefits of section 179D cannot seek, accept, or solicit payments  from designers in exchange for providing section 179D allocation  letters.   The issuance of a section 179D allocation letter shall not be used as  leverage to request a payment from a designer; allocation letters  should be duly issued once the applicable design services have been  performed.   These actions run counter to the intent of section 179D(d)(4)'s  express direction to allow the allocation of the section 179D deduction  ``. . . to the person primarily responsible for designing the property  in lieu of the owner of such property.''   Consistent with congressional intent, section 179D allocation letters  are administrative in nature and serve to formalize the allocation of  the tax deduction to the eligible designer.   As section 179D is rightly expanded in the legislation being  considered in the Senate, it must be reaffirmed that it is  congressional intent that entities cannot seek, accept, or solicit  payments in exchange for providing 179D allocation letters.    Madam President, Senate Democrats have stepped up and  passed legislation that will make it easier for American families to  afford health insurance coverage and prescription drugs and lower  energy costs and boost domestic job creation in the growing clean  energy sector. We have done so while reducing the deficit and without  raising taxes on families and small businesses. The Inflation Reduction  Act--IRA--tackles climate change, makes the Tax Code fairer, and  invests in long-overdue environmental justice programs. This is an  historic bill, and polling indicates that large majorities of Americans  support its major provisions.   While a simple majority of Senators can pass a budget reconciliation  bill, there was nothing to prevent our Republican colleagues from  joining us in supporting this measure to lower essential costs for  American families and enhance our economic and national security. These  are policies that all Senators and all Members of Congress should  embrace, and this legislation contains many bipartisan policies.  Reconciliation does not have to be a partisan process. Just in the past  year, the Senate passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act-- IIJA--the CHIPS + Science semiconductor manufacturing bill, the  Honoring Our PACT Act, and Treaty Document No. 117-3, which contains  Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of the  Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden, with strong bipartisan  majorities. I regret that our Republican colleagues did not join us  today in passing the IRA.   As for me, if asked to choose between the status quo or lowering  health coverage costs for Maryland families and having large companies  pay a minimum, fair share of taxes, there is no contest. I will choose  Maryland families every day. I find it incomprehensible that anyone-- other than perhaps some billionaires--thinks it is acceptable that  teachers, nurses, and mechanics and most small businesses often pay a  greater percentage of their income in Federal taxes than the  ultrawealthy or a company that makes billions of dollars in profits.  The bill we passed today changes that calculation and holds the richest  Americans and companies that make over a billion dollars accountable  for paying their fair share of taxes, like everyone else in this  country.   This past Wednesday, Timothy F. Geithner, Jacob J. Lew, Henry M.  Paulson Jr., Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers issued the  following statement:         As former Treasury Secretaries of both Democratic and       Republican Administrations, we support the Inflation       Reduction Act, which is financed by prudent tax policy that       will collect more from top-earners and large corporations.       Taxes due or paid will not increase for any family making       less than $400,000/year. And the extra taxes levied on       corporations do not reflect increases in the corporate tax       rate, but rather the reclaiming of revenue lost to tax       avoidance and provisions benefitting the most affluent. The       selective presentation by some of the distributional effects       of this bill neglects benefits to middle-class families from       reducing deficits, from bringing down prescription drug       prices, and from more affordable energy. This legislation       will help increase American competitiveness, address our       climate crisis, lower costs for families, and fight       inflation--and should be passed immediately by Congress.    The original top-line estimates from the Congressional Budget  Office--CBO--and the Joint Committee on Taxation--JCT--were that the  bill would raise $725 billion in revenue, invest $433 billion, and  apply the balance--nearly $300 billion--to deficit reduction. These  numbers will change some with the final score, but they illustrate the  magnitude of what this bill will accomplish. The IRA will help to build  a better America for all Americans.   Let's start with health care. The bill we passed today will lower  prescription drug prices and make healthcare more affordable for  millions of Americans. Finally, the Secretary of Health and Human  Services will have the authority to negotiate lower drug prices for the  Medicare Program, benefitting both millions of seniors on fixed incomes  and taxpayers. In the private sector, no plan sponsor or manager would  ever accept responsibility without the ability to decide how to  negotiate. Medicare negotiation will ensure that patients with Medicare  get the best deal possible on high-priced drugs, saving Medicare  approximately $100 billion.   The IRA will further lower drug costs for seniors by capping out-of- pocket costs for part D prescriptions at $2,000 each year, requiring  drug manufacturers to pay penalties if they raise their prices faster  than inflation, and delaying of the Trump administration's drug rebate  rule. Although these provisions alone will lower beneficiary costs, the  IRA also lowers costs through a redesign of the Medicare Part D  formula, expansion of the low-income subsidy--LIS--in part D, and  Federal coverage for vaccines.   The IRA also invests $64 billion to extend ACA healthcare premium  subsidies through 2025. These subsidies, first provided through the  American Rescue Plan, have guaranteed millions of Americans access to  affordable health insurance. Access to affordable health insurance  saves lives and reduces costs because people get the care they need and  they get it sooner. As Benjamin Franklin said, ``An ounce of prevention  is worth a pound of cure.'' The IRA will save Maryland families with  median income about $2,200 annually.   The IRA raises several hundred billion dollars by making the Tax Code  fairer through three major provisions. The first provides up to $80  billion to the Internal Revenue Service--IRS--to modernize its computer  systems, some of which are 60 years old, and rebuild its workforce to  ensure greater tax compliance. CBO estimates that investing $80 billion  in tax enforcement and compliance will generate $203 billion in  additional revenue over the next 10 years.   Since 2010, the IRS budget has been cut by roughly 20 percent, and  the budget earmarked for enforcement has dropped by 24 percent. Audit  rates for the largest corporations and the ultrawealthy have fallen  dramatically, by 54 and 71 percent, respectively. We now have the  perverse situation where the poorest American families are audited at  about the same rate as the top 1 percent richest taxpayers, even though  that 1 percent is responsible for 28 percent the ``tax gap,'' the  difference between taxes owed and collected. According to recent  polling, nearly three-quarters of Americans believe the IRS should  conduct more tax audits of large corporations and millionaires.   The IRA provides 10-year funding for the IRS as follows: $3.2 billion  for taxpayer services; $45.6 billion for enforcement; $25.3 billion for  operations support; and $4.8 billion for business systems  modernization.   These appropriated funds are to remain available until September 30,  2031, and no use of the funds is intended to increase taxes on any  taxpayer with taxable income below $400,000.   The bill also makes it easier for the IRS to establish a free, direct  e-file tax return system. The IRS currently outsources its free e-file  program to private, for-profit tax preparers. Not surprisingly, only 3  percent of taxpayers--of 70 percent eligible--use the existing free e- file option.   The second major provision establishes a minimum corporate income tax  of 15 percent of book income on fewer than 200 of the Nation's largest  corporations that currently pay less than the statutory corporate tax  rate, which is 21 percent. The corporate alternative minimum tax-- CAMT--proposal would impose the 15 percent minimum tax on adjusted  financial statement--``book''--income for corporations with profits in  excess of $1 billion. Corporations would generally be eligible to claim  net operating losses and tax credits against the AMT and would be  eligible to claim a tax credit against the regular corporate tax for  AMT paid in prior years, to the extent  [[Page S4211]]  the regular tax liability in any year exceeds 15 percent of the  corporation's adjusted financial statement income.   In 2020, 50 of the biggest corporations paid $0 in Federal corporate  income tax, despite recording substantial profits. Some of these  companies effectively had a negative Federal income tax because they  received more in credits and rebates than they paid in taxes. The AMT  makes the existing corporate tax structure fairer, especially for  smaller businesses that often pay their taxes at higher rates than the  largest corporations. Consider that many small businesses pay taxes  through the individual tax code, where the highest tax rate is as much  as 37 percent. Setting a baseline of taxes to be paid by the largest  corporations gives small businesses a better chance to compete and  succeed.   The third provision is a 1 percent excise tax on stock buybacks.  Corporations can choose to distribute profits either by issuing  dividends or buying back shares of stock, which inflates stock prices.  Stock buybacks are taxed at a lower rate than dividends and create  profit gaming opportunities for companies, which have been abused over  time. By levying a small 1 percent tax on these buyback transactions,  it improves tax efficiency and raises revenue that will significantly  contribute to deficit reduction.   The IRA's tax provisions will increase compliance and close the tax  gap, which costs the U.S. $1 trillion per year in unpaid taxes,  according to the IRS. That is important for the revenue they raise. It  is also important that millions of hard-working Americans who play by  the rules and pay their taxes believe that the system is fair and that  the ultrawealthy and large corporations aren't dodging their financial  responsibilities.   We need to address climate change by rapidly reducing our dependence  on fossil fuels and cutting our greenhouse gas emissions. The IRA does  that. It will cut our emissions by 40 percent or more by 2030 and put  us on track to meet 70 percent of our Paris agreement obligations. It  contains a Methane Emissions Reduction Program to reduce leaks from the  production and distribution of oil and natural gas.   The IRA contains roughly $370 billion in clean energy, energy  security, and climate change investments that will lower Americans'  electricity bills and prices at the pump and create as many as 9  million good-paying jobs here in America in the clean energy sector  over the next decade.   I am pleased the IRA includes a provision I have championed, a  production tax credit for our existing fleet of nuclear reactors. They  are an essential source of baseload power and provide 20 percent of the  Nation's electricity and over 50 percent of our carbon-free  electricity.   According to the non-partisan Resources for the Future, all told, the  IRA will drive down retail costs of electricity by 5.2-6.7 percent over  the next decade, saving electricity consumers $209-$278 billion. The  average household will experience approximately $170-$220 in annual  savings from smaller electricity bills and reductions in the costs of  goods and services over the next decade. The clean energy investments  will help to insulate ratepayers from volatility in natural gas prices,  with electricity rates projected to decrease even under a high natural  gas price scenario. More importantly, the IRA will bolster our economic  and national security by strengthening our grid and reducing reliance  on foreign energy supplies.   The legislation also includes a historic expansion of a tax program I  have led, the section 179D energy efficient commercial buildings  deduction, which provides a tax deduction for energy efficient building  investments. Energy efficiency is good business and good policy. This  legislation will expand section 179D, which was made permanent in 2020  under my leadership, to increase the deduction amount, improve its  administration, allow more nonprofits to use the deduction, and expand  its use to building retrofits.   In addition to the important steps the IRA takes to advance clean  energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the bill delivers major  Federal investments to make our communities healthier, safer, and more  resilient in the face of increasing impacts of climate change. It  provides Federal assistance for monitoring environmental quality,  mitigating the harmful impacts of air pollution and excessive heat, and  enhancing walkability in our neighborhoods. It does this through $3  billion for Neighborhood Access and Equity Grants and $3 billion for  Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants. By targeting resources  to disadvantaged or underserved communities, the bill advances equity  in our infrastructure planning and investments.   Climate change is happening now. We need to address its impacts on  the ground. The IRA invests $2.6 billion for the conservation,  restoration, and protection of coastal and marine habitats and  resources, including fisheries, to enable coastal communities to  prepare for extreme storms and other changing climate conditions, as  well as $250 million to rebuild and restore units of the National  Wildlife Refuge System and State wildlife management areas.   The bill supports America's farmers and rural communities, with  around $20 billion in funds for climate-smart agricultural practices  through existing farm bill conservation programs, including the  regional conservation partnership program--RCPP--and $1 billion for the  Natural Resources Conservation Service, to provide technical assistance  on conservation to producers. Many sustainable practices such as  expanding cover crops and riparian buffers that mitigate greenhouse gas  emissions and help farmers adapt to climate change also cost- effectively reduce pollution to the Chesapeake Bay.   The IRA makes investments to accelerate clean energy deployment, help  achieve our climate goals, and create millions of jobs over the next  decade. These investments include an expanded tax credit to support  domestic manufacturing of clean energy technologies, including solar  panels, wind turbines, and batteries; and tax credits that will make  battery and fuel cell electric vehicles--EVs--more affordable for  millions of families. The bill provides over $9 billion for Federal  procurement of American-made clean technologies, including $3 billion  for the U.S. Postal Service to purchase zero-emission vehicles, helping  to create a stable market for clean, Made in America products.   Researchers Robert Pollin, Chirag Lala, and Shouvik Chakraborty at  the University of Massachusetts-Amherst's Political Economy Research  Institute estimate that the IRA's more than 100 climate, environmental,  and energy provisions will generate an average of about 912,000 jobs  each year over the next decade through combined annual public and  private investments of $98 billion.   The IRA tax credits and other provisions won't just help create jobs;  they will help create jobs that pay prevailing wages. The middle class  has experienced wage stagnation for half a century. Income inequality  has grown. The IRA will help to rebuild the middle class. Unions from  the Communication Workers of America and the United Auto Workers to the  National Treasury Employees Union and the International Federation of  Professional and Technical Engineers all support the IRA because it  promotes union jobs and apprenticeships and because it will lower  healthcare costs.   In May, the Treasury Department estimated that the budget deficit  this year will decline by $1.5 trillion. As President Biden noted at  the time, ``The bottom line is that the deficit went up every year  under my predecessor before the pandemic and during the pandemic. And  it's gone down both years since I've been here. Period.'' The IRA is  fiscally responsible and will help reduce our budget deficits.   Deficits remain too high, of course, but one of the best ways to  address them is by getting unemployed Americans back to work. The July  jobs report released on Friday put the unemployment rate at 3.5  percent, matching the lowest it has been in 50 years. The U.S. economy  added 528,000 jobs in July, more than twice the number economists  anticipated. As Myles Udland, Senior Markets Editor of Yahoo! Finance,  stated,         This staggering increase in employment completes a       milestone for the U.S. economy: Pre-pandemic employment is       now fully restored.        In February 2020, the last month before the COVID-19       pandemic tipped the U.S. economy into recession, there were       152.504 million people employed in the U.S.        As of July 2022, 152.536 million people in the U.S. were       working.  [[Page S4212]]         And despite the labor market contraction during the       pandemic being the sharpest in modern history, the bounce       back marks the second-fastest job market recovery since 1981.        In a little over two years, we've seen job losses that       topped 20 million at one point be fully erased.        This recovery stands in stark contrast to the malaise we       saw in the labor market following the financial crisis, when       it took the better part of a decade for pre-crisis employment       levels to be restored.    Inflation is also too high, but its root causes are COVID-19  pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and Vladimir Putin's war on  Ukraine. The IRA tackles these disruptions by promoting domestic  manufacturing and supply chains and reducing our reliance on foreign  energy. On August 2, 2022, over 120 prominent economists wrote a letter  to Senate and House leadership stating that the IRA ``addresses some of  the country's biggest challenges at a significant scale. And because it  is deficit-reducing, it does so while putting downward pressure on  inflation.''   There is much to celebrate in this bill, but there are many  priorities that we were not able to add. This ``to do'' list includes  reinstating the expanded child tax credit and making child care  accessible and affordable. My priority list includes legislation I have  long championed to expand dental coverage to Medicare beneficiaries, as  well as to Medicaid beneficiaries, along with expansions to home and  community-based and maternal health services. Congress also needs to  address housing supply and economic development priorities, including  the Neighborhood Homes Investment Act, the Low-Income Housing Tax  Credit, the New Markets Tax Credit, and the Historic Tax Credit. While  the IRA will help create good-paying union jobs, we need to do more to  protect and enhance workers' rights to form and join unions and engage  in collective bargaining. And I will continue working to fund water  infrastructure programs the IIJA created to address urgent  affordability and resilience issues.   While that seems like a long list, we must not let the perfect be the  enemy of the good, and the IRA is so much better than good. It is  transformational legislation, and I am proud to support it. I want to  commend Majority Leader Schumer and so many of my colleagues who have  worked diligently both in the spotlight and behind the scenes to bring  us to this point. I also want to acknowledge committee and personal  staff; CBO and JCT staff; Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough  and her crew; leadership, floor, and cloakroom staff; the Senate  legislative counsels; and others. You toil anonymously, but I hope you  know how important you are. The Senate could not function without you.  You are among our Nation's finest public servants, and you are making a  critical difference in the lives of all Americans.   The American essayist Charles Dudley Warner famously said,  ``Everybody complains about the weather, but nobody does anything about  it''--a quote commonly misattributed to his friend Mark Twain. Passing  a reconciliation bill is like that. We all complain about the process,  especially the so-called vote-a-rama, which is grueling and grinding  and befuddling to just about everyone, but we don't fix it. In fact, it  seems to get worse each time, not better. I know I would prefer not to  go through the process again, but the Inflation Reduction Act and the  American Rescue Plan before it have been worth it.   Dahlia Rockowitz, Washington director of Dayenu: A Jewish Call to  Climate Action, noted that the Senate consideration of the Inflation  Reduction Act began on the Shabbat and Tisha B'Av, a Jewish day of  collective mourning for historic destructions. But as she pointed out,  `` . . . according to Jewish tradition, this day of despair is also the  day that new hope and the potential of a rebuilt, reimagined, redeemed  world is born. These investments in clean energy and transportation can  help us emerge from climate-fueled disasters to a more hopeful, clean  energy future for generations to come.''                            ____________________     Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to  congratulate Kim Brinkman, who will be retiring on August 11, and to  thank her for her 34-plus years of exemplary service to the Senate  community. Kim has spent her entire career working in the Senate  Disbursing Office. Her colleagues in disbursing will miss her, but so,  too, will all Senators and Senate staff and their families. We have all  relied on Kim for expert advice and guidance on pay and health and  retirement benefits and other issues.  [[Page S4213]]    Kim is a constituent, but she originally hails from Nevada, IA. She  attended Stephens College in Columbia, MO, for 2 years and then  transferred to the University of Iowa, where she graduated with a  degree in economics. She is a proud Hawkeye.   In 1985, Kim had a summer internship working at the Federal Aviation  Administration and decided she wanted to return to Washington, DC,  after she graduated from college. She went to a library in nearby Ames,  IA, and checked the ``Help Wanted'' section of the Washington Post's  classifieds. The Senate Disbursing Office had an opening; she applied  and returned to Washington to interview for the job; and she got it.  She started working in the disbursing office on October 5, 1987.   When Kim started her career, the disbursing office had a staff of 43;  just 10 of them were women, including Kim. The Senate had just two  female Senators: Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, and my former  colleague, Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, who had just assumed  office a few months before Kim arrived. Fast forward to today, and 45  of the disbursing office's 58 staffers are women. There are 24 female  Senators, plus Vice President Harris. That has been one of the biggest  changes Kim has witnessed over the course of her career. The other is  the advent of the internet, email, and other information technology,  which has revolutionized the way we all work, including Kim.   Senators Leahy, Grassley, McConnell, and Shelby are the only Members  currently serving who arrived here before Kim, and just one of her  colleagues at disbursing has more seniority. Kim began her career as a  staff assistant in the front office, moved to the employee benefits  section, became the employee benefits manager, and later was promoted  to her current position as assistant financial clerk of the Senate.   I have often said that the Senate is a family, and we are so grateful  to staff members like Kim who make it function. Certainly, Kim has made  the thousands of Senators and staffers she has helped over the years  feel like family. She isn't just a subject matter expert when it comes  to pay and benefits; she is friendly, cheerful, patient, and kind.  Everyone who knows Kim has the highest regard and affection for her.   Kim will travel back to Iowa this month to visit her parents and help  celebrate her father's 90th birthday. She will also travel to Kentucky  to celebrate her daughter Maya's graduation from the University of  Kentucky. While Kim and her sister will continue to look after their  parents as needed, I know Kim's legions of friends in the DC  metropolitan area are glad that she will be coming back here, where she  will step up her gardening and her antique shopping in Rappahannock  County. She will have more time for her artwork and playing the piano  and clarinet and volunteering at her church, where she is part of the  visiting ministry team.   Ralph Waldo Emerson said, ``To laugh often and much; To win the  respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; To earn  the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false  friends; To appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; To leave the  world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a  redeemed social condition; To know even one life has breathed easier  because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.'' He was describing  Kim Brinkman.   On behalf of my colleagues, but especially on behalf of all the  Senate staffers and their family members whom she has counseled and  assisted over the years, I want to thank Kim for her outstanding  service and wish her all the best as she embarks on the next chapter in  a life well lived.                            ____________________
