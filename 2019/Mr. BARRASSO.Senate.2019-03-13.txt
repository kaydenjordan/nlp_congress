 Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss the so- called Green New Deal.   America needs every form of energy in order to succeed, but the  Democrats' extreme Green New Deal would send our strong, healthy, and  growing economy over a liberal cliff. This radical plan would eliminate  fossil fuels by requiring 100-percent renewable, carbon-free fuels in  just 10 years.   Clearly, we realize that the climate is changing and that the global  community has a collective duty to deal with this and to address it.  Renewables like wind and solar are certainly a key part of the  solution, but still, in the United States today, wind and solar provide  only 8 percent of our power. Abundant, reliable, and affordable fossil  fuels, like coal and natural gas, power about three out of five U.S.  homes and businesses. Excluding them would harm our national security;  it would make us dependent on foreign energy; it would destroy jobs;  and it would reduce our quality of life.   In a letter sent to the Green New Deal's sponsors, the AFL-CIO--the  Nation's federation of labor unions that represents about 12\1/2\  million employees and 55 different unions--called the plan a threat to  U.S. workers. The letter reads: ``We will not accept proposals that  could cause immediate harm to millions of our members and their  families.''   Those at the AFL-CIO also say the plan is not achievable or  realistic, and I agree with them. By themselves, renewables can't keep  the lights on, and an all-renewable energy electric power grid would  collapse. This isn't serious environmental policy--it is a pipe dream.   The Democrats have yet to provide a cost estimate for the Green New  Deal. One analysis by the former Director of the Congressional Budget  Office estimates it could cost up to $93 trillion--with a ``t.'' That  is more than the U.S. Government has spent in our Nation's entire  history--combined. We are $22 trillion in debt right now. So how are we  going to pay for it--by borrowing more money we don't have or by hiking  taxes?   The crushing burden is going to fall the hardest on working families.  To get to this number, it would drain every person's checkbook in  America, starting with Warren Buffett and going all the way down. The  Green New Deal would cost every American family as much as $65,000 a  year every year. That is more than the average family makes in America.  In Wyoming, where the average family's income is way above average, it  would cost the family $61,000 a year.   Despite the heavy toll it would take, the Green New Deal would still  fail to significantly lower the Earth's temperature. Already, America  leads the world in reducing carbon emissions. In 2017, the U.S.  produced just 13 percent of the global emissions, and China and India  combined produced 33 percent.   Let's take a look at this from a global standpoint. To me, it doesn't  make any sense at all to destroy our competitive economy and allow the  biggest polluters to continue to prioritize growth at our expense.  Backbreaking tax increases and heavyhanded mandates are not the answer.  The solution is to promote free market innovation, and the Republicans  continue to advance several innovative strategies for reducing  emissions.   First, we are encouraging carbon capture, utilization, and  sequestration technologies. That means actually capturing carbon and  using it productively for medical products, for construction products.   There are things we can actually do. Last year, we passed a  bipartisan bill in this body that was signed into law. It is called the  FUTURE Act, and it expands tax credits for capturing carbon.   The Clean Air Task Force calls it one of the most important bills for  reducing global warming pollution in the last two decades.   Our carbon capture work continues with the bipartisan USE IT Act,  which is going to help turn captured emissions into valuable products.   The other thing we are promoting is advanced nuclear power  technologies. Nuclear power has helped lower emissions by providing  most of America's carbon-free energy.   In late December, we passed the bipartisan Nuclear Energy Innovation  and Modernization Act. This law will help innovators develop new-age  nuclear reactors that are cheaper, better, and more reliable.   We also have extended the nuclear tax credit to speed completion of  two new nuclear reactors. We are going to speed that completion--the  first in a generation. Together they will prevent 10 million tons of  emissions every year.   Third, we are encouraging an increase in the use of renewables.  Republicans have repeatedly passed tax incentives to promote clean  energy.   These include tax credits for wind, for solar panels, as well as  incentives for biodiesel and compressed natural gas. The clean energy  strategies that Republicans have been working on in a bipartisan way  are working because America leads the world in reducing energy-related  emissions.   Since 2007, U.S. emissions have been down 14 percent. This progress  is the result of innovation. So let's continue to promote proven  solutions. Let's reject the Democrats' Green New Deal as unreasonable,  unworkable, and unaffordable.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the centennial  of the Thermopolis, WY, Chamber of Commerce.   On March 23, the Thermopolis Chamber of Commerce celebrates their  100th anniversary at an annual banquet. What was once called the old  Thermopolis Commercial Club incorporated in Hot Springs County as the  Thermopolis Chamber of Commerce on February 4, 1919.   The future of the chamber was entrusted to elected directors:  President Guy J. Gay, Vice President C.C. Beaver, and Directors Peter  Sill, I.W. Wright, Harris Woods, A.W. Harrigan, and C.E. Stewart. Their  guidance laid the foundation for a chamber that continues to foster the  growth of business and sense of community in Thermopolis.   In an article dated February 7, 1919, the Thermopolis Independent  Record wrote of the intended mission of the new chamber of commerce.  ``We wish to create better business, better homes, better government, a  better community and, in general, create a better brotherhood of man.  We ask only what is fair. All who live here are the owners of our  community and our community is our biggest asset.''   This spirit has driven Wyoming's people, businesses, and communities  since its inception and will continue for generations to come. To  further expand the chamber's embrace of community, on November 13,  1987, the Thermopolis Chamber of Commerce passed a resolution to change  its name to the Thermopolis Hot Springs Chamber of Commerce. This  combined all of Hot Spring County's corner of the Big Horn Basin into  the chamber's mission.   The citizens of Thermopolis and Hot Springs County are blessed to  live in a beautiful environment. Located in northern Wyoming and  nestled on the world's largest mineral hot spring, Thermopolis is  bordered by the Hot Springs State Park and the Wind River Canyon. The  Owl Creek Mountains lie to the South while the Absaroka Range is to the  West. The hot springs have been free to the public since purchase of  the land from Native Americans in 1896.   The construction of the railroad had a major impact on the  development of Hot Springs County. In 1910, the Burlington Railroad  reached Thermopolis from the north. In 1911, the Burlington completed  its line through Wind River Canyon to the south. This gave the entire  Bighorn Basin much better connections with the rest of Wyoming. On  February 9, 1911, the legislature approved establishment of Hot Springs  County with Thermopolis as county seat. County government was organized  in January 1913. The Thermopolis Chamber of Commerce was organized just  a few years later in an office on South 5th Street.   For 100 years, the hard-working people at the chamber welcomed  visitors to the area. One of today's main attractions is the rich  prehistoric areas of Hot Springs County. The Wyoming Dinosaur Center  offers a professional paleontological experience for the whole family.  The center is an impressive 16,000-square-foot complex. It includes a  world-class museum, working dig sites, and a modern preparation  laboratory. Interpretive dig site tours allow visitors to walk the same  ground as ancient dinosaurs and watch as scientists recover fossils  from burial sites.   Hot Springs County as we know it today is vastly different from 100  years ago. It is this shared history between today's residents and  those of the past that creates a special bond. Under direction and  guidance from the chamber board of directors, executive director Meri  Ann Rush and two office assistants, Kailey Dvorak and Kymberlee Oliver,  continue the traditions of promoting Wyoming's people, businesses, and  communities, started by the chamber 100 years ago. chamber board  members are president Deb Tudor, vice president Pastor Sam Needham,  treasurer Vivian Butchart, secretary Susan Linko, past president Greg  Willson, Phillip Scheel, Barb Heinze, Robin Griffin, Kerri Manig,  Amanda Kraushaar, Lana Nicodemus, Shelly Burrows, and middle school  representative Jackson Reed.   In honor of the centennial of the Thermopolis Hot Springs County  Chamber of Commerce, I invite my colleagues to see this wonderful place  in person. Thermopolis is the hometown of my wife Bobbi and her brother  Mike. Her parents, Bob and Jerry Brown, continue to live there today.  Bob served Thermopolis as the longtime postmaster, as well as in World  War 2 and the Korean war. Jerry owned a store downtown.   It is a great privilege to recognize this remarkable organization  advancing Wyoming business and tourism. Bobbi joins me in extending our  congratulations and gratitude to the Thermopolis Hot Springs Chamber of  Commerce on their centennial celebration.                            ____________________
