 Mr. President, I rise today to call upon the  administration to take urgent diplomatic action to address the  escalating conflict in Ethiopia, a country in the midst of what many in  the international community, including myself, had hoped would be a  historic political transition to democracy. Instead the country is  sliding into civil war. Unless the international community acts quickly  to forestall further violence, I fear that bloody and protracted  conflict is unavoidable.   Ethiopians have long aspired to participate in a democratic system of  government. For years, their leaders let them down, but in 2018, things  appeared to change when in response to peaceful popular protests  centered in Ethiopia's Oromo and Amhara regions, Ethiopia's ruling  party elevated Abiy Ahmed to Prime Minister. Prime Minister Abiy  undertook dramatic political reform in the first year of his  administration, releasing thousands of political prisoners, inviting  exiled opposition groups back home, and allowing the press to freely  operate. Repressive laws like the Charities and Societies and Anti- Terrorism proclamations, which had long been used to stifle political  dissent, were revised and replaced. The new government committed itself  to free and fair elections and, for the first time in Ethiopia's  history, introduced a gender-balanced Cabinet. Many Ethiopians and much  of the international community rightly celebrated these achievements  and looked to further democratic progress. Abiy himself was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize in 2019.   Yet transitions from autocratic rule to democracy are rarely  seamless, and Ethiopia's transition is no exception. The journey to  democracy has been beset by the proliferation of ethnically motivated  violence across the country. In 2018, IOM reported that Ethiopia  recorded the third highest number of new ID P's anywhere in the world,  fueled by ethnic violence and displacement in Gedeo and West Guji  zones, and violence has continued. In June 2019, rogue regional  security forces assassinated the president of Amhara region and the  head of the Ethiopian National Defense Forces, and in June 2020, the  murder of popular Oromo singer Hachalu Hundessa triggered violence that  killed at least 239 people. Sadly, Ethiopians of all ethnic and  religious backgrounds have been victims of this endless cycle of  senseless violence.   To be clear, there are some who have taken advantage of new-found  freedoms to threaten or use violence to achieve political ends, engage  in hate speech, and incite broader conflict. Such behavior is  inconsistent with democratic practice and has further exacerbated the  country's ethnic and political divisions in a profoundly damaging way.  Ethiopian authorities have a responsibility to protect their citizens  by holding the perpetrators and purveyors of such actions accountable  through a transparent, credible legal process.   Yet the government's response to these challenges has only  complicated matters. In May 2020, a report from Amnesty International  chronicled a long list of abuses committed by Ethiopia's security  forces since the transition began, including extrajudicial killings,  torture, and arbitrary arrest. The government has engaged in a  troubling crackdown on political opposition, media organizations, and  civil society, particularly in the wake of Hachalu Hundessa's death.  There are growing fears that state institutions are being leveraged by  the ruling party to unfairly consolidate the current government's  power, including through weaponizing law enforcement and the judicial  process to attack government critics. Under these conditions, it is  unlikely that Ethiopia's next general elections can be anything  approaching credible, exacerbating an already volatile political  situation.   Against the backdrop of a transition in jeopardy, violence between  the federal government and political leaders of the Tigray region is  escalating. Reports suggest that hundreds have already died in clashes  between government and regional forces. I am particularly horrified by  evidence of a civilian massacre in Mai-Kadra. I condemn this act and  all attacks on civilians in the strongest term, and call for a thorough  and transparent investigation by a credible, neutral, independent body.  Those who attack civilians must be held accountable in accordance with  the rule of law. I am also concerned by reports of civilian deaths as a  result of federal government airstrikes, mass displacement, and  discrimination and arrests based on ethnic profiling. Authorities in  Tigray have confirmed that their forces fired rockets into the capital  of a neighboring country, Eritrea.  [[Page S7072]]  These rocket attacks constitute a significant escalation, are  counterproductive, and should cease. They further underscore fears that  the conflict will expand beyond Ethiopia's borders. If left to  continue, the conflict in Tigray will not only lead to a catastrophic  loss of life and worsening humanitarian conditions, but will breed  further enmity that will derail Ethiopia's democratic progress and  destabilize the entire subregion.   We cannot afford to let that happen. Ethiopia is the second most  populous African country, home to the African Union, and one of the  world's top contributors to UN peacekeeping missions a tradition that  dates back to the Korean war. It has been a pillar of U.S. engagement  in the Horn of Africa for decades, partnering with the U.S. on  counterterrorism and with the U.S. and international community to  stabilize protracted conflicts in neighboring Somalia and South Sudan.   The Ethiopian people need peace, not war; and the world needs a  stable, democratic and prosperous Ethiopia.   I urge the federal government and the leaders of Tigray region to  choose the path of peace. While it is tempting to assign blame for the  outbreak of hostilities, our collective focus must be on how to restore  order. Make no mistake, a full accounting must take place. Right now,  however, both sides must agree to an immediate ceasefire and begin a  sustained dialogue to settle political differences.   I also call on Prime Minister Abiy to take a series of actions to  facilitate a successful democratic transition. First, barring immediate  and incontrovertible evidence of serious crimes, he should release all  members of the political opposition. Their continued detention is  unacceptable, and I am troubled by reports that their judicial  proceedings are being politicized. Second, media and digital rights  must be respected. Arresting journalists and imposing internet  blackouts harkens back to the dark days of the previous regime. Mr.  Prime Minister, such practices must end. You and your colleagues have  taken bold action to chart a new course for the country, and I urge you  to continue along the difficult path of reform.   Third, the Prime Minister should empower an independent and impartial  body to investigate and ascertain responsibility for past acts of  violence beyond those related to current hostilities in Tigray.  Finally, I call on the Prime Minister to engage in an inclusive  dialogue with relevant stakeholders in advance of elections to ensure  there is a level playing field and buy-in to the electoral process from  all stakeholders.   Although resolving the current crisis requires Ethiopian commitment  and action, the United States, along with others in the international  community, have a critical role to play. I therefore urge the  administration to do the following:   Lead international diplomatic efforts-the administration must reach  out to multilateral institutions, allies and partners in the region,  the Gulf, and elsewhere to ensure unity around a single message to the  federal government and officials in Tigray, there is no military  solution to the conflict between the federal government and the Tigray  People's Liberation Front. Dialogue is the only path forward. A joint  delegation should demarche the Prime Minister with this message and  reach out to leaders in Tigray with the same.   Increase support for Ethiopia's democratic transition--the  administration should redouble its efforts to support the transition by  providing the Embassy and USAID mission with more staff to provide  increased monitoring in the areas of democracy and human rights and  increased technical assistance in the area of election administration.  Funding for grassroots conflict mitigation and reconciliation is  critical given ongoing tensions. The United States must also engage all  Ethiopian stakeholders, including traditionally marginalized  populations, without favor or bias, with the goal of encouraging  dialogue between the country's rival political forces. Political  disagreements must be settled through peaceful means.   Take an informed, organized, and holistic approach. Civil war in  Ethiopia will destabilize the Horn of Africa and has implications for  U.S. geostrategic interests in the Horn of Africa and Red Sea corridor  writ large. It is critical that the U.S. approach diplomatic engagement  in a holistic manner, recognizing the potential ripple effects of  prolonged conflict. Negotiations between Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt  relative to the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam--GERD--are only one  example of how the conflict could impact stability in the subregion.  Progress on the GERD talks is highly unlikely in the face of civil war,  since Ethiopia is likely to remain focused on its domestic problems.   Unfortunately, the U.S. approach is currently fractured. The  administration has engaged in GERD negotiations as though they are  unfolding in a vacuum, divorced from our interests in a strong  bilateral partnership with Ethiopia and absent a broader strategy for  the Horn of Africa and Red Sea corridor. Even in the parochial context  in which we have engaged in GERD negotiations, the administration's  actions have, quite frankly, been unhelpful. Having Treasury Department  lead the talks was never wise. Treasury lacks the deep regional  knowledge and expertise to lead such sensitive negotiations, and there  is no evidence that its actions were developed as part of an  interagency strategy or policy approach informed by such expertise. It  is imperative that a sound strategy be developed and that the State  Department take the lead on an integrated diplomatic approach to both  the country and the subregion.   Ethiopia faces historic challenges. These challenges can only be met  through diplomacy, dialogue, and compromise. The country has a once in  a generation opportunity that we must not let slip away. I urge the  administration to act while there is still time.                            ____________________
