 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  Diane L. Whitaker as she retires from the Clinton County Library System  this year after serving 31 years and 31 days as executive director of  the Ross Library in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania.   In the library's 107 years of existence, Ms. Whitaker is just the  seventh director, but she is the longest serving in its history.   The Ross Library Board of Trustees recently hosted a celebration for  Ms. Whitaker. They also revealed the newly named ``Diane L. Whitaker  Genealogy Collection'' on a plaque in her honor.   Over the years, Ms. Whitaker has overseen numerous projects and has  also authored grant applications that have helped local libraries with  much-needed funding.   Ms. Whitaker was raised in Clearfield County and holds a bachelor's  degree in secondary education from Lock Haven University. She earned a  master's degree in library science from Clarion University.   She has been a career librarian for more than four decades, working  as a school librarian, bookmobile librarian, children's coordinator,  branch librarian, and administrator.   Ms. Whitaker and her husband, Lester, live in Beech Creek. They have  three daughters and six grandchildren, all of whom reside in Clinton  and Centre Counties.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Whitaker for all her contributions to Ross  Library and the entire Clinton County Library System. The community is  a better place thanks to her efforts. She plans to visit State and  national parks in her retirement, which I think is an outstanding plan.                         Recognizing Michael Colbert     Mr. Speaker, for nearly 20 years,  Michael Colbert has given his leadership to Oil Creek Township as  supervisor chairman. Last week, he oversaw his final meeting as  supervisor, and he will retire at the end of the year.   Mr. Colbert first served as a supervisor in 1993 to fill a vacancy,  but he stepped down the next year. He would run again in 1999, win the  seat, and officially be sworn in in January 2000.   Over nearly 20 years at the helm, Mr. Colbert oversaw numerous  projects, but he told the Titusville Herald that his proudest  achievement was helping pave the way for Walmart to open a store in the  township.   In his well-deserved retirement, Mr. Colbert said he plans to  vacation in Florida for a few weeks.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Colbert for his dedication and leadership to  Oil Creek Township as supervisor chairman. He has given nearly 20 years  of his time and energy to his neighbors and his community. For that, we  are grateful.   I wish him the best in retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  the conference report to accompany H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   For the first time since 1986, there is a real opportunity to  challenge the status quo and simplify the Tax Code. The final agreement  lowers rates and significantly increases the standard deduction for  both individuals and joint filers. American families will see the child  tax credit expanded to help parents with the cost of raising children.   Importantly, the graduate tuition voucher exemption and student loan  interest deduction have remained to ensure our commitment to  opportunity through education. I, and many of my colleagues, urged the  conference committee to keep these important provisions intact.   H.R. 1 also eliminates ObamaCare's individual mandate penalty tax to  allow Americans the flexibility to buy healthcare that is right for  them. Job creators will see the corporate tax rate lowered to 21  percent on January 1, 2018, which is the largest reduction in our  Nation's history.   Mr. Speaker, this is just some of what this once-in-a-generation  proposal does to help America keep more of their hard-earned paychecks.  I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 1.                            ____________________
