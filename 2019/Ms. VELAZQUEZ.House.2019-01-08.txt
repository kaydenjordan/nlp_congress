 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 226) to amend the Small Business Act to include best in  class designations in the annual report on small business goals  prepared by the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 226         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Clarity on Small Business       Participation in Category Management Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. INCLUSION OF BEST IN CLASS DESIGNATIONS IN ANNUAL                     REPORT ON SMALL BUSINESS GOALS.         Section 15(h) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(h))       is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(4) Best in class small business participation       reporting.--        ``(A) Addendum.--The Administrator, in addition to the       requirements under paragraph (2), shall include in the report       required by such paragraph, for each best in class       designation--        ``(i) the total amount of spending Governmentwide in such       designation;        ``(ii) the number of small business concerns awarded       contracts and the dollar amount of such contracts awarded       within each such designation to each of the following--         ``(I) qualified HUBZone small business concerns;        ``(II) small business concerns owned and controlled by       women;        ``(III) small business concerns owned and controlled by       service-disabled veterans; and        ``(IV) small business concerns owned and controlled by       socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.         ``(B) Best in class defined.--The term `best in class' has       the meaning given such term by the Director of the Office of       Management and Budget.        ``(C) Effective date.--The Administrator shall report on       the information described by subparagraph (A) beginning on       the date that such information is available in the Federal       Procurement Data System, the System for Award Management, or       any successor to such systems.''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 226, the Clarity on  Small Business Participation in Category Management Act of 2019.   Let me begin by welcoming back Ranking Member Chabot to this new  Congress. I have been privileged to serve on the Small Business  Committee for two decades and appreciate the relationship the ranking  member and I have cultivated. I look forward to working with him on  this bill and others as we remain steadfast in our efforts to ensure  small businesses have the resources to thrive now and in the future.   Our committee has long acknowledged small businesses' critical role  in the $500 billion a year Federal marketplace. When small firms are  awarded Federal contracts, the result is a win-win.   Category management is believed by some to be the best strategy to  get agencies the lowest price, but my committee has heard otherwise,  and the data backs this up. Small contractors on the multiple award  schedule consistently provide lower prices to agencies than those  offered through category management.   Despite this, agencies have increased the use of category management,  which not just increases costs to the Federal Government but also  limits contracts to small vendors. In our committee hearings last year,  we heard that more and more contracts are being consolidated and put  out of the reach of small businesses as a result of category  management.   This bill is a commonsense first step to address the need of small  vendors, particularly minority-, women-, and veteran-owned small  businesses, to remain competitors in the Federal marketplace. By  requiring that contracting activity under this new regime of category  management be reported in the annual goaling report from agencies to  Congress, today's bill protects the industrial base by creating a  mechanism for much-needed accountability.   H.R. 226 gives us the ability to analyze the data so that we can  truly understand the role category management is playing in the  marketplace and make changes accordingly.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to offer this bill to provide accountability  to the category management regime. I urge Members to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), the chairman of the Committee on Homeland  Security.    Mr. Speaker, let me just respond to the gentleman's  comment regarding the shutdown. The fact of the matter is that the  President campaigned and told the American people that he will build a  wall and that it will be paid for by the Government of Mexico, and that  is not what he is telling us now.   Besides, this is the President's shutdown, and he was very proud when  he made that comment to Speaker Pelosi and the minority leader, Chuck  Schumer.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of this important legislation to provide  much-needed oversight of small business participation in the  streamlined acquisition strategy known as category management.                                time  1715    H.R. 226 requires that contracting activity under this new regime be  reported in the annual goaling report from agencies to Congress. This  data would allow us to better understand how small firms fare under  this new system and make adjustments if needed to guarantee an  equitable playing field.   This bill protects the small business industrial base by giving a  mechanism for much-needed accountability. It is supported by the  National Small Business Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and  the National Electrical Contractors Association, which is the voice of  the $171 billion electrical construction industry.   I thank the ranking member for his support of H.R. 226, and I remain  committed to ensuring small firms are competitive within the Federal  marketplace.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 227) to amend the Small Business Act to specify what credit  is given for certain subcontractors and to provide a dispute process  for non-payment to subcontractors, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 227         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Incentivizing Fairness in       Subcontracting Act''.  [[Page H272]]            SEC. 2. SMALL BUSINESS LOWER-TIER SUBCONTRACTING.         Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d))       is amended--        (1) by amending paragraph (16) to read as follows:        ``(16) Credit for certain small business concern       subcontractors.--        ``(A) In general.--For purposes of determining whether or       not a prime contractor has attained the percentage goals       specified in paragraph (6)--        ``(i) if the subcontracting goals pertain only to a single       contract with the Federal agency, the prime contractor may       elect to receive credit for small business concerns       performing as first tier subcontractors or subcontractors at       any tier pursuant to the subcontracting plans required under       paragraph (6)(D) in an amount equal to the total dollar value       of any subcontracts awarded to such small business concerns;       and        ``(ii) if the subcontracting goals pertain to more than one       contract with one or more Federal agencies, or to one       contract with more than one Federal agency, the prime       contractor may only receive credit for first tier       subcontractors that are small business concerns.        ``(B) Collection and review of data on subcontracting       plans.--The head of each contracting agency shall ensure       that--        ``(i) the agency collects and reports data on the extent to       which contractors of the agency meet the goals and objectives       set forth in subcontracting plans submitted pursuant to this       subsection; and        ``(ii) the agency periodically reviews data collected and       reported pursuant to subparagraph (A) for the purpose of       ensuring that such contractors comply in good faith with the       requirements of this subsection and subcontracting plans       submitted by the contractors pursuant to this subsection.        ``(C) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph       shall be construed to allow a Federal agency to establish a       goaling requirement for lower-tier subcontractors of a prime       contractor that is eligible to receive lower-tier       subcontracting credit under this paragraph''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(18) Dispute process for non-payment to subcontractors.--        ``(A) Notice to agency.--With respect to a contract with a       Federal agency, a subcontractor of a prime contractor on such       contract may, if the subcontractor has not received payment       for performance on such contract within 30 days of the       completion of such performance, notify the Office of Small       and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (`OSDBU') of the       Federal agency and the prime contractor of such lack of       payment, if such notice is provided to the agency within the       15-day period following the end of such 30 days.        ``(B) Agency determination.--        ``(i) In general.--Upon receipt of a notice described under       subparagraph (A), the OSDBU shall verify whether such lack of       payment has occurred and determine whether such lack of       payment is due to an undue restriction placed on the prime       contractor by an action of the Federal agency.        ``(ii) Response during determination.--During the period in       which the OSDBU is making the determination under clause (i),       the prime contractor may respond to both the subcontractor       and the OSDBU with relevant verifying documentation to either       prove payment or allowable status of nonpayment.        ``(C) Cure period.--If the OSDBU verifies the lack of       payment under subparagraph (B) and determines that such lack       of payment is not due to an action of the Federal agency, the       OSDBU shall notify the prime contractor and provide the prime       contractor with a 15-day period in which the prime contractor       may make the payment owed to the subcontractor.        ``(D) Result of nonpayment.--If, after notifying the prime       contractor under subparagraph (C), the OSDBU determines that       the prime contractor has not fully paid the amount owed       within the 15-day cure period described under subparagraph       (C), the OSDBU shall ensure that such failure to pay is       reflected in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting       system (or any successor system).''.       SEC. 3. MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS WITH RESPECT TO CREDIT UNDER A                     SUBCONTRACTING PLAN.         Section 8(d)(6) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.       637(d)(6)) is amended--        (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (G) and (H) as       subparagraphs (H) and (I), respectively (and conforming the       margins accordingly); and        (2) by inserting after subparagraph (F) the following:        ``(G) a recitation of the types of records the successful       offeror or bidder will maintain to demonstrate that       procedures have been adopted to substantiate the credit the       successful offeror or bidder will elect to receive under       paragraph (16)(A)(i);''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 227, the Incentivizing  Fairness in Subcontracting Act.   In fiscal year 2017, the Federal Government purchased goods and  services worth over $508 billion through over 22 million contract  actions. Unfortunately, not all this money remained with the original  prime contractor and, instead, trickled down to subcontractors.   Subcontractors are growing in importance as an avenue for small  businesses to work with the government, so it is important that  barriers to entry are reduced. Today's bill does just that by helping  contractors get the credit they need to meet Federal requirements,  while also creating a dispute process for nonpayment--a recurring  problem for those working with the Federal Government.   By improving the tools that exist for small businesses to become  subcontractors, today's measure will draw in more small businesses that  are not regular government contractors. This is a critical step to  expanding the industrial base and including more small firms.   Most importantly, it ensures more small contractors have just  recourse through the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business  Utilization if payment is not received within 30 days of completion.  Timely payment protects small contractors who do not have the overhead  margins to continue operating without being paid.   Today's bill is endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the  National Small Business Association, and the National Electrical  Contractors Association.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce this piece of legislation  which protects our small contractors by updating the subcontracting  goaling regime through increased flexibility and accountability.   Establishing incentives to count low-tier subcontracting awards and a  dispute process for subcontractors to utilize in the event of  nonpayment ensures a healthy Federal procurement marketplace. Today's  legislation spreads the economic power of Federal procurement to more  companies and the communities where they are located.   I want to thank the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Kelly) for  cosponsoring this critical legislation and for all his work on this  issue while serving on the Small Business Committee, and I would like  to also take this opportunity to thank the ranking member.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 128) to clarify the primary functions and duties of the  Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 128         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Advocacy       Improvements Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO PRIMARY FUNCTIONS AND DUTIES OF THE                     OFFICE OF ADVOCACY OF THE SMALL BUSINESS                     ADMINISTRATION.         (a) Primary Functions.--Section 202 of Public Law 94-305       (15 U.S.C. 634b) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``and the international       economy'' after ``economy'';        (2) in paragraph (9), by striking ``complete'' and       inserting ``compete''; and        (3) in paragraph (12), by striking ``serviced-disabled''       and inserting ``service-disabled''.  [[Page H274]]         (b) Duties.--Section 203(a) of Public Law 94-305 (15 U.S.C.       634c) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (5), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (2) in paragraph (6), by striking the period at the end and       inserting ``; and''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(7) represent the views and interests of small businesses       before foreign governments and international entities for the       purpose of contributing to regulatory and trade initiatives       which may affect small businesses.''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 128, the Small Business  Advocacy Improvements Act.   There are nearly 30 million small businesses in the United States  representing more than 99 percent of all businesses. These small firms  employ nearly 50 percent of all private-sector employees in the U.S.  The SBA Office of Advocacy represents an important tool for these  businesses because it is their voice that the office embodies in all  matters of government.   Clarifying the authority of Advocacy to examine international  economic data and represent small business interests in international  discussions, particularly in trade negotiations, raises the ability of  small American firms to participate in a global market. The office has  already been participating in various international working groups on  regulatory cooperation and trade initiatives with the sole focus of  protecting and raising the interests of small businesses.   Their unique knowledge is necessary in trade negotiations to prevent  indirect consequences from harming small firms and providing a more  equitable playing field within international trade. That is why I urge  my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   There is no question that we need to support our small businesses  across the country, no matter their location or industry, when they are  attempting to break into international commerce.   Today's bill leverages the unique position and knowledge of the SBA's  Office of Advocacy to amplify the voice of small firms in international  settings. Today is an important step to break down international  barriers for small entrepreneurs entering into the world of trade.   Finally, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Comer), for his  diligence on this matter.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
