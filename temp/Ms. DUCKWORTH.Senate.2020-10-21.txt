 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my dear  friend and colleague, Deirdre ``Dee'' Wallace, who retired this year  after 36 years of Federal service. A true civil servant, Dee served our  country and its citizens with humility and empathy for decades.   Since taking the vow to serve and protect our Nation as a soldier in  the U.S. Army, Dee has never stopped fighting for the American people.  After 5 years of military service, Dee dedicated her life to making  government work for the people during decades of service with the Army  National Guard and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.   Never discouraged, Dee embodies the type of caring spirit and can-do  attitude that we should all strive to emulate. As my chief of staff at  the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Dee worked tirelessly to bring  awareness to servicemembers battling posttraumatic stress disorder and  veterans facing homelessness.   In our time together, I learned that no stone will go unturned with  Dee around. She will always find a way to care for America's heroes.  Her service to her community is remarkable and her story inspiring. I  stand here today to applaud my dear friend and to honor her  extraordinary work.   Dee, I wish you the best of luck in retirement and thank you for your  service.                            ____________________
