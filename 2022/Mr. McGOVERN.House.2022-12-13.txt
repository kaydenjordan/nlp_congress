 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 1156) expressing the commitment of the House of  Representatives to building on the twenty years of success of the  George McGovern-Robert Dole Food for Education and Child Nutrition  Program.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 1156         Whereas the George McGovern-Robert Dole International Food       for Education and Child Nutrition Program (referred to in       this preamble as the ``McGovern-Dole Program'') has improved       the food security, nutrition, literacy, and primary education       of school-age children, particularly young girls, and their       families in over 48 countries in just two decades;        Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program was established by       section 3107 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of       2002 (7 U.S.C. 1736o-1) to procure agricultural commodities       and provide financial and technical assistance to carry out       preschool and school food for education programs in foreign       countries and maternal, infant, and child nutrition programs       for pregnant women, nursing mothers, infants, and children       who are 5 years of age or younger;        Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program has provided over 5.5       billion school meals benefitting over 31 million school-age       children and their communities;        Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program has been successfully       administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service of the       Department of Agriculture;        Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program is a key program of the       Department of Agriculture aligned with the governmentwide       Global Food Security Strategy;        Whereas in fiscal year 2021 alone, McGovern-Dole Program       projects have directly benefitted more than 4.5 million       children and community members through the distribution of       United States-produced commodities that provide daily       nutritious and high-quality meals and mitigate food       insecurity;        Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program partners with American       farmers, who provide 46,770 metric tons (``MT'') of food       commodities in support of fiscal year 2021 McGovern-Dole       Program grants in Central America, Africa, and Asia;        Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program complements United States       agricultural commodities with food grown and purchased       locally to support farmers and markets within their own       communities and to build the capacity of local governments       and communities to continue and sustain the benefits of the       McGovern-Dole Program into the future;        Whereas during the COVID-19 pandemic when school closures       were commonplace, the McGovern-Dole Program effectively       shifted from providing meals in schools to providing take-      home rations and distributed approximately 23,000 MT of       commodities donated by the United States and 550 MT of       locally procured commodities to more than 1,700,000 McGovern-      Dole Program participants and their families across 26 active       projects, ensuring that children continued to receive daily       meals and learn while at home;        Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program recognizes the value of       educating young girls and contributes to overcoming the       barriers they encounter in accessing a high-quality education       by promoting equality and the reduction of gender-based       violence;        Whereas school meals provide an incentive for families to       send girls to school and help girls to stay in school,       effectively preventing early marriage and delaying first       pregnancy, which can trap young women in poverty and limit       their future potential;        Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program strengthens local       community health and education through the formation of       parent-teacher associations, teacher training, and improving       the infrastructure of schools, classrooms, commodity       storerooms, latrines, and water sources; and        Whereas the United States, as a member of the Global School       Meals Coalition, is committed to and recognizes that       investments in McGovern-Dole Program, are central to       bolstering food security, building resilience to future       shocks, and supporting the nutritional, health, and       educational needs of children and adolescents worldwide: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of       Representatives that the United States is committed to--        (1) building upon the twenty years of successful work of       the George McGovern-Robert Dole International Food for       Education and Child Nutrition Program (in this resolution       referred to as the ``McGovern-Dole Program'') and its       positive role in breaking cycles of hunger and poverty,       providing opportunity through education and literacy, and       improving overall nutrition and health;        (2) complementing humanitarian assistance efforts and       development programs through the continued implementation of       the McGovern-Dole Program that addresses global food       insecurity and creates conditions for peace and stability;       and        (3) supporting United States farmers, millers, shippers,       and commodity groups that provide agricultural commodities       for use in the McGovern-Dole Program to help combat global       malnutrition and food insecurity and advance global       education.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1156. Today, we  are considering this legislation, calling on Congress to build on the  20 years of success of the George McGovern-Robert Dole International  Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program.   McGovern-Dole is one of America's signature child nutrition and food  security programs. It is named after Senators George McGovern and Bob  Dole, both of whom worked tirelessly and in a bipartisan way to end  hunger among children in the United States and around the world.   They continued their work together after leaving the Senate, living  examples of what can be accomplished when Members of Congress put  partisanship aside and make the welfare of children and families their  number one priority.   In that bipartisan tradition, I am proud to stand here today with my  Republican colleague and co-lead on this resolution, Congressman Tracey  Mann. I am grateful to each of the 86 bipartisan cosponsors of this  resolution.   I also want to honor and recognize our former colleague, the  incredible Jo Ann Emerson, who was my co-lead in 2001 when the  McGovern-Dole legislation was first introduced and later established by  Congress in the 2002 farm bill.   Over the past 20 years, McGovern-Dole has provided lifesaving meals  in a school setting to over 31 million of the world's most vulnerable  children, providing U.S. and international organizations with American  commodities, grants, and technical assistance to strengthen child  nutrition and education.   Working through partners like the World Food Programme, Catholic  Relief Services, World Vision, Save the Children, Counterpart  International, and many more, McGovern-Dole has reduced hunger and  increased school enrollments, attendance, literacy, and the support of  families and communities for education, especially for girls.   America's farmers are vital to the success of the McGovern-Dole  Program. Over the past 20 years, more than 1.3 million metric tons of  U.S. commodities have been used to create nutritious, culturally  appropriate school meals in over 48 countries.   But just as important as the statistics, perhaps even more important,  are the stories. I remember in Colombia, I visited a program in Soacha,  on the outskirts of Bogota. On barren hillsides, surrounded by shanties  housing thousands of internally displaced families, children were  receiving school breakfast and lunch.   Mothers and grandmothers were training as cooks, preparing the meals.  Clearly visible in the cafeteria were USDA and USAID bags of grains,  beans, and lentils.   One mother came up to me and said: ``Please thank the American people  when you go back home. I couldn't feed my children. I couldn't send  them to school. I was afraid my son was going to join the  paramilitaries or the guerillas just to get food. Now, my son is  getting fed, and he is staying in school. Please tell the American  people thank you.''   In Nairobi, Kenya, in the largest slum in the world, I went to a  McGovern-Dole breakfast and lunch program. The school principal showed  me how they store and prepare the U.S. commodities that feed her  students and how all the students know that this is a program from the  American people. I ate porridge made from American yellow peas. The  kids dug into the food like it was manna from heaven.   One little boy would take a bite and then scoop a small amount out of  his bowl and put it in his pockets. He was taking food home to his  younger siblings who don't get anything to eat.   Madam Speaker, McGovern-Dole represents the very best of this  country. It is something the American people should be proud of, a  powerful message to the world about who we are and what we stand for,  not only freedom of speech, freedom of religion, or freedom of the  press, but also freedom from want, freedom from fear, and freedom from  hunger.   There are many ways to advance our national security and economic  interests abroad. This program ought to be at the top of the list. As  we confront the global challenges of war, pandemic, and climate change,  food security and nutrition programs must remain at the forefront of  international development and humanitarian work.   I urge my colleagues to visit McGovern-Dole programs when they travel  abroad. I urge them to support funding that expands and builds upon  these 20 years of success.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 1156,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Bishop).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the distinguished chair of  the Appropriations Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Hayes), my distinguished colleague.    Madam Speaker, I have one additional speaker, but I  don't see her. I yield myself the balance of my time to close.   First of all, let me thank the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Mann) for  his support of this resolution and for his advocacy on behalf of the  McGovern-Dole program. As we listened to the back-and-forth here today,  it is really quite inspiring to see the breadth of the bipartisanship  here, that we are all dedicated to trying to deal with this horrific  problem of childhood hunger around the world.    Hunger is a political condition. We have the resources, the funds,  and the infrastructure. We have everything we need to eradicate hunger  in this country and across the planet. What we have lacked is the  political will.   The McGovern-Dole program was inspired by George McGovern and Bob  Dole, a liberal Democrat from South Dakota and a conservative  Republican from Kansas. Their efforts together have made a dent in  childhood hunger. It has made a huge difference. It has allowed more  young kids, especially girls, to go to school, to become literate, to  be able to get an education, to be able to succeed in their countries.   It is so incredible when you travel and you see a McGovern-Dole  project anywhere in the world, how grateful people are to the people of  the United States for supporting this.   Parents are the same everywhere. We all want to make sure that our  kids are safe, that they are fed, that they have a good future. What  this program does is, it helps parents ensure that their kids' future  is bright.   I believe that when we talk about national security, it has to be  more than just about the number of bombs we have. It has to be about  how we alleviate these global challenges like hunger, and in this case,  childhood hunger. That is the way we build a more secure and a more  stable world.   I am proud of all the organizations that have participated in the  McGovern-Dole program. I am proud of all those who have helped  administer the McGovern-Dole program, and I am proud to serve with  colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, who support this important  initiative.   I will close simply by saying, this is not only a good program, it is  a great program. At a time when people wonder where the bipartisanship  is in Washington, here is an example where we can bring people  together.   I know I mentioned her briefly in the beginning, but I do want to  acknowledge our former colleague, Congresswoman Jo Ann Emerson from  Missouri. She was a strong partner in this effort early on, in getting  the legislation that established McGovern-Dole up and running, and I  can't ever thank her enough.   To all my colleagues, please support H. Res. 1156, and please let us  all commit to doing more to eradicate hunger and food insecurity here  in the United States and around the world in the year to come.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
