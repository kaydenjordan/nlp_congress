 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6889) to mend the Federal Credit Union Act to modify the  frequency of board of directors meetings, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6889         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Credit Union Board       Modernization Act''.       SEC. 2. FREQUENCY OF BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETINGS.         Section 113 of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C.       1761b) is amended--        (1) by striking ``monthly'' each place such term appears;        (2) in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by striking       ``The board of directors'' and inserting the following:        ``(a) In General.--The board of directors'';        (3) in subsection (a) (as so designated), by striking       ``shall meet at least once a month and''; and        (4) by adding at the end the following:        ``(b) Meetings.--The board of directors of a Federal credit       union shall meet as follows:        ``(1) With respect to a de novo Federal credit union, not       less frequently than monthly during each of the first five       years of the existence of such Federal credit union.        ``(2) Not less than six times annually, with at least one       meeting held during each fiscal quarter, with respect to a       Federal credit union--        ``(A) with composite rating of either 1 or 2 under the       Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (or an       equivalent rating under a comparable rating system); and        ``(B) with a capability of management rating under such       composite rating of either 1 or 2.        ``(3) Not less frequently than once a month, with respect       to a Federal credit union--        ``(A) with composite rating of either 3, 4, or 5 under the       Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (or an       equivalent rating under a comparable rating system); or        ``(B) with a capability of management rating under such       composite rating of either 3, 4, or 5.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in  [[Page H8158]]       the Congressional Record by the Chairman of the House Budget       Committee, provided that such statement has been submitted       prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   First, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Vargas) for  offering H.R. 6889, the Credit Union Board Modernization Act.   This bipartisan bill would revise Federal credit union board meeting  requirements to bring highly rated Federal credit unions in line with  State credit union charter requirements in 17 States, including my home  State of California.   Under this bill, Federal credit unions that are highly rated by their  regulator, including a highly rated management team, would be required  to meet at least six times annually, with at least one meeting held  during each fiscal quarter. This would be a reduction from the current  requirement to meet monthly.   To ensure stability and mitigate the risk of institutional failure,  there are important safeguards included in the bill. For example, de  novo or new Federal credit union boards would still be required to meet  at least monthly during the first 5 years of receiving a charter, as  well as Federal credit unions that have received low exam ratings.   Additionally, if emergencies or issues arise requiring a board  meeting, nothing in the bill prevents Federal credit unions from  meeting more frequently.   Credit unions and consumer groups support H.R. 6889, including the  California and Nevada Credit Union Leagues, Americans for Financial  Reform, and Center for Responsible Lending.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill as well, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   H.R. 6889 will incentivize Federal credit union boards to ensure  their institutions are highly rated and well run in order to reduce the  number of board meetings they need to hold.   I therefore urge Members to support H.R. 6889, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2710) to increase transparency with respect to financial  services benefitting state sponsors of terrorism, human rights abusers,  and corrupt officials, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2710         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Banking Transparency for       Sanctioned Persons Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. REPORT ON FINANCIAL SERVICES BENEFITTING STATE                     SPONSORS OF TERRORISM, HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSERS,                     AND CORRUPT OFFICIALS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, and every 180 days thereafter, the       Secretary of the Treasury shall issue a report to the       Committees on Financial Services and Foreign Affairs of the       House of Representatives and the Committees on Banking,       Housing, and Urban Affairs and Foreign Relations of the       Senate that includes a copy of any license issued by the       Secretary in the preceding 180 days that authorizes a United       States financial institution (as defined under section       561.309 of title 31, Code of Federal Regulations) to provide       financial services benefitting--        (1) a state sponsor of terrorism; or        (2) a person sanctioned pursuant to any of the following:        (A) Section 404 of the Russia and Moldova Jackson-Vanik       Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of       2012 (Public Law 112-208).        (B) Subtitle F of title XII of the National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114-328,       the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act).        (C) Executive Order No. 13818.        (b) Form of Report.--The report required under subsection       (a) shall be submitted in unclassified form but may contain a       classified annex.       SEC. 3. SUNSET.         The reporting requirement under this Act shall terminate on       the date that is the end of the 7-year period beginning on       the date of the enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2710, the Banking Transparency  for Sanctioned Persons Act of 2021.   This legislation requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report to  Congress semiannually with a copy of any license Treasury issues in the  preceding 180 days that authorizes a U.S. financial institution to  provide services benefiting a state sponsor of terrorism and certain  other sanctioned entities, including human rights abusers and corrupt  officials. It would sunset 7 years after enactment of the act.   I am supportive of the disclosure requirements in this bill because I  believe that this after-the-fact reporting to congressional committees  regarding these specific licenses can serve as a useful oversight tool.   When the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, issues a specific  license, it allows a particular individual or entity to engage in a  transaction that would otherwise be prohibited under a United States  sanctions program. Typically, specific licenses are granted by OFAC  when the person or entity requesting such a license makes clear that  allowing for the permitted transactions serves a compelling public  policy goal. But currently, Treasury does not release specific licenses  granted to individuals or entities or any information about them.   OFAC's licensing authority is an important part of an effective  administration of United States sanctions, and disclosure is an  important part of Congress' ability to conduct effective oversight.   Now, there is a risk that if some licenses were to become public,  they would disclose commercially sensitive information to potential  market competitors, introducing issues of corporate theft and unfair  competition. That is why the bill allows for sensitive information in  these licenses to be included in a classified annex to the report.  Moving forward, we may want to examine whether this provides sufficient  protection for proprietary or commercially sensitive information  submitted by private-sector representatives which may not be classified  and, if publicly released, would allow potential market competitors to  gain an unfair competitive advantage. We certainly do not want to  create a chilling effect and a wariness on behalf of companies about  continuing to file for licenses moving forward, and we should guard  against that.   Mr. Speaker, ultimately, I support the underlying goal and the  disclosure requirements of H.R. 2710 because I believe they will  increase congressional oversight of United States' sanctions activity.  I urge my colleagues to do the same, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the Banking Transparency for Sanctioned Persons Act of  2021 will help ensure that Members of Congress have the information  they need to provide more effective oversight of the decisions made by  Treasury and OFAC and the impact that those decisions have on  sanctioned persons.   I thank Mr. Steil for bringing this measure forward, and I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
