 Mr. President, I am going to be here on another matter in  a moment, but I wanted to add my thanks to the great work that Senator  Kyl has done.   I remember coming here as a freshman Senator in early 2009, and Jon  Kyl was one of the people who was kind enough to take me in. We didn't  always agree. I still remember a very famous battle over slots at  National Airport. But Jon Kyl has always been someone I have enormous  respect for. I think Senators on both sides of the aisle have respect  for him, and we very much appreciate his willingness to come back into  service, fulfilling part of the tenure of his dear friend, Senator  McCain.   I know enough about Jon Kyl to know that, shall I say, his livelihood  prior to coming back into the Senate was quite good, and his  willingness to give that up to serve Arizona and the country is a real  tribute to the individual and the patriot he is. We will all miss him,  and I wish him all the best going forward.    Mr. President, I want to join with the chairman of the  committee and basically echo what he has said.   Bill Evanina is a true professional. I have had a chance to work with  him for a number of years in my role on the Intelligence Committee and,  more recently, as vice chair. Let me cite one example.   Outside of his lane--not a duty as required--Bill has been a  consistent voice in raising concerns about the challenges and threats  that are posed by China. As a matter of fact, the chairman and I were  recently in Austin, and Bill came down and gave one of the most  powerful briefs I have heard,  [[Page S7854]]  which he has done a number of times for the committee and increasingly  for the business community, talking in an honest, straightforward way  about the security threats, the intellectual property theft, the host  of concerns that confront our country by China.   Bill Evanina is one of those rare public servants, and I don't  think--as the chairman has pointed out, since he received unanimous  confirmation from the Intelligence Committee--that there is any  question about his service, any question about his temperament, any  question about his ability to do the job--no partisan challenges to  him, as the chairman has mentioned. He has served in his current  position for 3\1/2\ years.   We do him and other intelligence professionals a disservice when they  are arbitrarily held up for confirmation, not because of a substantive  issue that this individual may have performed or not performed but  because of a totally extraneous issue.   My intent today, along with the chairman, was to ask unanimous  consent that the Senate proceed to the Executive Calendar nomination,  getting Bill Evanina permanently confirmed to this job. He is an  individual who, if we are not careful and don't act on soon, may decide  to take his extraordinary professional skills and find much higher  remuneration in the private sector rather than serving our country.   I am not going to ask for that UC today in deference to one of our  colleagues who has lodged an objection to the nomination. It is my hope  that before the end of this session, the chairman and I will come to  the floor one more time and make this request.   I implore the Member who has a challenge against Mr. Evanina, again,  not based on his performance, not based on his politics, not based on  any professionalism he brings to this job--my hope is that the Member  will reflect and decide to remove this extraneous objection and allow  this great professional to be confirmed to a position he has already  served in for the last 3\1/2\ years.   I yield back.    Mr. President, I wholeheartedly support the nomination of  VADM Joseph Maguire to be the Director of the National Counterterrorism  Center, NCTC. Had I been able to cast my vote today, it would have been  to support this exceptional-nominee.   The Director of the NCTC is one of the most important positions in  the intelligence community, especially at this critical juncture in our  Nation's history. Admiral Maguire has a long and impressive record of  achievement and of service to his country, and I applaud his  willingness to once again return to public service after completing a  Navy career that spanned 36 years, including as the commander of Naval  Special Warfare Command.   The National Counterterrorism Center is the U.S. intelligence  community's premier organization for tracking and countering the  continuing threat from terrorism. Our country still has men and women  on the frontlines in the fight against extremist groups, and they must  get it right each hour of every day to ensure the safety and security  of their fellow Americans.   As Admiral Maguire and I have discussed, our counterterrorism  capabilities are greatly strengthened by our relationships with the  allies and partners with whom we have fought shoulder-to-shoulder since  September 11, 2001, in this struggle. This is why it is important for  the United States to hold onto and strengthen our traditional alliances  such as NATO-- and not to heedlessly undermine them.   I am satisfied by the ironclad commitments Admiral Maguire gave to  the Senate Intelligence Committee during his confirmation hearing to  ensuring that the men and women serving under him will always be  empowered to assess and analyze intelligence free from political  interference. He has also committed to present these assessments to  those in leadership positions free of any political considerations. In  short, he has committed to ``speak truth to power,'' and I expect him  to live up to these commitments.   This is especially important at a time when we have sometimes seen  those in power unjustifiably belittle and denigrate our Intelligence  Community and law enforcement agencies.   I trust that Admiral Maguire and those he leads at the NCTC will  continue to selflessly work day and night--whether on the 24/7 watch  floor or on the front lines, to protect the United States and our  allies from the terrorist threat. I salute him for stepping up to this  challenging task.                            ____________________
