 Mr. Speaker, like Mr. Westerman, I rise today to  recognize the heroic actions taken by 384th Bomb Group ball turret  gunner Jack Coleman Cook of Hot Springs, Arkansas, during a World War  II mission.   Selflessly, Sergeant Cook gave his life to save the life of his  fellow airmen, including my constituent, First Lieutenant Edward Field,  a veteran and poet from Brooklyn, New York. On February 3, 1945, in a  bombing mission over Berlin, Sergeant Cook showed us what true heroism  looks like.   After their B-17 bomber crashed into the North Sea, the crewmembers  were forced to inflate two life rafts. Unfortunately, only one raft was  able to fully inflate, leaving two men, Lieutenant Field and another  crewmember, in the frigid water.   After they had spent about 30 minutes in the water, Sergeant Cook  gave up his spot in the raft for Lieutenant Field, who had become numb.  Sergeant Cook then swam in the freezing water to the other raft, which  was only partially inflated. Unfortunately, he died before a British  vessel could come and rescue them.   In his poem, ``World War II,'' Lieutenant Field honored the  incredible sacrifice made by Sergeant Cook, recognizing that his  survival is entwined with the spirit born from another hero's  sacrifice.   It is my distinct honor today to commemorate the American heroes who  bravely served our country, in this case, Sergeant Jack Coleman Cook  and First Lieutenant Edward Field.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the proposed balanced budget  amendment to the Constitution. Specifically, the resolution prohibits  total outlays from exceeding total receipts for each fiscal year unless  a three-fifths supermajority of the whole membership of each House of  Congress votes to override the prohibition. The resolution also  requires a three-fifths supermajority of each House in order to raise  the Federal debt limit.   There are only two conclusions one can reach about this legislation.  Either it is fundamentally unserious--a facade designed to pretend that  Republicans, on the heels of a massive Republican tax giveaway to  corporations and the very rich that will increase the deficit by at  least $1.5 trillion over the next decade, have a shred of credibility  when it comes to claims of fiscal responsibility; or it is deadly  serious--the first step toward their ultimate goal of slashing Social  Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and other critical elements of the  social safety net--because you cannot have these enormous tax cuts and  balance the budget without slashing spending programs that most  Americans depend on.   Understand the context in which we are considering this legislation.  White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney recently admitted that the  Republican tax windfall for the rich would cost the Federal Government  $1.8 trillion in revenue over the next decade.   In the wake of their budget-busting tax scam, House Republicans have  the nerve to now seek to have us vote on this balanced budget amendment  because they want to maintain the illusion that they care about fiscal  responsibility. This is the height of hypocrisy.   But if we assume that Republicans actually intend to pass this  legislation, we should recognize the catastrophic consequences it would  have on senior citizens or the disabled and on low-income people. That  is because it would require radical spending cuts to achieve balance,  with the principal targets being social safety net programs like Social  Security, Medicare, and Medicaid that millions of Americans depend on.   I want to commend Mr. Goodlatte for his honesty. He has spent part of  his speech talking about how we have to cut entitlements.   What are the chief entitlements? Social Security, Medicare, and  Medicaid.   He talks about the lower percentage of expenditures that went for  entitlement programs years ago before Medicare and Medicaid were  enacted. Of course, we spend more on entitlements now that we have  Medicare and Medicaid.   But what is really causing deficits is not Medicare, Medicaid, and  Social Security. It is the Republican tax cuts. In the 1980s, when  Ronald Reagan was elected, the total Federal national debt from George  Washington through Jimmy Carter was under $800 billion. Then we had the  Reagan tax cuts, and when George Bush left office 12 years later, the  national debt had skyrocketed from $800 billion to $4.3 trillion. Then  we had President Clinton, a Democratic Congress, and Newt Gingrich, who  deserves some credit for it too, and we had 3 years of balanced budgets  in the late 1990s. In 2000, the projection was for $5.65 trillion  Federal surplus over the next 10 years.   Alan Greenspan, testifying in favor of the Bush tax cuts, said that  we have to pass these tax cuts because otherwise we will totally pay  off the national debt, and that is a bad thing for various reasons. So  we passed the Bush tax cuts--the Republicans did--and between that and  funding the Iraq and Afghanistan wars without a tax increase off the  credit card, we greatly increased the national debt again.   So the Democrats have come in and cleaned up the messes that  Republicans have left on the national debt by their huge tax cuts for  the rich, and now they tell us we can't afford Social Security,  Medicare, and Medicaid because we must keep these tax cuts for the rich  going.   This legislation would also undermine the Federal Government's  ability to respond to an economic crisis. When the Nation's economy  weakens, incomes of individuals and businesses decrease because of job  and business losses because of unemployment increasing, which in turn  automatically results in reduced tax revenues.   Meanwhile, spending on programs like unemployment insurance benefits  and food stamps automatically increases as more people lack jobs and  rely on unemployment benefits and food stamps to stay afloat. These  programs also help overcome a downward spiral in the economy as they  help stabilize the decline in consumer purchasing power and prevent a  recession from turning into a depression.   But by requiring a balanced budget, this constitutional amendment  would effectively prohibit the government from drawing on these  critical stabilizers.   Although the resolution allows Congress to override the amendment's  balanced budget mandate, it requires a nearly insurmountable three- fifths supermajority of the entire membership of the House in both  Houses. By the time Congress could react to an economic crisis, it  would have greatly delayed the stimulating effect of the stabilizers.  This legislation would almost guarantee that a recession would become a  depression. Meanwhile, millions of Americans who depend on these vital  programs for food, shelter, and rent would go without assistance.   In addition to making it harder to avoid an economic crisis, this  resolution could actually help to precipitate one. By requiring a  three-fifths supermajority vote of each House of Congress to raise the  debt limit, H.J. Res. 2 increases the probability that the government  will default on its obligations and cause the Nation to spiral into a  financial and economic crisis.   Beyond its devastating economic and social consequences, this  resolution is also anti-democratic. To the extent that it requires a  supermajority to undertake certain steps, such as waiving the balanced  budget requirement or raising the debt limit, it shifts power away from  the elected Representatives of a majority of the American people to a  determined minority that can thwart the majority's will.    Moreover, this bill inappropriately seeks to enshrine into the  Constitution one particular economic view that would bind future  generations and future Congresses that they elect.   Whatever anyone may think about economic policy and government  financing, those kinds of policies should be enacted as legislation  that can be modified, amended, or repealed by future majorities, not  enshrined in the Constitution to bind future generations to the  opinions of this generation. That is fundamentally undemocratic and  tyrannical.   Finally, this resolution suffers from a fundamental flaw to its  construction. There is no enforcement mechanism, and it is not clear  what would happen if Congress ignored it and passed an unbalanced  budget without the required supermajority. Presumably, it would somehow  be resolved in the Federal courts. We would see judges ordering tax  increases, or cuts in Social Security, or revising the transportation  budget, you name it, without any legislative guidance, and on what  basis they would make such decisions is anyone's guess.   We should not have judges determining inherently political questions  regarding budgetary decisions, upending the principle of separation of  powers and generating massive litigation over questions ranging from  who has the standing to sue, to what remedies a court can impose if it  found a violation.   This legislation is ill-conceived and deeply problematic. As I stated  earlier, this resolution is either a farce--just for show and a few  well-timed press releases--or it is a Trojan horse--an innocuous  looking resolution that is really designed to enable the long-held  Republican dream of dismantling Social Security, Medicare, and  Medicaid,  [[Page H3164]]  a goal they could never achieve politically but might achieve with a  constitutional amendment on the balanced budget. Either way, this  resolution is not worthy of this House.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.J. Res. 2, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Jeffries).
