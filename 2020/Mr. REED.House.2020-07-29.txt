 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, we agree. Families need access to childcare. It is key  to making America's recovery stronger. Childcare is an economic,  education, and public health issue that demands our full attention,  particularly now that millions of Americans want to return to work.   Unfortunately, this crisis has hit childcare providers across the  country especially hard. Many are facing an acute set of financial  challenges. We must address this problem in a bipartisan manner if we  are to ensure our Nation's children and the working families that  support them are not left behind during this crisis.   Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle today  have decided to throw bipartisanship out the window, knowing that by  doing so they are dooming their own legislation. They have once again  shut us out of the process and crafted a bill that is out of touch with  America's needs. This is no more than a copy-paste of various  Democratic childcare proposals superficially edited to link to the  pandemic.   This bill contains six childcare tax provisions that, combined, would  cost more than $100 billion. Simply throwing as much money as you can  at the problem with no thought into the actual policy itself won't  work. These provisions haven't been through our regular order in the  committee of jurisdiction. This package has not been the subject of a  single committee hearing, let alone, a committee markup.   It is abundantly clear, Democrats were so eager to achieve a  messaging victory, they felt they could skip the whole policymaking  process that is fundamental to how Congress is supposed to work. We  have been down this road before. In multiple States, the additional  childcare funding we have already provided through the CARES Act still  has not made its way down to childcare providers on the ground.   In my home State of New York, one of my constituents, Beth Starks,  testified in front of the New York State Assembly on childcare issues.  She highlighted that of the $164.6 million in Childcare Development  Block Grants for New York State, less than half have gone out to the  communities and providers who needed it yesterday.   Her testimony also underscores the negative impact State leaders,  like our Governor, have had by withholding Federal grants to families  and providers.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a copy of her testimony.  Testimony of Beth Starks, Founder and Executive Director of Chautauqua                           Lake Child Care Center  Before The NYS Assembly, Standing Committee on Small Business, Standing      Committee on Ways and Means, Standing Committee on Agriculture,   Standing Committee on Banks, Office of State-Federal Relations, Task                   Force on Food, Farm & Nutrition Policy         Good morning! Thank you for inviting me to testify today. I       am Beth Starks, the founder and Executive Director of       Chautauqua Lake Child Care Center.        I am a third-generation Early Childhood Educator and have       experience in everything from infant rooms all the way up       through higher education. I am proud to serve on both the       Governor's Early Childhood Advisory Council and the Child       Care Availability Task Force. I come to you today to speak       about child care as a small business. Below, in my written       testimony, you will find links to a lot of statistics and       additional information on the topics that I will be       discussing today.        I know that time is of the essence and I am making an       appeal to all of you. I come to you as the founder of a non-      profit child care center and a supporter of public education.       I come to you as a leader, a public servant and a voice for       children and families. Other small businesses, and families       need your help now by supporting childcare providers. Our       small businesses are especially strained right now when it       comes to their workforce. Workers need child care to do their       jobs. I implore you to ensure more decisive steps are taken       in NYS to assist families in paying for child care and to       safeguard the safety and health of child care providers and       the families they serve. We need you to ensure that New       York's child care providers are ready and able to play their       vital role in restarting the economy as we emerge from this       pandemic. In the past months, I have listened to our Governor       and to many other leaders talk about the reality of this       situation. We know this is a situation like no other, and       there was nothing we could have planned for. We are building       the plane as we fly it and we have true budgetary       constraints. I do understand that NYS has had the most cases       and the most deaths. The health and medical crisis and the       medical decisions needed to come first. I understand that the       decisions involving child care needed to come a little bit       later. Yet child care providers are essential and have been       on the front-line providing care for children of essential       workers so that they can do their jobs--as nurses, doctors,       law enforcement, and so on. Child care providers have allowed       essential workers to work every day knowing that their       children are healthy, safe and happy. I come to you today       frustrated, heartbroken, sad, exhausted, scared, discouraged       and so close to giving up. I am frustrated at the lack of       support, the lack of supplies and the lack of financial       resources. I am heartbroken. Heartbroken for the child care       facilities that have already closed, most never to reopen. I       am heartbroken for the mom of the 9-week-old who just started       in my care on Good Friday as she had to return to work as an       essential worker. I'm sad for the staff that I have lost, for       the parents crying in my office because they can't afford       child care. I am scared for my business of 14 years that I am       trying to keep afloat and I am scared for every child care       provider and for our industry. I am discouraged at the lack       of acknowledgement and awareness of the importance of Early       Childhood and the lack of investment in children.        First of all, I want all of you to understand that child       care is a business that supports all  [[Page H3916]]       other small businesses. We are an essential business that has       remained open throughout the COVID-19 emergency. By doing so,       we have allowed all other small businesses (as well as all       other industries) to remain open and now to re-open. So, all       of your medical providers, restaurant workers, hospital staff       and even farm workers have child care (& workers) thanks to       our centers. As mentioned by our previous speaker, a farm       needs workers in order to operate, there are child care       centers that specifically serve migrant workers. Child care       is an industry that is different from other small businesses       because we enable other small businesses to operate.        I chose to begin my verbal testimony by telling a few       stories. The things that I told included: why I started my       child care facility, the problems that child care had pre-      COVID and what we've gone through during this COVID-19       Pandemic. I founded my center as a non-profit 14 years ago       while I was working at SUNY Fredonia in the Education       Department. While I was there, I had my first son (who just       turned 16) and could not find child care for him. I brought       him with me to Fredonia every day and I found an incredible       in-home child care provider for him. Soon, I decided to stop       working at the college and became a licensed in-home child       care provider myself. In NYS, an in-home licensed day care       facility is also a small business and there are a lot of them       in WNY and across the state. After having my in-home facility       for two years, realizing the need for child care in Mayville       was so great, I then became incorporated and opened my       center. Chautauqua Lake Child Care Center (CLCCC) provides       care and education for over 100 children ages 6 weeks to 12       years. CLCCC is a non-profit child care center leasing space       inside Chautauqua Lake Central School. The partnership with       the public school allows families to drop off & pick up their       children all in one place. We provide full time care, part       time care, UPK, before school and after school programming as       well as a full day summer camp for school aged children. We       also employ 11 full time staff and 10-15 part time staff,       depending on the time of year.        I've also been a part of a lot of initiatives in our County       and across NYS. I serve on our Education Coalition here in       Chautauqua County where we focus on bringing together       educators & industries to meet the needs of the County. I       lead the K-readiness subgroup where we focus on young       children specifically. Our Education Coalition has had a lot       of efforts county-wide to try to support child care. We       started an initiative in the City of Dunkirk, as there are no       licensed child care centers in the City of Dunkirk.       Initially, Mayor Willie Rosas called together a Business       Roundtable, focused on child care. It was his most well       attended roundtable discussion, which demonstrates the need       for child care in the area. Our County Executive at the time,       George Borrello, now a NYS Senator, made child care a county-      wide priority. He recognized how important child care is as       an industry and how interconnected it is to businesses and       economic development. Last year, then-County Executive       Borrello (in collaboration with the City of Dunkirk, private       sector business, the County Chamber, and the County Planning       office and also with the help and support of Assemblyman       Andrew Goodell) was able to apply for some funding through       the Governor's Workforce Development Initiative/Economic       Development Council to work on obtaining additional funding       for child care. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in       obtaining funding, even though it was greatly needed. My       point is that child care was in a crisis situation here,       preventing people from going to work, pre-COVID. We are in       what's called a child care desert because there isn't enough       child care here in Chautauqua County (or in much of NYS).       According to the Center for American Progress, 64 percent of       New Yorkers lived in a child care desert (before the       Pandemic), which means that there are more than 50 children       under the age of 5 in a census tract that contains either no       child care providers or so few options that there are more       than three times as many children as licensed child care       slots.        The past 3 months, the situation has gotten much worse.       Over 50% of my colleagues in Chautauqua County have closed       their doors. Nationally, it is estimated that about \1/2\ of       them will never open again. We cannot re-open our county or       NY without child care because there is nowhere for children       to go and that includes children from infants all the way up       through the teenage years.        We're an industry that needs financial support. My       colleagues will tell you that they stayed open during COVID       because it was what was right for children and families. I       will tell you that we all made poor business decisions       because we operated our businesses by leading with our       hearts, instead of making financially-based decisions. We are       all fulfilling our mission in serving children and families.       We remained open serving on the front lines, but every single       day we are open we continue to lose money and there is very       little support. I was fortunate enough to be able to get the       PPP (Paycheck Protection Plan) and I will tell you my story       in being able to do so. I had to find the only lender in       Chautauqua County that was able to allow me to apply for a       PPP loan; there was only one. I searched all weekend to find       the lender and it was KeyBank. The manager let me call her on       a Sunday and come to meet with her first thing on a Monday       morning to open an account with her. None of the other       lenders would let me apply and/or open an account with them.       Once I was able to open an account, we were able to apply for       the PPP and were thankfully approved. If you look at child       care centers statewide, I was told that only 10% received the       PPP, and that's just for the centers. None of the in-home       providers were eligible because they are sole proprietors.       So, the PPP money has only helped a few of us. The EIDL       (Economic Injury Disaster Loan) money I was able to apply       for, but I was denied. I don't know the rationale behind it,       but we just received the email that told us we were not       eligible for that funding. As far as federal funding, there       was CARES Act money that was set aside for child care       federally and we were really excited because we were told we       would receive $164.6 million in NYS specifically for child       care, but we have yet to receive that funding. Of that $164.6       million in CARES funding, only $30 million was allocated, $20       million was designated for scholarships for families (the       scholarship only assists families making up to 300% of the       poverty level and luckily in Chautauqua County we were       already serving that population. So, very few families here       were able to take advantage of this money.) and $8 million       for supplies. We are so thankful for the supplies, which just       came this past Saturday. Beyond that there has been no help       directly to child care facilities. The biggest need is purely       financial. We need working capital. Most of the remaining       providers in Chautauqua County literally have weeks left       until they too close their doors.        We cannot look at supporting childcare as a ``subsidy''. It       is truly an investment in economic development and       infrastructure. We cannot rebuild our economy without an       investment in something as critical as childcare.        In closing, I will tell you that there are also bright       spots. In the beginning, I spoke about feeling frustrated,       heartbroken, exhausted, scared, discouraged and so close to       giving up. Well, I also come to you energized, inspired,       hopeful and encouraged and determined to never to give up. I       am energized by my insightful colleagues, in my community,       across the state and across the nation. I am energized by my       staff who are incredible and dedicated and selfless. I am       energized by my students who are the future educators. I am       inspired by my community coming together in a way that it       never has and bridging divides. I am hopeful for our future       and a chance to fix all of this. I am encouraged by the hard-      working families, the families struggling to go to work every       day to provide the best opportunities for their children. I       am encouraged by the child I sat with yesterday talking about       the people he loves and I am encouraged with the knowledge       that he is healthy, happy and safe in our care.        This issue to me is not political. It is very much       bipartisan and I believe that we have to all come together to       support children and families. In doing so, we support our       economic infrastructure and the future of our state. If we       aren't making decisions based on what is best for our       youngest citizens, then we are doing a disservice to our       entire population.        So, I offer to you my assistance as part of the solution. I       trust your leadership. I trust your judgement. Families and       providers need to be heard. They need your support and they       need it now. I recognize the need for funding and the CARES       Act allows emergency federal funds to be used to provide       child care to the essential worker keeping us safe and to       every other worker trying to go back to work. We need to       follow the lead of many other states around the country and       use that funding immediately to assist families and       providers. We need additional funding for child care in the       next round of CARES relief from the federal government. There       are also so many other sources of funding that could be used       for child care in our state. We need to do innovative things       like use FEMA dollars, community development block grant       funds, and economic development money to invest in child       care. We have to try to find other funding sources and make       NYS the leader in early childhood education during this time       and in the future.        I will always believe every challenge is an opportunity and       we have the opportunity now to do the right thing for our       current workforce and for our state's youngest citizens, our       future.        Thank you for your time.     Madam Speaker, up until now, Republicans and Democrats have  consistently worked together to provide additional support for  childcare. Again, this is an issue we fundamentally all agree on.   On the Committee on Ways and Means, we have demonstrated time and  time again our commitment to improving access to high quality  childcare. That is why we are disappointed today. Today's vote is a  wasted opportunity.   I started today by saying we all care deeply about childcare. As  COVID continues to disrupt American life, that focus has only grown. As  co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus, I can tell you we are committed  to reaching across the aisle and actively looking for issues where we  can come together to find common ground.   Leader McCarthy has further made clear his support for prioritizing  childcare as part of COVID relief and more than 40 Republican Members,  including myself, echoed that support in a letter to leadership.  [[Page H3917]]    In addition, Republicans have introduced a number of bills that  include smart provisions, such as the bills introduced by my  colleagues, Representative Walorski of Indiana and Mr. Wenstrup of  Ohio.   Earlier this week, we led the introduction of a bill called the Back  to Work Child Care Grants Act of 2020 to support working families,  advance our Nation's economic recovery, and help those parents who want  to go back to work. The bill provides a framework for childcare  providers to access the resources they need to reopen and stay open. We  are proud that we were able to make this bill bipartisan because we  care about getting results, not headlines.   Thanks to the leadership of folks like Senator Ernst and Senator  Alexander in the U.S. Senate, this proposal has a real chance of moving  forward.   Clearly, there is some common ground and shared goals among us, but  Democrats have skipped regular order and any semblance of meaningful  bipartisan discussion and compromise. There is an important role for  Congress to play in alleviating the economic stress COVID has placed on  American families. To the reasonable Members of my colleagues across  the aisle, come work with us. Our door is always open. Until you do,  Congress will continue to waste these good opportunities of good will  to bring the American people together.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the great gentleman  from Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Wenstrup).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1330     Madam Speaker, I am ready to close.    Madam Speaker, I would inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, to restart the economy in the wake of COVID-19,  parents will need sufficient childcare to return to the workplace. A  lack of childcare options could keep parents from returning to work or  could force parents to cut back the amount of time spent at work.  Either of these scenarios would cripple our households' finances and a  healthy economic recovery.   New requirements for childcare providers in schools, including  smaller class sizes, enhanced cleaning requirements, new and likely  evolving teacher education on new protocols, and liability risks, will  also increase costs. Policy interventions are needed to increase both  the supply of affordable childcare and working families' demand for  childcare.   As you have heard from my colleagues here today, Republicans share  concerns about the impact of the pandemic on the childcare industry and  lives of working families across the country.   We have bipartisan, feasible, commonsense solutions to address this  problem. Whether it is tax relief for families and businesses to  purchase childcare or additional support to keep existing childcare  providers in business, our solutions would have an immediate impact on  the industry and parents.   Successful childcare solutions have received bipartisan support in  the past, and they will moving forward. It is a shame we can cooperate  in good times but not in the midst of a global pandemic. Our families  and children deserve better.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge all my colleagues to oppose this bill,  and let's come together to pass a bill that will help the American  people in a true bipartisan fashion.   Madam Speaker, I yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Neal).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
