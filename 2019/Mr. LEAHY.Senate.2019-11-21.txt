 Mr. President, I will be brief.   I agree with the distinguished senior Senator from Alabama. The Paul  amendment imposes a 1-percent across-the-board cut over last year's  funding level to the vast majority of discretionary spending for the  duration of the CR.   I hope all Members--Republican and Democratic alike--will oppose it  because it would mean arbitrary cuts in defense and other national  security programs, cuts to veterans' healthcare, education, childcare,  opioid programs, just to name a few. It is a simplistic tool that  ignores the complexities of our Federal budget. It is not a way we  should govern.   We have the hard work of making hard choices to fund programs each  year based on reality. That is what we should do. That is what the  American people deserve.   I support increased investment in our Nation's infrastructure. I  would be happy to work with Senator Paul to ensure these programs  receive the resources they require.   I hope he might be able to get some support from the Trump  administration, which has consistently proposed cutting resources to  improve our Nation's infrastructure. I hope he might be able to get  that kind of support, but funding it through an across-the-board cut on  all other programs, including veterans healthcare, national security,  and education programs is irresponsible. It is not the answer.    Mr. President, I have spoken previously about the alarming  rates of corruption, violent crime, and impunity in Honduras. While  Honduras is by no means unique in this regard, it is a serious concern  given the challenges it poses not only for the people of Honduras but  also for the United States.   Every week, my office receives word of another assassination in  Honduras of a social leader, environmental activist, indigenous rights  activist, journalist, or trade unionist. Rarely does a week go by that  we do not hear about threats against these individuals. Rarely does a  week go by that we do not receive reports of arbitrary and prolonged  imprisonment of critics of government policies or practices. While the  murder of Berta Caceres on March 3, 2016, captured the world's  attention, that outrageous crime was but one of many targeted killings  of Hondurans  [[Page S6748]]  who have dared to protest against corruption, infrastructure  development that threatens their land, water, farms and communities,  excessive force by the military and police, and the lack of access to  justice.   These types of crimes are nothing new in Honduras; in fact, they are  shockingly common. But they have noticeably increased in frequency  since the conviction in a New York Federal court on October 18 of Tony  Hernandez, a notorious drug kingpin and the brother of President Juan  Orlando Hernandez who was named as an unindicted coconspirator. It begs  credulity that President Hernandez was completely unaware of the  actions of his brother or of the reported use of profits from drug  trafficking to finance his political campaign. Honduras, which was  already among the most corrupt and dangerous countries in the world for  those who have dared to challenge the dominance of a tiny elite who  continue to wield unbridled control over the political and economic  levers of the country, has become even more corrupt and dangerous.   Ever since President Hernandez successfully orchestrated his  reelection to an unprecedented second term, the country has become  increasingly polarized. Social and political dissent, when the  government's consistent response is to use force--including lethal  force--and to misuse the judicial process to silence its critics, fuels  instability and violence which are among the key drivers of migration.  This is what we are seeing in Honduras, and the United States shares  some of the blame as our Embassy and the Department of Defense continue  to publicly portray their engagement with the Hernandez Government as  business as usual.   There is only one person who has the authority and responsibility to  lead Honduras down a better path, a path toward real stability and a  culture of lawfulness, and that is President Hernandez. The election of  his successor is only 2 years away. In the time remaining, President  Hernandez could use what credibility he has left and take decisive  action to begin a process of reconciliation aimed at uniting the  Honduran people in pursuit of the common goals of economic opportunity,  personal security, and justice. Doing so would require a fundamental  change of attitude and approach, including installing people in key  positions of government who have unimpeachable integrity and who  represent a wide spectrum of Honduran society.   Absent such enlightened leadership, Honduras will likely remain a  fractured society, plagued by instability, rampant poverty, violence,  and impunity. Honduras's democratic institutions will continue to be  corrupted and eroded, and Hondurans will continue to seek a better,  safer life outside their country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I vividly recall the feeling of optimism  that people in this country and around the world felt on that day in  Washington in 1993 when Israeli Prime Minister Rabin and PLO Chairman  Arafat signed the Oslo Accords. For those too young to remember, the  Oslo process began as secret negotiations in Oslo, resulting in the  recognition by the PLO of the State of Israel and the recognition by  Israel of the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people for  the purpose of direct negotiations between the two parties. The Oslo  Accords marked the formal start of that process, which aimed at  achieving a peace treaty based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242  and 338 and at fulfilling the ``right of the Palestinian people to  self-determination.''   The negotiations were to focus on resolving the key issues in  dispute: Israeli settlements, the status of Jerusalem, Israel's  military presence in and control over remaining territories after  Israel's recognition of Palestinian autonomy, and the return of  Palestinian refugees. It was hoped and believed that the signing of the  Oslo Accords was the beginning of the end of the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict and of a process that would culminate in a two-state solution  with secure borders for both Israel and a new Palestinian state.   Since then, virtually nothing has occurred as envisioned. Prime  Minister Rabin, a visionary leader whom I knew and greatly respected,  was assassinated by a Jewish extremist. Over the years, time after  time, the hopes and aspirations of Israelis and Palestinians have been  dashed. Israelis have suffered countless deadly attacks by Hamas and by  other Palestinian extremists. The Palestinians have suffered countless  humiliations and assassinations. But despite the many setbacks, missed  opportunities, and failures of leadership on both sides, I have never  felt that the Oslo process was a lost cause--until today. Today, I feel  a greater sense of sorrow and discouragement about that once hopeful  vision than I ever have before.   On Monday, Secretary of State Pompeo announced that the  administration no longer considers Israeli settlements to be contrary  to international law, thereby reversing a longstanding U.S. position  that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal. That position  was based on adherence to international law and UN Security Council  resolutions and was embraced by both Democratic and Republican  administrations. Upon learning of this change of position, I could not  help but feel that it signified the demise of the Oslo Accords. After  so many similar reversals of U.S. positions by this White House on key  issues that both sides had pledged would be resolved only through  negotiations, it seems beyond dispute that President Trump never  believed in a two-state solution.   In fact, this White House has been consistently disingenuous about  its intentions in the Middle East, all the time talking about wanting a  political settlement but acting in ways that put it increasingly out of  reach. It was just a matter of time before they abandoned any pretext  of supporting the principle that territorial disputes should be  resolved through dialogue. Every step of the way, administration  officials have insisted on the myth that they are improving the  prospects for peace, but 3 years later, Israelis and Palestinians are  farther from that goal than at any time since 1993. The White House,  with the support and encouragement of the U.S. Ambassador and the  Secretary of State, has done whatever it could to ensure that the West  Bank, home to nearly 3 million Palestinians, is occupied permanently or  annexed by Israel.   Without a change of leadership with the necessary vision and  political courage in the United States and in Israel, the Palestinians  will remain as second-class citizens, subjected to a lifetime of  indignities and entitled to only limited rights. I cannot help but  wonder what my friend Prime Minister Rabin would be thinking today and  how he would react to this announcement. I suspect he would be as  disappointed as I am that his courageous act more than a quarter  century ago, and the opportunity that act offered for lasting peace for  both Israelis and Palestinians, has been so selfishly and recklessly  squandered.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
