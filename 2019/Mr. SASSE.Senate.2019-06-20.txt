 Mr. President, we are just a few days away from the first  official Democratic Presidential debate of the campaign season in  Miami, but for anyone paying close attention, the first meaningful  debate is actually about only 48 hours away in South Carolina.   On Saturday, 11 Democrats, including 4 of the top 5 in the current  polls, are going to take part in a candidate forum hosted by the  Planned Parenthood Action Fund.   What is Planned Parenthood? Planned Parenthood is the country's  largest abortion business. That is their mainstay of operation. Last  year, Planned Parenthood reported committing more than 330,000  abortions--somewhere between one-third and one-half of all abortions  committed in America last year. Planned Parenthood's president has said  that providing, protecting, and expanding access to abortion is part of  the organization's ``core mission.'' It does this work with the help of  more than $500 million in annual subsidies from the Federal Government;  that is, from taxpayers across this country, many of whom believe that  abortion is immoral. Yet the position of Planned Parenthood is and has  long been abortion at any time, anywhere, for any reason for free. That  used to represent the most extreme position anywhere in the Democratic  Party. It was shared by only a very small, hard-fringe portion of its  elected leaders.    Just to review some history, in 2008, Hillary Clinton was still  calling for safe, legal, and rare abortion access, and as she would  regularly emphasize, ``by rare, I mean rare.'' Yet, today, the radical  things that the Nation's largest abortion business wants are basically  indistinguishable from the position of every Democrat who is now  running for President--abortion at any time, anywhere, for any reason  for free.   In fact, it is actually worse than this because the position of every  Senator who is currently running for the Democratic nomination and of  at least one Governor is that a living, breathing baby who survives an  abortion procedure can still be left to die after birth. All seven  Senators who are currently running for the Democratic Presidential  nomination voted against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection  Act earlier this year, and Governor Bullock of Montana vetoed a State- level version of that bill just before he entered the race.   As things currently stand, it is entirely possible that the next  Democratic nominee for the highest office in our land will be publicly  agnostic about the moral status of post-abortion infanticide--morally  agnostic about post-abortion infanticide.   Let's be clear. These candidates are wildly and spectacularly out of  the mainstream in American life. Over the last two decades, Gallup  polling has consistently shown that a majority of Americans are opposed  to unrestricted abortion access beyond the first trimester. The Gallup  numbers actually show that well under one-third of Americans support  abortion beyond the first 3 months, and a new NBC/PBS/Marist poll finds  that fully four out of five Americans are opposed to all abortion in  the third trimester. That includes a majority of self-identifying pro- choice voters. I want to say that again. A majority of self-identified  pro-choice voters in America are opposed to abortion in the third  trimester. So the polling of Americans is actually quite different than  what the Democrats are going to pretend it to be over the next 2 days  when they talk into their echo chamber.   What is even more important than anything about public opinion is  that the Democrats are also out of step with our fundamental American  conviction that all men are created equal--all men and women and  babies. Instead, they are increasingly committed to the proposition  that some people are less than human and are, therefore, disposable.  Sadly, though, the most radical leftwing voices are winning in their  party's echo chamber, and Democratic candidates have now decided that  they must prostrate themselves before the ``flush with cash'' abortion  industry. This has consequences well beyond policy. As Democrats'  abortion positions have become more extreme, they have no longer sought  to even persuade fellow citizens with whom they disagree. Rather, they  have become openly hostile to Americans who disagree on this great  moral challenge.   My colleague from New York, for instance, Senator Gillibrand, who  will be attending this weekend's forum in South Carolina, made her  feelings clear earlier this month in an interview with the Des Moines  Register. In promising that she would appoint only judges who would  uphold Roe v. Wade, here is what she said. Listen to this quote:         I think there [are] some issues that have such moral       clarity that we have as a society decided that the other side       is not acceptable.        Imagine saying that it's OK to appoint a judge who is       racist or anti-Semitic or homophobic.        [This is not an issue where] there is a fair ``other       side.'' There is no moral equivalency when you come to       racism, and I do not believe there is a moral equivalency       when it comes to changing laws that deny women reproductive       freedom.    What? What are we talking about here? Are you kidding me? Did you  catch what she just said?   According to a sitting U.S. Senator and a candidate for the  Democratic nomination to be President of the United States, holding  pro-life views in America is no longer acceptable. It is not a fair  position, she tells us. It is the moral equivalency of racism or anti- Semitism. Perhaps in the Senator's next interview she will suggest that  pro-life Americans belong in a basket of deplorables.   There is so much wrong with this statement that it is difficult to  know where to begin. We could note the plain, simple fact that it is  not pro-lifers who have an ugly link to racism. Rather, since the very  beginning, the American abortion industry has been intimately connected  to eugenics. This is the origin of the movement.   As Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger put it herself--and  think about this quote--``the unbalance between the birth rate of the  `unfit' and  [[Page S4154]]  the `fit' [is] the greatest present menace to civilization.''   Sanger's racial opinions are a matter of some dispute, but this part  is clear--that she intentionally targeted efforts at Black  neighborhoods in Harlem and in the Deep South. Many of the people  involved in her efforts took things a step further--going so far as to  forcibly sterilize African-American women whom they deemed to be unfit  to procreate.   We can also note that it is, in part, because of this ugly history  that, today, Black women in America are 3\1/2\ times more likely to  have abortions than White women, and in some parts of Senator  Gillibrand's home State, Black children are actually more likely to be  aborted than to be carried to term.    We could also point to the continued eugenic use of abortion--for  example, to kill children who have nonlife-threatening diseases. In the  United States today, two-thirds of all babies in the womb who are found  to have Down syndrome are aborted, and in some parts of Europe, the  rate is pushing 100 percent. There are public ad campaigns in two  nations in Europe that celebrate the fact that they have gotten rid of  all of their Down syndrome babies.   Instead of going point by point, I will just recommend that anyone  who wants to better understand this disturbing history read Justice  Clarence Thomas's concurring opinion last month in Box v. Planned  Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky. Yet, according to my Senate  colleague, perhaps Justice Thomas is one of those racists--you know,  one of those notorious pro-life racists who is stalking America.   In their leftward lurch to become the Planned Parenthood candidate,  it is not just that the Democrats who seek this office are losing touch  with where Americans actually are on the hard questions of abortion or  with our fundamental American convictions, it is also, as my colleague  from the State of New York has shown, that we are losing touch with  even how to do politics like Americans, where you respect the dignity  of people you differ with and argue about the ideas. You don't declare  them an unfit and an unworthy, unacceptable other side. Americans have  always had a genius for talking to each other. In our constitutional  system, we set up debate fora like this to be able to facilitate,  channel, and elevate debate--even heated, feverish debate about really  sensitive topics.   Our Framers held firmly to the principle that men and women in their  exercise of reason could come to agreements by persuasion and by  dialogue even if it took a long time and even if the topics were  difficult. Anything less than that would be a violation of the basic  dignity of our fellow citizens. Our Founders knew that hard political  issues should not be resolved at gunpoint; they should be resolved by  debate, which starts by assuming the dignity of your counterparty in  that debate.   We are watching that conviction go by the wayside right now.  Slandering pro-life Americans as being, in effect, Klan members and  Nazis is just a way to crush debate, not to persuade. It is a way of  saying that these people--people like my mom, who prays outside  abortion clinics; people like my daughters and my wife, who have spent  a lot of hours volunteering at crisis pregnancy centers; and people  like the overwhelming majority of Nebraskans, whom I get to represent,  or Indianans, whom the Presiding Officer now gets to represent--are so  morally repugnant that they don't deserve a voice, that they don't  deserve to be treated like human beings, that they don't deserve to be  engaged in debate, that they are not people you could possibly have a  reasonable conversation with.   This is crazy talk.   It is not difficult to imagine where this approach leads. When we  lose sight of the intrinsic and inexhaustible dignity of unborn  children, we open the door to abortion's violence, and when we lose  sight of the dignity of our fellow citizens in debate, we open the door  to yet other kinds of violence.   I have spent a lot of time with pro-lifers in my life, probably a lot  more time than most of my colleagues who are going to be at the Planned  Parenthood debate in South Carolina on Saturday. I will tell you what  you will not find among these people is partisan caricature. What you  will find are people who are passionately devoted to the dignity of  every human being no matter how small or how vulnerable or what disease  one might have been diagnosed with. You will find a lot of Americans,  young and old, in the pro-life movement who care deeply about women who  are in need. You will also find a lot of enthusiasm for promising in  vitro surgeries and for scientific developments in ultrasound and  neonatal technology. You will find fellow citizens who are ready to  advance the basic American commitment to life through the tools of  dialogue, persuasion, and respect.   The dehumanization of our friends and neighbors, whether they are in  the opposite party or in the womb, destroys our national life together  and our national conversation. On both sides, we need to be constantly  stitching back together that fabric that has been torn asunder.   I suggest to the Democrats who are heading to the South Carolina  debate this weekend to spend less time wrestling with each other in  order to say more ridiculously extreme, clickbait things for high- propensity primary voters and spend more time listening to the voices  of their pro-life fellow citizens. My guess is they will learn  something, and our national debate will be the better for it.   Thank you.
