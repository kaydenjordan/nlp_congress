 Mr. Speaker, last month, there were two mass  shootings in my district, one in Farmington and another in Red River.   On Friday, I met with police officers, victims, and neighbors who  were terrified and wounded. An 18-year-old used an assault rifle and  several other guns to kill three beautiful souls and injure six,  including two police officers.   I sat with the victims and listened to their stories of horror and  pain. There were 144 bullets fired before the shooter even left his  front yard. One neighbor held my shoulders as he shared, from a place  of unbearable pain, what it sounds like when a powerful weapon  discharges and you see your neighbor bleeding to death on the street.   We know that the trauma of gun violence extends beyond those killed  or injured. That is why my constituents and Americans are pleading with  Congress to do what we can to prevent gun violence.   What happens, though? What do we come back to? Instead of addressing  gun violence, Republicans stand with the gun lobby to make it easier to  evade gun safety laws.   When it became obvious that gun manufacturers were selling powerful  pistols and then selling shoulder braces to turn them into rifles, the  Trump administration began work on a regulation to treat these  constructed rifles as the powerful weapons they are. The Biden  administration finished the job.                                time  1330    Gun manufacturers and sellers are using a loophole to avoid public  safety protections. This is how gun salesmen are describing the  loophole: ``It might look and function like a rifle, but thanks to the  fact that AR-15 pistols don't come built with a stock, they're legally  classified as pistols, giving them a full pardon from inconvenient NFA  restrictions.''   Listen, if it looks like a rifle, shoots like a rifle, and kills like  a rifle, we should treat it like a rifle. That is common sense, but  sometimes common sense isn't that common in the House these days.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand with the victims, to stand  with the people, and put people over the profits of the gun lobby.
