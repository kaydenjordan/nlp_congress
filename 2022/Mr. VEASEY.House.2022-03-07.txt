 Madam Speaker, I rise today to stand in solidarity with  Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas, and stand against anti- Semitism and other forms of religious bigotry.   On January 15 of this year, Congregation Beth Israel, in our North  Texas area, endured a preplanned terrorist attack with the explicit  purpose of targeting Jews.   This attack was personal to me, because I know the rabbi of that  congregation, Charlie Cytron-Walker, and his wife, Adena, very well. I  met them when they first moved to the North Texas area.   That is why I am here today, because no community should have to  endure that type of attack while they are trying to worship. It doesn't  matter what religion they happen to be. It has absolutely no place in  our houses of worship.   Tomorrow, in the House, we will vote on a bipartisan resolution that  my fellow colleague from North Texas, Beth Van Duyne, and I are  leading. This resolution condemns the actions taken in Colleyville in  January and underscores our commitment to fighting anti-Semitism. I ask  everybody to support it, because we must root out hate.                            ____________________
