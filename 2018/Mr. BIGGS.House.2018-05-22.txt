 Mr. Speaker, before giving my remarks, I include in the  Record a statement by Senator Johnson explaining the intent of S. 204.                      Statement of Legislative Intent       (By Sen. Ron Johnson on S. 204 (as considered by the House of                             Representatives))         In a recent article about pending right to try legislation,       FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb was quoted as saying: ``In       terms of making sure that it balances [access to experimental       drugs] against appropriate patient protections . . . with [S.       204], we'd have to do a little bit more . . . in guidance and       perhaps in regulation to achieve some of those goals, and I       think those are the goals that Congress wants us to       achieve.'' The article went on to quote Commissioner Gottlieb       as saying: ``We felt that there were certain aspects of [S.       204] that could be modified to build in additional patient       protections, but if you weren't able to do that       legislatively, that there [was] a pathway by which you do       that administratively and still remain consistent with the       letter and the spirit of this law.''        In response to this article, Commissioner Gottlieb tweeted       the ``FDA . . . stands ready to implement [right to try] in a       way consistent with the intent of Congress.''        As S. 204's primary author and lead sponsor, I want to make       this legislation's intent absolutely clear and remove any       ambiguity that the FDA could use to implement right to try in       a way contrary to its aim.        S. 204, as originally introduced, applied to patients       ``with a terminal illness,'' as defined by State law. In       discussion with the FDA, the agency suggested it would prefer       a uniform federal definition, especially one that already       existed in federal statute or regulation, because an existing       federal definition would facilitate implementation of the       law. The FDA suggested defining terminal illness as an       ``immediately life-threatening disease or condition.'' The       FDA disclosed that its suggested definition would exclude,       for example, patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy--an       illness explicitly intended to be covered by the legislation.        To be clear, I rejected this proposed definition because I       believed it would inappropriately exclude patients with       certain diseases from accessing treatments. By contrast, the       legislation instead defines terminal illness as ``life-      threatening disease or condition'' (which exists in current       federal regulation), which the FDA confirmed would include       patients diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.        Contrary to the preference of FDA official Dr. Janet       Woodcock, who expressed the FDA's desire to draft the       legislation ``to make sure we don't include patients we (the       FDA) doesn't intend to include,'' I replied and rejected that       notion by stating my intent was completely opposite hers:        ``I wanted to make sure we didn't exclude any one we didn't       intend to exclude.'' My aim from the beginning was to be as       inclusive as possible such that as many patients as possible       who are facing no available alternatives could potentially       qualify.        S. 204 is fundamentally about empowering terminally-ill       patients and their doctors who, together with the cooperation       of the developers of potentially life-saving therapies,       should be in charge of making a determination about their own       course of treatment. The bill is not intended to further       empower any federal agency, including the FDA, to limit in       any way the ability of an individual facing a life-      threatening disease or condition from accessing treatment. S.       204 is about preserving a right to hope and about expanding       individual freedom. It is not meant to empower the FDA to       limit the right to hope by regulation or guidance.        S. 204 includes a provision ensuring the Secretary may not       use a clinical outcome associated with the use of an eligible       investigational drug to delay or adversely affect review or       approval of the drugs, unless use of such clinical outcome is       critical to determining safety. This language is in no way       intended to enable the FDA to expand the scope of existing       safety determinations regarding investigational drugs.        S. 204 requires, in certain circumstances, that an eligible       investigational drug be under investigation in a clinical       trial that is intended to form the primary basis of a claim       of effectiveness in support of approval or licensure.       According to the FDA, this language simply incorporates the       standard definition of a clinical trial. This language is not       in any way intended to enable the FDA to exclude any clinical       trial as a basis for precluding access to treatments under       right to try.     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Right  to Try Act and on behalf of the patients who are fighting each and  every day to try to save their own lives.   It has been a long ride, but we are in sight of our destination.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a brief moment to thank my friend  and colleague, Representative Fitzpatrick, for working with me on this  cause from the moment we both entered office last year, and to extend  my appreciation to Senator Johnson, whose efforts on behalf of right to  try have been extraordinary.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank Chairman Walden for his efforts and the  leadership of President Trump and Vice President Pence.   Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge and thank my predecessor, Congressman Matt  Salmon, for his tireless efforts to pass right to try.   But it is the patients themselves and their tireless advocates who  deserve the most recognition. I have said this before and I will  continue to say it: when the Right to Try Act passes this Chamber and  is signed into law by the President, it will be them, not us, who  deserve the most credit for this remarkable victory.   Everyone here has heard me speak about the Right to Try Act more than  a few times already and everyone here is aware of the widespread  support that this legislation has garnered. Forty States have already  passed right-to-try legislation, often with unanimous or overwhelming  support from Republicans and Democrats alike.   If we can't come together to support a commonsense cause such as this  one, I am not sure what effort we can unite behind.  [[Page H4361]]    Those on the other side of this debate--and they are a shrinking  minority--argue that this legislation is unnecessary. Well, if it is so  unnecessary, why do I receive phone calls and letters from patients  each week urging me to do everything in my power to get this  legislation passed?   I have no doubt the FDA's expanded access program helps patients, but  I also know that the agency's personnel, including Director Gottlieb  himself, want to help as many patients as possible, but their efforts  simply are not enough.   The Right to Try Act doesn't eliminate the expanded access program.  Far from it. We are merely providing another, more direct avenue for  patients to acquire potentially lifesaving medications from  pharmaceutical companies that don't require them to ask permission from  a bureaucratic middleman.   Another argument I hear from the naysayers, one that makes me angry,  is that we are peddling false hope. False hope? What is that?    Mr. Speaker, to this tired argument, I respond that there  is no such thing as false hope. You either have hope or you don't.   I, for one, want those brave men and women who are fighting every day  against terrible illnesses and almost insurmountable odds to have a  choice, even if it is the last choice many of them will ever have the  opportunity to make. I trust them to weigh the pros and cons and choose  for themselves whether they wish to take a risk to try to save their  own lives.   Make no mistake: it is a choice. We are not offering a mandate,  merely an option.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  legislation.
