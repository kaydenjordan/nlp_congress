 Mr. Speaker, during my first term in Congress, I had the  opportunity to join Habitat for Humanity on one of their builds back in  Oakland County, Michigan. It was a lot of fun and time well spent.   Earlier this year, I met with Habitat and heard about their struggle  to provide affordable homes under the regulations imposed by Dodd- Frank. Habitat for Humanity relies on the generosity of so many: not  just volunteers who build the home or donate to their cause, but those  who provide professional services free of charge.   Of course a home needs to be appraised before a loan is approved, and  many times professional appraisers volunteer their services. Under  Dodd-Frank, however, that is not allowed. Dodd-Frank mandates that  appraisers receive customary and reasonable compensation for their  services. This means Habitat can no longer accept donated services. In  fact, Habitat told me that the complex Dodd-Frank rules have tripled  the cost of loans.   That is why I introduced the HOME Act; and I urge my colleagues to  support the act, as it is part of the CHOICE Act we are considering  later today. Let's make sure Habitat can continue its important  mission.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, one of the consequences of the financial  crisis is the government had to step in with taxpayer dollars and bail  out the financial industry.   Once Dodd-Frank was enacted, however, we were told: Don't worry.  There will never be another bailout. Rest assured, the orderly  liquidation authority under title II will give the FDIC all the tools  it needs to resolve a failed financial institution.   Indeed, title II does give the FDIC the ability to borrow from the  Treasury all of the taxpayer dollars it needs to reorganize a failed  financial institution. That kind of sounds like a bailout to me.   The Financial CHOICE Act truly ends the risk of taxpayer-funded  bailout. Under the Financial CHOICE Act, a failed bank will go through  bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a tested, transparent process. Judges sitting  in open court instead of unelected bureaucrats sitting behind closed  doors will make consistent, predictable decisions based on decades of  case law.   More importantly, bankruptcy puts the risk of failure on the bank's  shareholders and creditors, not the taxpayers.   I urge my colleagues to support the Financial CHOICE Act, and truly  put an end to the possibility of yet another taxpayer-funded bailout.                                time  1415
