 Mr. Speaker, Keith Nolan's dream was to be a military  officer. He excelled at the first two levels of Army ROTC and was  preparing to take the next step when he was told that he could not  continue because he failed the hearing portion of a military medical  exam.   This is not at all surprising, because Keith Nolan is deaf. The  United States does not allow the deaf community to serve in the  military, unlike other nations that allow deaf citizens to serve.   Despite Keith's passion and despite our attempts to establish a  demonstration program to prove that the deaf community is entirely  capable of contributing to our military, Keith does not have the  opportunity to serve his country.   Today, I am mourning for Keith and for the country, which lost out on  his service. But I want to celebrate his passion and his dedication to  expanding civil rights for the deaf community.   He has taken this rejection in stride, creating an ROTC program at  the Maryland School for the Deaf. I am once again calling for a  demonstration program that gives the deaf community a chance to defend  the country they love.                            ____________________
