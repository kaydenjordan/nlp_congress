 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address a  public health crisis that is taking a tangible toll on every facet of  our society.   In Pennsylvania, drug abuse and addiction are not abstract concerns.  The drug crisis is a reality that plays out across our community every  single day. Sadly, Pennsylvanians are not alone. Each day, more than  130 Americans die from an overdose.   As a nation, we cannot allow illicit drugs to continue tearing apart  families, destroying our workforce, and claiming lives. From law  enforcement officials to healthcare providers to educators to community  leaders and lawmakers, all of us have an individual part to play. We  must combat this crisis, keep drugs off our streets, protect families,  safeguard our economy, and, most importantly, save lives.   Ending this scourge requires a team effort. In Congress, it has been  my privilege to work with leaders at the Federal, State, and local  levels to identify and implement commonsense solutions for the drug  crisis.   Mr. Speaker, today I thank my fellow members of the freshman  Bipartisan Working Group on Addiction for their collaboration and  partnership during the 116th Congress. Together we worked toward our  shared fight against drug abuse and addiction. I am proud of the  legislative achievements that we forged, and I am looking forward to  continuing this work in the upcoming 117th Congress.   In the White House, President Donald Trump and his administration are  incredible leaders in this fight. From day one, President Trump  prioritized realistic and achievable solutions to tackle this problem,  equip those on the front lines, and support Americans in recovery.   I am grateful to President Trump's drug czar, White House Office of  National Drug Control Policy Director James Carroll, for his steadfast  commitment to this issue. This fall, it was an honor to host Director  Carroll in my district to meet directly with remarkable leaders on the  front lines of the drug crisis. He is a true partner for  Pennsylvanians, and I am thankful for Director Carroll's service in  this key role.   As a nation, Americans have made significant strides in defeating the  drug crisis, and now, today, our work must continue.   On the China Task Force we recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic is  not the only public health crisis that was created by the Chinese  Communist Party. All too often illicit drugs originating in China end  up on the streets in Pennsylvania, spurring addiction, harming  families, and killing too many of my patients, my friends, and my  neighbors. These drugs are trafficked through porous borders, and even  through the U.S. Postal Service.   As a direct solution to this problem, I have cosponsored legislation  to hold the Chinese Communist regime--and any other foreign  government--accountable if the government fails to stop deadly drugs  from leaving their borders, and I will continue to push forward with  commonsense legislation.   Tragically, the drug crisis has been exacerbated by the COVID-19  pandemic and aggressive mitigation tactics in Pennsylvania and around  the country. As we Americans battle this pandemic, we must not ignore  rising rates of addiction and overdoses. I continue to call on Federal  and State leaders to ensure that individuals and families facing  addiction and those in recovery have the resources and support that  they need, whether virtual or in person.   We cannot afford inaction. The ramifications of the drug crisis  transcend all divides. Together--not as Republicans or Democrats, but  together as Americans--we are in a shared fight to save lives, and  together we must win.                            ____________________
