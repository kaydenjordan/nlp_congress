 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to submit extraneous material on H.R. 78, to improve the  consideration by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the costs  and benefits of its regulations and orders.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 40 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 78.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) to  preside over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1415                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 78) to improve the consideration by the Securities and Exchange  Commission of the costs and benefits of its regulations and orders,  with Mr. McClintock in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act.   I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner) for leading this  effort in the House.   This bill is technically about something called economic analysis or  cost-benefit analysis. That may sound like Ph.D. economics, but it is  really about kitchen table economics because, Mr. Chairman, it is truly  about whether we are going to have a stronger economy--one that creates  good-paying jobs so that parents can afford to raise their children  today and these same children can have a brighter future tomorrow. It  is about making sure we have an accountable government that expands  personal opportunity, not government bureaucracy.   Mr. Chairman, I think we all know that small businesses are truly  America's job engine. They create nearly two-thirds of all new jobs in  our economy. Our economy works better for all when small businesses can  focus on creating jobs and on serving their customers rather than  navigating needless government red tape.   Unfortunately, for America's small businesses, bureaucratic red tape  has no better friend than the Obama administration. It has issued more  than 4,400 final regulations, with an astronomical cost to all of us of  $1 trillion. Just since the election on November 8, the Obama  administration had cynically issued 145 midnight regulations with a  cost of more than $21 billion.   For anyone who believes that this doesn't hurt our small businesses,  they need to listen to their constituents, because I certainly listen  to mine. I heard from a small business owner named Chris, who is back  in my district and who wrote me:         We have seen wave after wave of Federal regulations affect       our ability to grow. The costs associated with additional       reporting, auditing, and compliance are massive. The money       spent is significant and costs jobs and potential jobs.    Mr. Chairman, he is exactly right. The true cost of Washington red  tape cannot just be measured in dollars. The true cost includes the  jobs not created, the small businesses not started, and the dreams of  our children not fulfilled. Ill-advised laws like the Dodd-Frank Act  empower unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats to callously hand down  crushing regulations without adequately considering what impact those  regulations have on jobs.   As one former SEC Commissioner testified before the Financial  Services Committee, which I have the honor of chairing, these  Washington elites have forgotten the key to sensible regulation:         The most appropriate regulatory solution should be the one       that imposes the least burden on society while maximizing       potential benefits even if that means choosing not to       regulate at all.    Although the Securities and Exchange Commission is one of the few  Washington agencies that engages in at least some base level of  economic analysis, putting this requirement into law is definitely  preferable to current agency procedures. After all, the SEC's recent  interest in economic analysis came only on the heels of numerous  Federal courts throwing out some of its regulations because the  Commission failed to adequately take into account, again, the true  costs and benefits of its rules.   Passing this bill will erase any doubt that the Securities and  Exchange Commission must conduct sound economic analysis. It must  consider the impact of their rules on our jobs and our family budgets.  That is what cost-benefit analysis is all about.   Mr. Chairman, we may hear today from the usual suspects--the  opponents of this bill--that somehow this is meant to hinder the  rulemaking process and encourage litigation against the SEC. You will  hear these same people say, once again, that this is somehow dangerous.  Mr. Chairman, what is dangerous is being ignorant of the impact the  proposed regulations will have on our economy and on the American  people's wallets before they get implemented. That is what is  dangerous.   What is interesting, Mr. Chairman, is that Presidents, frankly, of  both parties seem to agree. Even Presidents Clinton and Obama directed  independent agencies to engage in, essentially, exactly the same  procedures that H.R. 78 would make into law. Such irony, Mr. Chairman,  that some Democrats will come to the floor today and oppose codifying  into law Clinton and Obama policy. Again, the irony of it all.   I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill because we must  hold Washington accountable to the American people. We must build a  stronger, healthier economy so struggling Americans can get back to  work and achieve financial independence.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, just as I opposed the bill before us today in the  previous three Congresses, I rise in opposition to it now. Republicans  have crafted H.R. 78 to tie the hands of the Securities and Exchange  Commission, the SEC, and to prevent it from issuing new rules to  address market failures and protect investors. At the same time, the  bill would enable the Trump administration to easily repeal important  Dodd-Frank rules by tilting the SEC's decisions toward what is best for  industry and, worse, what enriches the President-elect and his cronies.   Before I discuss H.R. 78, I think it is important to point out that  14 members of the Financial Services Committee, as well as the millions  of Americans they represent, are being denied the opportunity to  discuss this bill through hearings and markups. We are barely into the  second week of this Congress and the Republican leadership is  completely ignoring regular order--despite Speaker Ryan's declaration  less than a week ago of a return to regular order--by skipping the  committee process to bring this bill to the floor; but this is par for  the course.   In the other Chamber, Senate Republican leadership is similarly  jamming Donald Trump's conflicted nominees through the confirmation  process even before the FBI has completed background checks. And with  barely 10 days until his inauguration, Donald Trump has already given  up on ``draining the swamp'' and has broken his promise to hold Wall  Street accountable by nominating Wall Street insiders to nearly every  key economic and regulatory post.   Let me turn back to the problems with H.R. 78.  [[Page H429]]    During the past four Congresses, Republicans have sought to increase  the cost-benefit requirements that are related to SEC rulemakings even  though the Commission is already subject to stringent economic analysis  for which it is held accountable. Current law requires the SEC to  conduct the same economic analysis that is required of all agencies  under the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Congressional Review Act, and  the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Unlike other financial regulators, the  SEC has additional statutory requirements to study how its rules affect  market efficiency, competition, and capital formation.   Additionally, in 2012, the SEC voluntarily issued internal guidance  on economic analysis for rulemakings that closely follow Executive  Order No. 12866. Since adopting this guidance, the SEC has dramatically  expanded its economic analysis capabilities, including by increasing  the staff and the budget of its economics division by more than 300  percent over the last 5 years. In any other reality, the SEC would be  held up as a model of effective economic analysis.   When asked by Republicans in Congress to review the SEC's analysis,  the inspector general concluded:         We determined that the SEC's use of its current guidance       has been effective in incorporating economic analysis into       the rulemaking process.    H.R. 78, however, goes much, much further in radically directing the  SEC to no longer be concerned with the protection of investors. In  fact, the only reference to investors anywhere in the bill is in a  provision requiring the SEC to consider the impact these rules will  have on ``investor choice.''   The American public knows full well that ``investor choice'' is a  code for industry's wanting to offer a menu of predatory products, such  as subprime--toxic--mortgages or retirement products that are designed  to bankrupt low- and middle-income Americans and line the pockets of  Wall Street executives. Further suggestions that the bill is only  codifying the cost-benefit executive orders are false as the bill omits  one key provision from those orders: the prohibition of private rights  of action, which is simply the right to sue.   As a result, H.R. 78 provides industry with endless avenues to sue  the SEC and, thereby, puts pressure on the regulator to adopt the rules  it wants and to repeal everything else. What is worse, the bill is the  first signal to Wall Street that the SEC is leaving the enforcement  business. H.R. 78 provides no new funding for the SEC to address the  substantial, analytic, and potential litigation responsibilities the  bill would create even though the Congressional Budget Office estimates  that the analytical workload alone would cost $27 million.   Let's not fool ourselves that Republicans are going to increase the  SEC's funding. That is at the top of their agenda--kill the SEC by  taking away the funding that they need to be the cops on the block.   Members of Congress just finished debating a bill that caps the SEC's  sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, at a woefully  inadequate funding level for the next 5 years, denying the CFTC the  hundreds of millions of dollars it needs to adequately police the swaps  markets.   Further, Donald Trump has nominated a lifelong defender of Wall  Street's to lead the SEC, which I can only assume means that Trump's  SEC will equally pillage the Commission's overworked enforcement staff  to help pay for the Republicans' planned repeal of Dodd-Frank.                                time  1430    As President-elect Trump takes office next week, beginning what is  the most conflicted administration in U.S. history, I urge my  colleagues to join me, investor and consumer advocates, public pension  plans, civil rights groups, labor unions, and supporters of financial  reform in opposing H.R. 78 to ensure that the actions of Trump's SEC  are in the interest of America's economic stability and not in Russia's  or Wall Street's interests.   I am amazed that the Republicans can be so blatant, so noncaring to  come to us at this time with a bill that would basically take our cop  on the block, the SEC, and literally obliterate it. I am absolutely  amazed that they have the nerve and the gall to try this in face of  everything that we already know about what they have done to strip it  of its appropriate funding. But now with all of the debate and the  concern about Trump and Russia and everything that is going on, they  would come here with this bill today and try to pull this off.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased now to yield 4  minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the author of  the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act and the chairman of our Oversight  and Investigations Subcommittee.
