 ``. . . to provide and maintain a navy;   ``To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and  naval forces;   ``To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the  Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions; . . .''    Mr. Chairman, I stand here today with an urgent plea to my  colleagues. We were elected by the good men and women of the United  States who believe in our vision of America and who believe in our  dedication to doing whatever it takes to ensure the American Dream is  alive and achievable. It is for these reasons the REINS Act must pass.   Federal regulations imposed on American the job creators and  households, an estimated $1.9 trillion burden in 2015.   Who pays that?   The American citizen does. It costs on an average, as Chairman  Goodlatte brought up, $15,000 per U.S. household.   Could that money be better used to offset the cost of a college  education or maybe the staggering cost of health care due to the  Affordable Care Act?   Let me give you a real-life illustration from my district. A couple  of years ago, a constituent, a dairy farmer, was targeted by an  incredibly vague, broad, and costly EPA rule called WOTUS, Waters of  the United States. The EPA sued and won this case not due to  environmental damage, but due to the vagueness of this rule and the  determination in court. It cost my constituent over $200,000 in fines  and court costs for a natural depression in his pasture that the EPA  determined could qualify as navigable waters.   The rule states that any water or any land that becomes seasonably  wet is affected. I live in Florida. We get 54 inches of rain a year.  That is my whole State of Florida.    This is downright outrageous. This is just one example of the many  times the EPA has overstepped its authority by enforcing vague  regulations unfairly on individuals. The REINS Act will prevent these  costly job-killing regulations from going into effect and safeguard  against Federal bureaucrats imposing the heaviest burdens on the  American economy, and this will increase the livelihood of the American  people.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking  Member Engel.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the nation of Israel, one of  our greatest allies in the Middle East.   I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 11, Objecting to United  Nations Security Council Resolution 2334.  [[Page H153]]    U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334 calls for a Palestinian state  but not a Jewish state. It does nothing to condemn or stop the  Palestinian Authority's pay to slay, as we have heard talked over and  over again, that rewarded over $300 million to terrorists in Israeli  jails last year for crimes committed against Israeli citizens and  others. It legitimizes additional efforts to isolate and sanction  Israel. It declares the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem,  where the City of David has been excavated, and the Western Wall,  Judaism's holiest site, as occupied territories.                                time  1800    This is absurd. Furthermore, the Obama administration refused to veto  it. This shameful move broke with years of bipartisan U.S. efforts to  protect Israel from deeply flawed and biased U.S. resolutions.   H. Res. 11 reasserts the U.S. position that the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations between the  two parties. H. Res. 11 must pass to send a clear message to the  outgoing Obama administration, to the U.N., and to the world that the  United States stands with Israel.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  achievements of Leroy Baldwin. A true American original, Leroy Baldwin  was born and raised in Ocala, Florida, on December 15, 1932. Not coming  from a family with a rich ag background, Mr. Baldwin bought his first  calf when he was 6 years of age from the money he earned delivering  newspapers.  [[Page H175]]    Mr. Baldwin served honorably in the U.S. Army from 1952 to 1955  during the Korean war. After the war, he pursued his lifelong project,  the Baldwin Angus Ranch. Starting with 40 acres, the ranch now spans  620 acres and has taken the Florida Angus breed all over the world.   Mr. Baldwin thanked God each and every day for the blessings his  family and business enjoyed.   God, family, and country are the words he lived by, words vitally  important to our Nation today. We have lost a true giant.   Mr. Baldwin, may God bless you, your family, and thank you for what  you have done for Florida and our Nation's agriculture.                            ____________________
