 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the need for  meaningful, long-term reform for the United States Postal Service.   The USPS provides an essential service to every community in the  Nation, yet this agency has lost $78 billion in the last 13 years. In  2009 the Government Accountability Office published a report placing  USPS on the high-risk list, doubting the self-sustaining financial  viability of this agency. The financial state of the USPS has  progressively worsened due to declining mail volume, liabilities, and  debt. Proposals to give the USPS $25 billion in cash without serious  reforms will not address the fundamental issues that the agency faces.   The proposals before us today only delay real reform and throw  taxpayer dollars at a problem with no clear vision forward. Rather than  politicizing the mail, we should be working to give the USPS longevity  through comprehensive reforms. Rather than trying to fix a problem by  simply spending more taxpayer money, we should be enacting reforms to  equip our Nation's outstanding postal workers with the tools they need  and deserve to continue delivering the mail. This is the only way we  will ensure that Americans continue to receive this vital service  without interruption.
