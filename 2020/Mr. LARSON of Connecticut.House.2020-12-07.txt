 Mr. Speaker, on Monday, December 7, 2020,  I was unfortunately not present for rollcall votes 236 through 237. Had  I been present for these votes, I would have voted: ``yea'' on rollcall  vote 236 on passage Calling for the global repeal of blasphemy, heresy,  and apostasy laws, as amended (H. Res. 512), and ``yea'' on rollcall  vote 237 on passage of HBCU PARTNERS Act, as amended Act (S. 461).
