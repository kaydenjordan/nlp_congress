 Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of the 27th  anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which was signed  into law on July 26, 1990.   This landmark, bipartisan civil rights legislation enables people  with disabilities, including me, to experience more inclusive and  fulfilling lives.   The prohibition of discrimination on the basis of a disability has  helped to promote equal opportunity, full participation, independent  living, and economic self-sufficiency.   Mr. Speaker, it is true that we have made incredible progress since  1990, but we still have work ahead. Too many people with disabilities  still lack access to affordable housing, public transportation,  education, healthcare, and employment. Full access and inclusion  remains a fundamental aspiration, but it is not yet a reality.   Mr. Speaker, we must remain vigilant in defending the intent of the  ADA so that future generations can live in an inclusive, accessible  world, where the unique talents and abilities of individuals with  disabilities are innately recognized.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Deutch), my colleague, for yielding. It is an honor  to join him this evening to discuss the cause and mission that is very  close to my heart.   As many of my colleagues know, I was injured back in 1980, as a young  police cadet, when I was accidentally shot and paralyzed in the police  locker room when a police officer's gun accidentally discharged. So,  the cause of finding a cure and better treatments for spinal cord  injuries and supporting family members as caregivers of people with  spinal cord injuries has, again, been a passion of mine and mission for  many years.   In late 2001, it was my privilege to join Christopher and Dana Reeve,  two very dear friends of mine whom I got to know very well over the  years, in announcing the creation of the Paralysis Resource Center, or  the PRC, which was officially established in 2002 as part of the  Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation. These were two remarkable  individuals, as I said, I got to know and who became friends of mine  over the years.   I can remember back when Christopher Reeve was paralyzed in his horse  riding accident and how, instead of being quiet and introverted and  just dealing with his recovery, he made it his mission to call  attention to the cause of spinal cord injuries and the need for further  research to be done and support services to be provided. He was an  amazing inspiration to me because he gave voice and was a face of  spinal cord injuries and the work that needed to be done to find a  cure.    Because of his work and that of the Christopher and Dana Reeve  Foundation, we are getting closer and closer every day to finding a  cure for spinal cord injuries; and we are getting closer and closer  every day to providing support for better quality of life for people  with disabilities and paralysis and further support for the families of  those who care for people with disabilities, especially those with  spinal cord injuries.   In 2009, I was so proud to support the enactment of the Christopher  and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, which formally authorized some of the  programs that have led to the success of the PRC. This center has grown  to include a network of information specialists, a number of veterans  programs, a Peer and Family Support Program, a substantial Quality of  Life Grants Program, and a neurorecovery rehabilitation network.   It really is an inclusive center. It conveys the message that people  dealing with spinal cord injuries or nerve-related conditions are not  alone, that there are people and organizations around them who care and  are willing to give the advice and counsel support that they need. So  whether you are living with paralysis or you are the caregiver of a  loved one who is paralyzed, the PRC provides resources and information  to help serve the specific needs of those affected by spinal cord  injuries.   We know there are more than 43 million caregivers in the U.S.  providing support to loved ones with chronic disabling conditions on a  variety of disabilities, whether it is a sick child or a  [[Page H6208]]  sick parent or, in particular, those living with spinal cord injuries  and paralysis.   Reports estimate that the annual economic value, if we had to put a  price tag on this uncompensated care of family caregivers, to be  somewhere approximately at the level of $470 billion annually--$470  billion annually, if we had to put a dollar figure on this  uncompensated care. That is more than the total Medicaid spending was  in 2013. That is when this study was done and those statistics were  made public.   The benefits of family caregiving, of course, are plentiful and it is  what families do for one another. If you have a sick child or a sick  parent or a loved one, families so often step up to the plate and they  provide that uncompensated care. Again, it is what families do. But, at  the same time, it can also take an emotional, mental, and physical  toll.                                time  2030    As a result, respite is the most frequently requested support service  among family caregivers. Respite is that little bit of assistance where  you have someone coming in to give the caregiver a break during the  course of a week. Maybe it is an hour or two a day or a few hours  during the course of a week that can make all the difference in  allowing the caregiver themselves to go to the doctor or go do their  grocery shopping, the things that are important to the rest of the  family, or bringing a child to a baseball game or soccer practice;  again, just those little everyday things that maybe we often take for  granted that a family caregiver may not be able to do but for the fact  that they have respite coming in. As a result, respite is, again, the  most frequently requested support services among family caregivers.   Supported by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, the Lifespan  Respite Care Program, which I helped to create back in 1996 with then- Congressman Mike Ferguson, a Republican from Pennsylvania, it was a  bipartisan effort in creating this program, which operates now in 35  States and the District of Columbia, complements the PRC's efforts to  help paralyzed individuals achieve a high quality of life by ensuring  that caregivers who help them also receive relief and care, again, and  support themselves.   Access to respite services has been shown to promote caregiver health  and well-being, promote family stability, reduce the likelihood of  abuse and neglect, and delay or even avoid the need for admission to  costlier, long-term institutional settings, resulting in significant  savings for the healthcare system and ultimately taxpayers, but  ultimately helping the loved one who needs the care receive better  care, because the loved one providing the care gets the support and the  break that they need.   So beyond supporting access to respite for caregivers, we know the  PRC's services and programs have touched the lives of people across the  country, including those residing in the Ocean State, where I am from  in Rhode Island.   For instance, Sarah Galli of Rhode Island spoke about her brother,  Jeff, who was injured in 1998, and I would like to share her impactful  words on the importance of the PRC now. She wrote:   ``July 4, 1998, was the day that my family changed forever. My  healthy, strong, athletic 17-year-old brother dove into the shallow end  of a swimming pool and was rendered a high-level quadriplegic.   ``Each Independence Day that followed has been a reminder of how  quickly and irrevocably Jeff had his physical independence taken from  him. It is also a reminder of how grateful I am for the support that  has enveloped my family with care.   ``I can't speak for my brother's experiences as a quad. That is his  story to tell. But here is mine. In the years following his accident, I  have counted on the Paralysis Resource Center and the Reeve Foundation  for support. I have referred friends and strangers to them who require  information and advocacy.   ``And as a theater major in college, I started a student cabaret,  Born for Broadway, that expanded an annual gala in the years since,  raising awareness and funds for paralysis organizations, including  Reeve. And I have also picked up the phone on several occasions to call  the PRC and cry. Sometimes you just need to know that you are not  alone.   ``A friend of mine, Reeve supporter Jeff Ruben, wrote a song about a  pal who lives with paralysis, using the lyrics, `I believe in  miracles.'   ``I don't believe in miracles, but I do believe in Jeff. And I  believe in Reeve. Do you?''   Mr. Speaker, we know the PRC's network of support remains strong to  this day. When another Rhode Islander, 21-year-old Jack Calbi, was  injured in a mountain bike accident this past April and left paralyzed  from the chest down, the PRC immediately reached out to Jack's family  to discuss the array of resources available.   Nearly 6 million Americans live with paralysis, depend on robust  services and supports, respite for caregivers that love them, and a  continued investment in the science and innovation that will lead to  the treatments and cures of tomorrow.   The PRC has become a beacon of hope for so many. And as my dear  friend Christopher Reeve said, ``Once you choose hope, anything is  possible.''   Christopher and Dana Reeve were friends of mine. I miss them dearly.  They truly did provide hope to me and millions of others, whether  affected by paralysis or some other nerve disorder or disabilities in  general, or the families that are affected by this condition as well.  They made a difference, as has the PRC. I am grateful for their work  and I am grateful for all the efforts to keep the PRC going strong so  that they can continue to help those living with paralysis, their  families, and for those who may be affected in the future.   And together I know that one day, because of all the efforts that are  going on through amazing research right now, as we get closer step by  step every day to finding a cure for spinal cord injuries, that  families will know that they are not alone, that we are in this  together, and that PRC and the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation  are helping us to one day get one step closer to finding the cures and  those treatments that we so desperately look for.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida for raising attention  to this issue and for yielding to me.
