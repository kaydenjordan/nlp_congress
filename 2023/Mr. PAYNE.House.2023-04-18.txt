 Mr. Speaker, I rise to condemn the decision to shut down  the last Washington, D.C.-based bureau for New Jersey media.   In March, NJ Advance Media closed its Washington news bureau forever.  It was the last Washington news bureau to focus on New Jersey-related  content.   This closure robs New Jersey readers of critical political  information, and it undermines the media outlet's responsibility to  keep its readers informed.   Now, New Jersey readers will not know how congressional funding  benefits their communities, and they will not know how they will be  affected by legislation and possible political corruption.   The bureau had one reporter, the excellent Jonathan Salant, so it was  a cost-effective way to provide this information. Instead, NJAM  betrayed the very purpose of a news outlet to increase the bottom line.   I hope NJAM will reopen this bureau soon and provide effective  coverage of national politics to its New Jersey readers.                            ____________________
