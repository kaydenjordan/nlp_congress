 Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Lamborn) having assumed the chair, Mr. Jody B. Hice of Georgia, Acting  Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union,  reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill  (H.R. 3354) making appropriations for the Department of the Interior,  environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September  30, 2018, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.  [[Page H7135]]                                ____________________     Mr. Chairman, pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution  504 and as the designee of the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Frelinghuysen), I offer amendments en bloc. A list of the included  amendments included in the en bloc is at the desk and has been agreed  to by both sides.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the en bloc, and I  urge its adoption.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr.  Poliquin).    Mr. Chairman, I have no other speakers. I rise in  support of the amendments en bloc, and I urge its adoption.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I certainly appreciate the gentleman's  support for robust funding of the Superfund program, particularly the  cleanup program.   There is a need for Congress to make progress to address the backlog  of 1,300 sites on the national priority list. The bill proposes to do  so with a $47.6 million increase for cleanup work. However, the  amendment proposes merely to increase EPA's enforcement budget by $12  million, with a stated objective of reducing BLM's oil and gas  management program.   The committee wrote a balanced bill, and I support the wise use of  Federal oil and gas resources. Therefore, I oppose the amendment and  urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the gentleman's amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask Members to vote ``no'' on this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    I would be happy to engage the gentleman from Colorado  in a colloquy.    I thank the gentleman for his comments and for his  amendment, and I fully agree with his concerns about the backlogs, but  I have concerns with the proposed offset and appreciate the intention  to withdraw it.   The committee has made a concerted effort in recent years to fix  these problems and has increased the recovery account by almost $4  million over the last 2 years.   Under House Republican pressure over the past 7 years, the Fish and  Wildlife Service has delisted more species than all other previous  years combined, but, clearly, we still have a long way to go.  [[Page H7139]]    The Service has been directed and funded to complete all 5-year  reviews within the period required by law, and the committee will  continue to press the Service to see that they eliminate these  backlogs.   I thank the gentleman again for raising this issue, and I pledge to  work with him on this.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution  504, as the designee of the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Frelinghuysen), I rise to offer amendments en bloc No. 2. The list of  the amendments included in the en bloc is at the desk and has been  agreed to by both sides.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer).    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Minnesota.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the en bloc and urge  its adoption.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Chairman Frelinghuysen,  I move to strike the last word.   The Acting Chair. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentlewoman's  amendment. I certainly urge Members to support it.   This bill maintains the increases provided last year for deferred  maintenance and increases the construction account by $10 million. This  amendment will further our efforts to address the longstanding deferred  maintenance needs.   I urge an ``aye'' vote on the amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I understand the gentleman's overall goal  is to continue funding for the AML pilot project, consistent with a  fiscal year 2017 enacted level, and structure for the six Appalachian  States.   Therefore, we can accept this package of amendments at this time,  work toward maintaining funding for 6 States in a final fiscal year  2018 enacted bill. If we are able to achieve that goal, I hope we can  count on the gentleman's support to pass both this House package and to  enact the 2018 end-of-year spending bill.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to adopt this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Chairman Frelinghuysen,  I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Jody B. Hice) for the purpose of a colloquy.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Harris) for the purpose of a colloquy.    Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned at our full committee  markup, I understood that my colleague, Dr. Harris, was offering his  amendment to address local concerns from his residents with respect to  the visibility of offshore turbines. With all of these offshore  projects, many varying viewpoints need to be taken into account. I  appreciate that we have been able to discuss many of these views and  concerns here today.   It is my hope that we can work with the authorizing committees of  jurisdiction, the administration, and all interested stakeholders to  identify some better solutions as we move forward through the fiscal  year 2018 process.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I am certainly prepared to accept this amendment. I understand the  importance of the program to the gentleman from Pennsylvania and other  Members in the Appalachian region. I look forward to working with him  and all of the interested Members.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage adoption of the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, given our allocation, which was $824 million  below the fiscal year 2017 level, we had to find areas to trim. It is  also important to note that the bill does not support the elimination  of the program, as has been proposed in the President's budget. It was  the committee's effort to find some middle ground.   While I can certainly appreciate the gentleman's interest to maintain  fiscal year 2017 enacted level, the allocation of the committee doesn't  support those levels. So, therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no'' on the gentleman's amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I certainly appreciate my friend's support  for the research conducted at the EPA, and particularly the Research  Triangle Park. I am a supporter of the world class research that occurs  at RTP with respect to the computational toxicology program. That  research has helped to identify alternative high throughput testing  methodologies that have reduced the number of animals used in  laboratories.   Given the current allocation, however, which is $824 million below  the  [[Page H7145]]  fiscal year 2017 level, we had to find areas to trim. We certainly  don't have a funding level that can support the fiscal year 2017  enacted levels, but we tried to do the best we could to find common  ground.   I certainly look forward to working with the gentleman in the future,  if we happily come to some kind of budget agreement, where we can  reallocate funds to something as important as this. But, again, because  of our allocation, I must oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues  to vote ``no'' on the gentleman's amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Chairman Frelinghuysen,  I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Lance) for the purpose of entering into a colloquy.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York  (Ms. Slaughter).    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    While the amendment itself is drafted in order as a  general increase to EPA geographic programs, the gentleman proposes to  fund a program that was not requested in the budget and is not  authorized.   Further, he proposes to reduce grants from DERA, the DERA program,  which is a key program for improving air quality in areas like mine  that are in a nonattainment area with existing standards.   For those reasons, I oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to  vote ``no'' on this amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am sorry. I didn't hear the gentleman, and  I happily accept his offer to withdraw the amendment. I will happily  work with him to see if we can't work some time in the future to find  room for this program that the gentleman is obviously supportive of.    Mr. Chair, I won't take the 2 minutes. I just want to  let the gentleman know I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I  encourage adoption of the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I support the gentleman's amendment because  water infrastructure remains a top priority of this committee. I urge  adoption of the gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment,  reluctant opposition.    Mr. Chair, I think it is important that EPA right the  wrong that was caused by the Gold King Mine spill and ensure that the  affected States, and the Tribal areas, have the resources they need  following the spill.   The FY17 bill included $4 million to work with the States and Tribes  on an independent water monitoring plan as authorized by the WIIN Act.  Therefore, the proposed level in this amendment would exceed the  authorized level. And for that reason, I must oppose the gentleman's  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    In 1977, Congress made a deliberate policy choice to  exempt ordinary farming, silviculture, ranching, mining, related  activities, from the requirements to obtain Clean Water Act permits  when undertaken as normal activities: prepare and maintain land, roads,  ponds, and ditches.   Unfortunately, we heard concern for several years that, under the  Obama administration, the EPA and the Corps of Engineers changed  implementation of these provisions to significantly reduce the  application of the statutory exemptions.   Section 430 of the bill makes clear that Congress has always intended  that statutory exemptions are to have meaning, that the agencies cannot  simply ignore the will of Congress as set out by law.   For these reasons and a number of others, I oppose the amendment and  urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge a strong ``no,'' and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Since day one, everything about EPA's waters of the U.S.  rule has been flawed. The Obama administration claimed that it was not  expanding the waters under their jurisdiction, but we know that more  permits will be required.                                time  1915    The Obama administration claimed that the rule was based on sound  science but only released to science after publishing the rule. The  previous administration changed the name to call this the clean water  rule and took to social media to lobby the public, which led to  questions about whether the EPA violated law, which the GAO later  confirmed.   It was clear the previous administration had an agenda to implement a  rule, and they weren't going to be told otherwise. Thankfully, the  Sixth Circuit Court put a stay on that rule.   The language of the FY18 bill authorizes the withdrawal of the Waters  of the U.S. rule and seeks to bring resolution to the issue. The  language in this bill is consistent with the steps the new  administration has already taken.   For that and many other reasons, I urge a ``no'' vote on the  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, where I come from, Midland Empire, which  is where I have lived my whole life, is part of the South Coast Air  Quality Basin, which has been a nonattainment ozone area for about as  long as the Federal standard for ozone has existed. But it is not for a  lack of trying, as the south coast has a long history--actually the  longest history--of implementing some of the most stringent Air  Pollution Control measures in the entire United States.   We have done about all we can to reduce emissions from stationary  sources. Our issue is the amount of cars and trucks traveling through  the region. So you will find no stronger advocate for clean air than  myself, which is why this bill funds targeted Air Shed Grant Programs  and DERA grants. States and communities need resources to help meet the  overlapping 2008 and 2015 air quality standards.   To be clear, the language in the bill does not change ozone  standards. It gives communities some administrative relief to allocate  more resources to meeting the 2015 standard of 70 parts per billion.   Similar language, by the way, passed the House in July. Therefore, I  urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment to strike, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Again, Mr. Chairman, I would reiterate that California  has done more to clean air than virtually any other State in the Union  based upon its regulatory structure that we created and I continue to  support.   But technologies do not exist to meet standards that have been set  out by the Obama administration. So this gives us time to do what we  need to do, and that is to clean up ozone, and that is exactly what we  are going to do. But this is not the amendment that is going to do  that.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose that amendment strongly and urge a ``no''  vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I understand the importance of agencies  working together to protect our coastal resources for future  generations. We must also ensure that such coordination is done  carefully with congressional input to ensure that it does not lead to  Federal overreach.                                time  1930    When the previous administration created the National Ocean Policy  through executive order, the impacts were so broad, so sweeping, that  it would have allowed the Federal Government to evaluate everything  from agricultural practices, mining, energy production, fishing, and  anything else with activities impacting our oceans.   This subcommittee asked the CEQ, DOI, and EPA on a number of  occasions to provide estimates of the impact of the policy on their  budgets, but the administration failed to work with Congress and  provide such information.   How can Congress adequately budget for something without knowing the  expected expenditures and implication of the policy?   The bottom line is, if the administration wants to fund the National  Ocean Policy with such sweeping implications, it must work with  Congress to provide relevant information and allow Congress to provide  the necessary oversight to prevent that Federal overreach.   I support the language of the underlying bill, and I encourage my  colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, just because legislation isn't passed in  the House and the Senate and made into law doesn't mean that the  President can then go out and create an executive order. We have a  Constitution, and we have a process we must abide by. For that and  other reasons, I strongly oppose this amendment, and I urge a ``no''  vote.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am happy to support this amendment.   The recent court decision earlier this year overturned, really, a  longstanding EPA exemption for reporting from farms. These family farms  and ranchers across the Nation shouldn't be burdened with just more and  more paperwork to do an activity they have been doing for many, many  years in this country. It is not what Congress intended. Congress, last  I looked, still makes the laws around here.   I would support the gentleman's amendment and urge its adoption.    Mr. Chairman, I was happy to accept the amendment in the  last year and will be happy to support it again this year.   With that, I urge its passage.    Mr. Chairman, I understand the specific rule is now  being reconsidered by the Department of Interior, which is a good  thing, and I encourage my colleagues to support the Young amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  won't take nearly 1\1/2\ minutes. I just want to support the amendment.   I understand there are portions of the order that are widely accepted  and some parts that need to be reworked. I hope the Bureau gets the  message and works with all of the interested parties to improve onshore  order No. 3.   Mr. Chairman, I am happy to support the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I won't take 1 minute. I just want to support  the gentleman's amendment.   It is my hope that the gentlemen from Virginia and Pennsylvania may  be able to work with the new administration, find common ground on  approaches that will improve water quality in a flexible manner which  works for everybody.   Mr. Chair, I support the amendment and urge an ``aye'' vote.    Will the gentleman from South Carolina yield?    Mr. Chair, I just want to let the gentleman know that I  oppose this amendment. I don't think we should stand in the way of  exploration research that could inform potential future decisions,  whether it is for or against drilling, but we need to know information  so once we know the potential, we can allow the agencies to weigh those  pros and cons.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Walker) having assumed the chair, Mr. Hultgren, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3354)  making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment,  and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I want to commend my colleague for her  consistent work to protect taxpayer dollars, and I certainly support  her in all of the endeavors that she has done over the years to do  that. But this is not the type of approach that I can support. I  certainly like the idea of challenging the agencies, and I believe that  the agencies are going to meet that challenge to cut spending in a  responsible way.   This bill has made some very tough choices, within a subcommittee  allocation, that adheres to the current law. The Budget Committee asked  us to meet certain budget caps, and we have done so in this bill, while  asking that we increase spending for our national security, which is in  woeful shape.   So we had to make some very difficult tradeoffs. This bill, in its  current form, balances our needs, those tradeoffs carefully weighed for  their respectful impacts. We prioritize funding for fire suppression,  PILT, national parks--maybe the most popular agency in the United  States Government--and meeting our legal and moral obligations in  Indian Country.   Unfortunately, the process that the gentlewoman proposes--an across- the-board cut--would cut all those programs, including Indian health,  national park programs, and other programs, which already are taking  significant cuts.   This amendment makes no distinction between where we need to be  spending to invest in, say, energy independence, or to limit spending  to meet our deficit controls.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment,  but I certainly support the fact that we are trying to get our budgets  in line.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).    Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I understand, and I have taken a lot of  criticism over the last few years for cutting EPA's budget by 27  percent over the last number of years. However, I believe this  amendment is just going too far.   We have a new administration. We have a new Administrator. I think  there is a new day over at EPA. None of us want to see our rivers  polluted, toxic waste either on the ground or in the air, and I think  this administration will administer the law properly.   We may not always agree on where it is appropriate to draw the line  on environmental laws and regulations. Some think some standards are  too stringent, some think they are not tough enough, and that is a fair  policy debate to have. However, we know that no matter where the line  is ultimately drawn, there are individuals out there who are willingly  and knowingly trying to find ways around those laws. As such, EPA needs  the ability to look into criminal activity, whether it is illegal  dumping of waste, negligent dumping of toxics or oil, or the illegal  importation of products from other countries by those who would choose  to ignore United States law.   So we can debate the law and what is appropriate, but we can't give  criminals a free pass or ignore the laws that are on the books. Mr.  Chair, I must oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to do the  same, and I encourage a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I understand the gentleman's concerns. I  would suggest that he go down to the Administrator's office, our new  Administrator, Mr. Pruitt, and meet with  [[Page H7172]]  him. I don't think that there is any desire on his part to militarize  the Environmental Protection Agency, and I think that he will see this  new Administrator wanting to do the right thing.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to oppose  the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Lamborn) having assumed the chair, Mr. Bergman, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3354)  making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment,  and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, last year, May of 2016, in the previous  administration, the Department of the Interior issued a finding of no  significant impact with respect to these operations; thus followed a  review of 23 oil and gas platforms currently operating offshore in the  State of California. The review drew upon the best available science  and reaffirms that these operations are operating safely, as they  should.  [[Page H7173]]    This amendment is nothing more than another attempt to restrict  offshore development, and I oppose the amendment and encourage my  colleagues to vote ``no.''   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment was adopted on the floor  last year. I believe it is a good amendment. I encourage my colleagues  to support it.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the amendment. I  appreciate my colleague for bringing the Bureau of Land Management's  Onshore Order No. 3 to the House's attention. Mr. Chair, I urge my  colleagues to support the amendment.    Mr. Chair, the House has spoken several times on the  Bureau of Land Management's methane regulation in the past 2 years. I  understand the administration is reviewing the regulation and that  litigation is ongoing.   In the meantime, I think action is needed, and so I support this  amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would prevent the Department  of the Interior from performing a necessary and thorough review of the  existing 5-year plan. Meanwhile, the committee encouraged a review of  the 5-year plan in the 2017 omnibus, which we just enacted just a few  months ago. For these reasons and others, I certainly urge a ``no''  vote on this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, while I understand the gentleman's intent,  I share his concern with the 2015 ozone standards, the bill's language  in the amendment goes a little too far. It ties this new  administration's hands with respect to reconsideration or flexibility  efforts that they are trying to build in at the present time.   Meanwhile, the ozone language in the underlying bill provides the  necessary administrative relief for communities to comply with the  overlapping 2008 and 2015 requirements. I think that this  administration understands the complexities that are being imposed by  this 2015 requirement. They are trying to deal with it. Mr. Pruitt has  indicated that publicly.   Mr. Chairman, I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments.   If we get additional resources in the future, I would love to make  sure that Fish and Wildlife has the resources to make sure they meet  their mandates, and they should meet them now.   One of the mandates they have is review the status of every listed  species every 5 years and a corresponding change in the status if it is  called for by those reviews. Instead of doing those reviews, in many  cases, the Service chooses to spend the money to list more species.   If the government isn't willing to shoulder the responsibilities that  come with listing species under the ESA, perhaps it shouldn't be  listing those species in the first place. So I think they need to meet  their obligations under the law.   I certainly support this amendment, and I encourage Members to  support the amendment and vote for it.    Mr. Chairman, I wanted to jump up and support this  amendment. Obviously, the agency has not leaped fast enough and  problems persist. So I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  amendment, and I know it will squeak by with a large margin.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Lamborn) having assumed the chair, Mr. Bergman, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3354)  making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment,  and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 11 o'clock and 37 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, September 8, 2017,  at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
