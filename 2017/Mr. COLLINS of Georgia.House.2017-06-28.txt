 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 414 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 414         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3003) to       amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to modify       provisions relating to assistance by States, and political       subdivision of States, in the enforcement of Federal       immigration laws, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall       be considered as read. All points of order against provisions       in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Judiciary; and (2) one motion to recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on House Resolution 414,  currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to bring this  rule forward on behalf of the Rules Committee.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary  for Criminals Act. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally  divided between the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary  Committee. The rule also provides for a motion to recommit.   Yesterday, the Rules Committee had the opportunity to hear from my  fellow Judiciary Committee members Mr. Johnson of Louisiana and Ms.  Lofgren of California.   H.R. 3003 received consideration by the Judiciary Committee as part  of a larger bill, the Michael Davis, Jr. and Danny Oliver in Honor of  State and Local Law Enforcement Act. That legislation was marked up and  ordered reported by the Judiciary Committee on May 24.   As a cosponsor and strong advocate of the Davis-Oliver Act, I  supported the passage of legislation before the full House. Today we  have the opportunity to move an important piece of that bill forward  and to strengthen our policies against jurisdictions that flout  America's laws.   Mr. Speaker, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act is just simply common  sense. John Adams said that we are a government of laws, not of men. As  we approach the Fourth of July week, we recognize that America's  foundation is that of the rule of law. Yet too often we have seen local  jurisdictions ignore Federal immigration law and declare themselves  sanctuary cities, as though their actions have no consequences for  their law-abiding neighbors.   The reality, however, is that the localities that refuse to enforce  Federal immigration law undermine public safety and break the  democratic contract. Mr. Speaker, the sanctuary cities do not act in a  vacuum. They endanger lives and set dangerous precedent.                                time  1230    To many people, it would seem obvious that local and State law  enforcement should comply with Federal immigration laws and cooperate  with its fair enforcement by communicating openly with Federal  officials. It would also seem clear that jurisdictions that ignore  these laws should forfeit the Federal funds set aside to support  compliance with those same laws.   Despite this, sanctuary cities oppose Federal immigration officials  routinely. These men and women find themselves handicapped by local  officials implementing obstructionist policies.   In light of this, Mr. Speaker, I believe we need to better protect  our communities by ensuring our laws are followed. H.R. 3003 takes  steps do that.   I thank Chairman Goodlatte, Congressman King, and Congressman Biggs  for their work on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. These Members are  colleagues of mine on the Judiciary Committee, and they recognize the  need to respond to the continuing problem of sanctuary cities with  resolve, with confidence that Federal immigration laws safeguard every  American community and apply equally to every American community.   The underlying bill provided for by this rule also includes  legislation offered by Mr. King--Sarah's and Grant's Law. Sarah's and  Grant's Law is named after two individuals, Sarah Root and Grant  Ronnebeck, who were tragically killed by unlawful immigrants. The  unlawful immigrants were released and remain at large, and the Root and  Ronnebeck families were left to grieve unspeakable losses while the  lawlessness continues.   It is past time for us to take action to combat dangerous sanctuary  policies. We are a nation of laws and we need to act like it.   While there is no uniform definition of sanctuary cities, and no  comprehensive or official list of these jurisdictions, we have,  regrettably, become all too familiar with them. So-called sanctuary  cities are those jurisdictions that obstruct immigration enforcement  through noncompliance with detainers. They construct unreasonable  hurdles to compliance and create barriers to communication between  Immigration and Customs Enforcement and local personnel.   We understand that ICE has a job to do and that its officers took  oaths to uphold those duties. Opponents will claim that this bill is  unnecessary because ICE has the jurisdiction it needs. The truth is,  sanctuary policies make the ICE agents' jobs more difficult, more  dangerous, and endanger communities.   While the previous administration frequently flouted immigration laws  and, for far too long, took a rain check on holding sanctuary cities  accountable, even former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh  Johnson agreed that sanctuary cities shouldn't simply be allowed to  decline to cooperate with Federal Government authorities. In fact, he  said in 2015 that it is ``not acceptable to have no policy of  cooperation with immigration enforcement.''   Mr. Speaker, faithfulness to the law isn't like being offered a cup  of coffee. You can't look at the Federal statutes and say: You know, no  thanks, but I appreciate you offering.   H.R. 3003 confirms that this option is not on the table.   While I agree with former Secretary Johnson that we must have a  policy of cooperation, the policies of the former administration too  frequently didn't indicate a commitment to that goal. In fact, State  and local jurisdictions ignored more than 12,000 Federal detainer  requests in 2014.   Now is the time for action.   Thankfully, President Trump issued an executive order directing the  Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and ICE to  ensure that sanctuary jurisdictions are ineligible for Federal grants  and are subject to enforcement actions. The President also charged  these agencies with reporting on jurisdictions that have refused to  comply with detainers to hold criminal aliens.   The first week this report was issued, it showed 206 known instances  in which local personnel declined ICE detainers and released criminal  aliens. These aliens reentered the communities after they had committed  crimes such as assault, aggravated assault or battery, driving under  the influence, or domestic violence abuses.   The reports indicate that we have work to do, but it helps us by  identifying jurisdictions where personnel are  [[Page H5245]]  thwarting Federal law. It throws into relief the glaring problem of  sanctuary cities and provides information that law enforcement and  lawmakers can use as we assess the problem and develop meaningful  solutions.   Mr. Speaker, I was in the Georgia State House when we took action  there to address the issue of sanctuary cities. In 2009, we in Georgia  outlawed sanctuary cities in our State. Last year, the legislature went  further by requiring local governments to certify their cooperation  with immigration officials in order to receive State funds.   Today we have a chance to take a step in a positive direction on the  Federal level.   The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act prohibits States and localities  from implementing policies that restrict law enforcement agencies from  cooperating with immigration laws and officials. It gives teeth to that  restriction by tying eligibility for certain Department of Justice and  Homeland Security grants to State and local compliance with existing  immigration laws.   The bill requires that there will be probable cause before ICE can  issue a detainer, and focuses on grant programs reasonably related to  the scope of the bill.   Importantly, this bill also calls for aliens to be detained if the  alien is engaged in a crime that caused death or serious injury to  another person. Had this provision been law at the time, it could have  helped prevent what happened in the heartbreaking death of Sarah Root,  where an alien who caused her death was freed on bond and remains at  large.   The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act also takes the commonsense step of  allowing DHS to withhold aliens rather than transferring them to  sanctuary jurisdictions, even if the jurisdiction has a warrant. It  simply doesn't make sense for DHS to transfer aliens who are removable  under the law to jurisdictions that are looking for opportunities to  let them go.    Mr. Speaker, I cannot talk about holding sanctuary cities accountable  by strengthening our laws without mentioning the work of Chairman John  Culberson.   In 2016, Chairman Culberson successfully convinced the Department of  Justice to update guidelines in order to disqualify sanctuary cities  from receiving DOJ grant money should they be found in violation of  title 8 U.S. Code, section 1373.   Attorney General Sessions has reiterated that Federal law enforcement  grants are contingent on compliance with existing law, and that the DOJ  will deny fiscal year 2017 grant funds to jurisdictions that have  refused to share information regarding illegal aliens in their custody.   Chairman Culberson's efforts made clear that State and local law  enforcement agencies are expected to work with Federal law enforcement  agencies on immigration matters. Through his diligent work, meaningful  steps have been taken to restore accountability.   The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act builds on these efforts and  ensures that jurisdictions comply with the detainers while  strengthening our law to ensure that aliens who have been committing  crimes such as drunk driving are detained pending their removal.   H.R. 3003 permits the Secretary of DHS to issue a detainer for any  individual arrested for violation of a criminal or motor vehicle law  upon probable cause that an individual is an inadmissible or deportable  alien.   In this critically important step, the bill grants immunity to State  and local entities for compliance with any detainer.   Jurisdictions that want to act in good faith and follow the law  should be able to cooperate without being held liable for their  compliance. The protections provided in this bill are a major step  forward to effective enforcement.   Finally, this bill gives victims and their families a private right  of action against a State and local government whose noncompliance and  release of an alien results in a murder, rape, or serious injury of the  victim. This measure, were it law, would have allowed Kate Steinle's  family to sue after her tragic murder at the hands of a criminal and  unlawful immigrant.   Sanctuary cities and jurisdictions ignore the law. They do it at the  expense of the American people. Our citizens surely deserve better.  They deserve to live in communities that don't let dangerous criminals  back out into the streets. They deserve to see the law upheld rather  than ignored. Law-abiding citizens deserve to see individuals who break  our laws--not only by entering and residing in our country illegally,  but by committing crimes once here--to be removed.   This rule provides for the consideration of legislation to strengthen  the rule of law and to protect our neighbors and communities.   It demands that jurisdictions comply with our Nation's immigration  laws and enforcement or face penalties.   Today we can take action to turn off the spigot of Federal funds to  those jurisdictions that obstruct ICE efforts at the expense of  Americans. We demonstrate that Members of this House will not sit idly  by while sanctuary cities continue flouting the laws of our land with  impunity. We strengthen our detainer policy, enable ICE to do its job,  and, at the same time, help protect our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, I respect my friend from Massachusetts a great  deal. I am not sure what is subversive to the Constitution in upholding  the law.   When we deal with this issue, it is about a choice. We can talk about  local law enforcement and we can talk about cities that do not want to  do this, but they are making the choice here. It is time we hold people  accountable for choices.   I think it is really interesting that we mentioned the State Criminal  Alien Assistance Program, which, by the way, was meant to reimburse  localities for holding illegal immigrants. If they are not holding  them, then why do they need the money to start with?   So let's at least put it in perspective here. I can talk about  immigration reform. I believe there is a lot that we can do in that. I  agree with the gentleman. However, I disagree in the part here, why  don't we enforce the law that is here?   By the way, that is currently the law under both President Obama and  President Trump. Under U.S. Code section 1373, in order to get Federal  money, they have to comply with this section. This simply builds upon  what we have already done.   So I think it is a choice here. I think making it out to be anything  other than a choice that the localities have made is really trying to  subvert the process and discuss another issue. We can do that all we  want. That is what ended up, a lot of times, happening in this rule  debate.   But at the end of the day, this is about simply enforcing the law. I  think if you go to places all over the country and you begin to ask  them just a simple question and start it off with this, ``Don't you  think we ought to enforce the law?'' the answer you get over 90 percent  of the time is yes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, just going on this, immigration is an interesting  issue, and we can discuss this. There probably are not a lot of folks  that I respect more than the gentlewoman from California, but this is a  constitutional issue. Immigration is a national issue.   If we are willing to reverse this out and let the States and  localities determine immigration, I think we settled that way over 200  years ago. This is where this belongs.   So, as we look at this, Washington is not saying it knows best. But  on this issue, it is our domain; it is where we are supposed to be.  This is our role.   We believe, simply, that enforcing the law is what we need here. If  the gentleman believes that States ought to have more control in a lot  of things that we do, then I think maybe I am getting him closer to  agreeing with us on healthcare that we need to reform and replace  ObamaCare and let States have a little bit more information in that.   But one of the things is that there is no affirmative action on the  cities here. I think there is sort of a point to make here. There is no  affirmative action on cities or localities to comply with this issue.  They are simply, again, as I said earlier, making a choice.   If they choose not to work through it the current way, then they are  giving up Federal funding. That is their choice. If they choose to do  it, they are giving up Federal funding. They are not being forced and  coerced. They are simply saying: You actually look at it; you make the  choice in how you want to do it; then explain it to your population. If  they are agreeing with that, that is your choice.   One of the things that often is said here is we trot out letters from  associations. And I agree. I respect the National Fraternal Order of  Police and mayors. They have a great thing. But they also represent  members who are, right now, actually, not in compliance with this, who  dislike this law. So, naturally, you would say part of their membership  is going to be supportive of them.   But, also, growing up in the household of a Georgia State trooper, I  also know a few things about law enforcement as well. Law enforcement  wants to protect the communities they serve, and they want to enforce  the law.    What is happening right now is that local law enforcement is deciding  how they are going to do this. They are not cooperating with ICE to  find a better way to work in their communities. They are simply saying:  We made a political choice to do something.   Well, Mr. Speaker, I think with the Constitution, this body has the  political choice to say: That is your choice; just do it without  Federal funds.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I will address my remarks to the Chair, but I also will  not stand here and let it be said from some political angle that the  son of a Georgia State trooper has anything less than respect for law  enforcement or wants anything more than to have law enforcement  agencies do their job. And this is exactly what we are talking about.  Do your job.   If you want to make a political statement, then work it out  politically. But this is: Do your job, keep the law.   I mean, what else--are we going to get another letter from another  police association saying: Well, we decided we are not going to enforce  Federal whatever else?   This is an issue that needs to be discussed, and I will just simply  say, from this perspective, of one who has lived it for 50 years and  who lived it under the same house for 21 years, no, there is no one  that respects law enforcement and their role more than this Member. And  this Member is simply reflecting a lot of views of law enforcement.   This says: Let us do our job. We will work on these issues, but you  are making a choice. If you don't want to enforce it, then don't take  the money. Do what you want to do. Just don't take the money.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), our former chairman of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher).    I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I do believe that in just a little bit we will be  debating this bill. I do believe in just a short time it will pass.   I think what was very interesting, Mr. Speaker, is the frustrations  of my friend, and I believe they are true frustrations, and the stories  of folks coming from terrible places around the world wanting to get  here. We are the light on a hill. We are the ones that everybody wants  to come to. I grant you that.   But I do have a question. For these folks who are leaving disaster,  places in which law and order are not enforced, in which people are  dying, and they are striving to get someplace else,  [[Page H5260]]  why in the world would we want to get to here to find that we have a  situation in which local law enforcement can sort of decide what they  want to do, where law and order is not followed?   You are leaving one area to get to an area in which what they say is  law and order is what is needed and what is followed and why they come  here, but yet we are saying no.   I think it has also been, possibly, Mr. Speaker, a vast  mischaracterization to say that all police are against this. In fact,  if we have seen, there was 200 that was identified earlier, the vast  majority of police departments in this country uphold the law. So let's  don't make a blanket assessment of police here.   I think it is just an interesting development here. I think you can  talk about laws. You can like laws, you cannot like laws, you can do  something about immigration.   But I do think we also need to address something else. It wasn't a  part of this bill, but we wanted to make it a part of this bill, and  that is comprehensive immigration reform.   I do agree with my friend. There needs to be immigration reform. I  think it needs to start with security and safety and protection. It  needs to start with actually enforcing law, and then begin the  foundation of finding a way to get workers here--our guest worker  program, our ag worker program, the things that we need to make our  expansion so that we do it properly. I agree completely.   But, Mr. Speaker, I do find it has been amazing here because, just in  the context of this debate, these were words that were used: We're  demagoguing this issue. We didn't have the guts to address this issue.  Our DNA of leadership is to obstruct or to not bring this forward.   Well, I think the one thing that I do need to remind is, this body,  Mr. Speaker, if you are very familiar with this, over the last few  weeks, we have been dealing with a very difficult issue--we passed it  out of the House--that is healthcare, which was passed when this body  was filled in a majority of a different party, my friends across the  aisle, when they had, at times, filibuster-proof majorities.   They worked to pass healthcare. They worked to pass Dodd-Frank. They  worked to pass their priorities.   My interesting question is, they did not work to pass comprehensive  immigration reform. I am not sure why now we decide that it is such  their issue that they are now blaming us, many of us who want to find a  way forward.   But I think the answer is plain and obvious in history. They chose  not to do it. I repeat, they chose not to do it.   So I think in the discussion of this battle, we will continue these  discussions. We will continue to have differences of opinion. I think  it is sort of amazing though that we do have to have a discussion here  on telling police to enforce the law and work out the details as we go,  work out what is in this bill.   But it also is about priorities, Mr. Speaker. For those of us who  have had to look at the tragedies left behind as a result of some of  these decisions that they have made to ``better'' their community, the  deaths, the tragedies, then it is a pretty interesting choice. Is the  death more important or less important than your policy?   All we are simply saying is: just don't take the money. Look at it  from that perspective.   And we will continue to have these debates. My friend and I will  continue to be passionately different on this, and that is okay. That  is what this floor is for because, at the end of the day, we are going  to have a vote. One side is going to win and one side is going to lose  in this vote. And the debate is going to happen, and the bill is going  to come forward. There will be another vote. And then it will go to the  Senate.   I disagree with my friend from Massachusetts, respect his opinion,  but, in this case, I believe the debate is fairly clear to most  Americans. All we are asking is, and what the current law already  states, follow the rules. And all we are simply saying is, follow the  rules.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 414 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       15) to provide for increases in the Federal minimum wage, and       for other purposes. All points of order against consideration       of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to       the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Education and the Workforce. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 15.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
