 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it has been a frightening 2 weeks for  tens of millions of Americans who support a woman's freedom to make her  own healthcare choices. Actually, if you believe the polls, there are  hundreds of millions of Americans in that category.   Republican legislators across the country have passed some of the  most extreme restrictions on a woman's right to choose. With  breathtaking speed, they are trying to take us backward, but they have  already provoked a fierce reaction among the American people.   Just yesterday, I stood with hundreds before the Supreme Court to  speak on behalf of Americans everywhere who believe that women don't  deserve to be treated this way by their government. Meanwhile, here in  the Senate, the Republican leader is once again stalling--it seems to  be his MO--on a bill to improve legal protections for women who are  victims of domestic abuse, assault, and stalking. This is VAWA, or the  Violence Against Women Act.   VAWA has been a landmark piece of legislation, and it has greatly  reduced the abuse of women. Well, there was an improved and expanded  VAWA that was passed by the House of Representatives on a bipartisan  basis. It got significant Republican votes. It brings much needed  updates to existing Federal law. It finally expands protections to  women who are victims of violence from domestic partners or former  partners, not just current or former spouses. It also says that if you  are known to stalk your partner or have a restraining order against  you, you shouldn't be allowed to purchase a gun. Thanks to the work of  some of my colleagues in both Chambers, it also brings renewed  attention to violence against Native American women who are so often  overlooked.   I thank Senators Smith, Klobuchar, and Cantwell for bringing  attention to this bill later today.   Unfortunately, Leader McConnell has indicated that he will not bring  the House-passed VAWA bill to the floor, despite these many commonsense  reforms. Why not? I hope it is not because the gun lobby reflexively  opposes any restrictions on gun purchases--even for convicted stalkers.  I hope that is not the impediment here, because as Senator Klobuchar  has pointed out, if you are abused by your husband, then, you are  protected by VAWA. If you are abused by a boyfriend, you are not. What  is the difference? What is the difference?   VAWA is yet another example of how Leader McConnell has turned this  Chamber into a legislative graveyard. Even the most commonsense bills,  with broad support from one end of America to the other, that are  passed by the House--here, a bill protecting women from violence--meet  the grim fate at the hands of the Senate's self-proclaimed Grim Reaper.   What a shame. The Violence Against Women Act is precisely the kind of  legislation the American people expect the Senate to consider. During a  difficult few weeks for women across  [[Page S3019]]  America, the Senate could have sent a strong, positive signal by moving  forward on the Violence Against Women Act. Instead, Leader McConnell  carved out another tombstone for his legislative graveyard--another  popular bipartisan bill buried with no action by the Senate and tied by  the leader in partisan gridlock.                            ____________________     Madam President, earlier this month, a report from  Hawaii's Mauna Loa Observatory found that carbon dioxide levels in our  atmosphere have now reached the highest level in human history--in  human history. It was a chilling reminder that the threat from climate  change is real, immediate, and existential. Almost everyone accepts  this science and the gravity of the threat it portends. The only group  of folks that still seem skeptical of climate science are Republicans  and the Trump administration.   Yesterday the New York Times reported that the Trump EPA is planning  to rewrite the established benchmarks for unsafe levels of air  pollution. You heard that right. They are planning to use dubious math  to obscure the real and long-known health risks of air pollution. These  new formulations would result in fewer predicted deaths than what the  experts have long agreed to. People will still die. The numbers will  just be wrong about the effect.   Why, might you ask, would anyone want to obscure the full health  risks of air pollution? Because then the Trump administration could use  the fake math to justify further rollbacks to clean air rules at a time  when global warming is increasing and when Americans know the danger.  This Trump administration and the Republican majority are rolling the  clock back--more carbon, more coal, more oil, and more gas, when we  need less. We all know that.   What kind of Orwellian nonsense is this? The Environmental Protection  Agency making it easier to pollute the environment? It is a textbook  definition of ``dystopian.''   As my colleague Senator Whitehouse so often points out, dark money  lurks behind so much of what the Trump administration does. Big Oil,  Big Gas, and big polluters everywhere are the only possible boosters of  this decision. It is their money, funneled to political organizations  and politicians without a trace of disclosure, that motivates folks in  the Trump administration to make it easier to release more pollution  into the air.   We should be using the Senate to debate climate policies in search of  common ground, but Leader McConnell has decided to bring forward his  version of the Green New Deal just so his party could vote against it.  We know what Leader McConnell and the Republicans are against. What are  they for in dealing with climate change? So far, nada, zero, nothing-- they haven't put a single thing on the floor. The American people see  the effects of climate change in their lives, and they know Congress  must act. Only the Republican majority stands in the way.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
