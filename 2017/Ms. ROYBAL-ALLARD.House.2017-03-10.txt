 Mr. Speaker, President Trump and the Republican  Congress promised a better plan for health care that would be good for  all Americans.   Now that we have seen their plan, we know the truth. Passage of the  American Health Care Act will not improve health care or reduce  healthcare costs. Instead, it will cut critical health access and  benefits for children, older adults, pregnant women, communities of  color, and people living with disabilities.   If TrumpCare becomes law, it will destroy Medicaid as we know it,  while also increasing costs of health care for working class families  across the country.   It is unconscionable that this kind of destructive legislation should  be shoved through Congress without hearings or stakeholder input.   I urge my Republican colleagues to reject this shortsighted bill and  work with Democrats to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, a healthcare  plan that is working well for millions of Americans.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 154.   Stated against:
