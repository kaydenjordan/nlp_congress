 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to honor  an outstanding member of south Jersey. Over the weekend, Michael Bryan  of Dennis Township, New Jersey, achieved the great honor of being  raised to Eagle Scout. Michael is a member of the National Honor  Society and, for his Eagle Scout project, acquired the skills to weld a  stand for an American World War II plane propeller that was pulled out  of the Atlantic Ocean. It honors the 42 servicemembers who perished  during training at NAS Wildwood.   Michael plans to follow in the footsteps of his father and his  grandfather and enroll in the Coast Guard to bravely serve and defend  our country.   We are all looking for heroes. Some look to celebrities. Some look to  Washington, God help them. But I look to men like Michael Bryan who  make a difference in their community. He is south Jersey's hero. He is  an American hero.
