 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, Chairman  Smith, for yielding me time to speak on this important legislation.   It has become increasingly apparent with every major weather event  that our forecasting services are desperately in need of a major  overhaul. I am happy to support legislation that will do just that.   H.R. 353, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act, will  put our country's weather forecasting back on track to provide citizens  with lifesaving predictions and warnings.   I specifically point to this bill's innovative language on weather  technology planning. H.R. 353 calls on NOAA to evaluate the combination  of observing systems it needs to meet weather forecasting requirements.  It also requires the agency to conduct experiments on different  observing systems to evaluate their costs and benefits.   Such reforms will grant NOAA more flexibility to develop new  technologies while scrapping older approaches that do not bring enough  value to our forecasts. We need to better assess our observing system  resources instead of continuing to rely on outdated methods.   This bill will help push NOAA to consider new approaches, including  those from the private sector. For its part, the growing private sector  has signaled it is ready and willing to work with NOAA to bring better  weather forecasting to our citizens, and we should welcome this  development.   I am confident that H.R. 353 will create the kind of meaningful  change that we want to see at NOAA. This bill will better protect  American lives and property with more accurate weather forecasting. I  applaud the sponsors. I encourage all Members to support this bill.
