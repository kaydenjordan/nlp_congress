 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bipartisan approach to  autonomous vehicles reflected in the SELF DRIVE Act. As ranking member  of the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee, I have  been so pleased to be able to work with Chairman Latta to reach  agreements on the legislation before the House today. It is not the  bill I think that either one of us would have written on our own, but  it does reflect a bipartisan agreement that we reached after months of  negotiation, and I appreciate that very much.   Autonomous vehicles have great potential to improve safety on our  roads by reducing accidents caused by human error, which most accidents  are. My goal throughout this process has been to make sure that this  technology is deployed safely and that we also advance existing safety  technologies.   The SELF DRIVE Act lays out a framework for the National Highway  Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA,  [[Page H6672]]  to promote safe adoption of AVs. Mandatory safety assessment  certifications will ensure that NHTSA receives the data that it needs  to evaluate safety as autonomous vehicles appear on our roads. Within a  year of enactment, NHTSA will lay out a priority plan for what new  safety standards need to be written and which existing standards must  be updated. In addition, the bill requires manufacturers to write  cybersecurity and consumer privacy plans as they develop AV technology.   The legislation allows for exemptions to existing vehicle safety  standards. For example, there may be some vehicles that really don't  need a steering wheel. It is hard to imagine now. But we ensure that  NHTSA explains its process for granting any safety exemptions. The  maximum number of exemptions per automobile will scale up  incrementally.   To receive an exemption, a manufacturer must show equivalent safety,  a manufacturer must report crashes involving exempted vehicles, and  exempted vehicles must be listed in a public database.   This bill also has safety improvements that go beyond autonomous  vehicles. NHTSA will work to improve the performance of headlamps. In 2  years, NHTSA will issue a rule requiring an alert system to warn  drivers if a child or pet is left in the backseat. Already this year,  37 children have died from heatstroke after being left in hot cars.  This hot cars provision, which Congressman Tim Ryan, Congressman Peter  King, and I introduced as a standalone bill, will save lives.    A broad range of stakeholders have been involved and will be involved  in the future of self-driving workers. That is why we set up an  advisory council which will include industry, academics, labor, State  and local government, consumer advocates, and environmental experts.   As self-driving cars are developed, we must examine critical issues.  Will seniors and people with disabilities share in the benefits of  autonomous vehicles? Ensuring accessibility may require further policy  changes. We also need to grapple with the disruption self-driving cars  may cause in employment. Even though this legislation generally  excludes commercial vehicles--and additional clarity may be needed-- self-driving cars may displace workers who make their livelihoods  behind the wheel.   Once the House passes this bill, I look forward to working with  stakeholders and our Senate colleagues to send consensus legislation to  the President's desk. I believe we could go further to improve consumer  safety and strengthen protections to put consumers in control of their  data. We must also keep working to refine the Federal, State, and local  roles in ensuring safe roads and protecting access to courts when  necessary.   Mr. Speaker, today's vote is the next step in that process. I urge my  colleagues to vote in favor of the SELF DRIVE Act, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee, and I thank him for his support.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Matsui), a member of the Digital Commerce and  Consumer Protection Subcommittee and a major contributor to this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Eshoo), a member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), a member of the Digital Commerce and  Consumer Protection Subcommittee and someone who has put in a lot of  time and effort on this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to yield 2 minutes to  the gentlewoman from the great State of New York (Ms. Clarke), a member  of our subcommittee.   Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 3388, the  SELF DRIVE Act. As you may know, autonomous vehicles are the wave of  the future, and they are here now.   As innovative technology for these vehicles develop, our Nation's  transportation system will be transformed, decreasing the number of  traffic collisions, enhancing mobility for the elderly, disabled, and  poor, and lowering fuel consumption.   My constituents in the Ninth Congressional District of New York will  benefit greatly from autonomous vehicles, which will allow for smarter,  faster, and more fuel-efficient travel.   I am pleased that proper cybersecurity protections are included in  the legislation. As you may know, cybersecurity protections for self- driving vehicles is of great interest, particularly in today's  environment, to ensure that these vehicles not only meet technological  challenges, but there is a plan in place to meet public safety  standards and prevent and tackle potential hacks and/or terrorism.   I am so pleased that H.R. 3407, the legislation I introduced with  Congressman Adam Kinzinger is included in H.R. 3388. The cybersecurity  portion of the bill requires manufacturers to develop a written  cybersecurity policy. Within the cybersecurity policy, manufacturers  would address the following: one, a process for identifying, assessing,  and mitigating reasonable foreseeable vulnerabilities from cyber  attacks or unauthorized intrusions; and two, a process for taking  preventive and corrective action to mitigate against these  vulnerabilities, including incident response plans, intrusion  detection, and prevention systems that safeguard key controls, systems,  and procedures through testing and/or monitoring.   This legislation requires companies to develop a more comprehensive  cybersecurity plan, which can mitigate, correct, intersect, and  identify imminent threats. Fostering consumer confidence will include  ensuring an established system built to protect sensitive information  in our technological age. I am pleased to be a Member of this  committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney), my colleague on the Energy  and Commerce Committee.    Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, this has been a bipartisan effort. It has  been good. We made some progress. I want to say a few things, though.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of the SELF DRIVE Act. This legislation  puts us on a path towards safely deploying autonomous vehicles. I am  glad to see that it has strong bipartisan support.   Autonomous vehicles offer many benefits, including tremendous  lifesaving potential. Approximately 40,000 people are killed on our  highways every year in deadly automobile accidents. About 3,600 of  those accidents took place in my home State of California.   AVs can also transform mobility for millions of people who otherwise  face difficulty driving, such as seniors and those with disabilities,  including 3.8 million veterans in our country living with service- connected disabilities. That is more than 17 percent of veterans in  this country.   AVs can help connect underserved communities, as well as reduce  traffic congestion on our roads, and increase our Nation's productivity  and competitiveness in the global economy.   While I am glad that we are taking these steps for this legislation  today, our work cannot stop here. As the technology evolves, we must  ensure that the benefits are being maximized for consumers. This means  making sure that the vehicles are safely and appropriately tested, that  strong consumer privacy and cybersecurity protections are in place, and  that we are fully preparing Americans for the new employment  opportunities that this industry will create.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have  remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Illinois has 3\1/2\  minutes remaining. The gentleman from Ohio has 7\1/2\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the Congressman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), the ranking member of the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the  majority and minority of the Energy and Commerce Committee for bringing  this unanimous legislation to the floor on self-driving vehicles, which  are revolutionizing the way we conceptualize travel.   Self-driving cars have the potential to lower our infrastructure and  mobility costs, enhance safety on our roads, and enhance mobility in  our cities.   However, like any complex technology, self-driving cars pose new  challenges for the regulatory landscape and our labor markets. That is  why I am pleased to support H.R. 3388, the SELF DRIVE Act, which seeks  to foster innovation in this space while offering protection for  consumers.   The SELF DRIVE Act is one of the many important bills that will need  to be considered by Congress in order to define Federal and State  regulatory roles, provide the U.S. Department of Transportation the  tools it needs to update safety standards, and ensure that the American  people are not left behind as we transition to a 21st century  workforce. Particularly, I am pleased to see that H.R. 3388 allows the  creation of the Highly Automated Vehicle Advisory Council.

[[Page H6676]]    I have been working on separate legislation to create a new  retraining program for workers who are displaced from their jobs due to  the adoption of autonomous vehicle technology. I am very grateful for  Representative Joe Barton and Representative Bob Latta's staff for  working with my office to craft and refine that legislation. I believe  that we are getting closer to a final product, which will ultimately  recognize the inevitable changes to the labor market that this country  will experience in the face of automated technologies.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 3388. I know that members  of the Energy & Commerce Committee have worked tirelessly to bring this  measure to the floor after hundreds of meetings with relevant  stakeholders. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill and look  forward to working cooperatively with members on other bills that will  address other aspects of self-driving vehicles and the ramifications  that will have on our economy and our country.                                time  1200     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Ryan), the sponsor and my partner on the HOT CARS Act,  included in this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me just say some thank  yous. I thank the chairman of our subcommittee, Chairman Latta, for his  great work. I also thank Chairman Walden, and, of course, all of the  staff on his side of the aisle for their work to help us reach this  bipartisan agreement. I especially want to thank them for the inclusion  of the HOT CARS legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Pallone on our side and also  thank Michelle Ash, Lisa Goldman, Caroline Paris-Behr, and my staff,  Matt Hayward, for their great work on the subcommittee on this  legislation.   We will continue working together to send consensus legislation. I  appreciate the opportunity to work with Chairman Latta and to get this  to the floor today as a suspension bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  3440, the DREAM Act, to protect Monica, an Illinois DREAMer with a  nursing degree, who has dedicated her life to taking care of others.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas), my colleague, for the purpose of a  unanimous consent request.
