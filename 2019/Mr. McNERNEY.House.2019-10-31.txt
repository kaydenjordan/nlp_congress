 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a group of  talented students in my district who recently earned the title of Mock  Trial World Champions.   Venture Academy's mock trial team was one of 38 teams that traveled  to New York to compete for this honor in the Empire Mock Trial World  Championship. They successfully argued a fictional case involving a  construction company that was accused of failing to take proper safety  precautions by portraying the prosecutors and defendants as well as the  witnesses in the case. They ended up bringing back the top prize to  Stockton.   This isn't Venture Academy's first big success. Last year the team  placed fifth in the Empire contest, and for the past 6 years they have  won first place in the San Joaquin County mock trial competition.   One day some of these students could come here and stand at this  podium, putting their debate skills to work while arguing for or  against important legislation.   So, Madam Speaker, please join me in congratulating Venture Academy's  mock trial team, the Mock Trial World Champions.                            ____________________
