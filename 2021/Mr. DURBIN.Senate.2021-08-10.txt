 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this past Saturday, at 9 p.m., Chicago  Police Officer Ella French was shot and killed during a traffic stop on  the Chicago South Side.   Her death is devastating. Officer French was 29 years old. She had  served as a member of the Chicago Police Department since 2018.   Her brother described her as the epitome of a good Samaritan. A  fellow officer said of her: ``She truly showed the community that she  loved them and would do anything for them.''   Officer French's partner was also shot and critically wounded. We  pray for his recovery.   Two men have been charged by the Cook County State Attorney's Office  in the shooting of these officers. A third man has been charged by the  U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois for  conspiracy to violate Federal firearms laws.   I hope that justice is delivered swiftly and fairly for the  perpetrators of this horrible crime.   And let me be clear. As devastating as her death is, scores of  individuals are shot every week in Chicago, and many lose their lives.  For each of their families, the loss is just as intense as the loss of  Officer French.   And as heartbreaking as Officer French's death is, it is also  infuriating. We learned yesterday from the Chicago U.S. Attorney's  Office that the gun used to murder Officer French was straw-purchased  from a gun dealer in Indiana.   What is a straw purchase? It happens when a person who can pass a  background check buys a gun and gives it to a person who can't.   Straw purchases have long been the way that guns have been funneled  into the hands of those with felony convictions in Chicago, then to the  streets, then to deadly incidents.   According to the charges filed yesterday by the U.S. attorney, an  Indiana man bought the handgun from a man in Hammond, IN, and gave to  it a person with a felony conviction, who allegedly used it this last  weekend to kill Officer French.   For years, I have been fighting to toughen our laws against straw  purchases. Right now, straw-purchasing is treated--listen to this--as a  Federal paperwork violation for lying on a Federal gun purchase form.  Charges are rarely brought, and when they are, the sentences are often  just a matter of months. That needs to change.   I have joined with Senator Leahy of Vermont and Senator Collins of  Maine to introduce the Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act, a  bipartisan bill that would make it an explicit Federal crime, carrying  felony penalties when a person straw-purchases a firearm.   We need to take this type of gun trafficking seriously. It is time  for us to stop treating straw purchases like a paperwork misdemeanor.   As we have learned in the death of Officer French, it is a deadly act  and should be punished accordingly.   Officer French's death is also a call to action for the strike force  recently set up by the Department of Justice to crack down on regional  firearms trafficking in Chicago.   I met with Attorney General Garland in Chicago when he launched the  strike force 2 weeks ago, and I have written to him now urging that the  strike force immediately prioritize the investigation and prosecution  of straw purchases like the one that took the life of Officer French.   The strike force was established to keep a sustained focus on  firearms trafficking in Chicago. That focus should include stopping  straw purchases and holding the perpetrators accountable.   I look forward to working with the Justice Department and with my  colleagues to find ways to crack down on the deadly gun violence that  straw purchasers help to fuel.                               Opioid Epidemic    Mr. President, 2020 set a record for drug overdose deaths in America.  More than 93,000 lives were lost in the year 2020. In Illinois, 3,500  of our neighbors died of overdose, a 27-percent spike from the year  before.   How did we get to this point? Who is responsible for this?   There is one clear culprit: the pharmaceutical industry. For years,  opioid manufacturers deliberately lied about the risks of their drugs-- deliberately. These companies have claimed their pain killers should be  prescribed for common aches and pains. They even downplayed their  addictive nature even though their research showed that it was a very  real danger.   These companies then shipped mountains of these pills to every corner  of America. They aggressively promoted them to doctors, with the  backing of dark money organizations.   This epidemic wasn't created by some infectious virus; it was created  by corporate greed--corporate greed. In the words of Richard Sackler of  Purdue Pharma his company chose to flood our streets with ``a blizzard  of prescriptions that will bury the competition.'' It ended up burying  the users.    As a result, 500,000 Americans families have had to bury loved ones  who died of opioid overdoses and addictions since the start of the  opioid epidemic--500,000 Americans, a figure in the same range as the  610,000 Americans we have lost to COVID-19. The numbers are numbing.   From 2006 to 2014, drug companies like Purdue Pharma inundated the  country with 100 billion pain pills--100 billion. Let that soak in.  That is roughly 300 opioid pills for every living American over that  time.  [[Page S6196]]    They flooded communities like the rural county of Hardin in downstate  Illinois. They received enough opioids in Hardin County for each  resident to have a nearly 3-month supply.   Some counties in West Virginia and Kentucky had twice that level of  oversupply.   One pharma rep even bragged: ``I don't know how they can even house  this many bottles.''   Another wrote:         Keep `em comin'! Flyin' out of here. It's like people are       addicted to these things. Oh, wait, people are . . .    That level of greed and disregard for human suffering is an outrage,  and the companies responsible must be held accountable.   You may be asking: Why haven't we done that already?   It is a good question--because not only was the Federal Drug  Enforcement Administration aware of this obscene volume of  overproduction; they authorized it. They gave permission.   The Drug Enforcement Administration of the U.S. Federal Government is  responsible for determining the amount of opioid pills allowed to be  put on the market each year. They are effectively the gatekeeper for  these drug manufacturers and for years--years--they allowed opioid  production quotas to keep increasing.   Between 1993 and 2015, production of oxycodone increased 39-fold;  hydrocodone, 12-fold; fentanyl, 25-fold.   In 2016, America's pharmaceutical industry produced 14 billion opioid  doses in 2016 alone, enough for every adult American to have a 3-week  supply of opioids.   Think about that. Authorized by the Federal Government, requested by  the pharmaceutical industry, we put a quota that Pharma asked for to  produce 14 billion opioid pills in a year, enough for every American to  have a 3-week supply.   Any wonder that we had an opioid epidemic?   I pressed the Drug Enforcement Administration on this issue years  ago, when I learned of this. I asked them: How can you approve these  ever-increasing quotas. Pharma is insatiable. They will ask for as many  pills as they can possibly push into the American people's families,  especially when DEA had data that showed this overproduction was  fueling a deadly national drug crisis.   A couple years ago I worked with my Republican colleague, Senator  John Kennedy of Louisiana, to start stemming the tide of addictive  drugs. We passed a bipartisan bill that gave the DEA the authority they  said they needed to set commonsense production levels.   We changed the law so the DEA must--must--consider abuse, overdose  deaths, and the public health impact when determining opioid quotas.   Our approach worked, partially. Over the past 5 years, the DEA has  lowered opioid quotas by an average of 60 percent.   The DEA, this Federal Agency, will soon be proposing its 2022 quotas,  and I am sending a letter urging them to use their new authority and  common sense to rein in the greed of Big Pharma.   In the face of all this suffering, new legal challenges have been  brought to hold Big Pharma accountable for death and despair of the  opioid epidemic. Thousands of lawsuits from States, counties, cities,  and victims have been consolidated in one Federal court in Cleveland,  OH.   This movement reminded me of another breakthrough moment in public  health, when our Nation came together to hold Big Tobacco accountable  for its misleading marketing over the decades. We started holding these  companies accountable in 1998, with the Master Tobacco Settlement  Agreement. That settlement was estimated to provide States with $246  billion over 25 years. But despite the pressing need, only a tiny  fraction--a meager 8 percent of that amount--was actually dedicated to  tobacco prevention and cessation activities.   Instead, tens of billions from that settlement have gone toward  filling gaps in State budgets and funding pet projects like roads and  bridges and stadiums, even a tobacco museum.   As new opioid settlements are reached, we must learn from the missed  opportunity with tobacco lawsuits. We must ensure that the funds from  forthcoming opioid settlements are used to fortify health systems so  they can respond to the current opioid crisis and prevent our next drug  epidemic   All of us know what is going on out there. Even people who  acknowledge their opioid addiction and are desperate for treatment and  need help immediately wait for weeks and months to enter a drug rehab  facility. That is just unacceptable. We need community- and  residential-based treatment. We need to expand naloxone access. We need  to address the childhood trauma often at the root of addiction and  other public health strategies.   One of the things which I believe is essential, as our kids get back  to school after the pandemic experience, is that we need more  counselors on the scene at the schools dealing with these kids and this  transition back into somewhat normal life. These are critical moments  in a child's formation, and I hope that we can have resources available  to help them.   The best way to hold Big Pharma accountable is by compelling these  companies to pay the price for fueling this crisis, and their  restitution should be devoted to helping America heal.   Last month, a bipartisan group of State attorneys general announced  the framework of a litigation settlement involving Johnson & Johnson  and the Nation's three largest drug distributors. The companies would  pay a total of $26 billion over 18 years to resolve the suits, in  addition to changing their business practices.   The work isn't over yet, and I applaud the State attorneys general  for their extensive work involving these opioid defendants.   Legal proceedings continue for several other key industry  stakeholders that have yet to be held accountable--that includes the  Sackler family of Purdue and OxyContin infamy.   The Sacklers are trying to engineer a legal scheme to escape  liability through the bankruptcy court. That is the family that started  Purdue Pharma, which was responsible for this opioid crisis. They think  they found a venue now--a bankruptcy court--that is going to get them  off the hook or at least make sure they can protect the money that they  have made off of this criminal enterprise.   The Sacklers are trying to engineer a legal scheme to escape  liability for their conduct through the bankruptcy court, avoiding  future lawsuits, while paying $4.5 billion, while protecting their vast  fortunes estimated at over $11 billion.   That is why Senator Warren and I recently teamed up to introduce the  Nondebtor Release Prohibition Act, which would prevent the  nonconsensual release of liability through bankruptcy proceedings.   Translation: The Sacklers should not get a discounted ticket to ride  into the sunset protecting their billions of dollars. They need to be  held personally liable, and the amount charged against them should be  taken into account.   We must demand that the worst corporate actors are held accountable  for their role in this crisis. Far too many families have suffered as a  result of corporate greed and malfeasance.                          Recognizing Barb's Bakery    Mr. President, sometimes you have the best of luck in life, and it is  not planned. Neighbors of ours in Springfield, IL, Tom and Bridget  Lamont, have invited us to join them at their little house on Lake  Michigan in Leelanau Peninsula in the State of Michigan. In that time,  we have had great experiences together, and we have come to know a  terrific little shop called Barb's Bakery in Northport, MI. After years  and years of wonderful service and great pride, they are giving up the  business soon.   I have put in the Record a tribute to Barb's Bakery of Northport, MI.  I am joined by Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, both Senators from  Michigan   Mr. President, donuts have been enjoying a renaissance in recent  years. Today, you can find ``gourmet'' donuts with flavors like  kumquat, beet, guava, bacon maple, malted, salted cookie dough, and  blueberry bourbon basil. But for my money, nothing beats the famed cake  donuts and cinnamon twists baked fresh every morning at Barb's Bakery  in the small town of Northport, MI. There is nothing exotic about  Barb's donuts. They are simple, old-fashioned perfection.   My wife Loretta and I discovered Barb's Bakery years ago during a  vacation in Northport with our friends,  [[Page S6197]]  Tom and Bridget Lamont, and we have gone back nearly every year since.  Over the years, we have become friends with the owner, Barb Holcomb,  and her husband Jerry Holcomb--great people.   When Loretta and I first discovered her bakery, Barb's donuts may  have been the primary reason that travelers would make a detour through  Northport, a picturesque little village at the tip of Michigan's scenic  Leelanau Peninsula. That has all changed now. In recent years, new  restaurants and shops have sprung up around town. But Barb's Bakery  remains the anchor, both a destination--and a local institution. Each  morning, it brings local cherry farmers, young families, and tourists  together over coffee and donuts.   I try to stop by Barb's a little after 6 a.m., shortly after Barb or  Jerry opens the doors. I will get a cup of coffee and a cinnamon twist,  and Jerry and I will sit with the locals sharing local news and  figuring out how to solve the problems of the world. Barb starts her  workday at 1 a.m. each morning. That is when she goes to work to mix  the batter for the next day's baking. By 6:30, the benches outside are  usually filled with local farmers and retirees. At around 8 am, the  late sleepers and tourists show up. But by 10:30 or 11, the last donut  has usually been sold--so insider tip: Get there early.   You can smell the aroma of Barb's Bakery about 2 blocks away. Barb  tells me the butter-yellow, clapboard bakery building was first  constructed around 1850. Over the years, it has housed a dentist's  office, a shoe repair shop, and now, Barb's bakery.   Barb first start working there when she was 13. She bakes her  signature cinnamon twists on massive trays that hold about 6 dozen  twists each. On an average day, she sells six trays full. Donuts are  another big seller--classic cake donuts, plain or chocolate-iced--plus  the special, seasonal flavors: cherry during cherry season and pumpkin  in the fall. And Barb bakes the best cherry pies you have ever tasted.   Barb learned how to make her famous cinnamon twists from the women  who owned the bakery when Barb was a teenager. Now, Barb is getting  ready to pass that precious knowledge on. After 40 years of baking for  others, Barb Holcomb recently sold her bakery to a young couple from  the area, who plan to keep baking some of Barb's signature treats,   And Barb and Jerry are looking forward to taking a little time off  and maybe sleeping late every once in a while. Barb plans to put quite  a few miles on the royal blue 1970s Cadillac she just bought. She will  continue to give generously, and quietly, to the people and the village  of Northport, as she always has. And Barb and Jerry are hoping to do  some traveling.   Years ago, shortly after she graduated from high school, Barb and a  girlfriend took a magical trip through Greece and Afghanistan. And Barb  fell in love with Turkey. She returned again and again, often bringing  friends with her. She bought a house in Istanbul, which she kept for  many years. And she learned to speak Turkish fluently.   As Barb and Jerry get ready to start a new chapter of their lives  together, Loretta and I want to thank them for all of the delicious  donuts and for their friendship. And Michigan Senators, Debbie Stabenow  and Gary Peters, want to join me in saluting Barb and Jerry.   Let me close by saying to Barb: ``Iyi sanslar.'' Best of luck, my  friends.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following  the Klobuchar amendment, the following amendments be in order and that  the amendments be reported by number, with no amendments in order prior  to a vote in relation to the amendment: Capito, No. 3284; Boozman, No.  3103; and Braun, No. 3114.    I announce that the Senator from New Hampshire (Mrs.  Shaheen) is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, at my request this amendment incorporates  language reflecting Democratic priorities funded by the budget  resolution, including smart and effective border security measures like  nonintrusive inspection systems, hiring additional Customs officers for  screening at lawful ports of entry, hiring additional immigration  judges and asylum officers to reduce backlogs and enhance the  efficiency and fairness of the asylum system.   I thank the Senator from Kansas for accepting these changes, and I  support his amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3795     Mr. President, this has been a historic day in the U.S.  Senate. We started by passing a bipartisan infrastructure bill that  made history, and now the Senator from Missouri is finally coming  around to supporting the COPS Hiring Program that was created by  Senator Joe Biden in 1994.   Since its creation, the COPS Program--listen to this--has helped over  13,000 local police departments hire over 134,000 officers. We believe  in it on the Democratic side. We are glad you have come around.   We sent a letter to the Appropriations Committee, signed by 37  Democrats, for the COPS Program. Do you know how many Republicans  signed the letter? None. But with your amendment tonight, clearly you  have come around. The Republicans are joining the Democrats in  supporting Joe Biden's COPS Program. You are right: We need 100,000  more police. And we stand with Joe Biden's program and are glad that  you have joined us.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2734     Mr. President, imagine it is 3 in the morning, in a  desert, on our border, and the Border Patrol is out there and finds a  family--a mother and a father and two small children.   What do they do when they are 50 miles away from a port of entry?   They obviously take them to that port of entry, but according to the  Marshall amendment, they can't do it.   Listen to his language: ``[p]rohibiting migrants who have not  received a negative COVID-19 test from being transported.''   They can't be transported out of the desert because they don't have a  negative COVID-19 test? And what if they show up at the detention  center--and I have mentioned this to Dr. Marshall already--and there is  a new person walking in who happens to be a mother who is in labor and  needs to go to a hospital immediately?   According to your language, they cannot be transported unless they  have a negative COVID-19 test.   I would say to you, Doctor, that is not good medicine; that is not  humane. I asked you to change those provisions. I gave you language to  do that. I am sorry you didn't.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3797     Madam President, we all agree on one basic thing: No one  who is dangerous to the United States should be allowed to come to this  country. And those who are here and not citizens who are guilty of a  serious crime should be removed from this country.   That is the highest law enforcement priority not only of those  gathered here but also of the Biden administration.   The Hagerty amendment, though, makes it clear that he is seeking to  increase funding for detention and deportation of more undocumented  immigrants who have been convicted of any crime in the United States-- not a serious crime, not a violent crime, any crime--including  nonviolent misdemeanors.   The ICE Agency has sufficient funds to carry out its law enforcement  function, with a total budget of over $8 billion. This overly broad  amendment does not distinguish between the crimes committed by  individuals, the serious ones versus those that are not.   It would divert ICE from focusing its resources on the truly serious  public safety and national security threats. I urge my colleagues to  vote against this amendment.    Madam President, the Senator from Mississippi has stated  her case explicitly: If a prosecutor fails to prosecute a case, the  town or community that he represents as prosecutor--the town or  community--will be denied Federal funds. Think about this. Under the  Senator's amendment, if a district attorney decides not to charge a  certain property offense, even in just one case, the whole town will  lose its eligibility for Federal funding under programs like the  Violence Against Women Act--we know what that is; it is certainly a  refuge for many people who are victims of domestic violence--or the  Bulletproof Vest Grant Act to protect law enforcement in that same  community. They would lose their opportunity for Federal grants under  the Senator's amendment that she is offering.   I think we ought to think carefully about this. Prosecutors decide  whether to proceed with a case or not proceed based on the amount of  evidence, the likelihood of conviction, the possibility of securing a  plea bargain for a lesser offense. To deny a community Federal funds--   --or the police--I hope all of my colleagues would oppose  this amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3568     Madam President, the Grassley amendment would exclude  from a path to citizenship any undocumented immigrant who has been  convicted of any crime or who has been merely charged with a crime.  This is a broad exclusion, applies to any criminal conviction no matter  how long ago it took place, how minor the crime, and to any criminal  charge even if the individual is ultimately exonerated.  [[Page S6235]]    This exclusion is also unnecessary because every legalization bill  pending in the Senate requires a criminal background check and excludes  individuals convicted of a serious crime. For example, the bipartisan  House-passed Dream and Promise Act would bar an immigrant from  receiving legal status if they have been convicted of any felony, any  drug offense, or any crime of domestic violence.   Also, we have to accept the obvious: Crossing the border illegally  can be a crime, if one wants to be charged with that. This amendment is  inconsistent with due process and does nothing to increase public  safety.   I urge my colleagues to vote no.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3650
