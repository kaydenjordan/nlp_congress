 Mr. Speaker, I thank our incredible Chairwoman Waters and  our committee staff for working with me on an amendment and, again, for  their leadership on the bill as a whole.   I am proud to represent Michigan's 13th Congressional District, a  community that is incredibly diverse. Our diversity, as we all know, is  our strength.   We also know, though, that the way our government currently tracks  race and ethnicity is outdated and definitely needs to change. Our  government currently considers all people of Middle Eastern and North  African descent to be ``White,'' a categorization that myself and many  in our community consider to be very inaccurate. Our government  currently has broad categories that lump together whole continents,  ignoring the vast diversity of our people living here.   So my amendment simply builds on Congresswoman Jayapal's amendment to  ensure that we are providing the maximum flexibility possible to  Americans so that they can accurately reflect their race and ethnicity  on government forms. This, in turn, will help us in Congress and our  government at large to better identify issues affecting specific  communities so that we can have programs that effectively serve our  diverse communities.
