 Mr. President, today I recognize Ms. Emily Patrolia, a  Knauss Sea Grant fellow on the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce,  Science, and Transportation, for all of the hard work she has done for  me, my staff, and other members of the committee over the past year.  Ms. Patrolia has used her scientific expertise to inform public policy.  I would like to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Ms.  Patrolia for all of the fine work she has done.   Ms. Patrolia has had a significant impact during her time as a  fellow. She has worked on several pieces of legislation that have  passed the Senate and several others being considered by the Committee  on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Her contributions have helped  ensure the proper management of our natural resources and the continued  protection and prosperity of our Nation. I would like to extend my  sincere thanks and appreciation to Ms. Patrolia and wish her success in  the years to come.                            ____________________
