 Mr. Speaker, merry Christmas. I thank Chairman Graves  for yielding and for his leadership this year as we have worked to  address many challenging issues that are facing our aviation industry.   Hopefully, soon we will be celebrating enactment of the FAA  reauthorization bill that was shepherded through the House in July  rather than debating additional short-term extensions. However, Mr.  Speaker, here we are, and I rise in support of the Airport and Airway  Extension Act.   This legislation will continue the current authorization of the  Airport Improvement Program, Essential Air Service, and other key  programs through March while we wait for the Senate to act on H.R.  3935.   As we know, our Nation's airports--including Hartsfield-Jackson,  which serves my home State of Georgia and, by the way, is the busiest  in the world--are constantly working to build new infrastructure in  response to rising demand for passenger and cargo services.   They depend on AIP to keep those projects rolling and people and  goods flying. That is why I support the Airport and Airway Extension  Act, but I also call on the Senate to act quickly on our long-term FAA  reauthorization bill, which will modernize FAA operations, grow the  aviation workforce, strengthen the general aviation sector, improve the  passenger experience, and so much more.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House to support the bill  before us today and look forward to continuing our work to keep  America's skies the safest and most efficient in the world.
