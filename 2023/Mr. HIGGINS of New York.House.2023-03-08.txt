 Madam Speaker, last week the Buffalo Fire  Department lost a brother, and western New York lost a hero in the line  of duty during a four-alarm fire on Main Street in the city of Buffalo.   Jason Arno was a 3-year member of the Buffalo Fire Department serving  at Engine 2, one of the busiest companies in the city.   A son, a brother, a husband, a father, and a friend, Jason was  committed to putting his life on the line each day for the community  that he loved.   As our city mourns this tragic loss, we are once again reminded of  the bravery and the sacrifice it takes as a first responder.   While Jason is laid to rest this Friday, our hearts are heavy. Our  thoughts are with the Arno family, the  [[Page H1160]]  western New York community, and his brothers and sisters of Buffalo  Professional Firefighters Local 282.   The city of good neighbors and a grateful nation are forever indebted  to firefighter Jason Arno for his selfless sacrifice.                            ____________________
