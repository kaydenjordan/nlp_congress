 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the 2024 National  Defense Authorization Act.   Madam Speaker, I commend Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Smith for  their leadership, and I thank both sides of the aisle for their  vigorous debate while working together to create a bill that is focused  on the defense and security of our Nation.   The NDAA passed through the House Armed Services Committee by a vote  of 59-1. This shows that Republicans and Democrats can work together to  solve our Nation's problems. This committee put national security first  and set an example on how to bring a bipartisan bill to the United  States House floor.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the fiscal year 2024  NDAA on behalf of our Nation and the American warfighter.
