 Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to urge  that Congress speak with one voice, at a critical time, on an urgent  matter.   The fight for freedom is being waged in Ukraine right now, and the  outcome is going to have profound effects not just in Eastern Europe  but around the globe.   Russia has invaded Ukraine twice in the last 8 years, illegally  annexing Crimea, inserting troops and offensive military equipment into  the Donbas region in the east. They have initiated cyber attacks  against public and private entities in Ukraine, and they continue to  use disinformation to try to destabilize the democratically elected  government in Kyiv.   Now, the Russians have gone further by amassing more than 100,000  troops under the command of 100 tactical groups on Russia's Ukrainian  border. This Russian deployment includes rockets, tanks, and artillery,  and it is no longer just on the eastern border of Ukraine but now on  the northern border, where Russian combat troops and heavy equipment  have moved into Belarus and in Crimea in the Black Sea area.   Let me give a little history as to how we got here. Eight years ago,  Ukraine made a choice. The people of Ukraine stood up to a corrupt  Russian-backed government in 2014 and made a conscious decision to turn  to the West--to the European Union, to the United States.   I was in Ukraine in 2014 shortly after what is called the Euromaidan  or the Revolution of Dignity. When I was there in 2014, the Revolution  of Dignity barricades were still up, and in the center of town, the  Maidan was still occupied by Ukrainian patriots who were determined  that their country not go backwards.   The Ukrainian people at that time rejected authoritarianism. They  said instead they were choosing democracy, freedom of speech, and  freedom to gather, respect for the rule of law and free markets-- turning to us.   Despite Russia's unrelenting efforts at destabilization over the past  8 years, the Ukrainian people are more committed than ever to an  independent, sovereign, and democratic nation. And Ukrainians today are  increasingly patriotic and opposed to the Russian efforts to  destabilize their country. They don't want state control, repression,  and fear; they choose liberty and prosperity.   Moscow would have the world believe that somehow this massive,  unwarranted Russian buildup is about trying to shore up its border  against threats from Ukraine and NATO. This is, of course, patently  false. Ukraine's military posture has always been purely defensive,  and, unlike Russia, Ukraine has up held its commitments under the Minsk  agreements, which were designed to ensure a ceasefire in Eastern  Ukraine in the Donbas region.   NATO, of course, is a defensive alliance and is no threat to Russian  territorial integrity. NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg  recently told reporters that the ``significant movement'' of Russian  troops into Ukraine's neighbor, Belarus, is the ``biggest Russian  deployment there since the Cold War.'' And Russian troop numbers in  Belarus are likely to climb to 30,000, with the backing of special  forces, advanced fighter jets, short-range ballistic missiles, and S- 400 ground-to-air missile defense systems. This is new.   By the way, Ukraine is not asking for us to fight these wars for  them. They have been in a war with Russia over the past 8 years. They  have lost over 14,000 Ukrainians to this battle, including at the line  of contact, where there has been a hot conflict. I have been to the  line of contact. I have seen it. I have seen where the Russian snipers  have killed Ukrainian soldiers. I have talked to the soldiers from  Ukraine, who are determined, committed, and patriotic.   Fourteen thousand people--if you compare the population of Ukraine to  our population here in the United States of America, that would be the  equivalent of us losing about 120,000 Americans over the past 8 years  to an enemy. That is more people than we lost in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq,  and Afghanistan combined. Think how we would feel. This is how the  Ukrainians feel.   Ukraine is not asking, again, for us to fight their war for them, but  they are asking for increased lethal military assistance to help defend  themselves should Russia make a big mistake and decide to invade  further into Ukraine.  [[Page S579]]    When it comes to our allies, I have been pleased that most have  really stepped up to help Ukraine during this crisis. The British have  provided anti-tank missiles. When I was in Ukraine recently with the  congressional delegation, as we left the airport--this was about 3  weeks ago--a cargo plane arrived--an American-made cargo plane--with  weapons from the U.K. The United Kingdom was providing anti-tank  weapons to Ukraine. I saw them being unloaded, and I saw the smiles on  the faces of the Ukrainians knowing that this will give them a better  chance to defend themselves. We appreciate the Brits.   The Canadians have helped, specifically recently providing important  training on some of the new equipment they are getting. The Danes have  helped with additional funding, and the Baltics have transferred  weapons as well. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have all been strongly  supportive. Poland has been so supportive--and so many others.   We need all of our allies to step up like that--certainly all of our  NATO allies but, really, all freedom-loving countries around the world.  This is where the cause of freedom is being fought right now.   My hope is that Congress can come together and speak with one voice-- Republicans and Democrats alike--pass bipartisan sanctions legislation  and an aid package that sends a strong message of support to the  Ukrainian people, a message that we stand with them in their fight for  freedom but also sends a strong message to Russia that, if they choose  to invade further, the armed conflict will carry a heavy cost, the  sanctions will be devastating--and, finally, legislation that sends a  strong message to the world that the United States stands with its  allies in Eastern Europe and throughout freedom-loving countries across  the world.   The time to speak is now, with one voice. The world is listening and  watching.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the Senate floor  today to speak in support of a bill sponsored by the entire Ohio  delegation naming the post office in Avondale--of Cincinnati, OH--for  two World War II aviators: John Leahr and Herbert Heilbrun.   These two remarkable men--one Black and one White--grew up in  Avondale, which is a neighborhood which is part of Cincinnati, OH. They  dreamed of flying and signed up for the Army Air Corps after Pearl  Harbor. John Leahr flew the P-51 Mustang with the Tuskegee Airmen, and  Herb Heilbrun flew the B-17 bomber.   The Tuskegee fighters were assigned to protect the bombers in the  European theater. John and Herb worked together on some of the same  missions, but as World War II airmen, they were segregated and did not  interact. They didn't get to know each other until more than 50 years  after the war ended.   In 1997, Herb Heilbrun discovered that an event for the Tuskegee  Airmen was going to be held in downtown Cincinnati. He decided to stop  by and thank the fighter pilots who helped protect him and his bomber  and his bomber squad in Europe.   There, Herb met John Leahr, and the two men hit it off and discovered  how much they had in common. They found out they had both grown up in  Avondale and both spent time waiting for training working at the same  engine plant: Wright Aeronautical in Lockland, OH. They realized they  had been in the same third grade class at North Avondale Elementary  School. Luckily, Herb had saved the class picture; and there, you can  see them standing right next to each other, John and Herb.   Their friendship was obviously meant to be. John Leahr had long  wanted to make sure people knew about the Tuskegee Airmen and their  contributions during the war. Together, John and Herb shared their  story with schoolchildren and adults, talking about how things were  different in the past and promoting racial understanding and the  rejection of bigotry today.   Here they are with a group of young people, Herb and John, with  models of the airplanes that they flew.   The Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations honored  them for their work in 2003, and in 2007, there was a book--``Black and  White Airmen: Their True History''--and it recounts their story.   John died in 2015 at the age of 94. Herb died in 2020 at 100 years  old.   I believe naming this post office in their neighborhood for John  Leahr and Herb Heilbrun is a fitting way to honor the memory of this  team, who served our country with bravery and distinction in World War  II but then continued an important part of their public service long  after their military service ended.   My hope is that this legislation will be passed by the Senate on a  bipartisan basis and we can name this post office after these two  remarkable men.   (Ms. HASSAN assumed the Chair.)                            ____________________     Madam President, finally, I want to acknowledge someone  who is in the Chamber tonight. I want to acknowledge her dedicated  service. This is one of my senior staff members, who is moving to  Richmond, VA, to join the new Virginia Governor's administration.   Angie Youngen is an Ohio native and an Ashland University graduate-- who is very proud of that--and who was the scheduler for my  predecessor, Senator George Voinovich. I have had the good fortune of  having her on my team. Her loyalty, hard work, and judgment over the  past 8 years is deeply appreciated.   So, Angie Youngen, we will miss you here on Capitol Hill, but best of  luck in your new adventure.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
