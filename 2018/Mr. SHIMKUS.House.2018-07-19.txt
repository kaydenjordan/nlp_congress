 Mr. Speaker, to my friend Richard Neal, I understand the  frustrations of this debate and some of the processes, but this gives  us a chance to come down to the floor and just talk about the basic  policy of: Is a carbon tax good, or is it not good?   I can't speak to the process. All I can talk about is the policy.   Congressman Doggett was down here talking about national security  issues. I deal with this quite a bit in my role as the chair of the  Baltic Caucus and doing some NATO Parliamentary Assembly things.   Let me just speak briefly about a concern of what a carbon tax does  in international energy fights and disbursements.   Here I hold a picture--and I wanted to get it on the chart, but I  wasn't able  [[Page H6568]]  to--of an LNG terminal called Independence. Now, this terminal is in  Lithuania, and they are able to decrease their reliance on Russian  natural gas because they have built this import terminal.                                time  1000    They are able to now have two folks in which to import natural gas,  thus relieving themselves of being extorted by the Russian Federation.  A carbon tax would increase the cost of our exported goods to countries  like Lithuania, making them more susceptible to energy extortion by the  Russian Federation.   So in an international debate of an energy policy which the Russian  Federation does extort--how do I know this? I know this because, in the  early days of the reestablishment of freedom, a U.S. company bought a  refinery in Lithuania.    So the Russians didn't like a U.S. company buying an old  refinery, so what did the Russians do? They turned off the flow of oil.   So just in the international world, if we want to help our allies  decrease their reliance on imported crude oil from the Russian  Federation or, in this case, liquefied natural gas, a carbon tax will  make that more difficult. So that is why I think it is important that  we have this debate on the international perspective.   I also know that a lot of the organizations that are important to  me--the American Energy Alliance, Americans for Tax Reform, the Farm  Bureau, Western Energy Alliance, American Fuel & Petrochemical  Manufacturers, National Black Chamber of Commerce, Competitive  Enterprise Institute, and FreedomWorks--all support the resolution that  says a carbon tax is kind of the wrong way to go because it increases  costs on everybody, from the goods that we sell till we transport them  to the market, across the board.   So I appreciate the time. And again, we want to be the world leader  in oil and gas exports, and a carbon tax will prohibit us from being  able to do that.    Mr. Speaker, I rise before you today to speak about Mr.  Jack Edward Schurman, a longtime resident of Shelbyville, Illinois, in  my 15th Congressional District, a disabled veteran, an advocate for  former military men and women throughout the Nation, and chairman of my  Veterans Advisory Committee, and, I am proud to say, my friend.   Born in Iowa in 1939, Jack joined the Navy in 1959 and rose to the  rank of yeoman third class before a disability cut short his service in  1964.   Jack made his way to Illinois, and, in 1976, he married Nancy Ellen  Cranford. They raised two daughters, Kelli Ann and Kim Marie.   As chairman of my Veterans Advisory Committee, Jack has led our  meetings for years, bringing valuable experience and perspective.  Unfortunately, Jack's health has declined to a point where his mobility  is limited, and doctors have declared that he should no longer live on  his own, which is what he has done since his beloved wife passed away  in 2016.   Jack is now in Mississippi, thanks to the U.S. Department of Veterans  Affairs, which located a suitable residence for him near the home of  one of his daughters.   Mr. Speaker, members of my Veterans Advisory Committee and I will  miss Jack. We want to thank him for his tremendous service throughout  the years and wish him the best of health and happiness in this next  chapter of his remarkable life.                            ____________________
