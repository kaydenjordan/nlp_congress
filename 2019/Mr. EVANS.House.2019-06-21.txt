 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the hero who has  too often been forgotten; Frank Wills is his name, the security guard  who discovered the Watergate burglary in progress.   Mr. Wills' discovery ultimately led to the exposure of crimes and  scandalous behavior by several members of the Nixon administration and  campaign, including the President himself.   Despite his central role in exposing that Presidential scandal, Mr.  Wills only received a 3 percent raise in his weekly salary, and his  work at the Watergate actually hurt his later efforts to find a new  job.   Unfortunately, Mr. Wills passed away at the age of 52 without  receiving the type of official recognition he deserved. This week, we  observed the anniversary of the Watergate break-in, and on behalf of  the Congressional Black Caucus, I urge everyone to remember Mr. Wills  and honor his memory.                            ____________________
