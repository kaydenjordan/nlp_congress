 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida; he  has definitely been a leader on this issue.   I have got to tell you that I, too, am happy the Intelligence  Committee has agreed to release the memo. When I was back home in Texas  last week, it was the number one issue people were talking to me about.   I want to take a minute and step back and do a little bit of a  history lesson.   The Fourth Amendment to our Constitution arose from some of the  abusive practices that were going on in the Colonies. The King of  England would send his troops to rifle through people's effects without  a warrant. Our Fourth Amendment said we are not going to let that  happen in these new United States of America. We are going to require  the government to get a warrant before they go through people's papers.  We are protected from illegal searches.   I have been worried since the first day I got here in Congress, but  in our effort to protect ourselves--and perhaps out of fear, some of  it, perhaps, warranted--we are eroding those rights.   So, as this memo comes out, regardless of what is in it, we need to  be looking at the process: how we went to a secret court to get  permission to get this information, how that information was gathered,  what that information was, who vetted it, how thoroughly it was vetted,  how the judges reacted, and, eventually, what came out and determined  whether we need to reform that process to protect Americans' rights.   Yes, we all have a right to know what is going on with our  government. Yes, I am worried about career bureaucrats or elected  officials abusing the power of the government to get information on  their political enemies, like the King was doing back in the days of  the Revolutionary War. This is our opportunity to make sure that  doesn't happen in these United States.   Let's not lose sight of what the issue is here, and that is  protecting the people not only from foreigners who look to do us harm,  but also from an oppressive government that abuses its power to spy on  American citizens.   I am glad this memo is going to come out. I urge President Trump to  promptly release it and, in fact, go beyond that: look at some of the  sources of the material in it, determine that we can reveal some of  those sources without jeopardizing our ability to gather intelligence,  and release the source materials so we know what people knew when they  made the decision to pursue the material covered in this memo.   I think this is a great time for this country. I think this is our  opportunity to remind ourselves that we do have a right to be safe and  secure in our persons and papers from a government that may be trying  to do more than protect us.   Maybe some of these folks in the government have shifted from what we  need to protect America, such as, well, the best way to protect America  is to protect ourselves and our jobs and our political agenda.   That is not what the job of our law enforcement and intelligence  community is. It is to protect us from those who want to do us harm,  especially foreigners. I want to give them the power to do that, the  ability to do that, but I do not want to give them the ability to  affect elections, to go after their political enemies, to spy on any  one of us because they can.   Human nature is such that, if we give the government too much power,  there are those who will abuse it. So we in Congress have got to keep  our eye on the ball at all times and protect the constitutional rights  that our forefathers and our Founding Fathers gave us and that our men  and women in uniform fight for every day that they are in service to  this country.                                time  2000
