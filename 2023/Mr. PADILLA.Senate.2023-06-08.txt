 Madam President, I rise to introduce the Clean Shipping  Act of 2023. This legislation aims to reduce harmful emissions from  ocean going vessels and improve air quality for the nearly 40 percent  of Americans who live within 3 miles of a port.   Globally, maritime shipping is a major source of greenhouse gas  emissions, emitting an estimated 1 billion tons of GHG emissions per  year and roughly 3 percent of total anthropogenic global-warming  carbon-dioxide  [[Page S2033]]  emissions. According to the International Maritime Organization, global  shipping emissions could more than double between 2018 and 2050.   That is why the United States signed two shipping declarations at  COP26 to call for zero-emission fuels on international commercial  vessels by 2030 and the establishment of zero-emission shipping routes  by the middle of the 2020 decade.   This legislation would set a path to eliminate greenhouse gas  emissions from all oceangoing vessels that do business with the United  States.   The Clean Shipping Act will help reduce emissions consistent with the  goals of the Paris Agreement and keep global warming below 1.5 degrees  Celsius, protect air quality and public health for near-port  communities, reduce climate pollution emissions from large marine  vessels that call on U.S. ports, and ensure that the global maritime  sector reduces, while providing the EPA with the flexibility needed to  ensure smooth implementation.   The bill would direct the EPA to set progressively tighter carbon  intensity standards for fuels used by ships consistent with a 1.5 deg.C  decarbonization pathway, and to eliminate in-port ship emissions by  2030 for all ships at-berth or at-anchor in U.S. ports.   Importantly, this legislation is supported by global industry leaders  and environmental advocates and will ensure that the global maritime  sector reducesemissions consistent with the Paris Agreement, while  providing the EPA with the flexibility needed to ensure smooth  implementation.   More than 90 percent of global trade is transported by oceangoing  vessels, which produce an estimated 3 percent of global anthropogenic  emissions, yet these emissions are unregulated in the United States.   The International Maritime Organization's Intersessional Working  Group on the Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships plans to meet at the  end of the month.   This bill would send a strong signal of our commitment to our  international partners, empower the EPA to set standards to reduce  harmful pollution in accordance with our national and international  climate goals, provide certainty to the global shipping industry, and  catalyze research and development to transition oceangoing vessels that  rely on diesel engines.   This bill enjoys the support of environmentalists and industry  stakeholders alike who recognize the urgent need to reduce emissions  from the shipping sector.   I would like to thank my colleagues, Representatives Robert Garcia  and Nanette Barragan for championing this bill in the House.   I Look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the Clean  Shipping Act as quickly as possible.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to introduce the Clean Shipping  Act of 2023.
