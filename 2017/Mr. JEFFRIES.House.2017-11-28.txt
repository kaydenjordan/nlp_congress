 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from  California for yielding and for her leadership as well as her support,  in addition to Ranking Member Grijalva, Chairman Bishop, Chairman  LaMalfa, and the entire committee for moving this bill expeditiously to  the House floor and for their leadership and partnership in this  regard. I also want to thank my good friend and fellow Judiciary  Committee member, Congressman Chabot, for his support, leadership, and  cosponsorship of this legislation.   Words definitely matter. They can cause great harm and division,  particularly when they are embedded in Federal statute.   So this step that we are taking today, as it relates to the 21st  Century Respect Act, is important, as a symbol from this Congress, the  people's House, to the Nation that we can come together, that we are  all fellow Americans, and that outdated, antiquated, and racially  stereotypical terms like Negro and Eskimo and Oriental are not  appropriate at this time in America. They reflect a more divisive  bygone era.   Mr. Speaker, I am thankful to all of my colleagues for coming  together in this regard, a small but meaningful step in an era  otherwise characterized by great division, and perhaps an indication  that we can come together as Democrats, as Republicans, and as people  of diverse racial backgrounds to heal whatever divisions may remain in  our society.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues for their leadership and  support.
