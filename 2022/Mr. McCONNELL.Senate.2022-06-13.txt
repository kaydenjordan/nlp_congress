 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, runaway inflation has pushed workers  and families to the breaking point. According to one recent poll,  nearly 60 percent of Americans are making an effort to drive less and  cut back on electricity use. Three in four are pinching their budgets  for food and entertainment outside the home, and two-thirds are bracing  for prices to climb even higher in the coming year.   Six months ago, in December, President Biden told the American people  we had reached the ``peak''--the peak--``of the crisis'' with  inflation. He said that prices would start falling ``over the next  couple months.'' But like so many of Democrats' other confident  predictions about our economy, the President's statement has proven  completely false.   Friday morning's inflation report provided more official confirmation  of what American consumers know painfully well: The Democrats' out-of- control inflation is not letting up. In fact, it is actually getting  worse.   This year to May, consumer prices rose 8.6 percent, blowing away  expectations, jumping a full percentage point over the previous month  and setting--you guessed it--a new 40-year high. The data underneath  tell a brutal story for working families and American businesses. The  categories driving inflation last month were the ones they can't do  without.   Overall energy prices clocked a year-on-year increase of nearly 35  percent. Drivers are paying 48.7 percent more at the pump. And fuel oil  consumers have seen prices more than double.   Food costs continue to climb at over 10 percent. Grocery prices, in  particular, hit nearly 12 percent inflation, the worst year since 1979.  And full service restaurant prices saw their largest increase on  record.   Of course, that is not to mention the 31-year high for inflation in  the services sector, the 35-year high for rent inflation, or the 42- year high for rising airfare.   Day by day, all of these painful milestones add up to one simple  reality: Americans' hard-earned dollars aren't going nearly as far as  they once did. Runaway inflation has swallowed up any shot of rising  pay bringing more prosperity. In fact, the average worker has seen a  3.9-percent pay cut in the last year.   One mother of two in Indiana recently reported that she is earning  more than she ever has in her career but ``says she still feels like  she is financially losing ground.'' This is what she had to say:         I should be able to live on my own. I'm getting ready to       pay rent and it's going to take every single dime I've made.    As one of my constituents in Barbourville put it recently, ``We're  cutting back on everything--and I mean everything. Gas, meat, bread,  it's all expensive as hell. One moment you think you can afford to buy  something, then you go to the store and it's like, `Nope, can't get  that anymore either.'''   And here is a real kicker. One young couple in Utah has taken to  asking themselves weekly, ``What did we spend money on that we could  not have spent money on?''   Imagine if Washington Democrats were willing to engage in that sort  of self-reflection. Remember, it was their policy choices that made  this painful situation possible. It was the Democrats' choice to insist  on flooding--flooding--the economy with trillions of dollars in liberal  spending last spring. And it was Democrats' choice to spend months last  summer and fall working on ways to pour even more gasoline on the fire,  even though working families were already feeling the pinch of  inflation.   The Democratic leader himself said last spring:         I do not think the dangers of inflation, at least in the       near term, are very real.    None other than some of his own party's top economists warned the  exact opposite. But Washington Democrats were not to be deterred.  Working families' budgets took a backseat to the far-left's wish list,  and now Democrats' decision is literally driving them off a cliff.                                  H.R. 3967    Madam President, on another matter, the Senate is in the middle of  proposing major legislation to expand healthcare access for veterans  exposed to toxic substances in the line of duty. Doing right by our  vets is a bipartisan priority. An 86-vote majority of us voted to begin  processing this bill a few days back, myself included.   This legislation is not a minor fix; it is a series of major--major-- changes to help more veterans. So the precise language of the final  bill will have major consequences for veterans, for policy, and for  government spending.    Republicans have pushed to get votes on a few commonsense amendments  that would make this bipartisan bill even stronger for our veterans.  For example, one of these amendments would make sure the veterans who  are already in line--those who are waiting now, already in line-- waiting for treatment under the current rules are not disserved or  treated unfairly as an unintended consequence of the new expansion.  Surely that should be completely without controversy.   Another amendment would clarify how the government accounts for the  new funding to make sure the new legislation does not impose major  unintended consequences on the appropriations process.   Another amendment would make it clear that new medical presumptions  must rest on sound science, so Congress does not substitute our  judgment for the experts'.   These are not controversial amendments. They are directly related to  the substance of this bill. And given the magnitude of the changes  under consideration, the Senators sponsoring these amendments have  every right to expect votes on the floor. There is no reason why this  important bipartisan bill should be denied a bipartisan floor process.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
