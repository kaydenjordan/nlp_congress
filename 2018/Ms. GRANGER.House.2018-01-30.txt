 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 714, I call up  the bill (H.R. 695) to amend the National Child Protection Act of 1993  to establish a national criminal history background check system and  criminal history review program for certain individuals who, related to  their employment, have access to children, the elderly, or individuals  with disabilities, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendments  thereto, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I stand before you today to ask for your  support to pass the fiscal year 2018 Defense Appropriations bill. It is  past time that this essential, must-pass funding bill for our military  be enacted into law. Congress must act responsibly and do its job to  quickly get these dollars out the door and where they are needed as  soon as possible.   The legislation before you provides $659 billion for defense, more  than $60 billion above last year's levels. When combined with the  almost $5 billion already enacted into law in December, this bill  matches the top-line funding level in the final National Defense  Authorization Act enacted into law.   All Federal dollars are not the same. We need to provide and  prioritize national security after years of neglect and an increasingly  dangerous international situation.   Nor can we continue to hold our troops hostage as leverage for  unrelated issues. We are almost 4 months into fiscal year 2018, and our  troops still don't have their funding. It is time that the Congress  fulfill its responsibility to fund our troops at the levels needed.   It is time to lift the budget caps and enact a full-year Defense  Appropriations Act so that our military can begin to rebuild. This bill  does that by lifting the budget caps on defense and fully funding the  Department at the top line already approved by the Congress in the  National Defense Authorization Act.   It takes care of our troops by providing additional manpower and  fully funding a 2.4 percent pay raise, and it provides additional  funding for key readiness programs and robustly funds maintenance of  equipment and facilities.   The bill includes specific investments in several areas, such as air  superiority, $4.3 billion above request; shipbuilding, $1.6 billion  above request; research and development, $10 billion above 2017;  defense health, an additional $644 million for medical research; and  grants forces fully equipped.   The bill also provides additional resources in a National Defense  Restoration Fund in the amount of $28.6 billion to allow Secretary  Mattis to begin investing in the new defense strategy now instead of  waiting a full year.                                time  1400    This bill gives our military leaders the sufficient, sustainable, and  stable funding they have told us, over and over again, that they need.   The House has done its job more than once to fund our troops at the  levels they need only to have the Senate fail to act. Congress must  step up and fulfill its most fundamental constitutional responsibility,  which is to ensure that our troops have what they need to defend our  Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen), who is the chairman of the full committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), who is the chairman of the State, Foreign  Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert), the chair of the Subcommittee on Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Carter), chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee.    I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Aderholt), chairman of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and  Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Thornberry), the chairman of the House Armed Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as we conclude our remarks and, again, call for a vote  on this very important bill, I want to express my respect and  appreciation for the help of Ranking Member Visclosky, and certainly  for the leadership of Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen. I  have been fortunate to follow the chairman, as chair of Defense  Appropriations, and I speak for all who serve on his committee, who  look to him for leadership and respect him for his service. He is an  extraordinary public servant and a model for us all, and we thank him.   Mr. Speaker, the time is long past for Congress to fulfill their  duty. I urge all Members to support this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
