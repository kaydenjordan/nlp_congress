 Mr. President, may I ask that amendment No. 1846 be called  up?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is already called up.    Mr. President, may I ask that amendment No. 1846 be called  up?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is already called up.    Mr. President, may I ask that amendment No. 1846 be called  up?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is already called up.    Thank you, Mr. President.   It is impossible to fix all the problems with this bill in a 1-minute  amendment, but my amendment fixes two problems. It makes the middle- class tax cuts permanent, and it takes nearly $1 trillion away from the  massive deficit caused by this big giveaway.   How does the amendment do these two things? First, it leaves the AMT  where it is under current law instead of scaling it back. Second, while  making middle-income tax cuts permanent, it provides no individual tax  relief to those Americans currently in the top bracket. Third, it cuts  the corporate tax rate from 35 to 25, rather than 20.   If you care about deficit reduction, support this amendment. If you  care about permanent middle-class tax cuts, support this amendment. If  you believe a reasonable corporate tax cut could help grow the economy,  support the amendment. Finally, if you believe tax reform should be  bipartisan, support this amendment.   Thank you, Mr. President.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.    Mr. President, do I have any remaining time?    Mr. President, do I have any remaining time?    Mr. President, do I have any remaining time?    Mr. President, I don't need a full minute. I am just here  to say that permanent middle-class tax cuts is more important than 25  to 20 percent for corporations.   The problem with the Republican bill is the priority. It prioritizes  the corporate tax cuts over individual tax cuts for middle-class people  and that is why we oppose it and that is why everyone should support  this amendment. People come first.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.  [[Page S7706]]         Mr. President, I am shocked to learn that at 10 after 12  we are actually following a procedure that is a normal budget  procedure, but since that has been raised, pursuant to section 904 of  the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the  pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The question is on agreeing to the motion.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.
