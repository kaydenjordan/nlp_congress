 Madam President, I am proud to recognize Elliot  Perry of Bedford as January 2021's Granite Stater of the Month. Elliot,  a fourth grader at Bedford Memorial Elementary School and an ambassador  for the Children's Hospital at Dartmouth-Hitchcock--CHaD--has started a  fundraising campaign to build two accessible playgrounds at CHaD  locations in Lebanon and Manchester to help improve the experience of  children who visit these facilities.   Elliot was born nearly 4 months early and given only an 18-percent  chance to live. The medical professionals at CHaD worked hard to ensure  that Elliot received the best care that they could provide and 121 days  later, Elliot went home with his mom and dad.   Since then, Elliot has been one of CHaD's best ambassadors and has  helped raise more than $100,000 for the organization that he and his  parents credit with saving his life.   Last year, Elliot launched a new effort to support the patients at  CHaD. The 121 Club that Elliot founded aims to raise $121,000 to build  two sensory-neutral playgrounds that are compliant with the Americans  with Disabilities Act's Standards for Accessible Design at CHaD  locations in Lebanon and Manchester. With the help of his friends and  neighbors, Elliot has already raised a little more than $80,000 for his  cause.   Elliot hopes that these new playgrounds will provide an outlet for  any family who wishes to take a break during longer visits, as well as  provide a safe space for children of all abilities to play and develop  their motor skills.   Elliot embodies the best of New Hampshire. His drive to help others,  along with his empathy and inclusivity, has made an enormous  difference, especially for children facing particularly difficult  challenges and their families. I wish Elliot the best as he continues  fundraising to reach his goal, and I look forward to seeing what he  accomplishes next.                            ____________________
