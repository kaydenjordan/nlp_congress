 Madam President, I want to associate myself with the words  of the distinguished deputy leader. Nobody has said it better. Nobody  could. But in the meantime, we have to get up and vote.   Madam President, I am going to put in a quorum call for just a  minute, and then I will take it off.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, earlier this month, actually for the  first time in--earlier last month, I should say, in February, for the  first time in our Nation's history, the Senate convened as a Court of  Impeachment to try a former President for a high crime and misdemeanor.   For 5 days, every Member of the Senate was here to hear presentations  and arguments from an extraordinarily intelligent group of Congressmen  and Congresswomen representing the House of Representatives. We also  heard from counsel for former President Donald Trump. After listening  to the compelling evidence presented by the House managers, I voted to  convict President Trump for inciting the Capitol riots on January 6,  and I will have a lot more to say about my vote to convict the former  President in a later statement.    Today, though, I am going to speak about the unique role I had in  this historic trial as its Presiding Officer. It is unique in the  history of the Senate, and I thought for my fellow Senators and, also,  for historical purposes I would like you all to know some of my  feelings.   Now, I understand why some of my Republican friends were skeptical of  a Democratic Senator presiding over the trial of a Republican former  President. I noted the Constitution does not contemplate that the Chief  Justice would preside over the impeachment trial of a former President,  but I also note the impeachment process, no matter who presides, is  inherently and often intensely divisive. Presidential impeachments have  historically been partisan. Having a member of one particular party in  the Chair presiding over the trial could understandably give some  pause.   Now, as my fellow Senators know, I did not ask, I did not seek to  preside over this trial, but I am occupying the constitutional office  of the President pro tempore, and because I am, it was incumbent upon  me to do so. A Court of Impeachment is not a civil or a criminal court;  it is a constitutional court. And the President pro tempore, as a  constitutional officer, has historically presided over impeachment  trials of non-Presidents. As President Trump's term had expired before  the trial began, the responsibility to preside over this historic trial  fell to me, as it would have anybody who would have been President pro  tempore. I just happened to be.   I was not going to shirk my duty. My staff and I spent hundreds of  hours poring over the constitutional background of these trials. I read  transcripts. I read everything. And what I found is, throughout our  Nation's history, each President pro tempore has almost without  exception belonged to a political party, and each has no doubt had  their own personal and political views on the matters before the  Senate. But when presiding over the Senate, as I go back through  history, I see Presidents pro tempore have historically served as a  neutral arbiter, issuing rulings where appropriate and preserving  order. I consider holding the Office of the President pro tempore and  the responsibilities that come with it as one of the highest honors but  also one of the most serious responsibilities of my career here in the  Senate.   When presiding over an impeachment trial, the President pro tempore  takes an additional--not just his regular role but an additional one to  do impartial justice according to the Constitution and the laws. This  is an oath that I take extraordinarily seriously.   In fact, to demonstrate my commitment to preside over the trial with  fairness and transparency, before the trial I wrote a letter to every  single Senator and the parties to the trial. In it I made clear my  intention and my solemn obligation was to conduct the trial with  fairness to all. I committed to adhering to the Constitution and to  applicable Senate rules, precedents, and governing resolutions.   I committed to consulting with the Senate's esteemed and nonpartisan  Parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, and I committed to being guided  by Senate precedent should a motion or an objection or a request or an  application be put before me. I reiterated that any decision I made-- any decision I made--from the Chair would be subject to the review of  the full Senate--every Democratic Senator, every Republican Senator,  every Independent Senator. And I stated I would put any matter before  the entire Senate in the first instance where appropriate in light of  the precedents and practices of the Senate, giving all Senators an  equal say in resolving the issue at the outset. I also informed all  Senators, though, that I would enforce the Senate rules, and I would  enforce the precedent governing decorum and do what I could to ensure  the trial reflected the best traditions of the Senate.   Now, with the trial behind us, I believe I made good on those  commitments. My job wasn't to shape the trial or to direct or slant it  in any particular way but to make sure the rules were followed, the  proceedings were fair to all parties, consistent with the will of the  whole Senate, and I believe it was.  [[Page S914]]    I did my best. I followed the advice of the Parliamentarian and  enforced our rules and precedents. Where objections were raised, they  were ultimately resolved without a vote challenging the rulings I made  from the Chair.   While I never faced this situation, before the start of the trial I  had decided--and I had informed the Parliamentarian of my decision-- that should a ruling of mine be appealed, I would abstain from voting  as a Senator on the question of whether to sustain my own ruling. Now,  I know from the Constitution and the practices and the rules of the  Senate, the Presiding Officer is fully empowered to do so--to vote--and  it happens routinely during legislative sessions. But in going back  through all the hundreds of pages--the thousands of pages--I could not  find a historical precedent for Presiding Officers doing so during  impeachment trials, and I was determined to strictly adhere to  precedent, even if it limited my authority as a Senator in this  instance.    Now I would note that, on two occasions during the trial, I felt it  was necessary to remind counsel--and I did, as did Chief Justice  Roberts during President Trump's first trial--to refrain from using  language that was not conducive to civil discourse. On the final day of  the trial, when it got a little bit heated, I was prepared to do so in  stronger terms, if needed. Yet, during closing arguments, I believe  neither side gave me reason to do so.   Now, like those who presided over the three prior Presidential  impeachment trials in our history, I understood each of my decisions  was important historically and would become important precedents to  guide those who preside over trials in the future, just as I had read  and studied the precedents of past trials.   Since the conclusion of the trial, both Republican and Democratic  Senators have thanked me for being fair, and I appreciate that greatly.  I may have had a prominent role for this historic trial, but I was  committed to not shaping it in any way. I just wanted to give voice to  our institution's precedents and rules and to otherwise let the Senate  determine the trial's structure and direction, to let each side present  its case, and let the chips fall where they may, but let the Senate do  its job.   I have now had the opportunity to sit as a judge and juror in  numerous impeachment trials, including three trials of Presidents. All  were historic moments for the Senate and this country.   I hold no illusion that the Senate was at its best for every moment  of every trial, but each has nonetheless increased my respect for our  system of government and our Constitution.   I was proud to uphold my oath as a Senator and as a Presiding  Officer, my oath to do impartial justice according to our Constitution  and the laws during last month's trial. There are some things I  consider far more important than allegiance to any person or political  party, and my commitment to the Constitution and this great institution  of the Senate are listed high among them.   I have felt from the first day I came here that the Senate can be and  should be the conscience of the Nation. I wanted to help make sure that  conscience was upheld, and I appreciate the fact that my colleagues  elected me President pro tempore and gave me this opportunity.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, consistent with Standing Rule XXVI, I ask  [[Page S924]]  unanimous consent that the rules of procedure of the Committee on  Appropriations for the 117th Congress be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:     Senate Committee on Appropriations Committee Rules--117th Congress                                 I. MEETINGS         The Committee will meet at the call of the Chairman.                                 II. QUORUMS         1. Reporting a bill. A majority of the members must be       present for the reporting of a bill.        2. Other business.

This rule may be waived by       unanimous consent.           V. BROADCASTING AND PHOTOGRAPHING OF COMMITTEE HEARINGS         The Committee or any of its subcommittees may permit the       photographing and broadcast of open hearings by television       and/or radio.

VIII. POINTS OF ORDER         Any member of the Committee who is floor manager of an       appropriations bill is hereby authorized to make points of       order against any amendment offered in violation of the       Senate Rules on the floor of the Senate to such       appropriations bill.

She will be resigning her post at the end of this month, 11 years  since she first joined the U.S. Attorney's Office, but her work and the  strong partnerships she forged will carry on for many years to come.   A profile of Christina recently appeared in Vermont Business Magazine  under the headline ``A Born Advocate for Justice.'' And she has been  just that. During her tenure, Christina worked to stem the deadly surge  of heroin and fentanyl in our small State, and she has joined with  Federal partners to slow the illegal trafficking of firearms. She has  also used her voice to shine a spotlight on domestic violence and human  trafficking, not only prosecuting critical cases but also highlighting  the plight of victims who are caught in the path of such heinous  crimes. Her personal approach to each and every case, signing off on  every charging document in the office, as well as her commitment to  victims and her dedication to upholding the rule of law are evident to  anyone who has witnessed her work and her work ethic.   While Vermont's U.S. Attorney's Office is among the smallest in the  country, it is fair to say that under Christina's leadership, the team  has punched well above their weight. In one instance, her office set  out to investigate kickbacks and fraudulent billing practices involving  the electronic health records industry, unraveling a scheme that  resulted in an $8 billion national settlement with Perdue Pharma, which  admitted to needlessly and shamelessly promoting the prescribed use of  OxyContin, a highly addictive opioid.   During her time as U.S. attorney, Christina has forged strong  relationships with her partners in Federal, State and local law  enforcement circles, many of whom have shared with me how much they  appreciated her engagement. In the courtroom, colleagues on both sides  of the bench have lauded her fairness. A Federal judge, interviewed for  the aforementioned magazine profile, spoke of her ``quiet confidence''  and her ``natural courtroom presence: graceful and commanding.''   I am proud to have worked with Gov. Phil Scott to recommend Christina  Nolan for the position of U.S. attorney back in 2017. She has served  Vermonters very well during her tenure. Marcelle and I wish Christina  and her longtime partner, Jill, and their family our very best in  future endeavors.                            ____________________
