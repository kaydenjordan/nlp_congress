 Mr. Speaker, April 28 is National Prescription Drug Take  Back Day.   This is an opportunity to dispose of those expired or excess drugs  that you may have in your home so that they are properly disposed of  instead of ending up in a landfill, waterway, or, more importantly, the  hands of children or other dangers that could affect people's health  negatively.   For information about that, check with the U.S. Department of  Justice, the Drug Enforcement Agency, or your local police or pharmacy  to look for the information for where you should take your excess,  expired prescription drugs so we don't have a health risk, the  endangerment of our children, or risk it ending up in the wrong place  in the environment.   Again, April 28 is National Prescription Drug Take Back Day. Please  participate.                            ____________________
