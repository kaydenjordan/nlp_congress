 Mr. President, as a resident of a rural State, expanding       rural broadband access has long been a priority of mine, and I am not       the only one.        Over the years, Congress has dedicated significant resources to       closing the digital divide, and that has been especially true over the       past 3 years. Congress has appropriated a lot of money for broadband       lately--``a lot'' being $79 billion, to be precise--dedicated solely to       broadband-related projects--$79 billion on top of the billions of       dollars the Federal Communications Commission disburses annually under       its Universal Service Fund. That is an unprecedented amount of money.       In fact, with that much money, we ought to be able to deliver gold- and       diamond-laced broadband to every household in the United States.        Appropriating money is not enough. We could throw trillions of       dollars at the rural broadband problem and still not close the digital       divide. All of the money in the world is useless if it is not being       spent the right way. As I said, we have enough money now that we ought       to be able to deploy gold- and diamond-laced broadband across the       country, but I have serious questions about whether this money is       actually going to meaningfully move us toward closing the digital       divide. The money we currently have, as much as it is, is spread out       over 15 separate Agencies and 133 programs--133 programs. To say that       that is not conducive to a coherent rural broadband strategy would be       an understatement.        Now, the lion's share of the funding does go through one Agency--the       National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA--      but it is an Agency with a very poor record of efficiently disbursing       broadband funding. The last time Congress provided NTIA with a big       infusion of            [[Page S9716]]            broadband funding--by the way, a fraction of the funding it is now       responsible for--the Agency struggled with its implementation and ended       up overbuilding existing broadband networks, resulting in billions of       taxpayer dollars being spent with little to show. I have seen very       little to convince me that NTIA is likely to do much better this time       around.        In July of last year, the NTIA called for volunteers--volunteers--to       help determine how to allocate the $1.5 billion that Congress had       provided to NTIA to improve broadband access--volunteers. Yet Congress       has now put the Agency in charge of distributing the $42.5 billion in       the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program.        I am deeply concerned that, without serious oversight, the NTIA will       make and is already making similar mistakes in managing its current       broadband programs, which is why, earlier this month, I began an       oversight effort to review the numerous Federal broadband programs. The       oversight of how Federal broadband dollars is being spent is necessary       to make sure that Agencies aren't misusing billions of taxpayer dollars       and, most importantly, to make sure the funding is going to the areas       that are actually unserved.        I have already requested input from a diverse group of stakeholders       to identify ways that we can improve broadband programs--and broadband       policy more generally--as we head into the 118th Congress, and I have       requested that Federal Agencies provide information on their efforts to       improve broadband infrastructure siting, which is a key component of       deploying broadband networks.        In the new year, I will work on compiling these responses and       presenting stakeholders' concerns to the NTIA, to the Federal       Communications Commission, to the Department of Agriculture, and to the       Treasury Department. If changes need to be made to the programs       Congress has established, I will do everything that I can to hold       Congress and Federal Agencies accountable for making those changes so       that all of these programs work as effectively as possible and as       Congress intended.        To expand rural broadband access and actually close the digital       divide, it is not enough to just appropriate money. We also need to       make sure that money is being spent in the right way. I am committed to       doing everything I can to ensure that the money that has been       appropriated for rural broadband actually goes to expanding access to       those who are currently unserved.        I yield the floor.        The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington State.
