 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  Senator Kelly's maiden speech, that Senators Johnson, Peters, and  Carper be permitted to speak for up to 5 minutes each prior to the  start of the vote.    Mr. President, before I close, I have some brief  remarks.   First, on the bill that just passed, let me thank my colleagues for  passing this very important bill.   It stems from the fact that, in 2018, 20 lives were lost in a tragic  limousine accident in Schoharie, NY. The families came from the small  city of Amsterdam, the people. They had done just the right thing. It  is a group that went out. They knew they might be enjoying themselves,  and so they hired a big, long stretch limo. Unfortunately, as the limo  came down the hill in Schoharie, it crashed, and 20 people died.   I met the families. These were young people in the prime of life. I  met one mom. She lost four daughters--four daughters--in this crash.  This community of Amsterdam and these families have endured endless  tragedy.   But instead of cursing the darkness, they have lit a candle, and they  are pushing for the fact that there is a hole in regulation. We  regulate trucks, and we regulate smaller limos, but when it is a large  limo, and they are not sure what it is classified as, then there is  virtually no regulation. This legislation fills that hole. The accident  was preventable.   There was another accident on Long Island--four young women in the  prime of life killed in the same way. That was preventable.   Now Congress finally has the opportunity to address the gaps and  loopholes that have allowed limousines to escape the basic safety  standards that cover other vehicles.   My amendment--and that with Senator Gillibrand--would ensure that  limousines meet minimum safety standards. It mandates seatbelts and  seat safety standards, and it will save lives. So I thank my colleagues  for supporting this amendment.   It is a beautiful thing what these families are doing. The hole in  their heart will never go away. The hole in the heart of the whole city  of Amsterdam, which lost so many of their vital young men and women,  will never go away. But instead of cursing the darkness, they are  lighting the candle, and, tonight, the candle was lit thanks to the  bipartisan cooperation we have here. So I thank my colleagues.                                  H.R. 3684    Mr. President, now on the matter of today, the Senate is making  really good progress, really good progress. As you know, I had  promised, when we opened up our two-track process, that we would be  fully bipartisan in the amendment process as we move forward on the  bipartisan infrastructure bill. Well, I think no one can deny that we  have kept our word here in the Democratic majority.   So far, the Senate has considered 22 amendments on this bipartisan  piece of legislation, 15 of them today. That is more amendments than  probably happened in many months when we were in the minority. Of those  amendments, 12 have been agreed to--5 by voice vote, 7 by rollcall; 10  were not agreed to; 13 of those 22 amendments--more than half--were  sponsored by Republicans. So, clearly, we have shown a willingness to  allow Members who are not part of the bipartisan group to have input  into this important bill.   Tomorrow, we will continue to consider amendments, and then,  hopefully, we can bring this bill to a close in the very near future.   So the Chamber is working as Members on both sides of the aisle have  wanted it to. I am proud of what we have been able to do today and hope  we can continue tomorrow in that vein                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when  the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10:30 a.m.,  Thursday, August 5; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 3684.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Portman.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.
