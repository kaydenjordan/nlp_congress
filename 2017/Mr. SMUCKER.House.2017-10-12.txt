 Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to travel to Puerto  Rico this past Saturday with a bipartisan group of legislators. We  traveled there with Resident Commissioner Gonzalez-Colon, who has been  an absolutely outstanding advocate for Puerto Rico during this  difficult time. I have a few takeaways from that:   One, it was a sobering experience to see how widespread the  devastation is on the island. Every single aspect of the island of  Puerto Rico was affected.   Secondly, the full commitment of the Department of Defense, of FEMA,  of every Federal Government agency and the effort to recover that is  being conducted in conjunction with the Governor and folks on the  ground in Puerto Rico is great to see. It is an effective initial  recovery effort that has saved and has sustained lives. Millions of  meals and millions of bottles of water have been distributed.    A third takeaway is this will require a sustained active and  effective effort.   I want to thank the chairman for introducing this bill today, which  is absolutely necessary to bring back the economy on the island of  Puerto Rico. The top priority now is to rebuild the grid, which is  absolutely essential to getting the economy in Puerto Rico moving. That  is why we need this aid package. It is an important step along the long  road to recovery for our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico, as well as for  all of those impacted by hurricanes in the South and those out West  battling wildfires.   One thing I saw as well: the American people come to the assistance  of other citizens in need, and that is true whether it is in Houston,  Florida, or in Puerto Rico.   Again, I would like to thank the chair for introducing this  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
