 Mr. President, I want to join the Republican leader, as  well as the Democratic leader, with our hopes that we can still rescue  the situation on Capitol Hill before the deadline. We have an impending  government shutdown that is only 5 days away.   The House Republicans on the other side of the Rotunda have not taken  on their responsibility at this moment, and we are doing our best on a  bipartisan basis to do the opposite. Extreme factions of the Republican  Party continue to list their demands for reckless cuts and partisan  proposals in exchange for keeping the lights on in the Federal  Government. In doing so, their radical agenda is holding the livelihood  of the American people and the proper functioning of our government  hostage.   House Republicans' proposals, which some of their own Members don't  even agree with, would cut millions of dollars from public health,  childcare, education, food safety, law enforcement, housing, and more.  These cuts would create uncertainty for hard-working families across  the country, and they would put our national security and economic  well-being at risk.   Instead of negotiating in good faith, House Republicans are willing  to put the country through the pain of a shutdown. Now, we have had  shutdowns before. I remember them well--2013, 2018, and now the threat  of one in 2023. It appears to be a 5-year cycle. The shutdowns in 2013  and 2018 reduced economic output and GDP growth by projections in the  billions. They forced Federal employees to go without checks, to either  work without pay or be furloughed, and that included our military at  the time. Servicemembers would not be paid until Congress funds the  government. That would mean missed paychecks and strained household  budgets for the duration of a shutdown, until extreme MAGA Republicans  felt their demands had been met.   Take one Agency for example--the National Institutes of Health, the  premier medical research Agency in the world. They would have to delay  new clinical trials during a government shutdown, stalling critical  medical research on diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.   A shutdown would halt training of 2,600 air traffic controllers at a  time when our country desperately needs them, and the air traffic  controllers already on the job would have to work without pay. How  would you like to have the pressure of that job and in the back of your  mind wonder if you are going to make your mortgage payment? That would  potentially lead to delays, longer wait times for those traveling, as  we have seen in past shutdowns. The same goes for TSA.   The shutdown would delay major infrastructure projects that were  created by the bipartisan infrastructure bill.   It could jeopardize the benefits of more than 6 million American  participants in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,  Children, and Infants, including 170,000 in my home State of Illinois.   Public housing operations and housing choice voucher subsidies could  be at risk of running out of funding.   A shutdown could deplete relief funds and slow emergency responses in  the case of natural disasters. We have seen evidence of plenty of  those.   In short, it would be nothing less of a disaster for the economy and  for American families for this handful of MAGA Republicans to stop the  funding of our government.   Here in the Senate, we have taken a bipartisan approach to the task  of keeping our government funded.   I have served on the Senate Appropriations Committee for a number of  years, and I have watched carefully as the procedure of that  committee--one of the most important committees in the Senate--has  changed.   For the last almost 5 years, we have gone without a meaningful,  bipartisan effort to write budget bills, and we have taken from the  Members the opportunity on the floor of the Senate to actually review  those bills and make amendments.   It is our good fortune that the leaders in the Senate Appropriations  Committee currently are two of the best. One of the best Democratic  Senators and legislators, Patty Murray, of Washington, chairs the  Appropriations Committee. Her ranking Republican member, Susan Collins,  of Maine, is another extraordinary legislator. What they managed to  achieve so far in the Appropriations Committee is a tribute not only to  their skill but also a tribute to bipartisanship.   They have reported out all 12 appropriations bills to the floor of  the U.S. Senate for consideration on the floor for the first time in 5  years. Instead of a massive package called an omnibus, they were  leading us toward individual appropriations bills and an amendment  process on the floor we haven't seen for a long, long time.  Unfortunately, it was set aside by one Republican Member last week, but  we haven't given up on the notion of making this bipartisan.   I heard earlier a statement made by the Democratic leader in the  Senate that there were negotiations through the weekend for a temporary  spending bill. I hope that spirit continues when it comes to the  appropriations bills. I am sure with Senators Murray and Collins  working on it, we have a good possibility.   Now we recognize, more than ever before, the need to keep the lights  on in Washington on Capitol Hill. This week is going to be our test.  What must be top of mind in any compromise is keeping the Federal  employees paid, their families fed, keep the economy moving forward,  keep our affairs in order so that our adversaries know that the United  States of America can actually fund its own government.   That is why here in the Senate we are going to consider a bipartisan  continuing resolution to keep the government open at current funding  levels while we work toward a longer term answer.   Instead of considering a similar, serious short-term proposal to  prevent a shutdown, some House Republicans are now trying to consider  11 individual appropriations bills before Sunday. Let me tell you, the  track record doesn't look so good. Speaker McCarthy has already pulled  down more than one vote on the defense spending bill, despite the fact  his own party actually drafted the bill. They drafted the bill, then  they couldn't pass it with their own members of the House.   I am not sure what his plan is. But in the Senate, ours is to prevent  a government shutdown and have an orderly process of spending bills  considered by the Senate. We owe it to every American family to do our  jobs and to do it in a timely, respectful manner.  [[Page S4672]]    I urge my colleagues in the House to put the needs, well-being, and  livelihood of Americans above any partisan loyalty. I am committed to  working with my colleagues to prevent a shutdown. I look forward to the  Senate considering a continuing resolution that does just that.                          United Auto Workers Strike    Mr. President, on a separate topic, I heard my colleague earlier,  Senator Schumer, talk about visiting a picket line for the United Auto  Workers this morning. I did the same thing yesterday morning in  Bolingbrook, IL, where UAW local warehouse workers were out on the line  drinking coffee and eating a few donuts, holding their signs that said  ``solidarity'' with their union. I wanted to walk over there and be  with them at this moment.   You have to understand, when a worker like a UAW worker goes on  strike, they are really walking away from their regular paycheck and  receiving emergency pay from the unions, which, historically, has never  quite been the same or as much. The same thing is true when it comes to  the medical benefits. They may lose the coverage they had in the  workplace and have the union program that is an alternative that  doesn't provide the same level of benefits.   What I am trying to get to is the bottom line is, these strikes are  personal, and families sacrifice on behalf of the workers.   Why would they do that? Why would they walk off the job, stand in the  cold or outside weather from time to time like this? Because there is  more at stake than their own personal well-being. They are fighting not  only for their fellow members of the union, they are fighting for  working people all over the United States.   The organized labor movement--which I was happy to be a childhood  union family growing up--really made a difference in the life of  America. The 40-hour work week, overtime, vacation, healthcare  benefits, pension--virtually every one of those elements that are part  of a modern job--a good modern job--were fought for and sometimes died  for by those who were working in the labor movement in the earliest  stage.   The UAW is a good example. It was back in the forties when a young  fellow named Walter Reuther decided to make the UAW a viable force in  Detroit, MI. There was the famous confrontation at a River Rouge plant  where the UAW workers were on strike and violence broke out. Some  people were seriously injured. Those sacrifices were made, and America  changed as a result of it.   Now the modern struggle of the UAW is not unlike that of the forties.  The President of the UAW, Mr. Fain, came by my office several times to  talk about his goals. He made it clear--and we all knew the answer-- that when it came to the question of the survival of these automobile  makers in 2008 when the economy plunged, it was the workers who stood  up and said: We will make sacrifices and changes so that these  companies can survive. Some people, even those on the floor of the  Senate, were arguing: Let them go. That is capitalism. There are  winners and losers.   But President Obama and I and many others felt just the opposite.  Automobile manufacturing is a critical part of the American economy.  President Obama was determined to keep those companies alive during  that period of time. UAW did its part, and it did it well. They  sacrificed wages and benefits. They said that the new workers would get  paid dramatically less than those who had been there for years, and  they literally saved those companies.   Now those companies are profitable to the tune of billions of dollars  a year. What the UAW is saying is, for goodness' sake, make sure the  workers are part of the success. Don't let them read in the papers how  much the company is making while they are breaking their backs to make  the products that are successful.   That is what the strike is all about. There was a time not that long  ago in the early sixties when the executives of automobile companies  and similar corporations were making about 30 times the wages of those  who were working on production lines. Now the number is 500 times. The  three executives who lead the automobile manufacturers all make over  $20 million a year, each and every one of them. I believe the one from  General Motors makes $29 million a year. Meanwhile, the wages for the  executives have gone up 40 percent in the last 5 years and for the  workers, 6 percent. So there is a disparity there that needs to be  addressed and done fairly.   We want to make sure that the companies are profitable--they build  products we are proud of. But we want to make sure the workers who are  sacrificing every single day share in that profitability, share in that  productivity. And they can do it if they are part of the contract that  is now being negotiated.   I was out there on the line for about a half hour yesterday, standing  along with the workers and encouraging the workers to be strong during  this period. It is a time of personal sacrifice, but it is well worth  it, not only for sisters and brothers in the union but workers all over  America who prosper with the achievements made by the UAW.   I am proud to have had their support over the years, and I am proud  to stand with them in this time of challenge.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) and the Senator from Minnesota (Mrs. Smith), are necessarily  absent.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
