 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, few of us will ever leave the mark on history and every  human we encounter the way our dear friend Congressman John Lewis did.  His profound generosity and goodness was so beautifully balanced by his  courageous, unyielding demands for justice.   I saw it as we sat-in on this House floor demanding gun safety  reforms after the Pulse nightclub shooting.   I saw it as young and old met him, sensed his moral bearing, and he  patiently made each one the world's most important person in that  moment.   We saw it plain as day as he bravely crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge  to confront America's racist sins, knowing that batons and beatings  blocked the pathway to justice.   I saw it when he traveled to my district, and the outpouring of joy  and reverence overflowed for this truly good man.   And I saw it when he took the time, 5 seconds of his time, in that  room off the House floor, when he recorded a campaign video to help my  then high school-age daughter win her student government campaign,  which she did. That is a memory that she will treasure--and does  treasure--throughout her life.   His lifetime of ``good trouble'' is a model for us all, especially  now as we must carry on his work of racial justice. The more perfect  Union John Lewis lived in and risked his life for is what our Founders  expressed but did not necessarily exemplify and one that future leaders  must aspire to. His courage and generosity are strengths we must all  draw upon now.   Rest in power, my friend.
