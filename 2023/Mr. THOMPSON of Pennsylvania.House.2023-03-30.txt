 Madam Speaker, I rise today to fully  celebrate the life of a true Pennsylvania icon. Ira Brahm Born, known  as Bob by all who knew and cared about him, recently passed away at the  age of 98.   While most of you probably didn't know Bob personally, I know you are  familiar with his sweet work as the head of Just Born, Inc. The  Bethlehem candymaker is the force behind many beloved favorites, but  they are best known for Peeps, the colorful marshmallow chicks that,  for three-quarters of a century, have brightened our Easter  celebrations and our every day.   Bob was a veteran of World War II, an engineer, a talented musician,  an innovator in his industry, and a family man whose son, Ross Born,  along with a cousin, David Shaffer, carry on Bob's legacy at Just Born.   Madam Speaker, while we mourn the passing of Bob, his legacy will  live on for generations to come.                            ____________________
