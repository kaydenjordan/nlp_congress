 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Gennaro  Jewelers of Bellmore, New York, as they celebrate 100 years of service  to Long Islanders.   This renowned, local small business has been a cornerstone of the  community for one century, helping generations of New York neighbors  provide wonderful gifts to their loved ones during good times and,  unfortunately, bad.   Not only is Gennaro Jewelers known for its fine wares, but under the  leadership of my good friend Gary Hudes, the business also continues to  give back to the Bellmore community and beyond.   They are staunch supporters of law enforcement, firefighters, and  first responders, and they are dedicated to keeping those New Yorkers  safe each and every day.   With this long history of quality service in mind, I congratulate  Gennaro Jewelers as they celebrate their 100th year serving the Fourth  Congressional District.   New York's Fourth Congressional District is enriched by the presence  of great businesses like Gennaro Jewelers, and I wish my good friend  Gary Hudes and the entire team there much success in the future.   Congratulations on 100 years.                            ____________________
