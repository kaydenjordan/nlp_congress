 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this  legislation.   The debt ceiling is one of the best pathways to address debt and  deficits. In addition to immediate spending cuts and future spending  caps, this bill includes provisions to prevent IRS from auditing  families and small businesses and helps get Americans back to work.   My bill with Representative Steel to rescind IRS funding was  partially put into this bill. Even though we passed the entire bill by  our majority in January, parts of it are in this bill, and House  Republicans continue to work to protect every family and small business  from IRS overreach.   This bill also modernizes TANF work requirements and ends the scheme  of States sending small-dollar checks to people who are already working  to artificially raise their TANF work rates. These changes will focus  TANF dollars on those who need it the most and will push States to do  more to connect work-capable adults with the 9.6 million job openings  we have across our economy right now.   We have more to do to get our work done and our fiscal house in  order. We need to ensure our economy always rewards hard work, and this  bill is a great start.
