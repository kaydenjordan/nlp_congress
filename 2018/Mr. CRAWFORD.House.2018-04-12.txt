 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  Pennsylvania for doing such a great job on this. I know he has worked  really, really hard on it.   We have talked about the number of committee hearings that have been  dedicated to just nutrition. That is because the nutrition title of the  farm bill accounts for about 80 percent of the total authorization. So  it is really important that we get it right.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express support for the Agriculture and  Nutrition Act, specifically, the improvements that we are making here  in the critical nutrition title under the leadership of my friend Mr.  Thompson, who has done a fantastic job.   Currently, there is a loophole related to heating and cooling  allowances that is often used to artificially increase SNAP benefits.  States are given the flexibility under the previous iteration of the  SNAP program to use the standard utility allowances for heating and  cooling to ease SNAP administration.   Households automatically qualify for the SUA if they receive Low  Income Heating and Energy Assistance Program, it is called the LIHEAP  program, payments, if they receive payments from that program. States,  in order to increase SNAP benefits, provide LIHEAP payments of just  greater than a $20 minimum threshold, allowing households to qualify  for the SUA, thus increasing the SNAP benefits the household receives,  even though the household may not have actual heating and cooling  expenses.   Our bill requires demonstrated heating or cooling expenses in order  to receive a standard allowance for such expenses. We basically removed  the automatic availability of the SUA for heating and cooling and ask  that households demonstrate actual utility costs to receive the State- determined SUA.   Note that we exempt the elderly from that requirement of  documentation, so we will make sure that people understand that they  are not being adversely impacted.   My home State of Arkansas is already demonstrating how to implement  this practice. In our State, we currently require folks who want to be  a part of this program--and, by extension, eligible for SNAP--to  demonstrate that they, in fact, have utility bill expenses.   This reform will take what my State is doing and implement it across  the entire Nation and ensure that SNAP's initial purpose of helping  those who need this program the most is being achieved.                                time  1815    Much of the frustration of my constituents, and many folks across the  country, has been about the explosion of enrollees in programs who,  quite frankly, don't need the benefits in the first place and are  deemed eligible through an administrative shortcut.   It is my hope that more States will see this the same way that my  home State of Arkansas does and realize that Federal resources are not  infinite and being responsible stewards of this program serves those  who need the serving the most. If we enact this reform, they will  always be taken care of.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman again for his steadfast  leadership and his diligence in all of the hearings that we have had  over the last 4 years.
