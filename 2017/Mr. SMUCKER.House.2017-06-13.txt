 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Avon Grove  Red Devils men's lacrosse team on their State championship victory.   The Red Devils finished the season with a 23-2 record, beating  Philadelphia area powerhouse Conestoga in the PIAA Class 3A title game  with a thrilling 5-4 victory.   Sophomore Zach Augustine was one of the heroes, scoring the game- winning goal in double overtime, a moment that he described as  ``unbelievable.''   This redeeming victory for them comes 3 years after a heartbreaking  loss for the Red Devils in the 2014 State title game. Senior midfielder  Doug Jones, a freshman on that 2014 team, said: ``I remember as a  freshman saying to myself that I wanted to get back here. We knew we  had one goal: to win this. It means the absolute world to us.''   I applaud the commitment displayed by these young men, both to each  other and to their community. Congratulations to the Avon Grove Red  Devils team, the coaches, their families, and the faculty, staff, and  students that made this championship so special.                            ____________________
