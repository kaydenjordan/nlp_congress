 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to amend the  rule to provide for a motion to recommit on the Senate amendment to  H.R. 550 so that minority voices can be heard on the critical issue of  war.    Madam Speaker, before I begin, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of  my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I rise this afternoon to lead a Special  Order alongside my colleagues from the Congressional Western Caucus to  discuss important efforts to modernize one of our Nation's bedrock  conservation laws that has sorely grown outdated and ineffective.   The Endangered Species Act was signed into law 47 years ago to  protect and revitalize species of endangered or threatened animals and  wildlife, truly, a worthy goal.   Unfortunately, the ESA has earned a recovery rate of only about 3  percent, a staggering failure to protect the very species that it was  intended to aid.                                time  1745    And while it has failed to safeguard those species, the law has been  used as a political spearhead for frivolous litigation that threatens  private property rights, public land use decisions, local communities,  and American jobs.   Fortunately, there are ongoing efforts in the people's House here and  within the White House to update and modernize the Endangered Species  Act to better protect species, all while treating States, property  owners, and local stakeholders as partners rather than obstacles to  species conservation.   The Western Caucus recently unveiled a package of 18 bills introduced  by members across the rural West and beyond to strengthen the ESA.  These bills reflect our intention to bring this arcane law into the  21st century, aiming to create a more comprehensive and streamlined  approach to support species recovery while ensuring our communities are  not burdened by overregulation and misleading data.   This package includes my legislation, the Weigh Habitats Offsetting  Locational Effects Act, to ensure all conservation measures are  considered when Federal decisions that impact ESA-listed species are  being made.   By establishing a process that considers the totality of conservation  efforts, we can incentivize private investment in species recovery,  streamline Federal decisionmaking, and promote the comprehensive  efforts of States, local communities, and Tribes.   We should not tie our hands when it comes to species recovery. Using  the best available science, considering all ongoing conservation  measures, streamlining the process for listing decisions, and  empowering State and local efforts creates a comprehensive approach to  advance species recovery and fulfills the true intent of the Endangered  Species Act.   Madam Speaker, with this package of bills, you will hear more from  many of my colleagues in the Western Caucus. We are taking a very  important step toward truly strengthening the ESA.   The Trump administration has also unveiled improvements to the  implementation of ESA regulations developed to increase transparency  and effectiveness of the law.   Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt has rightly focused on  updating the administration of ESA to target the areas where resources  will do the most good, which, of course, are the direct, on-the-ground  conservation measures.   Much like legislation in the Western Caucus package that I and my  colleagues have championed, the updates direct listing decisions to be  based solely on the best science available as well as commercial  information. Only when sound science, not politics, determine  conservation measures can we truly begin to turn the tide to achieve  successes under the ESA.   The revisions also establish greater certainty for timely  decisionmaking by Federal agencies and applicants, therefore providing  streamlined actions and coordination for conservation efforts.   With partners like President Trump, Interior Secretary Bernhardt, and  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Director, Aurelia Skipwith, I believe we  truly can reverse the abysmal track record currently set under the  Endangered Species Act.   Unfortunately, we are seeing efforts right here in the people's House  to completely undermine and halt these important steps being taken by  the administration. Our conversation this afternoon is quite timely, I  believe, because tomorrow the lead Democrat in the House Natural  Resources Committee is marking up legislation to thwart the  administration's rule to  [[Page H618]]  bring more transparency and modernization into the ESA.   Why anyone would be proud of the status quo in which only 3 percent  of the species that have been listed under this law have recovered  truly does baffle me. That 3 percent is quite the meager report card,  so it is disappointing to see so many of my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle advocate for the status quo. I would hope they join  me and my colleagues who are working to strengthen this law in order to  provide real results, not simply evoking political talking points aimed  at appeasing litigious environmental groups.   Madam Speaker, like far too many regulations that come from our  Nation's Capitol, relying on top-down decisions from bureaucrats only  serves to limit economic prosperity. These decisions have not only  negatively impacted local communities, they have done close to nothing  to recover and protect threatened animals and wildlife.   I am looking forward to partnering with many of my colleagues from  the Western Caucus this afternoon to describe our efforts here in the  people's House to finally modernize the Endangered Species Act,  something that is far overdue for our wildlife, for our environment,  and for all of our communities.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Gianforte),  my colleague and good friend, who is a true leader for conservation.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Gianforte; his legislation,  the LIST Act, is exactly the kind of update we need. It is a  straightforward, science-based tool that equips Fish and Wildlife with  exactly the kind of ability to make decisions based on facts regarding  listing decisions. I thank the gentleman for his leadership. He is a  great spokesman for the State of Montana, and I appreciate his help  here this evening.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith), my  good friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Smith, and I appreciate him  for sharing some really personal impacts of a law that--can anyone  think of another law that has been in place for 47 years without any  kind of improvements or changes? It doesn't happen very often.   When we see impacts like that, that impact people's lives--they truly  do--not only species that we are trying to protect but the people who  are trying to live in concert with those species, it is something that  really speaks, I think, to a lot of us. So I thank the gentleman very  much for his bill.   The EMPOWER Act, I think, will give a lot of much-needed change and  improvement to this process so that States and local communities can  have a say. We should have more positive results from the ESA and move  forward from that abysmal 3 percent success rate that we should not be  proud of.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton),  my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Tipton for his comments. I  have to say that he just hit the nail right on the head.   The ESA should encourage and incentivize voluntary conservation  efforts. Species recovery, habitat recovery agreements, along with  private property conservation grants and habitat conservation loan  programs for State and local governments, will save money and resources  while boosting conservation.   The more we can do this locally, the more we can direct these  measures, the more impact they will have on accomplishing what we want  from this conserving of species.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for this commonsense approach,  this collaborative approach that he has taken, and for showing  leadership on all of these crucial issues that are important to us in  the West and all over the country, to the whole Nation.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar), the  leader of the Congressional Western Caucus, someone who has shown a  true sense of commitment to make the ESA something that it should be,  something that is successful that we can all be proud of.     Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Gosar for being here  tonight. He truly has been a leader in this effort to modernize the  ESA. I thank him for his commitment to that.   Legislation like he is proposing is going to be a huge step in  improving the situation that we have in this country. So, I thank the  gentleman for being here, again, very much.   If I could just say, I think it will improve the predictability for  endangered species listings and critical habitat designations, but it  will also level the playing field by applying the same standards for  listing as we do for delisting a species.   If a species is recovered, we should celebrate that. It should be a  happy day, something that is a good thing. That is our goal. Then we  can remove it from the endangered list so that resources can then be  directed toward species that still need to be protected and brought  back. It just makes sense.   I think the best example that comes to mind is the gray wolf. We  should be celebrating that. They are back, and they are back strong.  The science is clear about that. They are recovered, and it should be  removed from the list so that we can better come to the aid of other  endangered species.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for being here  tonight.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. LaMalfa), my good friend and fellow farmer.     Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. LaMalfa and have to say that  he has been a true leader in the Congressional Western Caucus and in  the House of Representatives. It is awesome to be able to have someone  contribute as much as the gentleman does that has the experience and  the knowledge of how these laws impact real people.   Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Olson), my friend who actually serves on the important, powerful  Committee on Energy and Commerce.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.  I did have the privilege of visiting the gentleman's district and  seeing firsthand the Parish Generating Station, a state-of-the-art  carbon capture and sequestration facility. It was amazing and truly  helped me understand the potential of the technology that we now have  at our disposal.   It is that kind of thing that will allow our Nation to truly lead in  the American energy renaissance.                                time  1830    Unfortunately, all too often, some of the complications from the  bureaucracy get in the way, and things like the ESA can prevent us from  reaching our full potential.   I thank the gentleman for his leadership and ensuring that the  economic effects are something too that we need to take into account. I  appreciate the gentleman's contributions here this evening.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the Fifth Congressional  District of the great State of Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman helping us  here this evening as we get down to the final few minutes of our hour.   While the thought behind foreign land acquisition in the ESA may have  been well-intentioned, we need accountability, and we need to be able  to determine whether results are being achieved.   The point the gentleman made about investing in our efforts  domestically makes a lot of sense where we can focus on a results- driven approach using science and not emotion. So I thank my friend  very much for that thought.   In trying to accommodate schedules, if I may, I yield to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman) for a few thoughts that he  has on this. He is a member of the Western Caucus. We are happy to  adopt South Carolina as a Western State.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Norman's thoughts. We  should be doing everything in our power to incentivize landowners to be  active participants in conservation efforts for threatened and  endangered species.   Without oversight over whether current restrictions set by the  Federal Government would actually help these species, and with very  little recourse available for the property owner, this legislation  takes a very important step forward to ensure there is a collaborative  approach.  [[Page H623]]    Madam Speaker, I yield to the good gentleman from the First  Congressional District of the great State of Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Gohmert. The gentleman knows  full well from his time serving on the House Natural Resources  Committee just how ineffective the current ESA is performing. I thank  the gentleman for his leadership and for spearheading the SAVES Act, as  he described, to enhance our conservation measures for endangered  species.   Madam Speaker, you just heard from a variety of members from the  Congressional Western Caucus who represent not only rural districts in  the West but also communities across the Nation, from Montana to  Missouri, from South Carolina to California. Their message was clear:  We must modernize the ESA. Doing so will be good for the species. It  will be good for communities. It will be good for taxpayers. And it  will be good for our economy.    A few Members were unable to join us tonight. I want to list some of  the bills that they are sponsoring: Congresswoman Cheney's Increasing  Access and Multiple Use Act, Congressman Westerman's PETITION Act,  Congressman   Mike Johnson's Critical Habitat Improvement Act,  Congressman Young's LAMP Act, Congressman Stewart's Critical  Infrastructure Act, Congressman Calvert's FISH Act, Congressman  McClintock's Endangered Species Transparency and Reasonableness Act,  and Congressman Buck's Threatened Species Protection Improvement Act.   All of these bills are critical for a comprehensive update to ensure  the ESA accomplishes what it was designed to do: recover threatened and  endangered animals and wildlife.   This package is supported by dozens of organizations, including the  National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce, the National Association of Counties, the Family Farm  Alliance, the National Endangered Species Act Reform Coalition, the  American General Contractors Association, the Independent Petroleum  Association of America, the National Association of Home Builders, the  Western Energy Alliance, the United Snowmobile Association, the  National Mining Association, American Agri-Women, and the National  Cotton Council, amongst many, many, many others.   As we continue to push for reforms to the ESA in the people's House  and work with the administration and the White House to support the  Department of the Interior's updated implementation regulations, I hope  that my colleagues will join us in recognizing that we can do so much  better to recover our Nation's magnificent flora and fauna.   The Western Caucus will remain at the forefront of this effort. A 3  percent success rate is failing our wildlife across this beautiful  country. We must do better.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
