 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise today in support of our amendment  to the INVEST in America Act.   Our amendment would save lives by reviewing the inadequate efforts to  clean up Coldwater Creek in north St. Louis County and posting signs to  prevent further hazardous exposure to our community.   The CDC estimates that 350,000 people have potential radioactive  exposure from Coldwater Creek. That is nearly one in two residents in  Missouri's First District--my district--and I am possibly one of those  people. Too many of us have gotten sick or died because of exposure to  this toxic water. No one should have to face such an injustice. St.  Louis deserves better. St. Louis needs better.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment would immediately start saving lives, and  I urge my colleagues to support it. Invest in America.                                time  2230
