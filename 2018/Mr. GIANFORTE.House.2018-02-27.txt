 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight another example  of Federal overreach that threatens our Montana and Western way of  life. Unclear Federal regulations could force millions of Americans who  recreationally compete in rodeos or participate in other equestrian  events to get a commercial driver's license. But these are not folks  competing for their livelihoods. In a recent story in the Billings  Gazette, Andy Bolich, the head coach for the Montana State University  rodeo team, said: ``For the most part, around Montana, I would say  rodeo is a hobby for most people.''   Yet Federal regulations could force these rodeo participants to wade  through unnecessary, costly red tape for their hobby. That is why I  recently led a letter which a bipartisan group of 26 colleagues signed,  to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. We urged the  Department of Transportation to clarify how the CDL regulations treat  those who participate recreationally in rodeo events.   Mr. Speaker, we must continue reforming, rolling back, and repealing  unnecessary regulations to protect our Montana and Western way of life.                            ____________________
