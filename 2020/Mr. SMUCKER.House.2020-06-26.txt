 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to  today's attempt to override the President's veto.   I think all of us agree that it is important to offer borrowers a  process to discharge loans when they have been defrauded by a school,  and that is what the rule, crafted with significant stakeholder input,  offers. That was the original intent of the borrower defense process  when it was enacted in 1995.   However, in 2016, as we have heard, the Obama administration used  this process to advance an ideological loan forgiveness scheme, and it  worked as they intended. We went from fewer than 60 claims over 20  years to nearly 330,000 claims in 4 years, which would cost the  hardworking taxpayers, if you had to pay this price, $40 billion. And  they will have to pay that price.   Now, I don't need to go into reasons why that 2016 Obama rule was  flawed. Instead, I will highlight some of the improvements made under  the new rule.   This rule strengthens protections for borrowers from fraud and  applies the same accountability metrics to all institutions across the  board.   The rule provides due process for students and institutions but,  rightfully, gives students the last word. The rule keeps the standard  of evidence the same as the one used by the Obama administration, by  the way, and thanks to stakeholder feedback, the rule does not require  borrowers to prove intent.   Another point, this new rule will only apply to new claims for loans  taken out after July 1.   I do want to thank Secretary DeVos and all of the hardworking  individuals at the Department of Education for working through the  caseload under the Obama standard. Your hard work of processing more  than 5,000 cases per week for borrowers seeking relief has not gone  unnoticed.   A vote against this veto override is a vote in favor of creating a  system that is fairer for students and taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution.
