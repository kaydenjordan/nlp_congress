 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record  the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION                 Denmark--SM-2 Block IIIA Standard Missiles         The Government of Denmark has requested to buy up to forty-      six (46) Standard Missile, SM-2 Block IIIA Vertical Launching       Tactical All-Up Rounds, RIM 066M-03-BK IIIA (VLS); up to two       (2) Standard Missile, SM-2 Block IIIA Telemetry, Omni-      Directional, All-Up Rounds, RIM-066M-03-BK IIIA (VLS); and up       to two (2) Standard Missile, SM-2 Block IIIA Telemetry, Omni-      Directional Antenna, Warhead Dud Capable, RIM 066M-03-BK IIIA       (VLS). Also included are MK 13 MOD 0 Vertical Launching       System Canisters, operator manuals and technical       documentation, U.S. Government and contractor engineering,       technical, and logistics support services, and other related       elements of logistics and program support. The total       estimated program cost is $152 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of a NATO ally that is an important force for       political stability and economic progress in the European       region.        This proposed sale would support Denmark's anti-air warfare       capabilities for the Royal Danish Navy's IVER HUITFELDT       Frigate Class ships. The SM-2 Block IIIA missiles, combined       with the Anti-Air Warfare System (AAWS) combat system, will       provide significantly enhanced area defense capabilities over       critical Northern Europe air-and-sea-lines of communication.       Denmark will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment and       support into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of these systems and equipment will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Raytheon Cooperation in       Tucson, Arizona; Raytheon Company, Camden, Arkansas; and BAE       of Minneapolis, Minnesota and Aberdeen, South Dakota. There       are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with       this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Denmark.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.

A determination has been made that Denmark can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       Denmark.                            ____________________
