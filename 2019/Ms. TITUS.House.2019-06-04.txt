 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of over 15,000  Dreamers and TPS holders who live in the heart of Las Vegas. They ask  for nothing more than a shot at the American Dream.   They are teachers, nurses, entrepreneurs, and, more importantly, they  are our neighbors, our friends, our colleagues.   These courageous individuals contribute so much to our communities  where they have spent most of their lives and they call home. They have  made the United States their own country and their own home.   Yet, over the last 2 years, the Trump administration has attacked  Dreamers and TPS holders by rolling back immigration protections and  tearing families apart.   That has got to stop.   By passing the American Dream and Promise Act, this House is going to  be standing up to the hateful anti-immigration policies that have come  to define the Trump administration.   The symbol of the United States must always remain the Statue of  Liberty. We should be putting out a welcoming mat, not building a wall.                            ____________________
