 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate a high school in the  district that I represent, North Side High School. They are also known  as the Steers, and for the past couple of decades, this school has  excelled in sports like cross country, soccer, baseball, and  volleyball, but not under the Friday night lights of Texas in football.   However, for the first time in 40 years, the football team has made  it to the State high school playoffs, and if you are from Texas, you  know that that is a really, really big deal.   The school has a population of around 1,800 students, and 95 percent  are Latino. North Side High School is hoping to dispel the myth that  the community can't succeed on the gridiron.   I want to congratulate Principal Antonio Martinez and Coach Joseph  Turner--who was given the job 5 years ago despite having zero head  coaching experience--and all of the football players on the Steers team  for their historic accomplishment. They are really a prime example of  hard work and dedication and how far it can take you.   I hope that this will not be the last time the Steers make the  playoffs. This has been just a great story for the entire Fort Worth  Independent School District.   Tomorrow night, on Friday, go Steers.                            ____________________
