 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate a constituent from Warren County who has a truly  remarkable story, an American story.   Salsa Ananda Catherina grew up in rural Indonesia on the central  island of Java. She was raised by her grandmother and uncle and lived  in a house without electricity, where water came from an underground  spring.   Salsa left home at age 16 to go to work for Sony TV in Malaysia. Most  of the money she made was sent home to help her family, primarily for  her brother and his four children, but also to her uncle, who helped  raise her.   Salsa moved to Hong Kong at the age of 26 to work with families. She  helped raise children, did cooking and general housekeeping. Again,  most of the money she made was sent back to Indonesia to help her  family survive.   It was in Hong Kong that Salsa taught herself how to speak English,  and, today, she not only speaks English fluently, but she is also  fluent in more than six languages, all of them self-taught.   It was in Hong Kong that Salsa met her future husband, Lincoln  Sokolski, who was there on business. Lincoln is president of Whirley- DrinkWorks! in Warren, Pennsylvania. The pair dated long distance for 5  years, and in 2010, Salsa came to the United States on a fiancee visa.    Salsa and Lincoln were married in Warren on July 10, 2010, on the  beautiful grounds of the Crary Museum. Salsa's first job was as a  volunteer at the Warren County YMCA. She helped greet guests and  performed other customer service responsibilities.   A year later, Salsa had done something she had never done before: she  learned to drive. She obtained her driver's license and started working  at Blair, in the packaging area. Salsa had never driven a car prior to  moving to the United States.   She would soon take a job at Whirley-DrinkWorks! in the office  performing administrative functions, communications, and human  resources. In her more than 5 years at Whirley-DrinkWorks!, she has  become a highly valued and respected teammate. Salsa has also been  recognized for her teamwork, positive attitude, and always coming to  work with the highest integrity and loyalty to the company.   In 2013, Salsa graduated from the year-long Leadership Warren  program, which is designed to educate future leaders on how to work  with nonprofit organizations and help them achieve sustained success.  One key project her team took on was to help teach disadvantaged  children how to read.   Salsa and Lincoln are very active in giving back to the community  with their time, leadership, and personal resources to help make Warren  County a better place to live and work. Among the organizations the  Sokolskis have worked with include the Warren YMCA, the United Fund of  Warren County, Struthers Library Theatre, Warren General Hospital,  Salvation Army, and numerous others.   Mr. Speaker, Salsa Sokolski's story doesn't end there. On February 2,  2018, Salsa achieved one of her greatest accomplishments, something she  considers to be her highest honor--she became a U.S. citizen.   Mr. Speaker, I want to remark on what an incredible person Salsa  Sokolski is. From working hard to take care of her family, to teaching  herself more that six languages and giving back to her community, Salsa  truly is impressive.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Salsa on achieving her American  citizenship. I am proud to call her a fellow American.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today there are a lot of  boys and girls in the Capitol who are dressed for success and ready to  get to work. Of course, I am talking about Take Our Daughters and Sons  to Work Day.   While my three sons are grown and my oldest has children of his own,  I do have the privilege of having Seth Lewis Parrish with me today.   Seth lives in Maryland, and thanks to the nonprofit Tuesday's  Children, he gets to spend the day with me; or, rather, I get to spend  the day with him. This is my second year in a row with my friend, Seth.  I have had the privilege of hosting him for our Take Our Daughters and  Sons to Work Day.   Mr. Speaker, in 2009, Seth's dad was serving in the Army and lost his  life a month and 2 days, Seth tells me, before he was born. Tuesday's  Children uses its experience and expertise to help our military  families work through their own losses.   April is also the Month of the Military Child, so it is even more of  an honor for me to have Seth here again with me today. He is a great  young man with a bright future. He is a Cub Scout, hockey player, flag  football player, and great kid.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, last week, the House  Agriculture Committee marked up and approved H.R. 2, the Agriculture  and Nutrition Act of 2018.   Along with the critical farm supports, the farm bill also authorizes  and provides funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,  also known as SNAP, and formerly called food stamps. SNAP is the  primary Federal nutrition assistance program for those in need and  ensures that no American goes hungry.   As a young, married man, I saw the value and the importance that a  Federal nutrition program, such as SNAP, provided when times got tough.  Coming from central Pennsylvania, I always say that the worst part of  growing up in a rural area is that everyone knows your business. By the  same token, the best thing about growing up in a rural area is that  everyone knows your business. And when times get tough, neighbors  always help neighbors in need.   And that is how I think about SNAP. No matter if you lived down the  longest rural country lane or in the middle of New York City, SNAP is  about neighbors helping neighbors.   Despite the rhetoric that has been espoused by some over the past few  weeks and months about the nutrition title, I would like to discuss  this important legislation, what H.R. 2 actually proposes to do to  improve SNAP.   Over the past 3 years, the Agriculture Committee has held 21  bipartisan hearings on SNAP, while hearing  [[Page H3702]]  from 81 witnesses. We have done our homework. We have heard directly  from those who are impacted the most. We also had not one amendment  from my Democratic colleagues to the Nutrition Title during the  committee markup.   It is a sad legislative process when not only do critics dismiss the  21 hearings, but they also fail to engage in the constructive amendment  process to improve the bill where they see shortcomings. Republican  Members acted to improve this bill, introducing 20 amendments in  committee.   Let me address work requirements and job training. And, clearly, I  think we can all agree that putting individuals on a path to  prosperity, helping them get better access to what I like to call  skills-based education, is the best way to assist an individual, to  assist a family to achieve food security. I am hard-pressed to find  anyone who would disagree with that.    Much has been made by some about work requirements, though. These  work requirements have been on the books as a part of SNAP and,  previously, the Food Stamp program since 1971, even though some States  chose to waive them for many able-bodied adults who did not have  dependents at home. In other words, some States have been circumventing  work requirements.   I like to say it as circumventing providing access to opportunity for  the people who are the most vulnerable, the people who need it most,  the people who are living under financial stress. Some States have been  circumventing those work requirements for adults who are work capable  and don't have children for years.   H.R. 2 strengthens and streamlines these work requirements for able- bodied adults. These folks are work capable. This bill also makes a  historic investment into SNAP Employment and Training, and also an  existing law, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, that this  body, in a bipartisan manner a number of years ago, passed as a  reauthorization to the Workforce Investment Act.   By coupling these work requirements with job training activities, we  can encourage a pathway out of poverty and, quite frankly, a pathway to  long-term self-reliance.   While education and training and the Workforce Innovation Opportunity  Act already exist, H.R. 2 provides States with a significant  investment: tools and options to move people forward, to provide people  an opportunity for upward mobility.   Upward mobility really is the American Dream. It is a dream of  opportunity. And for too long, many have not had those tools within  reach. H.R. 2 does some tremendous improvements to be able to restore  that pathway to opportunity. For some people, it may be for the first  time in their lifetime.   This isn't about burdening the States. It is about helping SNAP  recipients. Those are people--our neighbors, our friends, our  relatives--who are living in difficult, challenging financial times.  Some of it is long term, may be living in poverty for generations-- intergenerational poverty. But for many, it is short term, as a result  of bad luck or bad planning. Whether it is unemployment or  underemployment, these individuals deserve an opportunity to move  forward and to move upwards.   It is about helping SNAP recipients climb the economic ladder and  closing the skills gap. We know that the skills gap, Madam Speaker, is  all too real for so many Americans who wake up in the morning and are  wondering how they are going to make ends meet, how they are going to  pay bills.   They see the job openings that are there, estimated to be close to 6  million today and growing, the number of jobs. I am not talking about  jobs that require bachelor's degrees, 4 years, or 6 years, or anything  like that. These are jobs that largely require skills-based education.   It may be a matter of supportive employment, which, by the way, H.R.  2 supports, where you can actually start earning a paycheck by going to  work to be trained through apprenticeships, supportive employment.  These are jobs that require maybe a certification, some experience or  on-the-job training. All that can lead to pathways to greater  opportunity.   It is about giving the opportunity to poor people, the people who are  living in challenging financial circumstances, folks that you would  consider poor. It gives them the opportunity that they deserve to  achieve not just food security, but economic prosperity.   These new changes only apply to able-bodied adults who do not have  children or dependents with disabilities. For children, it is for those  under the age of 6. Therefore, the vast majority of SNAP recipients,  children, the elderly, the disabled, pregnant women, or individuals  with young children will not be impacted by these changes.   People ages 18 to 59 who are able-bodied deserve a pathway to upward  mobility, Madam Speaker. We don't provide them that today. But with  these changes with the farm bill, with H.R. 2, we give them that hope,  and we give them a pathway to upward mobility.   There are challenges for different groups. We are talking about able- bodied folks who are ages 18 to 59. We all know folks who fall into  that category. They may be family and friends and neighbors. Certainly,  as Members of Congress, we all have constituents who have folks in  those age groups that have fallen on hard times or are struggling  financially, and they need food security. We provide that with H.R. 2,  the farm bill 2018. But more importantly, we provide them a pathway to  opportunity through providing better access to more effective education  and training.   We recognize the challenges. For those who are 18 to 29, and  especially depending on their life circumstances, you are just working  your way into the workforce, it is extremely challenging, and there are  issues that are out there that may have to do with transportation. That  is a fairly frequent one with younger individuals. Certainly, the lack  of work experience, of being able to leverage what skills they have  are, unfortunately, impacted by what skills they don't have--that  skills gap.   With what we do with this farm bill, we actually guarantee a training  slot for each one of these individuals across the country, and we  require case management. The case management that can be provided by  those case managers helps people deal with those barriers that may be  out there that stop people from making the most benefit out of the job  training opportunities and the educational opportunities that will be  provided.   We are not talking about creating any new bureaucracies. It is about  working with any willing and able partner that is in this business  today, all of those agencies--called One-Stop Centers or CareerLink  offices under the Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act--that can help  with this. It could be nonprofits.   One of my favorite nonprofits that does just tremendous workforce  development is Goodwill. They provide case management, and they have  helped--I think the last number I looked at in 2016, they assisted over  300,000 people, some of them with special needs, to be able to get the  skills to be able to fill that skills gap.   And so we recognize the challenges of 18 to 29, but also let's look  at the other end of the spectrum of folks whom we consider work  capable, 50 to 59.                                time  2000    It is very difficult if you lose your job during that age group, for  many reasons, to be able to break back into the workforce. Sometimes  employers are just looking to hire folks a little younger who they can  pay a lower rate, or are unable to pay for the wisdom and experience,  unfortunately. I think investing in that wisdom and experience is a  good investment for employers, but many can be reluctant to do that.   So we know that those individuals also need some extra help of  breaking back into the workforce. This bill does that. This bill  provides them that opportunity to have at least 20 hours of training a  week. It also can be working 20 hours, and you wouldn't do the job  training.   But for so many, helping them retool all that experience in that age  group to be able to find a new opportunity, to be able to take all the  experience that you have developed and break into that workforce, that  group would benefit.   Madam Speaker, let me talk about categorical eligibility.   I know that some have also questioned the proposed changes to what is  known as broad-based categorical eligibility. We actually eliminate  that.  [[Page H3703]]  Under the current law, SNAP recipients are deemed eligible by  qualifying for a noncash TANF or State-funded benefit. What does that  mean?   Well, that means that if I hand you, literally, today--no matter what  your income is, no matter what your assets are--if I hand you a  brochure about SNAP benefits and you take that from me, that makes you  SNAP eligible, even though your income may be very, very comfortable at  supporting your needs and the needs of your family.   If I provide you information and you exercise that information to  call a SNAP hotline, an 800 number, that makes you eligible for SNAP  benefits, despite that your income might be very, very comfortable and  well above the income requirements to be SNAP-eligible.   Why is that a problem?   Because every dollar that is utilized inappropriately--and that is  what happens under those scenarios--takes food out of the mouth of  people who are truly eligible, truly food insecure, truly hungry. We  need to dedicate ourselves to making sure that every dollar is used  appropriately.   We don't take all the efficiencies, certainly, out of the SNAP  program. We actually retain two other categorical categories. One is  based on cash assistance. But the bottom line, those other two  categories, those two application processes, which are more efficient,  absolutely--less paperwork, that is not a bad thing--but at the same  time, we know that with these folks' incomes and assets, they are SNAP  eligible. We know that they are truly experiencing food insecurity.   So, under this bill, categorical eligibility will remain for low- income households that are determined eligible for cash assistance or  ongoing services such as child care, transit, counseling. They are  still in place. They are a part of H.R. 2.   In short, SNAP recipients will continue to receive benefits as long  as they meet the modernized asset test limits proposed in the bill.  Those asset test limits, by the way, are modernized. They are brought  into the 21st century. They have been around for decades, and they have  prevented truly hungry people who are experiencing food insecurity from  being eligible for SNAP benefits.   For the first time, we have changed that so the most vulnerable,  actually, are able to save some money and have some money. We are not  going to punish them for having up to $2,000 in savings. It is a big  change.   In terms of total assets, in the past, if your assets were $3,000,  you were eligible for SNAP. At $3,001, we take the rug and pull it  right out from underneath you. We are going to take that to $7,000 and  we are going to index it to inflation, Madam Speaker.   For those folks who have a person who is an older adult, elderly, or  a disabled person with a disability in the household, we are going to  take that from $5,000 to $12,000.   For people who are struggling financially, paycheck to paycheck,  right now what our government does under the current SNAP program is if  you have a vehicle that is worth $4,650 or less, you are eligible. If  it is $4,651 in value, you are not eligible. We pull the rug right out  from underneath you. We take that to a $12,000 value, in terms of  vehicles.   Madam Speaker, I am very proud of what we have done for the first  time. Really since the Great Society created these poverty cliffs,  where we fixed those. We have taken those poverty cliffs away. We have  indexed them to the Consumer Price Index increases so that they reflect  the realities of what people are struggling with financially. Without  this farm bill, without H.R. 2, those poverty cliffs will continue,  Madam Speaker. It is time to end the poverty cliffs.   Let me deal with reporting issues. The nutrition title has never been  about money. In this whole process, we have never talked about the  costs--we have looked at good policy--but, rather, providing good  policy that provides the best food security for vulnerable individuals.  That has been our goal, and that is what we have achieved with H.R. 2.  The nutrition title has zero sum program funding, and the overall  budget impact is neutral.   You hear all these outrageous claims. And I don't know where this  political speak is coming from, although November is coming. Election  time is bearing down upon us, I guess, because there are some in this  Chamber for whom it is all politics now. They will throw hungry people  under the bus for the purpose of politics in November.   We shouldn't do that, Madam Speaker. This is work that we all need to  be very serious about. I recognize that every bill can be improved. I  was very disappointed that some of my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle here offered no amendments during the markup process, because  I believe that they have got some great ideas. I would hope that they  would work with us when we bring this to the floor in a couple of  weeks. We will continue to refine this.    There were some ideas that were mentioned, but more came in the form  of criticisms and complaints during the farm bill markup in committee.  It would have been better if it had been put forward in serious  thoughts as amendments. A number of them I would have supported. But we  have opportunities to improve.   That said, to help with program integrity, there are also a number of  proposals in the bill that will help combat waste and fraud.   Waste and fraud in this farm bill is estimated to be annually in the  neighborhood of $700 million. Madam Speaker, do you know how many  hungry children we could feed with that $700 million that is wasted or  fraudulently taken and used by folks who aren't eligible for the  program?   The impact that we could have with that $700 million would just be  amazing, actually, and the amount of folks who are experiencing food  insecurity could find food security and they could find greater  opportunity as a result of that.   So the nutrition title does work to better serve eligible children  and adults and older adults who are food insecure by making program  integrity improvements to prevent as much fraud and abuse as possible.  Fraud and abuse of any amount takes food support away from our most  vulnerable citizens. Fraud and abuse, again, is estimated to be $700  million annually.   H.R. 2 addresses that. It incentivizes States, as they administer the  SNAP program, to deal with it. All savings realized through the program  integrity improvement are reinvested in nutrition title programs to  better address food security. It is a win-win. Where States identify  fraud and abuse, States will be able to retain 50 percent of the  savings that they secure.   Let me be clear, though: we expect them to invest that within the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, in order to further  address the needs of their citizens in their States experiencing food  insecurity.   Today, we heard firsthand details from local law enforcement about  alarming fraud that occurred in Jacksonville, Florida, related to SNAP.  Unacceptable. I am so thankful the law enforcement in Florida have  identified that, made those arrests, and are prosecuting.   Between 2012 and 2017, there were some 22,000 fraudulent SNAP  transactions that totaled some $3.7 million in taxpayer dollars. That  is $3.7 million, Madam Speaker, that, if used appropriately and without  fraud, would be able to meet the food insecurity needs of our citizens  that are truly in need. They are at risk of hunger.   These individuals created nonexistent businesses and accepted EBT  payments with no legitimate product in return. 198 individuals have  been accused of selling EBT benefits. Those are the electronic benefit  cards that we use with the SNAP program today. Even worse, a number of  these transactions involved the purchase and exchange of illegal drugs.   Again, as a strong supporter of nutrition assistance and helping  those who are truly in need, this kind of activity is entirely  unacceptable. We take measures. We incentivize States to be able to  identify, stop, and recover that waste, fraud, and abuse. Again, we  have them retain 50 percent of what they are able to get, but we  require them to invest that back into making sure the food insecure  people in our country--men, women, and children--do not go hungry. This  kind of activity is entirely unacceptable and only underscores the need  for more accountability and modern reforms to the law.   Madam Speaker, if I could inquire as to how much time remains.  [[Page H3704]]     Madam Speaker, let me just deal with  some of the rumor mongering that is happening within this Chamber.   One of the things I hear is that the nutrition title of the farm bill  results in a significant number of individuals from receiving SNAP.  Frankly, Madam Speaker, that is absolutely false. Actually, without  this change, a significant number of families experiencing food  insecurity will continue to not be eligible for the needed nutritional  support they have, being food-insecure families.   The 2018 farm bill and nutrition title updates the archaic asset test  that prevented hungry families from accessing SNAP for decades. In  fact, Madam Speaker, many of these asset values have not been changed  since the 1970s. We change them and we index them to inflation.   This update to the asset test will allow individuals and families  experiencing food insecurity to have more in savings, assets, the value  of their vehicle, without affecting their SNAP eligibility.   Additionally, for Active-Duty military households, SNAP's income  determination will, for the first time, provide an exclusion of up to  $500 monthly of their basic housing allowance.   We have a number of folks serving Active Duty who are military and  joined late in life and came with a spouse and kids. It is very  difficult for them to live on what the salary would be of an entry- level member of our military. This is the first time that we address  that issue in this farm bill, H.R. 2, that will be on the House floor  in a few weeks.   There is a criticism out there that the nutrition title creates an  excessive and unneeded new government bureaucracy to implement the SNAP  employment and training.   Madam Speaker, that is false. The farm bill nutrition title grants  States the flexibility to provide services to best meet the needs of  their State. While it provides an education and training slot for  everyone who wants one, the States already have the springboard in  place available through a combination of SNAP education and training,  the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, and State programs.   Under this proposal, States are granted the flexibility needed to  provide services that best meet the needs of their States. There is no  one-size-fits-all mandate. SNAP education and training leverages  willing and able partners--I have mentioned many of those already this  evening--One-Stop CareerLinks, community colleges, State human  resources service. Also, local, State, and national employers, where  someone who is food insecure and living in poverty could have the  access to be able to do an apprenticeship. They could go to work and be  trained through this program.                                time  2015    Finally, Madam Speaker, there are some who have said that more than a  million people will come off SNAP over the next 10 years. It has been  presented as a negative thing. We are talking about folks who will be  coming off because they have achieved greater opportunity.   We are talking about some folks who perhaps are on there just because  they took a SNAP pamphlet or called an 800 number. And if those folks  are truly eligible, they just need to do the application; they show the  income; they meet the asset test; and they will have SNAP. Those  families, those kids, will not come off SNAP. They will have the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.   Part of those, though, that I think the CBO talked about are folks  who truly do have a higher income and are really not eligible for this  program, and those folks will come off if they choose not to fill out  the application or they fill out the application and they are not  eligible. But many of that million-plus that CBO talked about that will  be coming off SNAP, it is because they have gotten good jobs; it is  because they have taken advantage of the education and training  programs that we are now providing greater access to under this 2018  farm bill and, specifically, the Nutrition Title.   Helping our fellow citizens to be able to achieve greater  opportunity, to achieve the American Dream, to prosper, to have a  living wage, that is not a bad thing. That is something that we should  celebrate.   Madam Speaker, we are going to bring this farm bill to the floor here  in a couple of weeks. I hope all of my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle will take the opportunity to read it, to actually see what is in  it. I look forward to working with them to help in any way in terms of  helping them with that process, and I look forward to successfully  passing farm bill 2018 out of the House of Representatives in the weeks  to come.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do  now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 17 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, April 27, 2018, at 9  a.m.                            ____________________
