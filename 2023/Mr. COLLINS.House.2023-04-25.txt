 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call for Secretary Pete  Buttigieg to resign for failing to do his job. He has taken the  Department of Transportation from efficient and effective to woke and  divisive. Instead of keeping Americans safe, tackling supply chain  challenges, and modernizing transportation systems, he is flying all  over the country on private jets to talk about race and gender. Looks  to me like he is campaigning for President on the taxpayers' dime.   I know it sounds like I am being hard on the Secretary, but I do have  some questions.   He recently asked Congress for $20 million to buy female dummies to  use in safety tests. How many total genders is he going to request for?  We are already funding two dummies. Now, he is asking for a third. What  is the total going to be? Forty? Fifty? This is a slippery slope.   Secretary Pete needs to resign so someone else can take the wheel at  the DOT. America needs fewer dummies, not more.                            ____________________
