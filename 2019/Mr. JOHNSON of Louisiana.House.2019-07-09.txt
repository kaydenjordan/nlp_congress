 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to  Mrs. Elsie Waites, who passed away on May 28, 2019.   Mrs. Waites was a native Louisianan from Gloster and was born on May  9, 1920. Throughout her life, she was always known as someone who loved  and cared for those around her.   Of her many accomplishments, Mrs. Waites was an avid volunteer in her  local community, helping young children achieve their dreams. She also  took it upon herself to organize a local quartet group, where she sang  for several years traveling throughout the State.   While Mrs. Waites lived an extraordinary life dedicated and devoted  to service and compassion, her first priority was always her family.  She was a loving mother and grandmother to 8 children, 21  grandchildren, 44 great-grandchildren, and 8 great-great-grandchildren.   One of Mrs. Waites' children, Mrs. Barbara Norton, is my good friend  and former colleague in the Louisiana House of Representatives.   I wish to extend my sincere and deepest sympathies to all of the  family and friends whose lives were blessed by Mrs. Waites. I pray that  God's grace gives them comfort during this time, and that they are able  to reflect on all the joyful memories that she provided.   Proverbs 31 reminds us that:         A woman who fears the Lord is to be praised. Honor her for       all that her hands have done . . . Her children arise and       call her blessed.                            ____________________
