 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Lofgren for  yielding time.   Today, I am proud to stand in strong support of the Testing, Rapid  Analysis, and Narcotic Quality Research Act that I introduced with my  colleague from Georgia, Representative  Mike Collins.   In recent months, criminals have turned to xylazine, a common animal  tranquilizer, to make fentanyl. If injected, this drug can have  horrible side effects, including large wounds at the injection site.   As a doctor, I have seen firsthand the horrific impact of the drug  crisis on our families and communities.   Addictive, dangerous substances like opioids have wreaked havoc in  Colorado, where we are now losing approximately 2,000 Coloradans a year  to fentanyl and meth overdoses. These numbers are likely to worsen with  the emergence of xylazine.   Our bipartisan legislation directs the National Institute of  Standards and Technology to make it easier and faster to detect drugs  containing xylazine and novel synthetic opioids. It also supports the  development of safe handling processes to protect law enforcement  officers and forensic chemists from this dangerous substance.    This effort will ensure our first responders have the support that  they need to detect, identify, and better understand synthetic opioids  and ultimately help save American lives.   At a time of deep division in our country, I am encouraged by the  bipartisan support to address this next wave of the drug crisis.   I thank Representative Collins for working with me to introduce this  bill and Chairman Lucas and Ranking Member Lofgren for their help in  bringing it to the House floor. I also thank Senators Welch and Cruz  for spearheading this effort in the Senate.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
