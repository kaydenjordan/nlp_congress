 Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to be supporting the  Heroes Act.   This bill will provide $1 trillion to state and local governments on  the frontlines of this pandemic to retain essential workers on payroll.   It will give much needed relief to renters and homeowners at risk of  losing their homes.   It will finally give direct payments to all taxpayers, including  workers with Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers and eligible  individuals from mixed-status families.   It will help families continue putting food on the table.   And I am particularly proud that it includes my bill, which would set  aside 10 percent of Paycheck Protection Program funds for minority and  community lenders that lend to the smallest businesses.   The American people need help now.   We cannot wait to act.   I urge all my colleagues to vote for this bill, which will help local  and state governments, essential workers, families, and small  businesses across America.
