 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6 which  includes my bill, the Treating Barriers to Prosperity Act.   The Appalachian region, including much of my home State of  Pennsylvania, has an overdose death rate 65 percent higher than the  rest of the country for people ages 15 to 64.   My legislation will allow communities to use Appalachian Regional  Commission funding for everything from attracting doctors to putting in  broadband for telemedicine. It will spur economic growth in communities  hit hardest by the opioid epidemic, while also helping those struggling  with addiction by breaking down barriers to employment.
