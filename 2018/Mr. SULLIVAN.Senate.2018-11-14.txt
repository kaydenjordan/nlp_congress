 Mr. President, I want to echo what my colleague from  Tennessee just mentioned about a lot of bipartisan accomplishments on  the Senate floor over the last several weeks. They are really important  ones.   He led the charge on the opioid bill which is going to help our  entire country and so many others. They don't always get reported in  the press, but it is important to make sure our fellow Americans, our  constituents, know that is happening.   This afternoon, I want to talk about another one that is a really  important accomplishment that we were able to achieve on the Senate  floor a couple of hours ago; that is, the Coast Guard Authorization Act  of 2018.   A number of Senators have already been down on the floor to talk  about this: John Thune, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, which  is where the oversight and responsibility of the Coast Guard lies;  Senator Wicker from Mississippi; Senator Carper--so many Senators  contributed to this important piece of legislation that we just passed  today by almost a vote of over 90 Senators.   It is a very bipartisan piece of legislation that we were able to get  through the Senate floor today. As you know, this has taken some time.  For almost 2 years, we have been working on the Coast Guard bill. A  number of us put a lot of time and effort into it.   I do want to do a shout out to my staff: Eric Elam, my legislative  director; Tom Mansour, a Coast Guard fellow in my office; and Scott  Leathard. All of them worked literally for the last year and a half,  night and day, on this bill.   Again, it is important for America and certainly important for my  great State of Alaska. It raises a broader issue. We just celebrated  Veterans Day. Our country was rightfully focused on our veterans. There  was a lot of focus on the centennial of the Armistice of World War I,  the ending of World War I. Often when there is a focus on the armed  services, it focuses on the armed services at the Pentagon--Army, Navy,  Air Force, and Marines--and sometimes the brave men and women in the  Coast Guard can be overlooked. They shouldn't be. We all know that.   One of the things I tried to focus on in my time in the Senate is  making sure they are not. Prior to 9/11, the Coast Guard was probably  the only service in the entire U.S. military--because they are a member  of the services of the U.S. military--whose members were risking their  lives every single day on the job. Post-9/11, with the national  security challenges we have, every member of our military--all the  services--are risking their lives every day, but the Coast Guard does  it day in and day out.   Pre-9/11 and post-9/11, men and women in that wonderful service  undertake a heroic mission with actions that we see saving American  lives and defending our national security.   What do they focus on and what does this bill focus on? Well, the  bottom line is, this bill is focused on making sure the men and women  of the Coast Guard have the resources to do their job. Their job is  varied and extremely important.   We have all seen the Coast Guard coming out of the sky to rescue us-- rescue Americans on seas when they are in trouble; with the hurricanes  we have seen over the last couple of years; the heroic pictures of the  men and women in the Coast Guard doing thousands of rescues. We see  that as part of their mission. They have been described as angels in  helicopters. When they show up, it is certainly witnessing America at  its very best. We have seen a lot of that. The mission of the Coast  Guard also includes ice-breaking, marine environmental protection, port  security, and international crisis response. Many members are deployed  overseas in places like the Middle East, combating illegal fishing by  other nations, protecting American fishermen, protecting Alaskan  fishermen, readiness to support the Department of Defense operation. It  is a long list. The Coast Guard does it very well.   Importantly, the bill we just passed today will significantly help  the men and women with this important mission. You and I serve on the  Armed Services Committee. Again, what my colleague from Tennessee was  talking about is another one of these bipartisan areas of achievement  that we have seen in the Senate in the last year, year and a half,  consensus on issues like rebuilding our military. We are doing that on  the Armed Services Committee through the National Defense Authorization  Act that passes the Senate and the House every year.   I am certainly honored to be on the Armed Services Committee, where  we are working on rebuilding from the cuts of 2010 to 2015. They were  almost 25 percent of the Department of Defense budget while national  security challenges were increasing all over the world.   The other thing we are rebuilding--and it doesn't always get a lot of  attention--we are rebuilding the Coast Guard. In essence, this bill we  passed today is the NDAA for the U.S. Coast Guard. The recapitalization  and rebuilding of the Coast Guard is a core element of the bill we just  passed.   Let's run through a couple of examples. Like what we just did in the  NDAA, increasing the end strength of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and  Marines, this bill today works to increase the end strength of the U.S.  Coast  [[Page S6957]]  Guard. Importantly, it starts to really accelerate what we are doing in  terms of recapitalizing the Coast Guard fleet. For example, this bill  authorizes the building of six more fast response cutters--these are  critical cutters for the U.S. Coast Guard--and three more national  security cutters for the U.S. Coast Guard. These are incredible  vessels. They are huge--400-plus feet.   I had the honor to go out to a commissioning of the Douglas Munro,  one of the new national security cutters. These ships can do it all.  They look like big Navy ships that can do it all. That is what these  national security cutters are doing.   This legislation also helps to streamline the building of Navy ships,  which is important as we recapitalize the fleet. It directs the Coast  Guard's overall policies.   Now I want to talk a little bit about some of the more specific  provisions in this bill that relate to my great State, the great State  of Alaska, where the Coast Guard and the people of Alaska have a very  special relationship. We love the men and women of the Coast Guard. We  see them in action all the time, doing heroic missions. We had the  largest Coast Guard base in the country in Kodiak, AK, and District  17--that is the Coast Guard district in Alaska--is the largest  geographic district in terms of square miles in the entire Coast Guard  area of responsibility. There are close to 4 million square miles and  over 47,000 miles of coastline just in the State of Alaska. That is  more coastline than in the rest of the lower 48 States combined. So the  Coast Guard has a huge mission in Alaska--a really important mission in  Alaska--and it covers all kinds of territory.   Let me just give you, again, a sense of the importance that District  17 and the men and women of the Coast Guard in Alaska have to my  constituents, to their fellow Alaskans--a snapshot from District 17's  website. It reads, just in an average month in Alaska, that the Coast  Guard saves 22 lives, performs 53 assists, and conducts 13 security  boardings and 22 security patrols throughout this gigantic area of  District 17, just to name a few of its duties, in addition to making  sure that illegal fishing in this part of our Nation doesn't occur.   I am also grateful that as we look at the recapitalization of the  Coast Guard's fleet, the former Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral  Zukunft, recognized how important Alaska was and sent me a letter, as I  am the chairman of the subcommittee in the Commerce Committee that is  in charge of the Coast Guard. My team and I put in a lot of effort with  Chairman Thune and others in writing this bill and in working on it for  the last 2 years.   In a letter to me prior to his retirement, the former Commandant of  the Coast Guard said that we know there are challenges and that there  is a growing mission, from the Coast Guard's perspective, in Alaska. In  terms of this recapitalization, we see a lot of these vessels coming to  Southeast Alaska. For example, six fast response cutters that are being  built and that are part of this bill are slated for Alaska, and two  additional patrol boats are for Petersburg and Juneau. The FRCs will be  home-ported--two of them--in Kodiak, one in Seward, one in Sitka, and  two previously commissioned FRCs will remain stationed in Ketchikan. So  those are a lot of assets coming, and I believe there are going to be  more. We are going to continue to work on that.   I thank the former Commandant and the current Commandant, Admiral  Schultz, who has been on the job for about 6 months and has already  been to Alaska three times. That is just another testament to  recognizing how important the Coast Guard is to the great State of  Alaska. I can't thank enough the men and women of the Coast Guard  nationally and in my State for the great work they do.   There are a number of provisions in this legislation, in addition to  the national areas of recapitalizing the Coast Guard, that are actually  focused, not surprisingly, on Alaska, given how important the Coast  Guard is to Alaska. Let me just highlight a few of them.   There is a provision that says the Coast Guard must position assets  to respond to any incidences given the national security and economic  significance growing in the Arctic region. The Department of Defense is  starting to focus on the Arctic region, and, certainly, the Coast Guard  is.   The provision further states that it requires the Coast Guard, in  consultation with the Department of Defense, to report to Congress on  the progress being made in implementing the Coast Guard's Arctic  strategy and to provide an assessment of the placement of additional  Coast Guard assets and cutters in light of meeting those strategic  objectives in the Arctic.   We know that the demands of a more strategic Arctic are putting a  strain on the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard. We believe--I  believe--that the provisions in this bill state that the Coast Guard  needs to look at that and provide more assets to do the mission if need  be.   As we are recapitalizing the fleet, it also talks about moving bigger  cutters in for smaller ones in region 17 because the Coast Guard must  continue to have adequate coverage. You don't want to move one ship out  and another ship in and have a gap in coverage. This bill focuses on  that--no gaps in coverage.   The bill also requires the Coast Guard to deliver a plan to extend  the life of the Polar Star, which is the heavy icebreaker that is home- ported in Seattle and has a critical mission. Again, in the NDAA this  year, we received authorization for six additional heavy icebreakers-- three heavies, three mediums. Yet we need to make sure that we still  have coverage with the icebreakers we have as we look to build and  deploy the new Coast Guard icebreakers that were authorized in the NDAA  this summer. This provision focuses on that.   It directs the Coast Guard to conduct persistent, aircraft-based  surveillance in terms of monitoring illegal, unreported, and  unregulated fishing in the Western Pacific. This is a huge problem. We  have our 200-mile limit where American fishermen and Alaska fishermen  can fish off the coast of Alaska and other States, but we often have  pirate fishing going on. We have countries such as China that come and  illegally take fish that should be in our economic zone or on the high  seas. The Coast Guard does a great job in monitoring and catching this  illegal fishing, which harms the oceans and harms our fisheries. This  bill underscores how important that mission is and directs the Coast  Guard to make sure there is persistent, aircraft-based surveillance in  monitoring what we call IUU fishing--illegal, unreported, unregulated  fishing--in the Western Pacific.    The bill requires the Coast Guard to have tested the capability of  oilspill vessel response plans in Alaskan waters and to report to  Congress on these capabilities.   It also, importantly, focuses on funding to update and maintain the  Nation's nautical charts with there being an emphasis on the Arctic,  where there is growing vessel traffic. Yet we have nautical charts that  are 70 or 80 years old, and some places have never been charted.   This bill facilitates the construction of a viable home port for the  NOAA research vessel Fairweather in Ketchikan, AK, which is an issue  that is important to my constituents, and to be perfectly honest, with  regard to NOAA, it has been hanging out there for too long. This bill  helps to make sure that the vessel is going to be home-ported where it  should be legally home-ported under the law, and that is in Ketchikan.   Those are just a few examples of the national aspects of this bill  for the Coast Guard's recapitalization effort and of some of the more  important provisions that focus on the Coast Guard's special  relationship with Alaska.   This act also contains many important items for our fishermen and  fisheries and our maritime industry throughout the United States,  whether in the oceans, whether on the Great Lakes, whether in the  rivers that we have. It is very, very important to our fishing  community, to our fishermen, and to the maritime workers throughout the  country.   Of course, this is important to my State. I often refer to Alaska as  the superpower of seafood. What am I talking about? Almost 60 percent  of the commercial and sport fish that is harvested in the United States  of America comes from Alaska. It is billions of dollars in terms of the  economic impact for our State. So included in this legislation is  important language to permanently address issues that have plagued  Alaskan fishermen, American fishermen, and  [[Page S6958]]  commercial vessel owners and operators of maritime fleets and,  importantly, the workers in these important industries for decades-- regulatory problems and challenges that these important industries and  the important men and women who work in these industries have been  struggling with for decades with no long-term solutions. At long last,  this bill addresses these--the long-term, permanent solutions.   What am I talking about?   Currently, our fishing fleets throughout the entire country, as well  as vessel owners and operators--again, throughout the entire country in  rivers, lakes, and oceans--are forced to comply with a patchwork of  burdensome Federal and State regulations that are well-intentioned but  often conflicted for incidental discharges off the decks of these ships  and for ballast water. Let me start with the incidental discharges.   Again, it is very important to my State but very important to any  State with regard to the fishing industry and fishermen who work hard  every day. If you are a commercial fisherman on a fishing vessel and  you have caught some fish and you want to hose down your deck--because  let's face it; fishing can be a bit of a messy business--through a long  history of requirements and lawsuits, you are forced to report to the  EPA these incidental discharges, and you need to get a permit to hose  down your deck of a fishing vessel or you will face a fine.   Now, you don't have to be a fisherman to recognize that this is  ridiculous and that people--Democrats and Republicans in this body-- have been trying to address this issue for decades because it creates  inefficiency, and it certainly doesn't help the environment. It adds to  costs, inhibits economic prosperity, and hurts fishermen and the  vessels they operate. This body has introduced short-term fixes for  years to try and address this. Those have not been sufficient. So this  bill addresses it for good.   Let me talk about another provision that tries to cut through the  patchwork of burdensome State regulations--again, well-intentioned but  often conflicted for ballast water and vessels. Currently, ballast  water is regulated by both the Coast Guard and the EPA. They both have  separate, inconsistent, and sometimes directly conflicting sets of  Federal requirements that are interdispersed with requirements from  States. This is literally a patchwork of requirements for vessels that  move through different State waters. Let me give you an example.   You are the owner-operator of a commercial vessel that is going up  the full length of the Mississippi River. You are moving commerce and  keeping a strong economy stronger. As you do that, not only must you  comply with inconsistent Coast Guard and EPA requirements, but you also  will likely have to comply with different and separate requirements  regarding ballast water for Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, and  Missouri. You get the picture. It is a patchwork of regulations--all  well-intentioned--that has the impact of inhibiting commerce and, most  importantly, of inhibiting job opportunities for the men and women in  this commerce. Twenty-five States have been regulating ballast water  under separate, inconsistent, and sometimes directly conflicting sets  of requirements. This has not only inhibited U.S. economic growth, but  it also actually makes it more likely that invasive species will  accidentally be introduced into this ballast water because the  requirements are so different, it is hard to keep up with them.    So, again, what this bill does at long last, working across the  aisle--and trust me, we worked on this for over a year, on these  provisions, Democrats and Republicans rolling up their sleeves, in good  faith, getting to work. Because we know how important this is to our  constituents, we looked at and focused on getting permanent solutions,  not quick fixes--the way these issues have been handled in the past,  for over a decade--to these significant challenges.   This bill will provide a permanent exemption on incidental vessel  discharges for all commercial fishing vessels and commercial vessels  under 79 feet in length. This is very important to the American fishing  industry, the men and women in that industry, and it is something that  they have been advocating for and Members of this body, of both  parties, have been trying to get for well over a decade. Well, we did  it today. That is important. As I said, without this exemption, small  vessel owner-operators would be required, as they have been for years,  to get an EPA permit to hose off their decks--not a good use of the EPA  and not a good use of the hard-working time of American fishermen.   Similarly, this bill provides a comprehensive solution to this  patchwork ballast water challenge that I just described, establishing a  single, nationally uniform standard for the regulation of ballast water  and other vessel discharges, and the EPA and the Coast Guard, with  input from the States, will work together. This uniform standard will  have the impact of helping our environment and our maritime industry  and fishing industry workers and the U.S. economy all at the same time.  That is an important accomplishment, and that is why over 90 Senators  voted for this bill today.   In conclusion, the men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard do heroic  work day in and day out. I am honored to chair the subcommittee of the  Commerce Committee in charge of the Coast Guard. This bipartisan bill  will support them and their incredibly important mission, and it was  long overdue. It was long overdue, but we got it done.   The Coast Guard's motto, ``Semper Paratus''--``Always Ready''--is a  motto I think we can learn from here in the U.S. Senate. It is so  appropriate for what they do for us. I want to make sure that the  members of the Coast Guard who are watching or learning about this bill  know that it is a signal that they have strong bipartisan support from  the vast majority of the Members of the U.S. Senate.   Hopefully, this bill will get over to the House quickly. We have been  working closely with the House on a number of these provisions, and  they are going to pass it, we hope, and we will get it to the President  soon for his signature.   Going forward, we have to work to make sure there is not an almost 2- year delay in getting the Coast Guard Authorization Act passed in the  U.S. Senate. When we work together, we can see that it is very  bipartisan.   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, the Presiding Officer  and I both know that the National Defense Authorization Act moves every  year. What I think we need to do is make sure, when we start debating  the NDAA in late spring, early summer every year, as we do, that we  reserve time to move and debate and pass the Coast Guard bill as well.  This is an issue I have raised with the leadership on both sides of the  aisle, with the chairmen of the Commerce Committee and the Armed  Services Committee, and I am hopeful that we can make some progress on  that so we are moving a Coast Guard Authorization Act, as we should be,  with the other services in the NDAA. But that is for tomorrow. For  today, we have an important accomplishment for our country, an  important accomplishment for the State of Alaska, and most importantly,  an important accomplishment for the men and women of the U.S. Coast  Guard who continue to undertake heroic actions day in and day out on  our behalf.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, November 15; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for  their use later in the day; further, that following leader remarks, and  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the Senate be in a period  of morning business with Senators permitted to speak therein for up 10  minutes each until 11 a.m.; further, that following morning business,  Senator Paul be recognized under the order of November 13 in relation  to S.J.
