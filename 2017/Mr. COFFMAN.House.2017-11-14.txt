 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2810, the  conference report for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2018.   The conference report contains significant policy and funding  initiatives that continue our commitment to our troops and their  families, all while maintaining military readiness and addressing  important military personnel issues.   The provisions contained in this bill provide our warfighters,  retirees, and their families the necessary pay and benefits to sustain  them in today's highly stressed force.   To that end, this bill establishes a fully funded by-law pay raise  for all our servicemembers. After years of lower than by-law pay raise  requests, it is critical that we continue to give our troops and their  families the pay increases they have earned.                                time  1430    It increases the end-strengths of the Active National Guard and  Reserve Forces, thereby increasing mission readiness while reducing the  stress and strain on the force and their families. It permanently  preserves special survivor indemnity allowance payments and closes the  gap in the ``widows tax'' to surviving military spouses.   It also continues to improve sexual assault prevention and response  by adding a new provision to the Uniform Code of Military Justice,  specifically prohibiting nonconsensual sharing of intimate images;  expanding Special Victims' Counsel training; and expanding the annual  Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Report.   Finally, spouses of servicemembers are challenged by varying State  licensure and certification requirements when forced to move to a new  State by military orders. Rather than imposing a single Federal  standard on the States, we provide a $500 reimbursement to defray these  costs. We ask States to work with the Secretary of Defense to develop  common standards where possible.   In conclusion, I want to thank the ranking member, Ms. Speier, and  her staff for their contributions to this report.   Of course, we were joined by an active, informed, and dedicated group  of subcommittee members. Their recommendations and priorities are  clearly reflected in the conference report for the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support the passage of  this conference report.
