 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This rule makes in order two bills and four amendments: H.R. 50,  Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2017; and H.R.  3281, Reclamation Title Transfer and Non-Federal Infrastructure  Incentivization Act.   H.R. 50 amends the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 and the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974. This is a bill that Congress already  voted on in 2015 in nearly a party-line vote in the House before dying  in the Senate.   I understand my colleagues think that this is a very important issue.  As a former mayor and council member, I know how difficult Federal  regulations can be to implement. This legislation, however, does  nothing except grind progress to a standstill, blocking improvements to  our Nation's health, safety, and environmental protections.   Perhaps that is why this rule also makes in order H.R. 3281, which  assaults our Nation's environmental and health standards in a different  way. This legislation, which I opposed in the Natural Resources  Committee, would authorize a de facto privatization of Federal  infrastructure across the Western U.S., all while stiffing our  taxpayers.   The bill does not require that taxpayers be compensated for the loss  of publicly owned land and mineral interests. Imagine, once again, this  Congress is putting the interests of private business ahead of our  hardworking taxpayers.   This legislation is a proposal from President Trump's infrastructure  plan, which largely seeks to enrich developers and private businesses  at the expense of our hardworking taxpayers and the general public as a  whole.   I could understand spending time on these bills if we had finished  the pressing work before us, but with thousands--and I mean thousands-- of children still separated from their parents due to the cruel actions  of this administration, is this really what we are spending time on?  Where are the moral priorities and family values of this Congress?  [[Page H6055]]    I have spoken with the Department of Homeland Security, and I have  spoken with the HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement, and there has been  one constant answer from both of them: They have absolutely no idea  what they are doing, no idea where the parents of these children are,  no idea how many children have been put into foster care, no idea when  these families will be reunited, and no idea what comes next.   Congress has a responsibility to act, not next week, not next month,  not next year, but today. Once we leave for August recess, let me  remind you, it will be 39 days before we come back. That means 39 more  days that we are going to allow children to be held in detention, in  cages, in cold cells, without their parents.   The Trump administration has already missed the first deadline to  reunite families. What assurances do we have that they won't miss the  second deadline, or the third one, or possibly the fourth one? How many  more deadlines does this Congress, this administration, need before we  realize that we are complicit--complicit--in separating children from  their parents who care about them?   And while we have them in our custody, we are complicit in not  properly taking care of them. ``Full of dirt and lice,'' that is how an  immigrant mother described her 14-month-old baby son who had been  returned to her after 85 days of separation.   We must act because this administration chooses not to. Failure to do  so will mean more families are broken forever, more families like  Yasmin's.   On May 22, Yasmin and her two teenage daughters entered the United  States and were immediately apprehended and then separated. The mother  was transferred to the McAllen holding center--also known as the dog  pound, as they call it--with a group of other separated mothers.   After 7 days, the mothers were told that they would be deported  without their children. Many of the mothers fainted when they heard  this news. One mother had a seizure in a cell. After appearing in  court, Yasmin was handcuffed, shackled, and given no information on the  status of her children. Family values.   After being transferred to another detention center, Yasmin was  informed that her daughters had been reunited with their father. But  Yasmin still remains in a detention center, where she has gone more  than a month separated from her children. She has received absolutely  no information about when she will see her children again and must  simply wait and pray. Family values.    These people are fleeing for their lives to the promise and safety of  the United States, and we aren't even considering their asylum cases.   Let me tell you another story, Mr. Speaker. A woman from El Salvador  decided to flee to the U.S. with her two young boys, ages 4 and 10,  after receiving grave threats from MS-13 gang members. Prior to fleeing  to the U.S., she had sought protection from Salvadoran authorities  through the legal process but had not received any protection.   In March of this year, she presented herself to the border officials,  after making a conscious decision not to enter the U.S. at an official  port of entry. She had learned that CBP officials are turning away  asylum seekers in direct--direct--violation of the United States and  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.   The mother and her two boys were apprehended and taken to a Border  Patrol processing station. The mother was sent to an adult detention  center in Laredo, and the boys were sent to a shelter for unaccompanied  children under the Office of Refugee Resettlement within Health and  Human Services.   At one point, the brothers were separated from one another and placed  into two separate foster homes, but were eventually reunited and  released to family on the East Coast.   Under current law and procedure--something this Congress could change  today--the children have absolutely no right to an appointed lawyer.  Without their mother to speak on their behalf, the 4-year-old and the  10-year-old boys must make a case for asylum on their own in separate  court cases.                                time  1245    This is what we could be doing today: One, fixing the broken laws  that have toddlers, toddlers who are barely out of diapers,  representing themselves in court and fixing the root causes of these  issues with the Central American Family Protection and Reunification  Act, legislation I have offered with Ranking Member Engel.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule so that we can use  our limited time here to act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will  offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.J. Res. 31, sponsored by  Representatives Deutch and McGovern and Raskin, which would reserve  Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United by enshrining in the  Constitution of the United States a democracy for all amendments,  establishing the right of the American people to enact State and  Federal laws that regulate spending in public elections.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch) to discuss this proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished ranking member of the  Committee on Rules, who has been a leader  [[Page H6056]]  on this issue of money and politics for years.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Massachusetts.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gallego) to speak on the continuing horror stories about  what has happened at our Nation's border.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   One final story to remind all of us what is at stake here.   Earlier this year, a Honduran father was separated from his wife and  child just days after President Trump's zero-tolerance policies went  into effect. Marco Antonio Munoz crossed the Rio Grande with his wife  and 3-year-old son on May 12 near the tiny town of Granjeno, Texas.  Soon after Marco and his family were taken into custody, they arrived  at a processing station in nearby McAllen and said they wanted to apply  for asylum.   Border Patrol agents told the family that they would be separated.  That is when Border Patrol officials literally ripped Marco's child  from his arms. At no point did Marco attempt to attack or assault the  Border Patrol staff, but due to his anguish, he was placed into a  padded isolation cell.   Marco began to pray, pray for his family and pray for their safety.  Hours passed, and the next morning, after receiving no information  about where his family was or when he would see them next, Marco took  his life.   Family values.   This is the law and order President Trump has no respect for either.  He is disrespecting the rule of law and violating court orders by  detaining children, babies, and he is creating  [[Page H6057]]  hysteria among families and confusion among Border Patrol and HHS  officials.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question and  the rule because we can do better than this. We have family values that  we must stand for, and I urge my colleagues to oppose this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
