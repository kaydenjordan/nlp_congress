 Mr. Speaker, today I stand to extend my heartfelt  congratulations to Arkansas State University Red Wolves football team  for their well-deserved selection to participate in the 2023 Camellia  Bowl, where they will face Northern Illinois University.   Reflecting on the 2023 football season, there is every indication  that the Red Wolves are poised for success in their upcoming clash with  NIU.   Quarterback Jaylen Raynor has been a true leader on the field,  helping deliver exhilarating victories that have ignited the enthusiasm  of Arkansas State's devoted fans.   As an alum of Arkansas State, I eagerly await the moment when Coach  Butch Jones and the entire wolf pack take the field on December 23 to  proudly represent Natural State on a national stage.   Wolves up.                            ____________________
