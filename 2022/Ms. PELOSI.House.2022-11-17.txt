 Madam Speaker, as we gather here, we stand on sacred  ground, the Chamber of the United States House of Representatives, the  heart of American democracy.   I will never forget the first time I saw the Capitol. It was on a  cold January day, when I was 6 years old. My father, Thomas  D'Alesandro, Jr., was about to be sworn in for his fifth term in  Congress representing our beloved hometown of Baltimore.   I was riding in the car with my brothers. They were thrilled and  jumping up and down and saying to me: ``Nancy, look, there's the  Capitol.'' And every time I would say: ``I don't see any capitals. Is  it a capital A, a capital B, or a capital C?''   Finally, I saw it, a stunning white building with a magnificent dome.  I believed then, as I believe today, this is the most beautiful  building in the world because of what it represents. The Capitol is a  temple of our democracy, of our Constitution, of our highest ideals.   On that day, I stood with my father on this floor as he took the  sacred oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States  against all enemies, foreign and domestic.    All of us who have served in this House have taken the hallowed oath  of office. It is the oath that stitches us together in a long and  storied heritage. Colleagues who served before us are all our  colleagues: colleagues like Abraham Lincoln, Daniel Webster, Shirley  Chisholm, Patsy Mink, and our beloved John Lewis.   Personally, it binds me as a colleague to my father, a proud New Deal  Congressman and one of the earliest Italian Americans to serve in  Congress.   This is an oath we are duty-bound to keep, and it links us with the  highest aspirations of the ages.   In this room, our colleagues across history have abolished slavery;  granted women the right to vote; established Social Security and  Medicare; offered a hand to the weak, care to the sick, education to  the young, and hope to the many.   Indeed, it is here, under the gaze of our patriarch George Washington  in the people's House that we have done the people's work.   My colleagues, I stand before you as Speaker of the House, as a wife,  a mother, a grandmother, a devout Catholic, a proud Democrat, and a  patriotic American, a citizen of the greatest republic in the history  of the world, which President Lincoln called the last, best hope of  Earth.   Indeed, in the words attributed to another of our colleagues, the  legendary Daniel Webster: ``Hold on, my friends, to the Constitution of  your country and the government established under it. . . .   ``Miracles do not cluster. That which has happened but once in 6,000  years cannot be expected to happen often.''   Indeed, American democracy is majestic, but it is fragile. Many of us  here have witnessed its fragility firsthand; tragically, in this  Chamber. So democracy must be forever defended from forces that wish it  harm.   Last week, the American people spoke, and their voices were raised in  defense of liberty, of the rule of law, and of democracy itself.   With these elections, the people stood in the breach and repelled the  assault on democracy. They resoundingly rejected violence and  insurrection and in doing so, ``gave proof through the night that our  flag was still there.''   Now, we owe to the American people our very best to deliver on their  faith, to forever reach for the more perfect union, the glorious  horizon that our Founders promised.   The questions before us in this Congress and this moment are urgent;  questions about the ideals that this House is charged by the  Constitution to preserve and protect: `` . . . establish justice,  ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote  the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves  and our posterity.''   Our posterity, our children. Babies born today will live into the  next century, and our decisions will determine their future for  generations to come.   While we will have our disagreements on policy, we must remain fully  committed to our shared, fundamental mission: To hold strong to our  most treasured democratic ideals, to cherish the spark of divinity in  each and every one of us, and to always put our country first.   In their infinite wisdom, our Founders gave us their guidance: ``e  pluribus unum'', ``out of many, one.''   They could not have imagined how large our country would become or  how different we would be from one another, but they knew we had to be  united as one.   We the people: One country, one destiny.   It has been with great pride that, in my 35 years in the House, I  have seen this body grow more reflective of our great Nation, our  beautiful Nation.   When I came to the Congress in 1987, there were 12 Democratic women.  Now, there are over 90 and we want more.   The new members of our Democratic Caucus will be about 75 percent  women, people of color, and LGBTQ. We have brought more voices to the  decisionmaking table. When I entered leadership in 2002, there were  eight of us. Today, there are 17 members of leadership.   When I first came to the floor at 6 years old, never would I have  thought that some day I would go from homemaker to House Speaker. In  fact, I never intended to run for public office.   Mommy and Daddy taught us through their example that public service  is a noble calling and that we all have a responsibility to help  others. In our family, my brother, Tommy, then became mayor of  Baltimore also.   It has been my privilege to play a part in forging extraordinary  progress  [[Page H8557]]  for the American people. I have enjoyed working with three Presidents,  achieving historic investments in clean energy with President George  Bush; transformative healthcare reform with President Barack Obama; and  forging the future, from infrastructure to healthcare to climate action  with President Joe Biden.   Now, we must move boldly into the future, grounded by the principles  that have propelled us this far and open to fresh possibilities for the  future.   Scripture teaches us that: ``For everything there is a season, and a  time for every purpose under Heaven.''   My friends, no matter what title my colleagues have bestowed upon  me--Speaker, Leader, Whip--there is no greater official honor for me  than to stand on this floor and to speak for the people of San  Francisco.   This I will continue to do as a Member of the House, speaking for the  people of San Francisco, serving the great State of California, and  defending our Constitution.   With great confidence in our caucus, I will not seek reelection to  Democratic leadership in the next Congress.   For me, the hour has come for a new generation to lead the Democratic  Caucus that I so deeply respect, and I am grateful that so many are  ready and willing to shoulder this awesome responsibility.   Madam Speaker, standing here today, I am endlessly grateful for all  of life's blessings.   For my Democratic colleagues, whose courage and commitment--with the  support of your families--have made many of these accomplishments  possible. That could not have been done without you.   For my dear husband, Paul, who has been my beloved partner in life  and my pillar of support, thank you. We are all grateful for all of the  prayers and well-wishes as he continues his recovery. Thank you so  much.   For our darling children: Nancy Corrine, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul,  and Alexandra; and our grandchildren: Alexandra and Madeleine; Liam,  Sean and Ryan; Paul and Thomas; Bella and Octavio, they are the joys of  our lives of whom we are so very, very proud, and they are a comfort to  us at this time.   And for my brilliant, dedicated, and patriotic staff under the  leadership of Terri McCullough, working together, the finest group of  public servants the House has ever known, thank you all so much.   And, again, for those who have sent me here, for the people of San  Francisco, for entrusting me with the high honor of being their voice  in Congress.   In this continued work, I will strive to honor the call of the patron  saint of our city, Saint Francis: ``Lord, make me an instrument of thy  peace.''   In this House, we begin each day with a prayer and a pledge to the  flag. And every day I am in awe of the majestic miracle that is  American democracy.   As we participate in the hallmark of our Republic--the peaceful,  orderly transition from one Congress to the next--let us consider the  words of, again, President Lincoln, spoken during one of America's  darkest hours.   He called upon us to come together, to ``swell the chorus of the  Union when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels  of our nature.''   That, again, is the task at hand.   A new day is dawning on the horizon, and I look forward and always  forward to the unfolding story of our Nation; a story of light and  love, of patriotism and progress, of many becoming one, and always an  unfinished mission to make the dreams of today the reality of tomorrow.   Thank you all. May God bless you and your families, and may God  continue to bless our veterans and the United States of America. Thank  you all so much.                            ____________________
