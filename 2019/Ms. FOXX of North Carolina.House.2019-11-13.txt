 Mr. Speaker, this week, we celebrate the  fifth year of National Apprenticeship Week, a week dedicated to  showcasing the impact that apprenticeship programs have on preparing  Americans for the jobs of today and tomorrow.   Our Nation has 7 million unfilled jobs. A 2018 survey of U.S.  employers showed that nearly half of all job creators struggle to hire  employees with the right skills for the job.   Apprenticeships offer one of the strongest solutions to closing the  skills gap and strengthening the American workforce. That is why  Republicans on the Committee on Education and Labor are committed to  expanding apprenticeship opportunities nationwide.   According to the Department of Labor, 94 percent of apprentices  retain employment after completing an apprenticeship program, and the  average starting salary after completion is $70,000.   Apprenticeships help integrate the education system with the  workforce development system, which allows all students to be better  prepared to compete successfully in the 21st century economy.                            ____________________
