 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague  from Massachusetts. I am glad to share in this bipartisan moment of  admiration for his work with my colleague from Georgia.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to defeat the  previous question so that we can bring a resolution to the floor. This  resolution will ensure that the House meets its constitutional  responsibility to conduct oversight of the executive branch by  investigating potential conflicts of interest of President Donald J.  Trump.                                time  1300    It reads: ``Whereas, on October 18, 2016, then-candidate Donald J.  Trump communicated via Twitter: `I will Make Our Government Honest  Again--believe me. But first, I'm going to have to #draintheswamp in  DC';   ``Whereas, President Trump subsequently nominated a team of wealthy  and connected insiders to lead his Cabinet, many of whom have been  forced to withdraw from consideration because of irrevocable conflicts  of interest;   ``Whereas, as President-elect, President Trump announced that he  would be `leaving his great business' to his adult children, a move he  felt would be `visually important';   ``Whereas, President Trump has taken no steps to untangle his  financial interest in his business holdings, to limit his ability to  advise the nominal managers of The Trump Organization, or to prevent  other interests from currying favor with the White House by doing  business with companies that might benefit the President's bottom line;   ``Whereas, President Trump has reversed White House policy and now  refuses to release visitor logs to the public;   ``Whereas, on May 30, 2014, President Trump stated: `If I decide to  run for office, I will produce my tax returns, absolutely';   ``Whereas, on January 24, 2016, President Trump stated that he would  release his `very big returns . . . in the next period of time';   ``Whereas, on February 25, 2016, President Trump changed his position  and stated that, although he could not release his tax returns while  under audit, he would do so `as soon as the audit is done';   ``Whereas, on May 11, 2016, President Trump communicated via Twitter:  `In interview I told @AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I  would release my tax returns when the audit is complete, not after  election!';   ``Whereas, on January 22, 2017, White House senior adviser Kellyanne  Conway stated that `the White House response is that he's not going to  release his returns';   ``Whereas, President Trump has directed the Congress to act on  comprehensive reform of the Internal Revenue Code;   ``Whereas, without the President's tax returns, the public cannot  know  [[Page H2914]]  how the full extent to which any proposed reforms will personally  benefit the President;   ``Whereas, on January 11, 2017, President Trump insisted that he has  `no dealings with Russia';   ``Whereas, it has been widely reported that President Trump sought  and received funding from Russian investors, especially when American  banks stopped lending to him after his multiple bankruptcies;   ``Whereas, Donald Trump, Jr., who runs day-to-day business operations  for his father's companies, has stated: `Russians make up a pretty  disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. We see a lot of  money pouring in from Russia';   ``Whereas, on March 20, 2017, James B. Comey, Director of the Federal  Bureau of Investigation, confirmed the existence of a Federal  investigation into multiple connections between the Trump campaign and  the regime of Russian President Vladimir Putin;   ``Whereas, it has been reported that President Trump has personally  guaranteed over $300 million in loans to German financial institution  Deutsche Bank AG;   ``Whereas, the Trump administration is now responsible for overseeing  multiple investigations into the trading and lending practices of  Deutsche Bank AG and for negotiating a potentially multibillion-dollar  settlement with the bank related to its trading of mortgage-backed  securities;   ``Whereas, these matters represent only a few of the many instances  in which President Trump has broken his promise to `drain the swamp';   ``Whereas, under the Constitution of the United States, the United  States Congress has a responsibility to conduct oversight of the  executive branch of government;   ``Whereas, the majority of the Committee on Oversight and Government  Reform of the House of Representatives rejected an amendment to have  the committee's oversight plan that would have tasked the committee  with investigating the President's conflicts of interest;   ``Whereas, members of the Committees on Energy and Commerce, Foreign  Affairs, the Judiciary, Homeland Security, and Ways and Means of the  House of Representatives have each advanced resolutions of inquiry  designed to obtain information about the President's ongoing conflicts  of interest;   ``Whereas, the majority has blocked each of those resolutions from  consideration on the House floor;   ``Whereas, the continuing refusal of the majority to conduct even  basic oversight of the Trump administration diminishes the status of  the Congress as a coequal branch of government;   ``Whereas, this continued neglect undermines the credibility of the  House of Representatives and raises a question of the privileges of the  House;   ``Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives  directs the following persons to take the following actions:   ``(1) President Trump is directed to transmit to the House of  Representatives copies of any document, record, memorandum,  correspondence, or other communication in possession of the Executive  Office of the President, or any portion of such communication, that  refers or relates to President Trump's proposal to maintain an interest  in his business holdings, while turning over day-to-day operation of  those interests to his sons Donald J. Trump, Jr. and Eric Trump.   ``(2) In support of transparency in government and the longstanding  tradition of the disclosure of tax returns of Presidents and  Presidential candidates, the Secretary of the Treasury is directed to  provide the Committee on Ways and Means with the tax return information  of Donald J. Trump for tax years 2007 through 2016 for review in closed  executive session by the committee as provided under section 6103 of  the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and directs the committee to hold a  vote on reporting such information to the full House of  Representatives.    ``(3) The Director of the Office of Government Ethics is directed to  publish any waiver or exception granted to any officer or employee of  the government to the January 28, 2017, executive order entitled  `Ethics Commitments by Executive Branch Appointees'.   ``(4) The Administrator of General Services is directed to provide  the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of  Representatives with any legal analysis supporting its March 23, 2017,  conclusion that Trump International Hotel in Washington may maintain  its lease with the Federal Government, despite an express prohibition  on elected officials taking part in the lease.   ``(5) President Trump is directed to provide visitor logs for both  the White House and Mar-a-Lago to the Committee on Oversight and  Government Reform of the House of Representatives on a rolling and  ongoing basis, and directs the committee to hold ongoing votes on  reporting the contents of such visitor logs to the full House of  Representatives.''   Mr. Speaker, I filed this resolution because it appears to me and the  American public that Mr. Trump has drained the swamp and funneled it  into the Oval Office.   Trump's billionaire, special interest friends are now in charge of  policies that impact every American, every family, and every child.  Everything from education to health care to taxes are in the hands of  people who have never sent their kids to public schools, who have never  had to take out a loan to pay for college, and who have never had a  medical bill they couldn't afford--and all of this is in the hands of a  President who refuses to release his tax returns.   While Trump fights to keep Americans in the dark about which of his  other friends he owes special favors to--whether it is Big Oil, foreign  banks, lobbyists at Mar-a-Lago, or the Russians--Republicans seem to be  happy to look the other way.   Transparency and accountability are not partisan ideas. Families at  home deserve a Congress that works together to be the necessary check  that our Constitution provides over this unaccountable administration.  I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question.
