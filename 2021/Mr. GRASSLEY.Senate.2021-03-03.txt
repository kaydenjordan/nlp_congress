 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this week, my Democratic colleagues  are poised to push through the Senate here an untargeted and unfocused  $1.9 trillion tax and spending package, and it is all being done under  the guise of COVID relief. Some of it is very essential for COVID  relief but a small part of it.   This whole act is very unfortunate because it didn't have to be this  way. In the past year, Republicans and Democrats were able to work  together to pass more than $4 trillion in COVID relief, and it was all  done with strong bipartisan support.   From the start of this year, my Republican colleagues and I have  stood ready to engage in good-faith, bipartisan negotiations to provide  further targeted relief. However, despite all the talk of unity and  bipartisanship by President Biden, the new Senate majority hasn't even  attempted to reach across the aisle. Bipartisanship worked 5 times over  the last 12 months, starting about 1 year ago right now.   The majority, demonstrating their unwillingness to compromise, has  resorted to using special budget procedures so that they may pass a  partisan bill strictly along party lines. The result is going to be an  unwieldy, nearly $2 trillion package that isn't shaped according to  current economic realities but strictly by a partisan liberal agenda.   In February, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, CBO,  projected that even without any further stimulus, gross domestic  product will return to its prepandemic levels by mid-2021, and, for the  year, the economy will grow at 4.6 percent.   If those two points aren't strong enough, it was recently reported  that retail sales jumped 5.6 percent during January, and the National  Retail Federation is projecting retail sales for the year to grow at  the fastest rate in two decades.   If those four points aren't enough, at the same time, personal income  is reported to have risen by 10 percent, and the personal savings rate  has surged from a historically high 13.4 percent to over 20 percent.   The American economy will soon be roaring without a $2 trillion  further stimulus. It is no longer March of 2020 when the economy was in  free fall and businesses and places of employment were shut down. And  how were they shut down? By those of us right here in the Congress of  the United States, the Federal Government doing it by government edict.   While many individuals and certain sectors of our economy continue to  struggle and, of course, deserve a helping hand, others have largely  recovered and are no longer in need of assistance. At this time,  instead of $2 trillion, two-thirds of it not needed, why not help those  hurting and not pour gasoline on the inflationary fires? A COVID relief  package should reflect this reality in both size and scope.   Even longtime Democratic economists, such as Obama's former Director  of the National Economic Council, have raised concerns about enacting  nearly a $2 trillion stimulus package at this point when we are already  in recovery. As former Secretary of Treasury Summers--I also referred  to him as Director of the National Economic Council--this is what he  says: ``The proposed Biden stimulus is three times as large as'' the  gap between actual and potential output as estimated by the CBO.   Enacting a stimulus unmoored from economic reality poses real risks  to our economy, including inflation and slower economic growth moving  forward. In fact, a Penn Wharton Budget Model analysis of the  President's proposal projects the proposed stimulus would result in a  decrease in both GDP and wages in 2022 and over the next 2 decades.   While inflation has been subdued in recent years, we shouldn't let  that lull in inflation lull us into a false sense of confidence that we  can spend with impunity with no consequences. We are in unchartered  waters with debt held by the public exceeding the size of our economy  and trillion-dollar annual deficits.   Moreover, as economist John Greenwood and Steve Hanke, professor of  economics at Johns Hopkins, recently warned:         The money supply will grow by nearly 12 percent this year.       That's twice as fast as its average growth rate from 2000-19.       It's a rate that spells trouble--inflation trouble.    And that is without another round of stimulus that we are going to be  debating in the next few days here on the floor of the U.S. Senate and  probably passing before the end of the week.   Concerns of inflation have been dismissed by the White House and by  the Federal Reserve. This sounds too familiar to those of us who  witnessed the stagflation of the 1970s. We were told by President Nixon  and his advisers that they could spend their way to lower unemployment  and economic growth without inflation. They were wrong. The Nixon  administration's mistakes ushered in a decade of disastrous inflation.  I have said for decades, if Nixon did something, we ought to learn from  it, not repeat it.   It was with this background of stagflation that I first ran for  Congress on a platform of fighting inflation. Inflation is a regressive  stealth tax on every single American. It is particularly unfair to  those who have very little money to begin with, and those who have  lived beneath their incomes to save for the future only to see their  hard work wiped out as the value of the dollars that they put away  plunges. Hopefully, Nixon inflation is only history never to return.  [[Page S1007]]    But none of us can guarantee that inflation won't return. Not only is  the size of this stimulus package detached from reality; so is the  scope. A common adage for stimulus and economic relief measures is that  they should be timely, they should be temporary, and they should be  targeted. By this standard, the Democrats' stimulus is well wide of the  mark.   More than one-third, or about $700 billion, of the funding in the  bill wouldn't even be spent until 2022 or beyond, according to the CBO.  How does anybody know that we need a stimulus in 2022 and beyond? By  what standard does the Biden administration say that we are going to  need that? And doesn't that have something to do with the failure of  this bill to accomplish what it wants to accomplish, or even the need  for it, if some of this money won't be spent until the outer years?   I don't know about you, but I don't see how spending hundreds of  billions of dollars years from now is either timely or targeted. As  these economists talk about a stimulus, if it is going to be any good,  it needs to be timely and targeted.   What does all this have to do with fighting the pandemic right now,  with the people hurting right now? Are these same people going to be  hurting in these out years when some of this money is going to be  spent? If that is the case, this brand-new administration is already  admitting that their policies of the future are a failure and a failure  today.   Nearly a quarter of the package, or $422 billion, is dedicated to  direct payments to households with incomes up to $200,000, all  regardless of whether they have lost a job or experienced any loss of  income. Such untargeted payments make little sense when just this past  week it was reported that personal income was up 10 percent and  personal savings rates soared to over 20 percent. We clearly shouldn't  be using taxpayer dollars to pad the bank accounts of those with six- figure incomes when we ought to be targeting this toward those who are  unemployed and those who are low income.   Then we have another $350 billion of this package that is going to be  allocated to bail out fiscally irresponsible States at the expense of  States that have managed their State budgets wisely, like my home State  of Iowa. This spending is hard to justify given recent reports  indicating most States saw little to no drop in revenue between 2019  and 2020. And many States that were previously projecting shortfalls  are now projecting budget surpluses.   The package also includes hundreds of billions of dollars in liberal  wish-list priorities that have very little to do with the current  pandemic. This includes enhancements to refundable tax credits, an  expansion of ObamaCare subsidies, and an $86 billion taxpayer bailout  of poorly managed pension plans.   On poorly managed pension plans, that is something that I have been  trying to reform over the last 2 years, and reform is necessary, as  much as helping them with taxpayer dollars. But there are absolutely no  reforms in this stimulus of those multiemployer pension plans. It is  simply an $86 billion bailout.   In the case of COVID, there are some things that no amount of money  can address. Until the widespread immunity is achieved, many people  will not feel comfortable eating out, going to a movie, taking in a  concert, or traveling on a vacation. Spending trillions of dollars will  not change the attitude of those people who are going to still be very  cautious.   So here is what I would spend the money on--and a lot less money than  $1.9 trillion. Yes, let's prioritize funding for vaccine distribution,  assistance for the unemployed, and aid for small businesses in the  struggling sectors. And, by all means, let's open our schools. Doing  this doesn't require $2 trillion. Let's remove the pork in this bill.  Let's set aside the long-term leftwing wish list and work together as  we did before in those five bipartisan bills over the last 12 months.  And they have passed both bodies overwhelmingly.   Several of my Republican colleagues approached the White House a few  weeks ago with a long list of what I just said--maybe a longer list of  items proposed by President Biden that could get Republican support  with minimal tweaks. A bipartisan package along those lines could well  have passed a few days ago. It is still not too late. I hope we can  make a bipartisan effort happen again   I yield the floor.
