 Mr. Speaker, I am here today to recognize an  outstanding 10-year-old girl from Sea Isle City in south Jersey.   Regan Capone is already an engaged member of her community and  frequently fundraises for local charities. Last year, Regan raised over  $6,000 for the Love of Linda Cancer Benefit Horse Show. Regan is now  raising money for her Uncle Mike's Seafood Polar Bear Run/Walk For  Autism.   Aside from fundraising, Regan is a competitive equestrian and  competes in the English Circuit of South Jersey. She even made it to  the regionals this year. Regan is a dedicated individual who impacts  the South Jersey community every day with her selflessness and her  desire to raise awareness for the causes that are so close to her  heart.   Thank you, Regan. You are truly an American hero for all that you do.  God bless you and God bless America.                            ____________________
