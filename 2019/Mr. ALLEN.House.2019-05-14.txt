 Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to recognize National  Charter Schools Week, a week where we honor the opportunity to bring  real educational choice to millions of families across America.   Georgia has a rich history of school choice and in charter schools.  Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to visit Drew Charter School  in Atlanta, Georgia.   Serving more than 1,800 students from pre-K through 12th grade, Drew  Charter School has implemented a project-based learning approach that  is helping all students reach their highest potential.   The numbers speak for themselves. Drew Charter School has a 100  percent graduation rate. No wonder there is a wait list to attend this  wonderful school.   While speaking with administrators, touring the beautiful campus, and  visiting a few classrooms, it was evident that Drew Charter School has  excelled in their mission to provide a quality education.   As the senior Republican on the Early Childhood, Elementary and  Secondary Education Subcommittee, I look forward to sharing my support  for charter schools and everything they do for our young students. By  supporting charter schools, we are putting kids first in education, not  politicians more concerned about power and money.                            ____________________
