 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an important  amendment to this year's Energy and Water Development Appropriations  bill. It fixes a serious problem that must be addressed to protect  hardworking Americans in my district and across the country.   Both parties can agree that our Nation should be spending taxpayer  dollars on goods manufactured here at home, not overseas, whenever we  can. Doing so not only supports American jobs in our communities but  also reinforces our national security. Even President Trump called for  strengthening enforcing laws that promote American industry and  American workers. So I hope my colleagues from both sides of the aisle  can come together on this issue.   Particularly in these uncertain times, it is imperative that we  protect American production capabilities by supporting U.S.  manufacturers.   Every year since 1991, Congress has included a provision in the  Department of Defense Appropriations bill to require that military  agencies purchase anchor chain from American businesses. For the last 2  years, the House and Senate have supported an amendment of mine  clarifying that this requirement applies to the Army Corps of  Engineers. Unfortunately, the Corps has continued to ignore clear  congressional intent and has made several acquisitions of foreign-made  anchor chain from countries like China and Korea.   Until the Army Corps follows the policy, I will keep fighting to  support U.S. manufacturers and their workers, and I hope the whole  Chamber will join me in this effort.   My amendment strengthens the existing language in this bill to better  protect the critical production capability, support our manufacturing  industry, and put American workers first.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H6458]]         Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's willingness  to work with me on this important issue and also Representative Kaptur  for her support.   Our Nation can't afford to lose its critical production capability.  We should not allow American workers to be left behind, so I look  forward to working with the gentleman and the gentlewoman.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time, and I withdraw my  amendment.
