 Madam President, reserving the right to object, I know       firsthand how difficult it is when you navigate through any issues like       this. I had a small business for nearly 17 years with just 15       employees. I can tell you, for a small business--and that is defined,       maybe, from 100 employees and fewer--it is a major issue. You want to       make sure, when that occurs, that you are not overly burdened by the       process of whatever you are contending with.        The EEOC is charged with enforcing our employment discrimination       laws. As general counsel, Ms. Gilbride would provide overall guidance       and management to field offices' legal units and develop litigation       strategies.        During the Trump administration, the Commission saw many changes       aimed at what I believe is always beneficial--transparency and       accountability--for the purpose of, when you get into these discussions       with smaller businesses--not big corporations, as they have got their       staffs of attorneys--you have got to be careful that you are not       burdening them with something that could disrupt their businesses and--      who knows?--depending on how long it might take, put them out of       business. Remember, with many of these small businesses, whoever the       proprietors are, they are making a living out of it, not necessarily       gauging a return on investment, so to speak.        Unfortunately, some have called for the reversal of these changes of       more transparency and accountability. For example, the Commission could       reverse Commissioner voting on the approval of litigation and the       requirement to post these votes publicly online. If reversed, the       general counsel and staff would have the authority to commence            [[Page S9734]]            litigation against employers instead of the Commission, like Congress       intended it to be.        The Chair of the Commission has also made clear that she will seek to       reinstate the burdensome collection of pay data from employers in an       attempt to identify pay discrimination. However, the reality is that       this data provides no context for wages, such as job experience,       education, or skill level.        How does that relate to Ms. Gilbride?        When she was asked about some of this, it wasn't clear whether she       was going to keep what many of us thought was good with accountability       and transparency or whether she was going to go more in the direction       of the way it was before.        This position has too much impact on, potentially, many, many small       employers. All I am asking is that we don't do it today through       unanimous consent but that we put it up for a vote when everyone is on       record and when we can vet it more thoroughly.        Therefore, I object.
