 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I am proud to stand up in support of the SHIELD Act, which  incorporates my bill, H.R. 4703, The DEFEND Act. The DEFEND Act, as  incorporated here, would forbid paid internet activity by foreign  actors, foreign political parties, foreign intelligence services and  the like.   This is a problem because in 2016 across Pennsylvania users of social  [[Page H8417]]  media saw this image over and over again. It is the real image of a  coal miner suggesting that miners were supporting the Republican  nominee and getting together in huge rallies in places like Pittsburgh  and Philadelphia.   But the problem is, there were no rallies. And the truth is, the  actual opinions of coal miners were much more mixed. They know, in  fact, that they have been let down on issues like healthcare and  pensions, by both Republicans and Democrats, and they have been  supported and protected on those same issues by Members of both  parties.   In fact, just today, the House Natural Resources Committee passed the  Miners Pension Protection Act, and I was proud to stand with members of  both parties in support of that.    Mr. Chair, the man in this image died in 1987 at the age of 57--too  young--like most miners, of black lung. These miners have given a lot.  We cannot allow the Russians or anyone else to take anything else from  them and affect our elections.
