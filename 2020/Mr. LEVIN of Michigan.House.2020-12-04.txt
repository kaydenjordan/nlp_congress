 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor my retiring  director of constituent services, Zeenath Hussain. It may not be common  to speak on the floor of this House about a staffer, but Zee is truly  an extraordinary public servant and human being.   In 2004, Zee answered an ad for a staff assistant position in my  dad's, Sandy Levin's, district office. Over the years, she built an  incomparable network of relationships with officials in an astounding  array of Federal agencies and an unmatched mastery of how to solve  virtually any constituent problem.   Even after 16 years of service, in a pandemic causing untold  suffering and chaos, Zee listened to each constituent attentively,  leveled with people when necessary, and comforted and reassured every  family member.   In addition to her tireless work for constituents, Zeenath took care  of everyone around her, mentoring generations of congressional staff,  dispensing advice about life, and cooking to-die-for Indian meals for  the office and anyone who happened by.   Zee, I reluctantly admit you have richly earned the right to retire  from your job, but I hasten to add that there is no retiring from  friendship or from love.                            ____________________
