 Madam Speaker, this pandemic's tentacles have  infiltrated every facet of our communities' lives. The brilliance of  this rescue package is that it understands those complexities and  addresses those many needs.   For example, since the pandemic began, we have seen increased reports  of abuse of women and children, so this bill helps fund shelters and  refuge.   The country has also seen the heartbreaking devastation in Tribal  communities. Native Americans are four times more likely to be  hospitalized and twice as likely to die from COVID-19 than White  Americans. So, this bill includes over $20 billion to assist Native  people, including their Tribal governments, health facilities, and  education.   We need this package to end the Nation's suffering. Let's pass this  bill, save lives, save livelihoods, save communities.
