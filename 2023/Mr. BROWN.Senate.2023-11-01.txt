 Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to the  Paul amendment.   Members of both parties have always agreed an independent--underscore  independent--central bank is critical to a functioning economy.  Congress put in place restrictions to shield the Fed's monetary policy  from political influence. This longstanding restriction ensures that  the Fed isn't subject to the whims of Congress, to the partisanship, to  the nihilism--if I could use another word--of, too often, people in  this body.   Whether it is threatening a default or a government shutdown, all too  common because of dysfunction and chaos in the House of  Representatives--whether it is threatening a default or government  shutdown, we have already seen how partisanship so negatively impacts  people's pocketbooks in the broader economy. We don't need it here too.   This amendment would make the Fed less effective. It would open it up  to all kinds of nefarious political pressure. Congress already requires  that the Fed undergo regular review of their operations, of their  programs, of their balance sheet, of their financial statements. These  are some of the ways Congress holds the Fed accountable while avoiding  dangerous political interference.   This amendment is irrelevant to what we are voting on today. It is  yet another impediment to keeping our government open. It shouldn't be  partisan. It shouldn't be political. Those antics should stay out of  this debate.   I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Paul amendment.   I yield the floor.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1217
