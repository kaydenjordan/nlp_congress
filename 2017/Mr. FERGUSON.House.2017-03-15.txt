 Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by saying that, for  the last 25 years, I practiced dentistry in Georgia's Third District  and I experienced a healthcare system that was broken and in desperate  need of repair to reduce costs and increase access to care.   After the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, I saw my patients,  my friends, my neighbors forced away from doctors who had treated them  for their entire lives. Instead of decreasing costs, patients saw their  costs skyrocket and their access to care limited.   As a medical practitioner, I want what is best for my patients. Those  are the people that I am fighting for: my neighbors and constituents  who saw their premiums skyrocket, their quality and access to care  limited or determined by a government bureaucrat. I committed to them  that I would repeal ObamaCare and undo the damage that it has done to  our healthcare system.   The legislation we are currently considering in the House, the  American Health Care Act, is just the beginning of keeping that  promise.   This is not a choice between a broken healthcare system that existed  before ObamaCare. It is a new direction that reflects an understanding  of what works and what does not work. The legislation will enact many  reforms that directly impact Americans by lowering costs and improving  access to care.   Tonight, my colleagues and I are going to share with you in great  detail what that legislation does. We have all been very open in our  opposition to the Affordable Care Act, but it is also important that we  share with our constituents what we stand for and what we are working  to do to reform this broken system.   We stand for patient-centered health care that meets the needs of our  constituents in an affordable way. We stand for market-driven  healthcare solutions and an industry that prioritizes personal freedom  over government mandates. We stand for the biggest entitlement reform  in a generation to ensure that we protect our most vulnerable  populations.   This is just a short list of the goals we are working towards, and I  am excited to be joined by a number of my colleagues tonight to help me  explain more to the American people what is happening with our  healthcare system.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington). He  served in the George W. Bush administration. He has worked with the  FDIC, and he has been a public servant in Lubbock, Texas, at Texas Tech  University. He serves on the House Agriculture Committee, the Budget  Committee, and the House Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Texas touched on some  very important issues. One that he talked about was the process here,  that this is just the beginning of a long journey that we must take to  rebuild our American healthcare system.   This has been an open legislative process. More than 8 months ago,  even before I was a Member of this great House, the Republican caucus  here released A Better Way agenda, which detailed a consensus vision  for patient-centered healthcare reform. Our bill, the American Health  Care Act, is built on that framework.   These ideas are not new. They are not unvetted. They are a product of  many conversations, debates, and work. Unlike the drafting of  ObamaCare, we want our constituents to know what is in this legislation  before we pass it. That is why every American can go to readthebill.gop  and look at this legislation for themselves. In fact, I encourage  anyone who hasn't taken time to look at this legislation yet to go to  readthebill.gop and read more about the American Health Care Act.   At no point in this process have I felt closed out of it. As a matter  of fact, as a freshman, I can tell you that I have had my voice heard,  I have been asked for input, and I have seen many of the ideas that I  have spoken about be included in this bill.   This bill has not been crafted behind closed doors. It has not been  kept in the shadows. As a matter of fact, it has been just the  opposite. As a freshman Member sitting in conference, leadership has  been very straightforward about the intentions of the bill, the basic  framework of the bill, and I am excited to see that, as this process  has gone through regular order, we have seen many amendments added to  it, and we are continuing that process.   Regular order means that we have done something very unique here. We  haven't just taken a bill and passed it and then get to read what is in  it. We have taken a bill, and we have taken it through the committee  process. Our colleagues on the Committee on Energy and Commerce and  Committee on  [[Page H2075]]  Ways and Means have worked through some many long nights debating  amendments in an open process.   Tomorrow the House Committee on the Budget will take up this  business. I am a member on that committee, and I am looking forward to  the process of going through the debate tomorrow. I am sure that it  will be long, and I am sure many amendments will be debated; but I am  excited about the opportunity that we have to move a piece of  legislation forward, make it better, make it more conservative, but,  most importantly, make sure that Americans have great health care,  access to that health care at an affordable price.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr.  Bacon) for his remarks.   He touched on something that is very important, and that is the  driving down of cost and how this is accomplished. Truly, when the  patient is in control of their health care, they are also in control of  the cost. We are fighting for consumer choice in a patient-driven  healthcare system. We understand, and I certainly understand, that  patients and doctors need to be at the center of the healthcare  conversation, not bureaucrats and not insurance clerks.   Our plan includes provisions to expand choice and give consumers more  control over their healthcare dollars. The American Health Care Act  significantly increases the amount individuals and families can  contribute to their personal health savings accounts each year,  allowing them to save more to pay for future healthcare expenses and  the flexibility to use their healthcare dollars as they choose.   It also allows them to spend those healthcare dollars where they  think that it will best benefit their families. It allows them to have  the most intimate conversations with their healthcare providers and  make sure that they are making the right decisions and using their  dollars wisely. If the first question always is ``does my insurance  company pay for it?'' you are always going to get the most expensive  answer. However, if the patient has contributed to this process, the  patient then will be able to make some informed decisions through good  conversations with their doctors, and they can better manage their own  health care.   We are fighting for a system that puts patients first and allows  Georgians in the Third District and all across this Nation to make  their own healthcare decisions. That starts with a conversation between  the doctor and the patient.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rutherford).  He is a former three-term sheriff from Florida, representing the  greater Jacksonville area.    Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Florida touched on  something that is very important, and that is fairness in the  marketplace. I can tell you, as a small-business owner, I did not  receive the same favorable tax treatment as the major corporations did  under the Affordable Care Act. Once this bill took effect, I had to  move into the individual market. I had to begin buying health insurance  with post-tax dollars, and I was unable to afford the coverage not only  for my family, but for the people that I had the pleasure of working  with every single day in my business.    What Mr. Rutherford talked about is leveling the playing field, and  that is something that we need to do. It will increase innovation. It  increases jobs. It increases success. It is so frustrating for  Americans as they begin to build their small businesses and they begin  to grow, and every single time that they take a step forward, the  government takes more and more out of their pocket. Now we have a  healthcare system that continues to rob them of their success.   Make no mistake; the healthcare system that we had prior to the  Affordable Care Act was certainly not successful and not headed in the  right way, but we have made it worse with this. What we have done is we  have not only disenfranchised many small businesses and people who are  growing their businesses and finding success, but we have also, quite  candidly, done a poor job of maintaining our safety net. What we are  fighting for is to increase affordable health care for all Americans,  and this has meant listening to a lot of the feedback from our families  and our constituents back home.   What we need to recognize is that, under our plan, dependents can  continue to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26 and they are  fully on their feet, if that is the right thing for their families to  do. Americans told us that they like this flexibility, and we have  listened to them.   Our plan will also ensure that those who have preexisting conditions  can't be charged more for the health coverage they need. It also  includes incentives, not mandates, to encourage Americans to have  continuous coverage. This is good for the marketplace, and it will keep  costs down for all Americans. Our portable tax credits will also  increase access to coverage by assisting lower income individuals to  purchase the health insurance that they need.   What is more, the American Health Care Act includes a Patient and  State Stability Fund to help States expand the number of vulnerable  patients who have access to health care. We know that States know how  to best meet the unique needs of their citizens, and this is going to  give them the flexibility to do that. Therefore, as these funds are  flexible, they allow things like cutting out-of-pocket expenses for  patients, promoting access to preventive services, or increasing  available options in the marketplace--all things that are needed.                                time  2030    These reforms will help drive down costs and increase access to care.  This is good news for patients who are worried about affordable  coverage. Unlike ObamaCare, though, it means that their coverage  provides them with meaningful access to care.   It does you no good to have an insurance plan that you cannot afford  to use. Time and time again, I have patients, I have small-business  owners, I have constituents from all over Georgia's Third District that  come to me and say: Just because I have this new insurance plan doesn't  mean that my family is getting better care.   One such example was a gentleman that came into my district office  just this past week. Three years ago, his health insurance for his  family with four children was about $900, and he had a $3,000 family  deductible. Last year, his premium had risen to $1,700 a month. And  this year, he laid in front of me on my desk in the district office a  bill for his health insurance that was $2,400 a month, and a $7,000  deductible. He is a small-business owner with nine employees. It is  absolutely crushing his family expenses, and that is not fair.   What we have done is we have created an environment where we have  tried unsuccessfully to expand access; and in doing so, we have risen  costs on men and women across this Nation that are trying to do their  best to move into the middle class. We have seen it destroy family  finances. We have seen it create a situation where many families now  pay more for their health insurance than they do for their own homes.   Mr. Speaker, in my case, that is the exact same thing. My insurance  payment is more than my house payment, and that simply doesn't seem  right.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney).  She has proven to be a great Member of Congress. I have enjoyed working  with her thoroughly. Ms. Tenney has some very revealing remarks going  forward.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New York for her  very candid remarks. As you can see, she touched on many important  issues--the unfairness of the system that we have now, but also the  importance of protecting our Medicaid safety net.   What we have seen under the Affordable Care Act is that we have seen  our safety nets eroded. We are diverting resources away from the people  that need them the most--the poor, the elderly, the blind, the  disabled, children, and pregnant women--and we are pushing those  resources to able-bodied men and women who do have the ability to work.   It is important to recognize that our legislation is probably the  largest entitlement reform program in a generation. Our legislation  puts Medicaid back on a budget for the first time in history. It  provides enhanced flexibility to the States to allow them to design  effective and financially sound programs to meet their population's  unique needs.   Our plan also ensures that Medicaid prioritizes care for the most  vulnerable, who it was originally intended for. We must do this because  there are so many Americans, unfortunately, that have to depend on this  safety net for their health care.   I understand this. In my hometown, in my dental practice, I treated  patients who relied on Medicaid for their healthcare coverage. It was  an honor to take care of them and to have very real discussions about  their healthcare needs. I understand this vulnerable population because  they were a vital part of my practice, and it was truly my pleasure to  take care of them. I understand the unique circumstances that cause  many of these individuals to be on Medicaid and to need this valuable  safety net.   But we have to have an honest conversation about that. We have to be  able to provide that safety net. And as we put more and more able- bodied men and women without children on that safety net, it is  diverting resources away from those that need it the most. That is not  right and that is not the American way. We are fighting to protect and  strengthen this Nation's healthcare safety net.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Marshall). Dr.  Marshall knows firsthand about health care. He was a practicing OB/GYN,  a board chairman of a hospital, and he has served our Nation in the  United States Army.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Dr. Marshall for his  strong remarks and pointing out and highlighting several important  things.   You know, one of the biggest things that we are fighting for as part  of repealing ObamaCare is that we are fighting for our personal  freedom. Right now, Americans have the ``choice'' of purchasing a  government-mandated, one-size-fits-all product or paying a government- mandated penalty. In almost a third of all U.S. counties, and many in  my home State of Georgia, consumers don't even have the choice between  insurances to purchase. This is not a choice.   With the passage of the American Health Care Act, no longer will the  Federal Government mandate that Americans purchase a product that they  don't want, because we believe that individuals should have the freedom  to make their own choices. We understand the unique dignity of every  human being. This dignity calls for self-determination and personal  freedom, and we are fighting for that freedom. It is important.   I want to thank all of my colleagues who have joined me tonight to  share with our constituents more about what we are fighting for.   First off, our legislation promotes personal freedom by eliminating  the individual and employer mandates. Purchasing decisions should be  left up to the consumer, not the Federal Government. Under our plan, no  American is mandated to purchase a product that he or she does not want  and cannot afford.   As I have shared, I have personal experience with how important the  conversation between the patient and their doctor is. By almost  doubling the cap on how much individuals can contribute to their  personal health savings accounts each year and expanding where those  dollars can be used, our plan puts patients back at the center of the  conversation with their doctor, and they remove all of the government  bureaucrats from the middle of that conversation.   Health care is personal. It should belong to the patient and their  healthcare provider--and no one else. That is where the most important  decisions are made.   We are also working to strengthen our safety net to ensure that our  vulnerable populations have continued access to health care. Our plan  returns power to the States with the biggest entitlement reform in a  generation. Our legislation also protects Americans with preexisting  conditions, ensuring that no one is unable to purchase insurance  because of an illness.   ObamaCare is a complex tangle of regulations and Federal overreach.  With every day that passes, Americans and businesses feel the growing  weight of a healthcare system that is failing. But it is also  irresponsible to return to a broken healthcare system that brought us  ObamaCare.   Tomorrow, we will take the next step in the open legislative process  as my colleagues and I on the Budget Committee do our part to send the  American Health Care Act to the floor of the House for a vote. I am  excited to take this step, but I want to be clear that this is only one  part of repeal and reform. We are doing all that we can, and we are  going to continue to push for conservative solutions with this bill.  But it is not the final vote that we will take. There are many steps to  go.    While it will take time and patience, I made a promise to repeal the  Affordable Care Act and improve our healthcare system for all  Americans. I am committed to this difficult road of building this  healthcare system that puts patients first. The American people deserve  the hard work and political will it will take to do this the right way.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have been joined by my colleagues  tonight and glad to hear their comments, and I know that you have been  as well. I want to point out that my colleagues have done an  outstanding job tonight, and I believe that they have made some very,  very salient points, and articulated reasons why we must step forward  and do all that we can to reform our American healthcare system.   We have to control the cost. We have to do the things necessary to  put patients back in control. And, Mr. Speaker, I have confidence that  this body, along with our President and our colleagues in the Senate,  can do that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
