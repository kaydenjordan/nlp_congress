 Madam Speaker, 100 years ago, the great State of New  Jersey became the 29th State to ratify the 19th Amendment guaranteeing  women the right to vote.   New Jerseyans of all ages are honoring this anniversary. On Sunday,  the Kinnelon Girl Scouts held a women's vote celebration, inviting  residents to learn about the suffrage movement and what it means today.   In towns across my district, like Morris Township, the municipal  building will be lit purple this week, a nod to the purple of the  suffragette sashes that symbolized dignity and loyalty.   I thank all our residents for recognizing this milestone and what it  means in 2020.   New Jersey's most influential suffragette, Alice Paul, started the  National Woman's Party. She said something that still resonates today:  ``There's nothing complicated about ordinary equality.''   In our complicated world, women have made significant strides since  1920. As we celebrate 100 years of suffrage, let us remember all the  work that lies ahead.                            ____________________
