 Madam President, in the middle of the Great  Depression, the people in Tennessee and North Carolina looked around  and said: Why are all the national parks out West?   So Tennessee contributed $2 million, and North Carolina contributed  $2 million, and John D. Rockefeller Jr. said: I will give $5 million in  honor of my mother if you can match it. The children of North Carolina  and Tennessee in schools raised another million dollars in community  efforts, and the Great Smokey Mountain National Park was created and  given to the people of the United States.   So the people of Tennessee and North Carolina gave that to the United  States and, today, more than 12 million Americans visit it. There are a  lot more people who visit it than live in Tennessee and North Carolina,  and part of the deal was that there would be no entrance fee. The one  thing that we wanted or our grandparents wanted at the time was that  the American people be good stewards of what we gave to the American  people.   Today, thanks to the leadership of Senators Warner, Portman, King,  Manchin, Heinrich, Daines, and Gardner on the Land and Water  Conservation Fund, that has happened. I am proud to be a part of it.  This is the most significant piece of conservation legislation in at  least a half century, and it represents a recognition by the American  people that we can be good stewards of what Ken Burns has called ``our  greatest idea,'' our national parks and our remaining public lands.
