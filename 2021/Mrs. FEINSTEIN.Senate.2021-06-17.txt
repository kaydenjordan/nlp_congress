 Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce bipartisan  legislation with Senator Collins today to improve safety standards on  products that affect every single American household. Most people  assume that the personal care products they use every day are safe,  whether it is shampoo or shaving cream, lotion or make-up, hair dye or  deodorant.   In reality, however, these products are not approved by the Food and  Drug Administration for safety before being sold, and the FDA's  authority to regulate these products are sorely outdated. In fact, it's  been more than eighty years since the law has changed on how oversight  is conducted for these products. It is time to finally bring the FDA  into the 21st century.   For the better part of a decade, Senator Collins and I have worked  with a wide variety of stakeholders that represent industry, consumers,  and health groups. Together, we introduce this Personal Care Products  Safety bill with the support and input of these groups to implement  commonsense and feasible measures.   One of the most critical components of this legislation is providing  FDA with mandatory recall authority over these products. Without this  authority, the agency has few options to ensure consumer safety.   For example, in 2019, the FDA discovered asbestos in make-up marketed  to children and teens at a popular chain store. After the FDA requested  that these products stop being sold, the company refused to comply with  the request. Lacking the authority to mandate a recall, FDA was left  with the only option of warning consumers not to use these products.  This is simply unacceptable.   Under our bill, the FDA could remove these harmful products from the  marketplace--whether at your local pharmacy or mall, or online. Perhaps  even more importantly, our bill would set forth regulations to outline  good manufacturing practices for personal care products and prevent  harmful products from ever being sold.   Our bill would also require companies to register with the FDA so  that the agency knows who is manufacturing personal care products and  where they are being made before arriving in stores. Companies would  also be required to disclose their list of ingredients, attest that  they have safety records for their products, and report serious adverse  events, such as infections that required medical treatment, to FDA  within 15 days after being notified that one occurred.   This bill would also require the FDA to evaluate at least five  ingredients per year for safety and whether they should be used in  personal care products. There would be opportunities for companies,  scientists, consumer groups, medical professionals, and other members  of the public to weigh in not only on the safety of particular  ingredients but also which ingredients should be a priority for review.   As I've said before, the ``Personal Care Products Safety Act'' is the  result of many diverse groups working together to ensure businesses are  able to provide the safest products possible to consumers. As such,  this legislation also recognizes the needs of small businesses and  provides flexibility to ensure they are able to comply with these new  regulations while also upholding strong safety standards that protect  consumers.   I am pleased that this legislation has the support of a broad  coalition, including the Environmental Working Group, Beautycounter,  Estee Lauder, Unilever, Johnson & Johnson, Revlon, L'Oreal USA,  American Academy of Pediatrics, American Cancer Society Cancer Action  Network, the Association of Maternal & Child Health Programs, the  Endocrine Society, March of Dimes, National Alliance for Hispanic  Health, the National Women's Health Network, Au Naturale Cosmetics,  Burt's Bees Company, The Clorox Company, the Handcrafted Soap and  Cosmetic Guild, and Procter & Gamble.   I want to thank Senator Collins for her support as well as her staff  for their hard work on this important legislation. I urge my colleagues  to join us in modernizing our outdated regulatory system for personal  care products, and I hope the Senate will finally pass this long  overdue legislation this year.   Thank you Madam President. I yield the Floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA:   S. 2103. A bill to amend the Revised Statutes of the United States to  hold certain public employers liable in civil actions for deprivation  of rights, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
