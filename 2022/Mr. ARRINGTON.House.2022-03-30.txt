 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support the Donna M. Doss Memorial Act. It is bipartisan and bicameral  legislation that I introduced alongside my friends, Senator John Cornyn  and Congressman Cuellar.   Donna Doss was a constituent of mine from the Big Country, Abilene,  Texas. She valiantly served our country as a Border Patrol agent for  nearly 16 years before she was tragically killed in the line of duty in  2019. In addition to serving our country as a law enforcement officer-- and I would add, a hero--she was a daughter, a sister, a mother, and a  loving wife to Michael, her husband for over 20 years.   Like many in her profession, she made the greatest sacrifice for the  good of this great country, for the love of her fellow countrymen. The  Bible says: No greater love than this that a man or women lay down  their lives for their friends. She did that. She is a patriot and we  will miss her.   This legislation is going to designate the Rocksprings, Texas, Border  Patrol station as the Donna M. Doss Border Patrol Station to honor her  and her legacy and her family, and, quite frankly, every law  enforcement officer and their families that take on the same risks, and  many of whom who make the ultimate sacrifice.   It is the right thing to do. It is a good thing to do. I pray that  the family is comforted by this gesture, and I pray that God would  bless her legacy, as we pray that he blesses our entire country.
