 Madam Speaker, during one of my floor speeches last  week, I shared that President Biden's  [[Page H5563]]  Build Back Better plan embodied the vision of the American people and  is the kind of legislation that assures our people, hardworking  Americans across the country, that we will not abandon them in their  time of need.   Now, I love history. And tomorrow is a very special day in the Virgin  Islands. It is Contract Day. I can't help but make the connection  between the landmark provisions outlined in Build Back Better, this  transformational piece of legislation, and what is happening in our  Halls of Congress as we come to the point of passing that, with the  struggle that took place in my home on St. Croix on October 1, 1878.  Then known as the Danish West Indies, on that day in history, almost  150 years ago, four brave, stalwart women led the St. Croix Labor  Rebellion, also known to us in the Virgin Islands as ``Fireburn.'' We  honor the memory and sacrifices made by our ancestors on this day,  which we call Contract Day.   Now, after slaves in the Danish West Indies organized, fought, and  took their freedom from chattel slavery in 1848, a new type of slavery  was formed in a labor bill the following year to regulate the now free  workers. The law stipulated a day wage and restricted and confined  workers to remain on one plantation for the entire year. That location  could only change on Contract Day, October 1.   Former slaves worked on the same plantation as before with little to  no improvements in their living conditions, healthcare, no childcare,  education, no change in income. These new restrictions forced the  workers to bear an impossible, untenable burden. They soon realized  that they were free in name alone.   The untenable working and living conditions along with the false hope  that labor laws may change and then finding out that they were not  going to change, ignited a protest that led to a rebellion in  Fredriksted on the island of St. Croix. That movement was bravely led  by four women who we immortalize in our history as the queens: Queen  Mary Thomas, Queen Mathilde Macbean, Queen Susanna ``Bottom Belly''  Abrahamson, and Queen Axeline ``Queen Agnes'' Salomon, demanding all  plantations improve workers' wages and repeal the Labor Act of 1849.   Many of the protestors were killed; hanged. The women were tied to a  stake, covered in molasses, and burned, irony being that the same cane  that they cut, made into sugar and molasses, would be the instrument of  their cruel death.   The fight for appropriate pay, job creation, equity and improvement  in working conditions, living wages, sanitary housing, clean drinking  water, especially for those in need, continues today in America. And we  are attempting to solve those with the provisions in President Biden's  Build Back Better plan.   All people, they simply want support, a foundation for them to have a  reputable shot at the American Dream. Women want meaningful jobs and  the ability to leave their children in sanitary, clean, safe,  affordable childcare; the ability to buy a home so that you can obtain  equity for your children's college; to start a business.   When I think of my ancestors and how bravely they fought--some to  their death--for the causes of equity and improved labor conditions, I  am encouraged to continue advocating, championing, fighting for the  changes that I believe the Build Back Better plan will bring us closer  to, bring our Nation and those within it to those dreams that we all  have.   I pray this same encouragement and spirit of boldness and  perseverance for all of my colleagues who are standing with us in that  fight.                            ____________________
