 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the crucial  investment my bipartisan amendment to the MORE Act will make to support  local law enforcement and to protect our children, families, and  communities.   My provision, which passed with a strong bipartisan majority, will  invest $10 million for the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration to study technologies and methods that law enforcement  may use to determine whether a driver is impaired by marijuana in their  system.   We know that marijuana significantly impairs judgment, motor  coordination, and reaction time. Studies have found a direct  relationship between blood THC concentration and impaired driving  ability. In fact, drivers under the influence of marijuana regularly  cause traffic collisions.   We must give our law enforcement officers the tools to detect  impaired drivers and get them off the road--and to always have their  backs.   Safety is always my top priority, and I am proud to lead efforts that  invest in our law enforcement and protect our families.   I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass my critically  important provision, to ensure that law enforcement has the tools  necessary to keep roads safe for our families.   This investment is crucial to protecting our families from the  dangers of impaired driving.                            ____________________
