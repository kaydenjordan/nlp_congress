Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall), my  distinguished colleague from the Rules Committee, pending which I yield  myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this  resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1107, providing for consideration of  H.R. 2574, the Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act, and H.R. 2694, the  Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, under closed rules.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate for each of the two bills,  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the  Committee on Education and Labor. The rule also self-executes a  manager's amendment to H.R. 2574.   Additionally, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2639, the  Strength in Diversity Act, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1  hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  member of the Committee on Education and Labor and makes in order 12  amendments. The rule provides that the chair of the Committee on  Education and Labor may offer amendments en bloc, debatable for 20  minutes.   The rule also provides for consideration of H. Res. 908, Condemning  All Forms of Anti-Asian Sentiment As Related to COVID-19, under a  closed rule.   Finally, the rule extends recess instructions, suspension and same- day authority through November 20, 2020.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to begin debate on four bills today that will  protect workers, encourage diversity and inclusion in the workforce,  and demonstrate Congress' support for our Asian-American communities in  the face of anti-Asian rhetoric by the administration and right with  respect to COVID-19.   COVID-19 has infected over 27 million people worldwide and claimed  the lives of over 900,000, including almost 200,000 of our fellow  Americans. This pandemic brought the world to a standstill economically  and socially. Virtually everything in our daily lives has been affected  in some form.   There was no coherent national strategy to deal with this deadly  pandemic when it started, and now, 6-plus months in, Americans are  still being left behind by an executive branch more focused on  downplaying the virus' severity than getting it under control and our  economy and way of life back on track.   In Congress, we find ourselves having to deal with a Senate majority  that has even less interest in controlling the virus and helping  American families than the President. The House has passed numerous  pieces of legislation that would directly help American workers, small  businesses, families, and children; but, in the midst of a pandemic,  Leader McConnell is more interested in packing the judiciary than he is  in passing legislation to help the American people. The HEROES Act has  sat on Leader McConnell's desk collecting dust for exactly 4 months to  the day.   In the absence of leadership by the White House and Senate, our  cities and States are desperate for resources to combat the pandemic.  The American people are calling out for relief, but Republicans are  willfully ignoring them. Instead, they are trying to divert attention  from their abject failure to take prompt or effective action earlier  this year when tens of thousands of lives could have been saved.  Instead, this administration is using the playbook of fear-mongering  autocrats through the ages by demonizing a marginalized group.   In recent months, we have seen a marked rise in anti-Asian sentiment  and rhetoric. Racist and xenophobic names for COVID-19 have been  spouted by elected officials, and these terms have had damaging, far- reaching impact on Asians and Asian Americans.   As we have seen over the past 4 years, the endorsement of racist  language by national leaders has led to well-documented increases in  racist speech and hate crimes across the country. This harmful rhetoric  has resulted in physical attacks, verbal assaults, workplace  discrimination, and online harassment against our fellow citizens.  These are our friends and neighbors, essential workers, nurses, law  enforcement officers, and teachers.   The vitriol against our fellow Americans must be forcefully and  overwhelmingly condemned, Mr. Speaker.   In the midst of this pandemic, reaffirming American values is more  necessary than ever, whether it is condemning hate speech or making  sure that our government is working for all Americans and not just Wall  Street tycoons or real estate developers. Therefore, I would recommend  to my colleagues that they encourage Senator McConnell to quickly take  up the HEROES Act or come to the table with good-faith negotiations to  address COVID-19 in a thoughtful and people-focused way.   I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Grace Meng from New York, for  introducing this necessary resolution and the House Judiciary Committee  for quickly getting this before the Rules Committee.   Mr. Speaker, it has been more than 65 years since the Supreme Court  made racial segregation in public education illegal, but over the past  several decades, racial and socioeconomic segregation in our schools  has dramatically increased. This didn't happen by accident.   In many counties across the U.S., children are assigned to schools  based on where their home is located. If your parents can afford to  live in a more affluent area and pay higher property taxes, the school  you attend will reflect this.                                time  1030    The opposite, of course, is true for students in poorer areas, and  centuries of systemic racism have relegated far too many students of  color to poorer neighborhoods and school districts.   School districts that predominantly serve students of color receive  $23 billion less in funding than predominantly White school districts.  The result of this undeniable gap in educational funding is that  students of color have fewer resources, older equipment, and aging--if  not crumbling--facilities that make learning more challenging compared  to their peers in higher-income areas.   In a 2001 Supreme Court decision, Alexander v. Sandoval, a  conservative majority stripped away four decades of  [[Page H4393]]  statutory protection against discrimination by disallowing victims of  these unjust policies from bringing disparate impact claims under title  VI of the Civil Rights Act. Fortunately, the bill we are considering  this week will restore the rights of students, parents, and communities  to address this systemic harm by allowing those impacted to seek  enforcement in our courts.   The Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act is critical to reforming how  education is accessed in the United States. It is long past time for  Congress to step in and ensure that the law can address discriminatory  policies and practices, and that is exactly what this bill will do.   Similar to the Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act, the Strength in  Diversity Act addresses the importance of increasing diversity in  education and eliminating socioeconomic and racial segregation. Once  again, educational opportunities for our children largely depend on  their home ZIP code.   Unsurprisingly, segregation has a detrimental impact on learning and  educational outcomes. Research shows that students educated in  integrated schools have higher test scores, are more likely to enroll  in college and are less likely to drop out. Moreover, integrated  classrooms have been found to encourage critical thinking, problem  solving, and creativity.   Consistent with the primacy of local control of education, many  school districts around the country have implemented innovative  strategies to address school segregation. Strategies to support more  diverse and inclusive learning include the development of state-of-the- art magnet schools, open enrollment policies, and changes in feeder  patterns to promote diversity. Research suggests that diverse settings  reduce stereotypes and promote cross-racial understanding which is  especially important as our country moves towards a more ethnically and  culturally diverse society.   The Strength in Diversity Act supports communities in developing,  implementing, and expanding diversity initiatives to promote higher  levels of social cohesion and reduce racial prejudice. There is no one  solution to make education more equitable for our students, but  different data clearly shows that increased diversity in classrooms is  one of the best ways for all students to receive a quality education.  This bill will promote those solutions.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, we have the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.   COVID-19 has exposed and exacerbated the hurdles women continue to  face in the workplace, so let's start out by stating one obvious fact:  women shouldn't be forced to choose between financial security and a  healthy pregnancy.   It has been illegal to discriminate against pregnant women for  decades, but we know that this damaging practice remains widespread.   Women make up nearly half of the labor force in this country, yet  pregnancy discrimination persists, including losing a job, being denied  reasonable accommodation, or not being hired in the first place. In  fact, the number of pregnancy discrimination claims filed with the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has been steadily rising for  two decades and is hovering near an all-time high. These practices  aren't new, and they must end.   This is an issue that spans the political spectrum and affects women  in every corner of this country. Estimates indicate that over 20  percent of pregnant workers are employed in jobs that are both low wage  and physically demanding. Women of color are heavily overrepresented in  these estimates, with nearly one in three employed Black and Latina  women working in low-wage jobs.   Though the Pregnancy Discrimination Act has been law since the  seventies and despite a 2015 Supreme Court decision allowing for  reasonable accommodation claims, an unreasonably high standard of proof  is still allowing discrimination against many pregnant workers.   The bipartisan Pregnant Workers Fairness Act helps change this  practice by strengthening Federal workplace protections and promoting  the health and well-being of pregnant women and their families. This  important legislation requires public-sector employers and private- sector employers with more than 15 employees to make reasonable  accommodations for pregnant employees and individuals with known  limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical  conditions.   It is 2020. We should not have to have this debate or lay out an  entire argument as to why we should protect pregnant workers. But here  we are. It is past time that pregnant workers have fair and equal  opportunity in employment. It is past time that the protections of the  Pregnant Workers Fairness Act become law.   When more women work, the better the economy performs. Women are not  asking for special treatment or handouts, just the workplace  protections they deserve so that they can do the jobs they need to do.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues who helped craft these  superb pieces of legislation. I look forward to supporting this rule, I  urge my colleagues to do the same, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my learned colleague for his input.  It certainly would be refreshing to see anything pass the Senate these  days.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished chairman of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have been talking about shared American values.  Certainly, one of our strongest shared American values is that we  condemn violence, particularly violence against our law enforcement  officers. That is not open to question. What happened in California  this past week is horrific, and we all condemn that.   But that is not what we are talking about here. What we are talking  about is an attempt to hijack the rule that we are here to debate.   I mean, I have just listened to a very eloquent argument by the  gentleman from Georgia about the need for bills to go through regular  order and to follow the process. If these are the noncontroversial  items, as warranted by my colleagues, then they can go through the  suspension process.   We just voted on two suspension bills last night. We can do more. We  can be here longer than anticipated if the news I am reading is  correct. So, let them go through the suspension process. Let them be  marked up.   Let's get back to the business of why we are here today and the four  bills that are under consideration as part of this rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Matsui), another distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, we are prepared to close if the gentleman  from Georgia has no further speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   We are in the midst of some of our country's most challenging times.  Millions of Americans are facing eviction. They are food insecure. They  don't know where their next paycheck is going to come from. 200,000  Americans have died, and that number is likely to double by the end of  this year. We have a President wholly indifferent to the pandemic,  other than its impact on his  [[Page H4398]]  political future, and Senate leaders aiding him every step of the way.   Months ago, the House passed the HEROES Act, which would be a  lifeline to the people we serve. However, that bill remains untouched  on Senator McConnell's desk, with hundreds of others.   Included in that bill are lifelines for small business and working  Americans, critical aid to State and local governments just trying to  keep the lights on and to defend our citizens against the pandemic when  national leadership is so lacking, and much-needed money that would go  a long way to developing a vaccine for COVID-19.   The HEROES Act is money for our healthcare providers, our schools,  our caretakers, and essential workers. It is a dereliction of duty for  the Senate to refuse to engage in good faith on this critical  legislation, and the American people will remember.   But while this bill remains in Senator McConnell's legislative  graveyard, we will continue to push for the protections that Americans  need, deserve, and are calling out for. Each of the four pieces of  legislation in our rule today will help our country and Americans all  over.   From the beginning of the 116th Congress, this House has shown that  it is up to the task of legislating for the people while exercising  oversight and other critical constitutional duties.   While we have passed critical COVID-19-related legislation, we will  not stop passing the legislation necessary to make this country a more  equitable place for all Americans. We won't stop working for the  American people, despite attacks by those who would prefer to posture.   There is no place for violence against law enforcement. There is no  place for violence against our fellow citizens, whether that violence  comes from the left or the right. There is no place for discrimination.  Most of all, there is no place for stoking division between Americans,  and we will beat that back at every opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1107         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 9. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       1325) to amend title 18, United States Code, to punish       criminal offenses targeting law enforcement officers, and for       other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill       shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.       All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. When the committee rises and reports the bill back to       the House with a recommendation that the bill do pass, the       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 10. Immediately after disposition of H.R. 1325, the       House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       8251) to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit       preventing access to lifesaving medical procedures and       treatments, and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. When the committee rises and reports the       bill back to the House with a recommendation that the bill do       pass, the previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 11. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 1325 and H.R. 8251.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
