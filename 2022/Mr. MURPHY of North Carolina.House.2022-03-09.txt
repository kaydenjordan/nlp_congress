 Mr. Speaker, today is day 14 of Putin's  ruthless, senseless war on Ukraine. Yet, with all eyes on the United  States, President Biden has still failed to impose the necessary full  economic penalties on the Russian economy.   This week, Ways and Means Republicans and Democrats negotiated a  strong bipartisan bill that added additional, much-needed economic  punishments on Putin's war effort, a historic deal that stopped both  U.S. imports of Russian oil and suspended normal trade relations with  Belarus and Russia--that is, before the White House got involved.   To be clear, the only reason the White House is doing anything is  because it is being politically expedient. They stopped and stalled  negotiations.   The White House has subsequently watered down negotiations where now  40 percent of nonenergy imports from Russia can still continue under  this plan, fueling his war efforts.   While banning U.S. imports of Russian oil is critical, this weakened  legislation fails to go the distance and truly hold Putin accountable  for his shameful war crimes.   There is a special place in hell for evil despots who bomb children's  hospitals. We must do everything at our disposal to support Ukraine and  prove to the world that a strong America will not allow brutal  dictators to reign on this Earth without swift and ferocious  consequences.
