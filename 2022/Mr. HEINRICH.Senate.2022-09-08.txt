 Mr. President, it is my honor to recognize the heroic  life of Samuel F. Sandoval, Sr., who passed away on July 29, 2022. Mr.  Sandoval had been one of the last four remaining Navajo Code Talkers  who served during World War II and whose unbreakable code using the  Navajo language delivered military communications and played an  indispensable role in America's victory in the Pacific.   Mr. Sandoval was Naasht'ezhi Dine'esh, Zuni Clan, and born for  Tl'aashchi'i, Red Cheek People. He was born on October 24, 1923, in  Kimbeto, NM, near Chaco Canyon and graduated in 1942 from the Navajo  Methodist Mission School in Farmington, NM, where he was discouraged  from using the Navajo language.   He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in March of 1943 and completed  his basic training Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego, CA, where  the original 29 Code Talkers had arrived the previous fall. After  transferring to Camp Pendleton in Oceanside, CA, he and other Code  Talkers created more than 600 codes using words from the Navajo  Language. As one of the 418 Navajo Code Talkers, he used the 813-word  Navajo code to securely send and receive military communications.   Mr. Sandoval served in five combat tours, including Guadalcanal,  Bougainville, Guam, Peleliu, and Okinawa, before his honorable  discharge in January 1946. In recognition of his military service, Mr.  Sandoval received the Navy Unit Commendation Ribbon, a Combat Action  Ribbon, a China Service Medal, a World War II Victory Medal, a Navy  Occupation Service Medal with Asia Clasp, and an Asiatic-Pacific  Campaign Medal with a silver star, in lieu of five bronze stars.   After the war, Mr. Sandoval earned a degree in substance abuse  counseling from the University of Utah. He worked for many years as a  counselor, assisting Navajo people experiencing alcohol addiction and  substance use disorders at his clinic, To-Tah Alcohol Counseling.   Like other Code Talkers, Mr. Sandoval had strict orders not to  discuss their secret mission during the war or until it was  declassified decades later in 1968. After their role was revealed  publicly, Mr. Sandoval and his late brother, Merrill Sandoval, took  immense pride in their experiences as Code Talkers and worked to  educate the public about their contributions. Mr. Sandoval told his  personal account in both a book and documentary titled, ``Naz Bah Ei  Bijei: Heart of a Warrior.''   In 2001, Mr. Sandoval received a Congressional Silver Medal from  President George W. Bush in recognition of his service as a Code  Talker. Earlier this year, during his last trip away from home, Mr.  Sandoval received American Spirit Award for Bravery from the National  WWII Museum in New Orleans, LA. He was looking forward to attending the  groundbreaking for the Navajo Code Talker Museum in Tse Bonito, NM,  which took place on National Navajo Code Talkers Day on August 14.   My thoughts are with his widow, Malula, his surviving siblings, his  six children, his 33 grandchildren, his 33 great-grandchildren, and all  those on the Navajo Nation and in New Mexico who he inspired through  his incredible life of service.                            ____________________
