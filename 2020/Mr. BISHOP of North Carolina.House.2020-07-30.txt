 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment No. 225.   Last year, the Trump administration finalized a rule to allow  employers to use flexible health reimbursement arrangements, HRAs, to  fund insurance premiums for coverage purchased on the individual  market. This will allow more Americans to shop for their own coverage  and allow more employers to provide quality health benefits. Expanding  the use of HRAs will increase overall coverage by 800,000 and provide  strong protections for those with preexisting conditions.   Congress needs to provide certainty for employers who want to provide  this benefit. That is why my amendment would ensure that no funds in  this act may be used to withdraw the final HRA rule.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to adopt my commonsense amendment.
