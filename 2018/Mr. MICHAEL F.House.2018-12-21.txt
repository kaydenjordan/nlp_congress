 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak about S. 512, the  Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act.   This legislation contains language from H.R. 1320, the Nuclear  Utilization of Keynote Energy Act, or NUKE Act, that I introduced in  the House with my colleague, Representative Adam Kinzinger. The NUKE  Act passed the House in September, and I am glad to see that the Senate  has also supported these important priorities for the nuclear industry.   I would like to thank Senators Barrasso and Whitehouse for  introducing this legislation in the Senate, and I want to thank my  friend, Representative Kinzinger, for working together to advance the  NUKE Act in the House.   This legislation is very timely, as the nuclear industry is facing  pressure from a variety of factors. Ensuring clarity and reliability  for the industry will be an important step, and I believe this  legislation accomplishes those goals.   Mr. Speaker, before I conclude, I would like note that my colleague,  Representative Gene Green, a cosponsor of the NUKE Act is retiring at  the end of this Congress. I want to commend Mr. Green for his service  to the people of Texas, and I want to wish him the best in his  retirement.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
