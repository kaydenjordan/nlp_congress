 Mr. Speaker, while in my district a few weeks ago, I  spoke with my constituents about the Democratic Party's plan to build  our country back better after the pandemic.   The people of the Virgin Islands agree with me that we have reached  an inflection point. This is our moment to prove to the American people  that their government works for the people, not just those at the top.   As President Biden always said, we need to reward work in this  country, not just wealth. Build Back Better means creating millions of  jobs while tackling the climate crisis and ensuring that America will  not only compete but lead the way to the clean energy future.  Meanwhile, its transformative investments in women and families-- including childcare, paid leave, home-based care, and universal pre-K-- will unlock the full economic potential of parents in the workforce. It  also includes historic investment in workforce training, to connect  workers to jobs.   Democrats have already made sure 40 million American families  received a tax cut through the Biden child tax credit, which is helping  cut child poverty in half. Build Back Better doubles down on those  investments, resulting in one of the largest middle-class tax cuts  ever. This is our opportunity to build back better.                            ____________________
