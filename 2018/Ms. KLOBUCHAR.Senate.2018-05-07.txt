 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize 1st Lt.  Robert Frank Niemann, an American hero from New Ulm, MN, who served  honorably in the U.S. Air Force as a member of the 334th Fighter  Interceptor Squadron, 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing, South Korea.   North Korean forces shot down First Lieutenant Niemann's plane on  April 12, 1953, and 1 year later, he was still missing and declared  killed in action. Forty years later, new information revealed that  First Lieutenant Niemann was captured by North Korean forces and was  questioned by Soviet intelligence officers. He refused to answer their  questions, emphasizing that it was a violation of international laws to  interrogate a wounded prisoner of war.   First Lieutenant Niemann's strength of character in the face of enemy  soldiers was truly heroic. While he is still listed as missing in  action and his status is still unknown, his family and loved ones are  seeking closure. First Lieutenant Niemann made the ultimate sacrifice  defending our county. His daughter, Ann, has planned a memorial tribute  in his honor on May 12, 2018.   Occasions like this one are a powerful reminder of the contributions  of the brave men and women who have donned the uniform in generations  past. We must never forget their sacrifice. Please join me in honoring  the service and sacrifice of 1st Lt. Robert Frank Niemann.                            ____________________
