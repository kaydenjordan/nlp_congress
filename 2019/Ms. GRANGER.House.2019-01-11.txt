 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 266.   Unfortunately, moving this bill across the House floor will not  resolve the partial government shutdown, as the President has said he  will not sign this bill into law.   It is the job and responsibility of Congress to appropriate funds. We  must come together to find a solution that will reopen the government  and fund border security. We need a compromise that represents the will  of both Chambers and the American people.   By considering the Senate-passed version of the appropriations bill,  we are eliminating House Members' involvement in the process. This bill  in particular ignores 93 percent of all House Member requests that were  included in our bill, including the 50 amendments that were adopted on  the floor.   This appropriations bill for the Interior Department fails to include  the $12 million that House Members provided to U.S. Geological Survey  programs, like the earthquake early warning system that saves lives.   It also reduces the amount of funds available to clear dead and dying  trees from forests, to help prevent the kind of devastating wildfires  we saw this year, by $21 million.   We have heard a lot about the National Park Service during this  shutdown. This bill reduces funding for our national parks by $27  million.   These are just a few of the priorities of the House that are not  included in this bill before us today.   Madam Speaker, Republicans stand ready and willing to negotiate with  our friends on the other side of the aisle on legislation that includes  priorities of both parties and both Chambers. That is how this  legislative body and our system of government are designed to work.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from California, Mr. Calvert, for  his efforts today and over the last several months to ensure that the  House's voice is heard in this debate.
