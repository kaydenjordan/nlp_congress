 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  Monsignor William O'Neill, who celebrated his Golden Jubilee of  Ordination on June 4, 2017, marking his 50th year of service with the  Catholic Diocese of Savannah.   Irish Catholics have been an important aspect of Savannah's culture  and history since their arrival during the mid-19th century. Today,  Savannah maintains important aspects of Irish Catholic culture, and is  now home to the third largest St. Patrick's Day festival in the world.   A native of Ireland, a newly ordained O'Neill arrived in the heat of  a Georgia summer in 1967. His first assignment was to St. Mary on the  Hill in Augusta. Later, Father O'Neill would go on to manage the  cathedral at Abercorn and Harris, which has become an architectural  staple in the city of Savannah.   Father O'Neill's graciousness and love for the Catholic faith and its  Savannah followers led him to begin the renovation of the cathedral on  Abercorn and Harris in 1998, which involved the removal and cleaning of  over 50 stained glass windows, the replacement of the slate roof, and  the restoration of the building's interior.   On February 4, 2001, Father O'Neill was made the first priest of the  Savannah Diocese in nearly 34 years to be invested with the title of  Monsignor, which serves as a recognition of his commitment to the  Diocese. Although he has since retired, Father O'Neill remains an  active part of the Diocese.   I congratulate Father O'Neill and I thank him for his commitment to  the First Congressional District of Georgia.                Retirement of FLETC Director Connie L. Patrick     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Ms. Connie  Patrick for her service to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center,  as she retires as its director this Friday, June 30, 2017.   Director Patrick began her career in law enforcement in 1976, when  she was sworn in as a deputy with the Brevard County Sheriff's Office  in Titusville, Florida. Her hard work and determination gave her the  opportunity for a promotion to serve as a special agent with the  Florida Department of Law Enforcement.   After 20 years with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, she  began her work with the FLETC. Director Patrick's impeccable work ethic  gained her a promotion to Director of the FLETC in 2002. She has since  served in that capacity.   Under Director Patrick's leadership, local, State and, Federal  training facility growth has increased by an astonishing 22 percent.  The FLETC has also trained more students during her tenure than it did  in its first 36 years of existence.   As Director of this division of Homeland Security, Director Patrick  oversaw training for a majority of Federal officers and agents from  more than 90 Federal organizations on the local, State, and national  levels. These facilities graduate approximately 63,000 law enforcement  officers annually. To date, Director Patrick is the longest-serving  head of any component of the Department of Homeland Security.   Director Patrick has also found the time to serve as a leader among  members of the National Sheriffs' Association Education and Awards  Committee, as well as the executive committee of the National Law  Enforcement Exploring Committee.   I thank Director Patrick for her invaluable dedication to ensuring  that  [[Page H5189]]  our law enforcement officers are properly trained to protect our loved  ones.                St. Mary Missionary Baptist Church Anniversary     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  St. Mary Missionary Baptist Church on its 87th anniversary this year.   In 1930, God gave a group of dynamic trailblazers, under the  leadership of the church's first pastor, Reverend R.D. Cooper, a vision  to help establish a permanent place of worship. They purchased land and  built the first structure that would become St. Mary Missionary Baptist  Church. On that location, the members of St. Mary embraced the church's  unified goal of ``Touching Lives for Christ.''   As pastors came and went over the years, each had their own vision on  how to improve and enrich the church and its congregation. The church's  current leader, Minister Lawrence F. Baker, Sr., joined St. Mary as its  pastor in 2005 and made many improvements and purchases that helped the  church grow its membership while never losing sight of its vision.   St. Mary is a truly blessed congregation with its kind and charitable  members serving the community any way they can. As the church continues  to grow, the good people of St. Mary touch more lives every day. On  June 11, communities and congregations from all over came together to  celebrate St. Mary's history and future.   I congratulate Minister Baker on his impressive leadership of this  dynamic organization.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Congregation Mickve Israel in Savannah, Georgia, as it celebrates its  incredible 284th anniversary on July 11, 2017.   Just 5 months after General James Oglethorpe settled the colony,  Jewish settlers fleeing persecution in Europe arrived in Georgia. They  sought refuge in Savannah, where they were free to practice their  beliefs. This brave group soon founded the Congregation Mickve Israel.   Predating our country by several decades as the first congregation in  the South, Mickve Israel set an important precedent for the Jewish  people. As such, wars, plagues, and religious struggles each challenged  the congregation over the years, yet Mickve  [[Page H5221]]  Israel has withstood the test of time. It continues to be a beacon for  the faithful and now welcomes 380 families inside its walls.   The story of Mickve Israel is special to the people and has been  recognized for its achievement since its early years. President George  Washington sent a personal letter to the congregation to honor its  members and wish them well.   Since then, numerous Presidents over the years have made similar  gestures, each one acknowledging the congregation's longevity and  importance to the Jewish community.   I would also like to acknowledge the congregation's importance and  congratulate Congregation Mickve Israel in reaching this impressive  milestone. I know this religious community will continue to serve a  caring, faithful, and integral role in Savannah, Georgia.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding, and I thank the gentleman for hosting this Special Order.   This is certainly a very important subject, one that I am very  familiar with. It is indeed an epidemic in our country. There is not a  State nor a district that hasn't been touched by this problem.  Countless people have succumbed to this issue. That issue is the  [[Page H5223]]  use of opioids and the devastating impact on our communities.   Recent data showed that overdose deaths have jumped by over 50  percent in the decade leading up to 2015. In addition, nearly 1,300  people died in Georgia in 2015 from drug overdoses. These are  statistics that need to be urgently addressed. We have made great  progress with the passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery  Act, but we have an opportunity to do more.   One staggering statistic is that last year it is estimated that  roughly 60,000 people died from drug overdoses--a number that is far  too high. Just earlier this month, four people in central Georgia died  in a matter of 2 days due to opioid overdoses from falsely labeled  drugs. That instance is not only troubling because it reflects growing  painkiller use in the rural parts of my State, but because it also  represents another problem: counterfeit and fake drugs.   An issue that I have been working on is the growing trend of drugs  and drug ingredients being ordered abroad and delivered through the  mail to addresses around the country.   A recent Wall Street Journal article mentioned the synthetic opioids  that are being brought into this country and the methods by which they  are doing it.   An example of one of those drugs is fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that  is wreaking havoc across the country.   We must not only look at the types of drugs that are being used, but  also how people are acquiring them and how to effectively limit that.  Our enforcement personnel are working diligently with the Postal  Service to find ways to curb this trend, such as using advanced data.  But it is a topic that needs more work. By cutting off their ability to  purchase these dangerous synthetic opioids, we can help to limit this  epidemic.   As a lifelong pharmacist, I have seen firsthand the dangers and  problems associated with opioid abuse and its impact on our  communities. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to counter this trend in hopes of saving lives.   Again, I want to thank the gentleman for hosting this tonight. It is  so very vital to our country. Thank you for allowing me to speak.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes, they are. They have to show an ID in  order to pick it up. Now, the prescription itself is a C2 prescription,  so if we don't recognize them at the pharmacy, we have to ask them for  their ID to make sure that is indeed the person who is picking it up.   We also have a program in Georgia, in fact, a program that you are  very familiar with, a prescription drug monitoring program, that allows  us to go and check a database to see if that person has actually been  doctor shopping or is pharmacy shopping and getting it at other places.  That has helped us. It is a great tool in fighting this epidemic.    That is one of the major problems. For  instance, in my practice, I practiced in Savannah, Georgia, which is on  the South Carolina line, and only 2 hours from the Florida State line.  That was a constant problem for us. I could look at my data all day  long, but I wouldn't know whether they had gotten something filled in  South Carolina or in Florida.
