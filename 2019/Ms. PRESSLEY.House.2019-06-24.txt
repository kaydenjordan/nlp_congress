 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment  which would provide increased funding to support the Department of  Housing and Urban Development's Family Self-Sufficiency Program.   Access to stable, safe, and affordable housing is a fundamental human  right. In my district, the Massachusetts Seventh, one of the most  diverse and unequal districts in our Nation, we are distinctly aware of  the connection between housing and economic opportunity.   Affordable housing promotes healthy living and provides low-income  people a chance at upward mobility. Without it, families are  destabilized, productivity suffers, and entire communities crumble.   Recently, the Boston Housing Authority partnered with Metro Housing  and Compass Working Capital, a nonprofit financial services  organization which provides financial coaching services and support to  Family Self-Sufficiency Program participants in my district.   The Family Self-Sufficiency Program is a voluntary, 5-year program  that provides participants in the federally-funded Housing Choice  Voucher Program the opportunity to save part of their rent increase  when they earn more money at work. The program provides participating  families with an FSS savings account.   My amendment provides $5 million in additional funding to the  organizations working with individuals and families seeking to improve  their financial standing. This partnership, under the auspices of the  Family Self-Sufficiency Program, has supported low-income families to  build assets, pay off debt, and save for their retirement.   Participants have gone on to earn degrees, purchase their own homes,  and start small businesses.   This includes Julia, a woman who, after years of working as a tailor  and taking on additional side work for friends, learned about the FSS  program. Julia used Compass' financial coaching to launch JDLS Couture,  a tailoring and design business in Boston.   This includes Ernise, a resident of Cambridge, who graduated from  Compass' program last year. Ernise joined the program while unemployed,  saying that before she joined she was ready to give up. Ernise found  full-time work, paid off debt and increased her credit score, and built  enough savings to begin the home purchasing process.                                time  1745    My amendment will support a program rooted in financial empowerment  and independence, a proven program.   We must also work to enact policies to guarantee housing for all and  leverage the resources to make it a reality.   I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Price).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment,  which underscores the importance of investing in safe, efficient,  people-centered transportation systems for all communities across the  country.  [[Page H5068]]    I view every issue through a lens of equity and health. Without  access to safe, reliable, and inclusive modes of transportation, our  collective well-being suffers; our families suffer; our communities  suffer.   For far too long, our Federal transportation funding and policies  have created a landscape which has exacerbated inequities and  disparities, particularly for low-income communities, people with  disabilities, our youth and seniors.   In my district, Black and Latino commuters are more likely to  experience longer travel times than their White peers. These unequal  burdens make the promise of economic mobility further out of reach.   I recently rode the T back home with an advocate named Dianna, who  was fighting for transit justice. We spent over 2 hours making a  journey of just a little over 4 miles. Broken elevators and outdated  infrastructure meant that the wheelchair Dianne uses to navigate ran  into constant access barriers.   Just 2 weeks ago, the red line train derailed twice in 1 week,  causing massive gridlock across my district and impacting the ability  of riders to commute to work, school, home, and everywhere in between.   Unfortunately, this isn't new. MBTA trains have derailed 43 times  over the last 5 years, the second highest total of any metro transit  system in our country. Many of these derailments place a  disproportionate burden on the shoulders of low-wage hourly workers who  are rushing to their second- or third-shift jobs, parents or caregivers  who are traveling with young children on overcrowded and delayed  trains, and riders with disabilities who already experience the  failures, daily, of a biased and discriminatory system with ableist  privilege as a lens.   Our chronic underinvestment in mass transit bus systems, bicycle- accessible and pedestrian paths have caused income inequality and  opportunity gaps in communities throughout the country.   According to the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights,  inadequate access to affordable, reliable transportation has  exacerbated health disparities, forcing many low-income patients to  miss appointments, oftentimes worsening medical problems.   Mr. Chair, people do not live in silos. They live in  intersectionality, and our policies at the Federal, State, and local  levels should reflect this reality.   We cannot spur economic development and tackle economic inequities in  urban, suburban, and rural communities without modernized roads,  bridges, and mass transit, which connects communities to jobs and  higher education.   We cannot tackle health disparities without reliable and affordable  mass transit systems which enable low-income families, seniors, and  people with disabilities to access care.   We cannot tackle the existential threat of climate change without  intentionally investing in mass transit systems that protect frontline  communities and alleviate the environmental health hazards caused by  traffic congestion.   Transit equity is a civil rights issue and an economic justice issue.  We must continue to invest in transit infrastructure, multimodal  improvements that promote inclusivity and dependability.   My amendment emphasizes the important role that Federal policy and  investments make in equalizing access to reliable commuter rail and  other mass transit options for all. The BUILD grant program helps to  support these types of State and locally driven transit projects.   From investing in bus or commuter rail systems or cycling and  pedestrian path projects, the BUILD program helps to drive innovative  projects, and it seeks to expand the system, and is people-centered.   Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Price for his efforts to ensure robust  funding for this program, which I do believe gets us one step closer to  addressing these inequities across the system, repairing our crumbling  infrastructure, as well as expanding our investment in multimodal  transit.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Price), the chairman.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
