 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Cole for yielding.   I rise today in opposition to the previous question so that we can  immediately consider H.R. 6858, the American Energy Independence from  Russia Act.   Gas prices are at a record high, and unfortunately, they will  continue to rise.   While the Russian invasion of Ukraine has worsened the crisis, it is  not the sole cause. The root cause of high energy and gas prices is due  to the anti-energy policies of the Biden administration, which  suspended all oil and gas leasing on Federal lands, slow-walked  liquefied natural gas exports, and halted construction of the Keystone  XL pipeline while green-lighting Russia's Nord Stream 2.   These steps allowed Putin to corner the energy market and fund his  invasion of Ukraine. American dollars can no longer go to countries  whose interests run counter to America.                                time  1015    America produces some of the cleanest oil and gas in the world. If my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to lower emissions and  promote clean energy, they would rely on American oil and gas  production in States like my home State of Oklahoma, not foreign  countries like Russia, Venezuela, and even Iran.   Oklahomans are tired of inaction from Washington. They expect  solutions. We cannot continue to tap into the strategic petroleum  reserve, which is at some of the lowest levels since 2003. In addition,  releasing 30 million barrels is only enough to meet our Nation's energy  requirements for about a day.   Sadly, this week House Democrats are not bringing forward a single  piece of legislation to address the energy crisis.   Under the Trump administration, America was energy independent and a  net total energy exporter for the first time since 1952.   Madam Speaker, energy security is national security. Sadly, under  this administration, we have neither.   Congress must act immediately to take up the American Energy  Independence From Russia Act.   This legislation would promote America's oil and natural gas  production and unleash American energy independence once again.                            ____________________
