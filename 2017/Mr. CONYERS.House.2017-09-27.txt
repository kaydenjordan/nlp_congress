 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  3229, a bipartisan, commonsense measure intended to protect the safety  of federal judges and judicial employees.   The bill accomplishes this critical goal by extending the authority  of the Judicial Conference to redact sensitive information contained in  the financial disclosure reports filed by these individuals pursuant to  the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. Specifically, H.R. 3229 would  extend this authority for 10 years, that is, until December 31, 2027.   I am an original cosponsor and strong supporter of this bill for  several reasons.   To begin with, absent a further extension of this authority, the  Judicial Conference's ability to redact sensitive personal information  from the financial disclosure statements filed by judges and judicial  employees would cease  [[Page H7551]]  and thereby create potentially serious security risks to these  individuals.   Judges and judicial employees are often the subject of threats,  harassment, and violence. Like probation officers, these individuals  routinely interact with disgruntled litigants and convicted criminals  who may hold grudges against them.   A resentful litigant seeking to take revenge for a judicial decision  can learn of a federal judge's home address, his or her spouse's place  of employment, or a child's school, among other types of sensitive  information, by requesting a copy of the judge's financial disclosure  report.   During 2016, for instance, a federal judge was shot in front of his  home, a murder-for-hire plot against a federal judge was uncovered, and  threatening letters were sent to other judges.   Fortunately, section 105 of the Ethics in Government Act grants the  Judicial Conference the authority to redact certain limited information  from financial disclosure reports when the release of such information  could endanger a judge, a judicial employee, or a member of their  family.   Congress has extended this redaction authority on 5 previous  occasions, most recently on January 3, 2012.   Another reason why I support H.R. 3229 is that the Judicial  Conference has exercised its redaction authority with demonstrated  restraint.   As required by the Ethics in Government Act, the Conference has  promulgated regulations requiring a clear nexus between a security risk  and the need to redact sensitive information.   In addition, the Act requires the Judicial Conference to report  annually to Congress on the number and nature of redactions as well as  the reasons for them.   Based on a review of these reports, it is clear that only a small  percentage of the financial disclosure reports filed contain an  approved redaction of some information in the report.   For example, less than 3 percent of financial reports contained an  approved redaction of some information over the past 5 years.   Finally, the need to extend this redaction authority--which will  expire in just over 3 months--is a time-sensitive security matter that  requires prompt consideration of H.R. 3229.   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3229, which will  simply extend the Judicial Conference's current redaction authority for  an additional 10 years.   In closing, I want to commend Congressman Hakeem Jeffries for his  leadership on this important legislation. We share his commitment to  protecting the security of those public servants who serve in the  federal judicial branch.   Accordingly, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Issa) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 3229, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
