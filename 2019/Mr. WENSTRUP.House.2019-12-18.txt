 Madam Speaker, since 2016, America has seen a pattern  of failed and disproven attacks and allegations against President  Trump.   Today is the fourth impeachment-related vote since President Trump  took office. It is yet another attempt to reach their predetermined  conclusion of impeachment, a conclusion built on political bias,  accusations, and innuendo. These repetitive and false allegations  reveal a political obsession disguised as some kind of righteous  oversight.   When they didn't win at the ballot box, they pursued a Russian  collusion narrative that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had to waste  time and taxpayer dollars to prove false.   When the Russian collusion malicious deception didn't work, Madam  Speaker, Democrats sought a new path forward to impeach President  Trump: They created a made-for-TV set of hearings complete with witness  auditions held in the basement of the Capitol.   Despite all of their efforts, the charges the House considers today  lack evidence to support them. There wasn't one witness who said a  crime or impeachable offense was committed.   Madam Speaker, I remind my colleagues, no crime, no impeachable  offense. That is a pretty good defense if you ask me.   I will work diligently to further reveal the truths and further  reveal the abuses of power, Madam Speaker, that Democrats paid for and  enacted during the last 3 years, abuses of power from the other side of  the aisle within this body and within our FBI. Americans deserve the  truth.   All in all, history will be remembered today as the political  impeachment that set the precedent for Presidents to be impeached every  time there is a divided government.   I oppose the articles before us today, and I yield to the other side  and their superior imaginations.
