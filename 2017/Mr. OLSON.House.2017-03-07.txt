 Mr. Speaker, I work for the Texans in Meadows Place. They  are led by Mayor Charles Jessup. The locals call Meadows Place the best  square mile of small-town America.   Meadows Place has a secret. Shhhhh. Every man who lives there is in  love with the same woman. We all love Lillian Cox.   Lillian turned 110 on February 22. In 352 days, I am taking Lillian  out for her 111th birthday. She will put on a nice dress, a necklace,  and earrings. I will take her to the Live Oak Grill, where she will  have the fried catfish she loves so much. I will have the chicken fried  steak. And we may go dancing, if I can keep up with her.   Lillian, happy 110th birthday. I will pick you up at 5 p.m. on  February 22, 2018.                            ____________________
