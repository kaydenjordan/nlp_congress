 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the amendment.   I represent the largest district east of the Mississippi. It is the  second most rural district in the country, and home to more than 53,000  veterans.   The VA facilities that these veterans rely on--these are clinics in  places like Houlton, Maine, Fort Kent, and Rumford--are at risk of  being shut down if we don't permanently end the Asset and  Infrastructure, or AIR Commission.   Our VA hospital in Maine would be moved from Augusta. It would be  downsized to an urgent care facility then be moved to Portland, Maine,  which is a long distance away from most of the rural communities that I  represent.   Of course, Congress created this panel and tasked it with processing  the recommendations given to streamline VA facilities. I think if you  live in a rural State, it turns out that has largely been shorthand for  closing facilities or reducing access to healthcare services.   I introduced a bipartisan bill to eliminate the AIR Commission. Just  about a month ago, I helped secure the language referred to earlier in  the National Defense Authorization Act of that bill and, of course, I  now support this amendment to defund the Commission and transfer the  money to the VA's Healthcare for Homeless Veterans Program. It is a far  better use of the money.    I thank Mr. McGovern for his support of our Nation's veterans.
