 Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the  University of Akron's sesquicentennial and congratulate them on 150  years of extraordinary research, education, and contributions to  northeast Ohio.   In 1870, Buchtel College was founded in Akron, OH. It was the  predecessor to today's University of Akron. The opening enrollment at  Buchtel College was 46 collegiate students with an additional 171  students in the preparatory program. Today, the University of Akron has  an enrollment of more than 19,000 students between the main campus in  Akron and four regional locations, and the school has more than 175,000  alumni living in 138 countries around the globe.   The University of Akron is home to a beautiful 218-acre campus and  top programs in psychology, business administration and accounting,  secondary education, the world's largest polymer academic program, and  more. UA has a $2.7 billion economic impact in its primary service  area, which includes the Ohio counties of Summit, Cuyahoga, Stark,  Medina, Portage, and Wayne.   On October 10, 2020, UA will be celebrating its sesquicentennial  anniversary with 150 independent celebrations around the world,  concluding with a live message and toast from current University of  Akron President, Gary Miller. The evening will honor UA's past 150  years of education and research and recognize the impactful,  imaginative, and innovative work faculty, researchers, and staff at UA  have done over the years and continue to do today.   UA is a prominent institution of higher education with a long history  of playing an active role in serving the community in Akron and beyond.  Congratulations to the University of  [[Page S6038]]  Akron for 150 years of excellence, and I wish them the best of luck as  they keep the lamp of learning burning for many years to come.                            ____________________
