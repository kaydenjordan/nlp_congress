 Madam Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with our LGBTQ+  community who have fought for equal dignity under the law for decades.   For far too long our LGBTQ neighbors have been discriminated against  simply for being who they are and loving who they love. Today, if that  case is overturned, same-sex couples would not be allowed to marry in  the State of Michigan.   Every single American, no matter their faith, race, gender identity,  or sexual orientation has the right to marry the person they love.   I am proud to be here today in the people's House as Congress takes  this historic vote to send this legislation to President Biden's desk.   Today, we take one more step toward equality and justice for all. May  we continue to build upon this progress by ensuring that all LGBTQ+  neighbors have what they need to thrive and be protected under law.
