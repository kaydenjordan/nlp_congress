 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with my  Asian American and Pacific Islander brothers and sisters.   Asian Americans continue to experience violence, harassment, and  discrimination. Across our country, our AAPI communities live in fear  of being targets of deadly violence and racist slurs, simply because of  who they are.   As we work to invest and rebuild our communities, we must make one  thing clear: Hate and racism have no home here, not in our policies,  and not in our hearts.   Yesterday, we passed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to send to the  President's desk. Today, we passed a resolution condemning the horrific  shooting in Atlanta.   We are making progress, but we must never lose sight of the work that  lies ahead to combat the hatred and violence against the AAPI community  and root out racism against our brothers and sisters.                            ____________________
