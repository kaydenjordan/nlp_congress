 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Ohio for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, here we go again: about to vote on a divisive bill being  pushed through by the majority without any Republican input. Disguised  as accountability, this bill hinders law enforcement's ability to do  their jobs, limits the readiness of law enforcement, and demonizes an  entire profession for the actions of a few.   A bill from my Minnesota colleague, Mr. Stauber, a former police  officer himself, accomplishes many of the aims of this bill before us  today, and has bipartisan support from the stakeholders involved; but  Democrats rejected it, picking partisanship over real reform to help  and improve law enforcement.   We do not deny there is work to be done, but the path to getting it  done is working together to ensure that law enforcement developed the  necessary tools to keep our communities safe and protect the rights of  people they serve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and to work on a  bill that will really help law enforcement and the citizens.
