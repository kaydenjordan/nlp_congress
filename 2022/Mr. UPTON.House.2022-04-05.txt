 Mr. Speaker, it seems like just yesterday when a number of  community leaders encouraged me to run for Congress. Against all odds,  we ended up winning a very hotly contested Republican primary, and the  journey began.   Throughout my career, I have leaned on lessons from my Reagan White  House days where my boss and mentor was Ken Duberstein, who later was  his chief of staff.   Reagan worked both sides of the aisle to get things done, caring less  about who got the credit, and I made a promise that such a principle  would be my guiding light. Especially in these days of divided  government, that is the only way one can actually get legislation  enacted.   There has been something special in my household with highlights and  lowlights that we often discuss at the dinner table. As I reflect back,  there have certainly been more highlights representing the wonderful  and diverse corner of southwest Michigan. These folks are truly the  salt of the earth, and I love them all. I really do, even the few that  don't always love me.   As chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, a huge highlight was  21st Century Cures. Hailed as the most important piece of legislation  passed in that Congress, it laid the foundation for Operation Warp  Speed and faster drug approvals, including the first vaccine that  Pfizer produced in Kalamazoo.   Now, once again, with my partner Diana DeGette, we are pursuing Cures  2.0 with all the disease and patient groups who joined us on Cures.   My driving mission has been jobs and the economy. Whether it was  working on a North American energy independent plan, pursuing renewable  resources, and, yes, dealing with climate change. Changing the tax laws  so that no longer do we have the highest corporate tax rates in the  world, which drove so many of our job creators someplace other than  America. Being the Republican lead with John Dingell on the auto rescue  plan. The industry and all the jobs that came with it was simply too  big to fail.   Pipeline safety, protecting the Great Lakes, and our drinking water  has also been my focus. Every family in America deserves clean water.   I have been more than willing to stand up for the less fortunate and  vulnerable, including my vote last week to cap the price of insulin.   I have had the opportunity to visit our brave troops in harm's way  overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan, and witnessed the tragedy of war like  we see today with Putin's invasion in Ukraine. It was critical to pass  the recent humanitarian and military aid. Yes, it was.   And, of course, I witnessed 9/11 here and pushed hard on the  recommendation by the 9/11 Commission to protect against such an attack  again.  [[Page H4156]]    As a former Boy Scout, I believe in leaving the campground better  than when you found it. I have worked with seven administrations, seven  House Speakers. None of them would call me a rubber stamp. If it is  good policy for Michigan, it is good enough for all of us.   As a vice chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, we have  pushed the envelope to get things done, taking on some complex and  often controversial issues that others may want to just sweep under the  rug. Immigration reform, including border security, for our Dreamers  and farmers, a real honest-to-goodness infrastructure bill that passed  69-30 in the Senate but then hit the rocks here in the House, barely  surviving Trump's opposition, despite his call for a proposal twice as  expensive with no pay-fors.   I have worked alongside real giants who put principle over politics:  Greg Walden, Paul Henry, Mike Rogers, Pat Tiberi, Susan Brooks, Charlie  Dent, John Lewis, Mike Castle, Henry Hyde, Amo Houghton, Dave Camp,  Nancy Johnson, and Don Young were among the best.    I work daily on all things Michigan, particularly with Debbie  Dingell, and we have been hitting the road to push for civility.  Hopefully, civility and bipartisanship versus discord can rule, not  rue, the day.   Current colleagues like CMR, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Steve Womack,  Mario Diaz-Balart, Josh Gottheimer, Brian Fitzpatrick, Tom Cole, Dave  McKinley, Dan Kildee, John Katko, Kurt Schrader, Dean Phillips, Peter  Meijer, and my friend Steny cut the mustard, too.   I have been blessed having wonderful, hardworking staff all these  years. Yes, two of them--including my chief of staff, Joan  Hillebrands--have been on my team 36 years, with another handful  between 15 and 20 years. Our district team has worked on so many  different casework issues, in the tens of thousands. Throughout the  COVID nightmare, we worked with our local bankers to save dozens of  small businesses with PPP, and we worked to get vital supplies to our  wonderful health facilities and frontline workers, who are still so  stressed today.   Even the best of stories has a last chapter. This is it for me. I  have done the zillions of airline miles back and forth. I have signed  ``Fred'' to over a million letters; cast more votes than anyone in this  Chamber while here; and by most accounts, have succeeded in making a  difference, accomplishing what I have set out to do, with more  unfinished work still yet to come.   Arthur Brooks recently wrote about three traits most important in  life--honesty, compassion, and faith. I would like to think those same  yardsticks were passed along to me by my parents, watching on C-SPAN  now.   Someone asked my wife, Amey, what would be the next chapter? She  said, ``and they lived happily ever after.'' Indeed, we will. I thank  Amey, our two kids, and three grandkids for giving me so much to look  forward to.   Thanks again to the people of my district who placed their faith and  confidence in me all these years.   God bless the USA.                            ____________________
