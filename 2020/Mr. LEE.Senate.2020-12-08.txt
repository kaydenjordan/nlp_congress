 Madam President, I stand today to give tribute to my friend  and colleague, the senior Senator from New Mexico, Tom Udall, who was  assigned to be my mentor when I first arrived in the Senate nearly 10  years ago.   Over a series of meetings we had over breakfast, lunch, and in our  offices, Tom mentored me and tutored me on the rules of the Senate. He  took the time to explain the nuances of the filibuster and how the  Senate has deviated from the rule as it was originally designed. The  concept is not a familiar one, nor is it intuitive, and yet Tom was  able to explain it to me in a way that was simple and easy to  understand and helped me grasp the passion that he has for addressing  that issue and for reforming the Senate for the better ever since then.   He had a way of doing it that didn't make anyone feel demeaned but  made them, rather, more enthusiastic about making the Senate a better  place in which to work, operate, and legislate.   I have no idea whether the person who assigned Tom as my mentor knew  that Tom and I were related, that we are second cousins, that his  grandmother and my grandfather were brother and sister, or that my  grandmother on the other side of the family was his U.S. history  teacher at James Fenimore Cooper Intermediate and Junior High, but our  paths seemed destined to cross.   I didn't know Tom well growing up, although I knew his father  Stewart, and I knew his Uncle Morris. Tom was already off to fame and  stardom by the time I came along, but I knew his family long before I  got to know him. In many ways, they saved the best for last.   Even though I got to know your dad and your Uncle Morris before I got  to  [[Page S7255]]  know you, I tremendously enjoyed getting to work with you. You and I  come from similar parts of the country, from some of the same ancestral  pioneer stock, and we have very different ideas. Yet Tom Udall has  always been someone with whom I have been able to communicate freely  and frankly and from whom I have always heard positive, uplifting  communication, even when we disagree, which happens from time to time.   Thank you so much for your service. It has been a pleasure getting to  work with you as a colleague. I wish you and Jill the very best success  and happiness in your future endeavors.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor Judge Dee  Benson, who passed away this week after a heroic battle with cancer.  Dee had a remarkable and far-reaching legal career, making an impact  throughout Utah and the country. But even more than that, he has made  an indelible mark as a beloved teacher, mentor, role model, and friend.   Dee grew up on small farm in Jordan, UT, across from the old Jordan  High School. He served a 2-year mission in Sweden for the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and afterwards attended BYU,  graduating in 1973 with a degree in physical education. After a brief  stint as a student teacher and soccer coach at Hillcrest High, he  decided to change career paths and on a whim applied to law school.   Dee stumbled onto what would become a brilliant vocation in law. He  was one of the very first law students at Brigham Young University,  when my late father, Rex Lee, was founding BYU's J. Reuben Clark Law  School. Dee quickly took to law, grasping legal concepts with speed and  ease, and soon became a star of his class, even without spending all  his time in the libary. He was an equally affable student, loved by all  of his classmates. A gifted athlete, he still managed to participate in  school activities and sports while in law school, even playing for the  soccer team during his final year and finishing near the top of his  class.   After graduating in 1976, Dee spent a few months playing professional  soccer  [[Page S7278]]  with the Utah Golden Spikers of the American Soccer League, and then  turned to his law career. He started out in private practice, first at  Marineau and Mack and then at Christensen and Martineau. He would later  be appointed to positions at the highest levels of law by Presidents,  Chief Justices, and Senators.   He came to Washington first to work as counsel for the Senate  Judiciary Committee. Dee was then-Senator Orrin Hatch's chief of staff  for 2 years and while there served as counsel on the Iran-Contra  Congressional Investigating Committee. He worked as U.S. attorney from  1989 until 1991, when he was appointed by President George H.W. Bush to  serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, where he  served for nearly three decades.   As Federal judge, he was appointed as one of the seven judges to the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court by Chief Justice William  Rehnquist, frequently flying to Washington to review requests for  warrants and wiretaps against suspected spies and terrorists. He was  also appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts to serve on the Judicial  Conference of the United States, a policy-making body within the  Federal judicial system.   Dee had a deep love of the law and true impartiality as a jurist. In  all of his duties, he never sought to impose his own agenda but simply  to get the law right--not according to his own personal beliefs or  feelings but as he understood it. And as much as Dee loved the law, he  was loved by those around him. He brought kindness, humor, and fun to  every environment. He was known to keep a bicycle in his chambers and a  dart board for his clerks.   I myself was lucky enough to have him as my first boss when I clerked  for him the year after I graduated from law school. I learned more  about the practice of law during that clerkship than I did during all 3  years of law school combined. I will never forget our countless  conversations about the law--deep dives on everything from compelled- speech doctrine , the coconspirator hearsay rule, and the requirements  for authenticating so-called ``ancient documents'' under the Federal  Rules of Evidence--in the courtroom and in his chambers and sometimes  even while mountain biking or during a game of ping pong or darts.   Everyone at the courthouse--from the prosecutors to the defense  counsel, from civil litigants to criminal defendants, from probation  officers to support staff--loved and learned daily from Judge Benson.  Despite his keen intellect and prominence, he was one of the most  humble, genuine people I have ever known. He cared deeply about the  happiness of those around them and left everyone more happy and  encouraged than when he found them. He treated each person who came  into his courtoom with dignity and respect, no matter who you were.   Throughout the years, Dee retained his passion for sports and zest  for life. He ran marathons, was an avid mountain biker, and mastered  every sport that caught his interest. He was a devoted father who,  despite the many demands on his time, seemed to maintain constant  contact with each of his four children, taking delight in every word  they uttered and every activity they pursued.   Even his cancer diagnosis would not dampen his spirit or slow him  down. After being partially paralyzed and bedridden this past May, by  the end of the month he had returned to his chambers in Salt Lake City  and had come into work as recently as last week--steadfast and strong  until the end.   Judge Dee Benson was a true public servant, a gift to Utah and to  everyone who had the good fortune to meet him. For those of us who knew  and loved Dee, the world will now seem incomplete; but it has been an  honor and a blessing to call him a mentor and a friend.                            ____________________
