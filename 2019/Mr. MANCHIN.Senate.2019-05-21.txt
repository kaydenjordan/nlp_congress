 Madam President, today I am incredibly honored to rise  and recognize a group of 23 heroic military veterans who will travel  from West Virginia this week to visit our Nation's Capital as part of  the 10th Always Free Honor Flight. On the occasion of their visit, in  which they will see for the first time the monuments built in their  honor, I want to express my utmost gratitude to these special men and  women for their extraordinary bravery and patriotism and for their  noble sacrifice to help keep our country free.   I have said this time and time again: West Virginia is one of the  most patriotic States in this great Nation. With one of our country's  highest per capita rates of military servicemembers and veterans, West  Virginia is undoubtedly one of our Nation's most patriotic States.  According to the Department of Defense, West Virginia had the highest  casualty rate in the Nation during the Vietnam war, and I am so proud  that the Honor Flight will allow these West Virginia veterans to pay  homage to their brethren at the Vietnam Wall. The 31 veterans  participating in this week's Always Free Honor Flight truly embody the  Mountain State's history and contributions to the safeguarding of our  American freedoms.   Our special West Virginians visiting this week represent warriors  from 23 to 93 years old and have traveled from all parts of our great  State, from Beckley to Bluefield, Princeton to Cottageville, and many  places in between. In addition to our Mountain State veterans, six  veterans from Virginia and one veteran from Florida will be  accompanying their West Virginia neighbors on the day-long adventure.  Of the patriots attending, one served in World War II, two served in  the Korean war, 10 served in the Vietnam war, one in Vietnam and Desert  Storm, one served in the Cold war, one served in Desert Storm and the  Gulf war, two served in the war in Afghanistan, and many others served  between wars.   I would especially like to recognize our World War II veteran who  will be on this honor flight--93-year-old Allen K. Walker who now lives  in Beckley but is originally from the Mississippi Delta. He joined the  Navy in Rosedale, MS, in 1944. He served as a seaman first class  stationed in Pearl Harbor, HI. Allen is a member of our Nation's  Greatest Generation, and their sacrifices and valor embody American  patriotism. They fought in such a pivotal war, in an era that  threatened our existence as a Nation. Unfortunately, as the years go  by, we are losing so many of our World War II veterans, and we must  show them our utmost gratitude each and every day.   As I mentioned, we will also be joined by veterans of the Korean,  Vietnam, Cold, and Gulf wars. They engaged in combat all over the  world. They were Humvee mechanics, military police officers, and radio  operators.   Two of our proud veterans here today served in the Korean war. One is  86-year-old Corporal Paul Clifford Lathey from Cottageville, WV. He  joined the Army in 1953 in Ripley, WV. During his time in Korea, he  served in the 15th Infantry, 3rd Division Fox Company, where he treated  wounded soldiers in MASH units. Our other Korean war veteran is 90- year-old Sergeant David Shirley Knapp, who was in the Army from 1948- 1954 and served as a combat engineer during the Korean war.   Another veteran is Charlie R. Lambert from Iaegar, WV, who served in  a variety of roles during the Vietnam war. After he joined the Navy in  1970, he served in a ``boots on the ground'' role in Thailand, served  on the flight deck of the USS Iwo Jima, and volunteered to be a member  of the Brown Water Navy or the forces that patrol shallow inland  waterways, seizing contraband and engaging with the enemy. Another  brave West Virginian who served in Vietnam is Sergeant Robert Ortiz,  from Premier, WV, who served as an infantryman in the 196th Light  Infantry Brigade, 23rd Infantry Division Americal.   We also have two veterans who served in two wars, both from Virginia.  Sergeant Jackie Thornton of Narrows, VA, who served in the Army during  both the Vietnam and Desert Storm wars, as the chaplain's assistant, as  well as, Sergeant Steven R. Mitchell of Bluefield, VA, who served in  the Army in both Operation Desert Shield/Storm and the Gulf war.   I would like to also specifically honor the youngest veteran we have  with us today, Sergeant Austin Patrick Coleman of Bluefield, WV. He  joined the Marines in Houston, TX, and served his country in Helmand  Province Afghanistan as an infantryman, assisting the Afghanistan  National Army. Another veteran of the war in Afghanistan here today is  Michael ``Doc'' Atwell of Princeton, WV. Doc served in the Navy at Camp  Dwyer in the Helmand Province. He was attached to the 1st Tank  Battalion RCT7 as a FMF corpsman.   Showing our appreciation to those who have served is something that  we should do each and every day, but today is a special day to pay  tribute and thank those who have volunteered to put their lives on the  line for our freedoms. The memorials our honor flight participants will  visit today serve as an important reminder to us all that our freedoms  and liberties come at a steep cost. However, I know our veterans will  find special meaning and potentially long-lost emotions when they tour  such touching sites.   This week's honor flight and the continued support of our veterans  would not be possible without the dedication of so many volunteers and  caregivers. I would like to thank Theresa Riggs, the JROTC Cadet from  Montcalm High  [[Page S3002]]  School, as well as the military spouses and other family members  serving as the guardians on this year's honor flight. These guardians  have selflessly given their time to travel alongside our veterans all  the way from Princeton, WV, to Washington, DC, to share this very  special journey with them.   I also commend those in the Always Free Honor Flight Network for  their dedication to providing our veterans with such a unique and  meaningful experience. Without the diligence and passion Dreama of  Denver, president of Always Free Honor Flight Network and owner of  Princeton, WV's, Little Buddy Radio, as well as Pam Coulbourne, the  coordinator of these flights, many of our veterans would never have the  opportunity to travel to Washington and pay homage to the men and women  they fought beside. Dreama and Pam launched the Always Free Honor  Flight in 2012, and every year, they continue to make this dream a  reality for many of our West Virginia veterans.   I would also like to recognize Sergeant First Class Paul Dorsey, vice  president of Always Free Honor Flight and official photographer Steve  Coleman, who have done a tremendous job of ensuring that our veterans  receive the recognition they deserve. Dreama, Pam, and Steve have also  dedicated themselves to the Denver Foundation, serving as incredible  examples of how individuals can give back to their communities.   I am filled with pride every time I meet the patriots who have served  our country, and I am so pleased to welcome West Virginia's most  courageous veterans, who are all heroes, to Washington, DC. I encourage  all of my colleagues to join me in saluting them. They truly inspire us  all as we are reminded of their selfless service. It is because of  their bravery that all Americans enjoy the greatest liberties and  freedoms in the world.   God bless all our servicemembers and veterans, God bless the great  State of West Virginia, and God bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
