 Mr. Speaker, over a month ago, on  November 14, I spoke on the impeachment hoax with points true then and  still true today.   After over a month of secret investigations into the administration,  Democrats have now decided to open these controlled hearings to the  public. This continues the deception by Democrats to mislead the  American people. It is insulting: no Republican witnesses, no counsel  by the President to participate, and full exoneration by courageous  President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.   It is sad that, instead of focusing on funding our military through  the National Defense Authorization Act passed only last week or passing  the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to create jobs, Democrats  continue, having wasted $30 million of taxpayers' money on the Russian  hoax, now proceeding with a Ukrainian hoax.   This partisan witch hunt diverts attention from the President's  successes: The unemployment rate remains at a record low; there is  record job creation; and the stock market, again, today, is thriving,  showing that President Trump keeps his promises.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
