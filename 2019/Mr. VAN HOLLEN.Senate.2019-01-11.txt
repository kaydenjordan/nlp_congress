 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today marks the 21st day of the  government shutdown, an unnecessary and shameful government shutdown.  We are now tied with the longest shutdown in American history.   A few weeks ago, the President of the United States, President Trump,  said he would be ``proud'' to shut down the government if he didn't get  his way. This is nothing to be proud of, and the harmful impacts of the  shutdown are growing by the day, growing on people throughout this  country who are being denied important government services, impacting  every American.   We just heard the other day from the Food and Drug Administration  that they are no longer going to carry out some of their food safety  inspections, putting at risk the American food supply for every  American. We heard from the EPA that they are going to be suspending  their monitoring of some toxic pollutants, also having a growing  harmful impact every day on the country and putting the health of  American citizens at risk. So that is nothing to be proud of, nor  should any of us be proud of the fact that today marks the first full  pay period in this shutdown where Federal employees are going to get no  pay. These are civil servants who go to work, when they are allowed to,  for the good of our country in all sorts of Agencies, providing  fundamental services.   Today--I know you can't read this document from there--they are  getting pay stubs, and on the pay stubs in the place where their normal  pay period salary should be, there are zeros--zeros.   I just arrived on the Senate floor from a meeting that Senator  Cardin, my fellow partner representing the State of Maryland, held in  Howard County, MD. We met with 16 Federal employees, most of whom have  been locked out of work and all of whom are not getting any paychecks.  We wanted to bring them together to hear about the impact this shutdown  was having on their lives and on their families.   The first thing they wanted to talk about was that they wanted to get  back to work to do the business of the American people. When they are  out of work, so many Americans who rely on their efforts are denied the  benefit of their work. So they emphasized the fact that their No. 1  priority was to get back to work on behalf of the American people.   We also wanted to hear from them directly about what the impact was  on them as individuals and their families because they are now getting  a big zero on their pay stubs.   One of the people we heard from was Freda McDonald. She works at  FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Administration. She has a  chronic medical condition that requires her to get treatments every  week. She said she has pretty good insurance to cover most of her  health condition, but the insurance doesn't cover the cost of her  medication fully, and she needs to get that on a weekly basis. Then, on  a weekly basis, the copays amount to hundreds of dollars. So she is  going to be squeezed right away on getting access to the medication to  treat her medical condition because she got a pay stub with a big zero  on it.   We heard from Kerri Woodridge. He works at the Office of Personnel  Management. A lot of Americans don't know what that Agency does, but  they are the Agency that has to oversee Federal employees throughout  the system. If they are not at work, the whole system begins to break  down. The first thing he emphasized was the total waste of dollars to  the American taxpayer in keeping them out of work because that just  creates even more inefficiencies throughout the entire Federal  Government when the Office of Personnel Management can't be on the job.  He also talked about the fact that he is not going to be able to make  his mortgage payments.   There are a lot of Federal employees--thousands and thousands of  Federal employees, GS-2s and GS-3s, who are literally one payment from  not being able to make their bills. Now their pay is not coming in, but  I can tell you their bills are still coming in. Their mortgage payments  are coming in, their rent payments are coming in, their medical bills  are coming in--all of those bills are coming in, even though their  paycheck is not.   Mr. Woodridge talked about the fact that with the upcoming mortgage  payment, he didn't think he would be able to make it. He has electric  bills. He spoke very passionately about his children because he has a  son who has some special needs, and in order to make sure his son can  perform well at school, the family has hired a tutor for that child,  and he doesn't think he is going to be able to make the payments to the  tutor in the coming weeks. He said: Well, the Agency said you should  get a lawyer to protect you from the creditors who are coming after you  when you can't pay your bills. Mr. Woodridge had a pretty simple  question: If I can't afford to pay my bills, how can I afford to hire a  lawyer to protect me from the people who are demanding I pay my bills  on time?   Eric Bryant, another Federal employee there, an Air Force vet, is  someone who served his country in uniform  [[Page S154]]  before serving his country in a civilian capacity for our Federal  Government. Thirty percent of our Federal employees are veterans. They  served their country in the military, and now they are serving their  country in a different way as civil servants in the Federal Government.  He said that he had called the electric company to let them know that  because he wasn't getting paid, he wasn't sure if he would be able to  pay his electric bill on time. Could they take it easy on him? The  electric company said: We want our money. Sorry, go find the money to  pay the bill on time.   I don't know if they threatened to turn the lights off or not, but  people aren't going to be able to pay their mortgages or rents or  electric bills or other bills.   There was another Federal employee who took a moment out of work. He  is actually not furloughed. He is working because he is part of the  Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, and he has been deemed  essential for the public safety. But he came there to let us know that  when his colleagues, many of them in the analytics part of Federal law  enforcement--the folks who collect DNA, the folks who are tracking  suspects, people who are tracking fugitives--when that whole part of  Federal law enforcement is furloughed and can't do their job, that puts  those who are on the job and in the line of duty at greater risk. He  said that it puts their lives at greater risk.   Of course, to the extent that we are compromising and weakening  Federal law enforcement in general, we are also putting the public at  greater and unnecessary risk every day.   We heard similar accounts from other Federal employees who were  there. We also heard from a small Federal contractor. I am sure that  all of us are hearing not just from Federal employees but so many small  businesses that provide services to the Federal Government in places  around the country, and in many cases, they are in danger of going  belly-up.   In order to deal with the shutdown and the fact that they may not get  paid as a small business by the Federal Government for their services,  they also are laying off their employees. Many of these are low-wage  employees or median-wage employees. Think about contractors who provide  food services to different government agencies or janitorial services.  Those employees are also living paycheck to paycheck. They have been  told not to come into work. We heard from one that is a nonprofit  called Senior Service America that actually helps put seniors to work  in jobs around the country. Just a few days ago, this particular  Federal contractor in Maryland furloughed--laid off--176 of their  employees. These aren't Federal employees being laid off.   In addition to that, these are Federal contractor employees who work  for small businesses that contract with the Federal Government. The  negative impacts of this are mushrooming by the day, harming families,  harming communities, and harming all of the others that also require  the economic activity from either Federal employees or small business  contractors who help at their restaurants, and that is on top of what I  talked about earlier, which is the negative impact of the denial of  important services and health protections for the entire American  public.   A lot of the concerns expressed this morning by Federal employees  also include the long-term impact. If you don't make a mortgage payment  on time, that is going to hurt your credit rating. In some cases, for  Federal employees who work for National Security Agencies, their  ability to keep their security clearance is tied to their credit  rating. When you start having your credit rating downgraded, it is  going to mean, No. 1, you don't get credit, can't pay your bills, and  it also means, in some cases, that you risk your entire livelihood, at  least in those Federal Government jobs that require good credit  ratings.   None of this is anything that the President of the United States or  anybody should be proud of. I do want to say a word with respect to the  contract employees. Yesterday, Senator Cardin, Senator Smith, Senator  Brown, Senator Kaine, and many Senators--about 30 Senators--wrote to  the Office of Management and Budget, wrote to the Trump administration,  and asked them to use their contract authority to hold harmless those  Federal service contract employees who are being locked out of work  through no fault of their own.   I was pleased that just yesterday in this body, on a unanimous basis  or by unanimous consent, we passed legislation that would ensure that  Federal employees were made whole at the end of the day because they  should not be the ones who are punished for a shutdown they had nothing  to do with.   Senator Cardin and I and others proposed legislation to ensure that  innocent Federal employees should not be the victims of a political  fight they had nothing to do with. I am hopeful that later today, the  House of Representatives will pass that legislation and the President  will sign it. That, of course, would remove a big cloud of uncertainty  that hangs over the head of Federal employees who are either working  without pay or furloughed and locked out without pay.   It, of course, doesn't deal with the fact that while Federal  employees are denied a paycheck, they are not going to be able to make  their payments on time on mortgages and rent, and they will have a  snowballing, harmful effect from loss of credit rating. There is other  legislation that has been introduced by Senator Schatz and I and others  to make sure that Federal employees aren't hurt because of their credit  impact or by people collecting bills, just as we protect servicemen and  women who are deployed overseas to make sure people can't come after  them when they are not here and not able to pay their bills. I hope we  will pass that legislation.   All of this just goes to show that while Federal employees and the  small business service contractors and a growing number of communities  that depend on that economic livelihood are being hit by the day, the  big losers are also, of course, the American people, both because of  the lack of health protections and services and because, at the end of  the day, taxpayers want to make sure they are getting services for  their tax dollars.   What are we accomplishing with a government shutdown? I must say that  when the President of the United States says he can ``relate'' to what  is happening, it is pretty clear he can't, right?   I don't know if my colleagues saw the Coast Guard statement the other  day on how you are supposed to help make do during the government  shutdown. Here is a recommendation that they provide. This is step 4 to  supplement your income. They suggest that finding supplemental income  during your furlough period might be challenging, but here are a few  ideas for adding income:         Have a garage sale--clean out your attic, basement and       closets at the same time.        Sell unwanted larger ticket items through the newspaper or       online.    Give me a break. When the President of the United States says he can  relate, I want to see the President of the United States hold a garage  sale. This is somebody who goes from Trump Tower to Mar-a-Lago and back  to the White House. He can't relate to these fellow Americans, Federal  civil servants who, when they miss a paycheck, can't pay their  mortgage.   This is why, just yesterday, Senator Cardin and I asked unanimous  consent for the Senate to act immediately on two bills that came over  from the House to reopen the government because, yes, this is the  shutdown that President Trump said that he would be proud to have if he  didn't get his way. He is certainly the initiator; he is certainly the  protagonist of the shutdown. But every day that goes by when this  Senate doesn't do what it can that is within its power to end the  shutdown, the Senate is an accomplice in President Trump's shutdown. If  we have it within our power to do our job as a separate branch of  government, then we should do it. It is not an excuse not to act  because the President doesn't like what we propose. Under article I of  the Constitution, we are a separate, independent, and coequal branch of  government.   Last Thursday, as their very first order of business, the House of  Representatives passed two bills. The first bill was H.J. Res. 1. I  have a copy of it right here in my hand. What this bill does is reopen  the Department of Homeland Security at current funding levels through  February 8, to give us all an opportunity to debate the best  [[Page S155]]  and most effective way to provide border security in our country. The  dispute here is not about whether we need border security; of course,  we need secure borders. We don't want open borders. We need secure  borders.   The question is, What is the most effective and smart way to  accomplish that? The Presiding Officer is an expert on this. I respect  the input he has provided to this body and others. We need a  multilayered approach. But the purpose of H.J. Res. 1 was to say: OK,  we have some differences over the best way to do that, but let's not  shut down the Department of Homeland Security while we debate that.  Let's keep it open at least until February 8 at current funding levels  and work that out. That is what the House sent to the Senate.   Guess what. With respect to the Department of Homeland Security, it  is identical--word for word--to what this Senate passed just before  Christmas. We passed it on a voice vote--a big, overwhelming bipartisan  vote. That vote was to keep the Department of Homeland Security and  other Departments open until February 8.   What is the justification for not having a vote in the Senate on the  same thing that we passed by voice vote just a few weeks ago? The  answer we get is: Well, the President of the United States doesn't  agree with it.   Well, that is too bad. We are a separate branch of government. If the  President wants to veto that, let him veto it. Then it comes back here.  Under the Constitution, we would have a veto override vote. But we  shouldn't be contracting out our responsibilities under the  Constitution to the President. Yet the Republican leader, the majority  leader, objected to letting us vote again on the same measure that we  voted on just before Christmas.   Senator Cardin then offered the other unanimous consent request  yesterday. That was to pass legislation to open up the other eight of  the nine Federal Departments that are closed--Departments that have  nothing to do with Homeland Security, nothing to do with border  security.   This legislation was also passed by the House of Representatives on  its opening day a week ago Thursday. Here is the kicker. The House  didn't take the numbers that the House of Representatives was proposing  in the appropriations bills for these Departments; it took the funding  levels the Senate had proposed on a bipartisan basis, and the Senate  did that on a bipartisan basis in two ways.   First of all, the full Senate voted overwhelmingly--certainly, by a  veto-proof margin--to fund eight of those Federal Departments through  the remainder of this fiscal year--so through September 30--at levels  we agreed to, first, on the Senate Appropriations Committee and then by  an overwhelming vote on the Senate floor. The other measures in the  bill the House passed were measures the Senate Appropriations  Committee, on a bipartisan basis, overwhelmingly supported.   The House said to the Senate: We are going to send you a bunch of  bills to open up the government at levels the Senate has already agreed  to, in a bipartisan way, one way or another.   Yet the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, on behalf of the  caucus, said: No, we are not going to allow a vote to reopen eight of  those nine Departments because the President doesn't want it, because  the President wants to hold all of those Departments that have nothing  to do with homeland security hostage until he gets his wall--a 2,000- mile-long wall.   The irony, of course--and the Presiding Officer knows this--is that  the President's own budget for this year was $1.6 billion. That was the  President's budget for this year.   I am happy to sit down--and I know all of our colleagues are--to work  out the best way to provide border security. As part of an overall  approach, we had barriers along parts of our border long before  President Trump was in office, but we don't want to be wasting taxpayer  dollars. As I said, even the President's budget for this year was not  requesting what the President says he now needs.   Let's be straight with the American people. It is not just $5.7  billion--or whatever it is--to build a wall. You are talking about a  2,000-mile-long wall, so you are talking about $30 billion. What the  President wants to do is to come back every year and shut down the  government until he gets his next installment on a 2,000-mile-long wall  that the experts tell us is not the smartest way to provide border  security and is certainly not the most cost-effective way.   Let us remember that the President said this was something Mexico was  going to have to pay for, not the American taxpayer. I saw him on TV  yesterday, when he was down at the border and was trying to explain  away that campaign promise: Oh, I didn't really mean Mexico was going  to pay for it directly; it was going to be indirectly.   That is just not happening. We know Mexico is not paying for this  wall like the President said. That is why, as its first order of  business, it is important for the Senate to pass the legislation that  is before us that we have already supported on a bipartisan basis.  Literally, we have the keys today, if we want to, to pass the bills  that would reopen the government and send them to the President. If he  doesn't want to sign them, at least we will have done our work as the  Senate. We would then face the question of overriding the President's  veto to reopen the government.   This is where we are now. As I said, as each day goes by, we have  Americans who are being denied more and more services. In addition to  the ones I have already mentioned, I have spoken to a lot of small  businesses that rely on the Small Business Administration for their  small loans in order to get up and running, and I have spoken to a lot  of folks in farm country who really rely on farm service credit and  farm center services. They are being squeezed very badly.   This is impacting people throughout the country as 80 percent of  Federal employees actually live and work outside of the national  capital area, and 80 percent of them are folks like the folks along the  border. There are TSA officials who are all over the country at  airports, and all of them are being asked to go to work every day  without pay. They are getting zeros on their pay stubs like the other  hundreds of thousands of Federal employees.   It seems to me this is the time for us to act. That is why I have  joined with so many of my colleagues to say to the Republican leader,  to the majority leader: Let's do our job under the Constitution. Yes,  we know what the President's position is, but what is our position? Why  are we unwilling to vote on two bills that are before us that reflect  the position this Senate has taken on a bipartisan basis already? How  can we justify to our constituents and to the people around the country  that we are unwilling to take a vote on measures that we know have  overwhelming support in the U.S. Senate because we want to somehow  reinforce the President in his own political fight?   I am very hopeful that as the days go by, the Republican leader will  decide to make sure this body--the U.S. Senate--does its job as a  separate branch of government and will take up the bills that will  reopen the Federal Government, put people back to work for the American  people, make sure Federal employees who are working get paid and that  those who have been furloughed will have a chance to go back to work on  behalf of the American people.   We have it within our power to do it today. We have it within our  power to do it any day now. I hope we will do our part to end this  shameful shutdown. By tomorrow, it will be the longest shutdown in  American history. The President of the United States may say he is  proud of it, but I hope not a single Senator in this body--Republican  or Democratic--will be proud to be here on the day in history when we  will have broken the record for the longest government shutdown. In my  view, that is a dereliction of duty, and it is certainly a dereliction  of duty for us not to do our part and use the power we have to take a  vote on the bills that are at the desk in the U.S. Senate to reopen the  government for the American people.   I see my friend, the Senator from Maine, is now on the floor. I thank  him for his leadership in this battle.   Let's do the right thing.   I yield the floor.
