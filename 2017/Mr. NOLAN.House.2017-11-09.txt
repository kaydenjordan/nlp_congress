 Mr. Speaker, the simple truth is that the rich are getting  richer in degrees unparalleled in human history in this country, the  poor are getting poorer, and the middle class are getting crushed.   And now our Republican colleagues have offered a proposal to the  Congress of the United States to make it worse. The fact is that, under  the Republican tax bill, the upper 1 percent will be getting a $1.7  trillion tax deduction. At the same time, independent reports tell us  the middle class will be getting--millions of them--will be getting an  increase in their taxes, and we will be passing on $1.5 trillion in  debt to our children and our children's children.   Mr. Speaker, this tax bill is a scam. It is traditional old-fashioned  trickle-down economics that has never worked and has been the ruination  of every great economy in every great country in the world. We have to  oppose it and stop them from succeeding in this tax scam.                            ____________________
