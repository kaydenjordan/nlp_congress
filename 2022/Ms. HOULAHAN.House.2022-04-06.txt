 Mr. Speaker, last week, I held an in-person townhall to  hear how inflation impacts our community. Too many Pennsylvanians are  making tough choices to put food on the table, gas in their tanks, and  other budgetary choices.   Today, I rise to discuss why confronting Putin abroad helps address  inflation issues here at home.   It is no secret that we live in a global market. We became acutely  aware of that fact during the pandemic. Ukraine and Russia provide us,  and the world, grain, oil, gas, and even things like fertilizer.   When we are at war in these areas or people are at war in these  areas, this impacts our economy colossally. We are again seeing how  connected we are, this time not from a global disease but, rather, from  a diseased man.   Vladimir Putin is infected, and he is inflicting untold horrors on  the people of Ukraine and simultaneously destabilizing our world  economy and order.   To fully address these rising costs and inflation in part caused by  this Russian war, our top priority has to be bringing a just, durable,  and lasting peace to this conflict in Ukraine.   The longer the war rages on, the longer it will take for our economy  to recover. That is why we must impose strong sanctions against Russia,  coordinated with our allies; we must expedite weaponry to Ukraine; and  we must return to prepandemic domestic oil production levels to meet  our domestic needs and to help bring down global market costs.   For the people of the Sixth Congressional District of Pennsylvania, I  promise to keep doing everything in my power to make sure we can  alleviate pressures that are felt at home from abroad.                            ____________________
