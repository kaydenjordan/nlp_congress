 Madam Speaker, I thank the chair of the Appropriations  Committee for yielding me 1 minute.   I rise to say, of course, everybody is going to vote for this bill. I  wish I believed that.   Madam Speaker, this bill is a demonstration of the failure of 535  adults elected by their fellow citizens to act responsibly. Obviously,  of those 535, a number have acted responsibly, have worked to get the  job done.   There are really only 12 bills that need to pass the Congress. There  are many other bills that are important bills and should pass the  Congress that I voted for and make life better for America.    How is that?    I thank the gentleman, who is my friend, and I thank him  for that.   As I was saying, this is a failure. We knew that these 12 bills have  to pass. Why? Because if they do not, government shuts down. It stops  serving the American people. It stops maintaining security and health  and welfare of our people. So we know these bills have to pass.   But notwithstanding that, year after year after year, we come to this  point where we are adopting a CR. It is really a CI, congressional  irresponsibility.   Now let me say that I generally speak of the Congress, but very  frankly, Madam Speaker, we have exercised our responsibility in this  House. We passed 9 of the 12 appropriation bills and sent them to the  Senate.                                time  1615    The Senate, Madam Speaker, has not sent a single bill to the House,  not passed a single appropriations bill through the United States  Senate. They have passed through some in committee.   I heard my friend   Tom Cole speaking earlier on the rule. He is my  friend, and he is a Member I respect. He is a member of the  Appropriations Committee and the Rules Committee. He is a Member who  respects this institution. But I disagree with him very much about why  we are at a CR. We passed overwhelmingly 75 percent of the  appropriation bills before August 1 and sent them to the Senate. They  have neither acted on those bills nor have they acted on their own  bills and asked to go to conference.   So we find ourselves at the 11th hour, as we did on September 30-- although we passed the CR a little before September 30--without having  funded the government.   The gentleman referred to the fact that we control both Houses.  Frankly, nobody controls the United States Senate. We are in the  majority by one. But, unfortunately, in the United States Senate, you  need not a majority; you need a supermajority. So the minority can  defeat the majority.   The minority can defeat the majority in the United States Senate.  That is an appalling place for our democracy to be. I have written an  op-ed in Time magazine on that issue, and it has been distributed to  many Members.   Mr. Cole made an assessment about why the CR is coming to the floor  today with just hours to go before it expires. His assessment was not  correct. The reason we have not gotten, as the gentlewoman has pointed  out, to even the opportunity to discuss a resolution of the differences  between the House and the Senate on spending levels and the objects of  that spending is because Senate Republicans have refused to negotiate  and made as a condition precedent--as we lawyers say, something that  has to happen before you do something else--that we resolve all the  riders.   Now, for any of us who have been involved in the appropriation  process for any period of time, the riders are almost always the last  items to be resolved, invariably. I served as an active member of the  Appropriations Committee for 23 years, and for the last 16 years, I  have been very much involved in working with the Appropriations  Committee to get these bills passed.   Because of the refusal to even sit down and determine how much money  we will spend overall, which is called in our jargon 302(a) numbers,  the chairman has been unable to get to a discussion of the differences  so that they could be resolved. If you can't discuss, you can't  resolve.   So for Mr. Cole, frankly, to have intimated that somehow it was the  Democrats that couldn't do it, it takes two to tango, and frankly, one  of the partners in the Senate doesn't want to tango until something  happens that almost always happens at the end.   The timing for the consideration of this CR resulted not from the  majority's focus on passing critical legislation to help the American  people get ahead, the Build Back Better Act, the infrastructure bill  which, by the way, only 13 Republicans voted for, but my speculation is  at least half of them are going to take credit for what was done in  that bill, maybe all of them. It is as a result, this failure, of the  minority's determination to slow down the work of Congress so that such  legislation is delayed.   As a matter of fact, the minority leader of the United States Senate  said exactly that. He said that he would not consider negotiating on  the CR until Build Back Better was done, which means he is prepared to  shut down the government. I think that is probably not true. I don't  think he wants to shut down the government. I hope he doesn't want to  shut down the government.   He wants to gum up the works on Build Back Better. I get that. He is  opposed to it. He doesn't like it. He thinks it is the wrong  priorities. That is an honest position to take. I think it is  incorrect, but it is honest. But don't do it by playing games with the  appropriation process.   In my view, the Senate treats the appropriation process as a back- burner issue. When we get to it, we will get to it, but we have a lot  of other things we want to do first. For the last 10, 11 months, that  is what the case has been.   To dissemble and derail the legislative process using every tool  available to them to prohibit Congress from doing exactly what the  American people are looking for us to do is not responsible. How sad.  How shameful that reality is.   I agree that it is unfortunate that we have to take up another  stopgap measure this week to keep this government operating. If it were  based upon whether this is the right thing to do in terms of substance,  I would vote ``no.'' But it absolutely is the right thing to do in  terms of process.   But the chair is absolutely right; we need to pass an omnibus. I  would hope that every Republican after, hopefully, passing this piece  of legislation today  [[Page H6888]]  or tomorrow will then address how we are going to have an omnibus, how  we are going to deal with the problems, how we are going to give the  government agencies that which they need to meet new challenges that  were not available to us a year ago and so they could not be addressed.   It is extremely disappointing that Senate Republicans are blocking  progress toward full-year appropriations that will enable our  government to serve the American people. I happen to believe that the  ranking member, Senator Shelby, wants to see an omnibus passed. I  believe that. But I believe the tactics of the Republican leadership in  the Senate are not to do so until they get what they want.   That is dangerous for our country, and it is extraordinarily  inefficient for the 2 million people who are waiting to see what we are  doing. That is what they are focused on, not the job, not the  priorities, not the dangers, but what is happening: Is the government  going to fund us on Saturday? On Saturday, are we going to be able to  operate?   There are few certainties in Washington, Madam Speaker, but one of  them has now become that Congress will not complete the appropriation  process by the start of the fiscal year. I have tried to make that  happen every year that I have been majority leader. The chair of this  committee, Rosa DeLauro, did everything she could to pass 12  appropriation bills by the August 1 deadline. If we had had any help on  the Republican side, we would have done it--any help.   Now, we have only a four-vote margin over here, so on some of the  bills that were more controversial for one reason or another, we needed  some help. I will remind my friend--and I dearly thank him for yielding  me the time. He knew it was going to be a somewhat extended discussion,  but I thank him for that. It reflects back to how this institution used  to operate, frankly, and I appreciate it. But he knows that when the  Republican side was in the majority, and they could not get the  majority of votes on fiscal issues, they looked to this side of the  aisle. We always helped and made it happen; maybe not 100 percent of  us, but a large enough amount so that the important fiscal issues would  be dealt with and passed.   Only six times over the past 20 years has Congress come within 3  months of this deadline, the end of the fiscal year.   Now, I could go on for some period of time talking about Mr. Cole. He  said the majority wasn't serious. We are very serious. We have been the  ones that opened up government after it was shut down for some 35 days  when we took over from the Republican leadership two Congresses ago. We  can do better.   For Mr. Cole to say that we were spending time pandering to the  American people by passing the Build Back Better Act or passing the  bipartisan infrastructure act, I hope he reflects upon that statement  and says, no, that was wrong. Yes, we focused on Build Back Better  because we think it is important for the American people, but we had  already passed the appropriation bills. They were already in the Senate  ready to be acted upon, and we were ready to act in response.   Madam Speaker, this is the result of the inability of the Congress to  work. The House worked. Republicans and Democrats, this House can work.  Maybe sometimes I don't agree with what it does, and maybe sometimes my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't agree with what it  does, but it works. It can pass legislation.   The Senate is not working, and it is hurting our country.   We should all resolve, however we vote on this CR, we should all  resolve, hopefully, all of us--and I am a good friend of the ranking  member, Ms. Granger. I think she wants to get this bill done. By ``this  bill,'' I am talking about omnibus, all 12 appropriation bills. I think  she wants to get that done. But I am not sure that she has been  empowered by her leadership to do so.   We can have differences, and we have a way of resolving those  differences. Ultimately, we vote. But if we keep putting it off,  putting it off, putting it off, it undermines the credibility of the  United States, the confidence that people have in our country, the  confidence that our workers have in our stewardship of the leadership  of this country, and the people's confidence. So we ought to resolve  that we stop this.   The Republicans, through Mr. Cole, have talked about a motion to  recommit. It mirrors the unserious nature of their opposition. Why do I  say that? Because their motion to recommit has nothing to do with the  funding of government. It has nothing to do with our responsibility to  ensure that government continues to work on behalf of the American  people. Rather, it would send this bill back to committee and would not  possibly be able to act in a timely fashion that some 30 hours from  now, I guess 31\1/2\ hours from now, government would shut down.   I would have understood perhaps a motion that would have said we are  going to fund government at this level, or we are going to fund this  objective and not that objective, but that is not what it did, totally  irrelevant to the appropriations process bill. They may think it is an  important issue. I get that. But it doesn't have anything to do with  this issue.   Very frankly, that is exactly what the Senate has been doing on the  Republican side, irrelevant issues, not the appropriations process. So  we find ourselves now at a time when we must pass this CR.   I am not in love with this CR, but in a world of alternatives, there  should be none for any of us. All of us should have the courage to be  responsible. Madam Speaker, all of us should have the courage to say  there is no alternative, and after we pass this bill and the Senate  passes this bill, get down to the work between now and February 18.   I would hope we could pass an omnibus appropriation bill including  the work of the gentleman from California, the gentlewoman from  Connecticut, and all the rest of us on the priorities that we want to  pursue as an American people and the investments that we want to make  in achieving those objectives. I hope we do that.                                time  1630     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, pending Senate passage of the CR tonight without  amendment, the House will not be in session tomorrow--I want to  reiterate, pending passage of the CR tonight. If the CR is not passed,  we will be in session tomorrow at 9.   If the Senate fails to act, as I just said, we will meet at 9 a.m.  for legislative business and expect to vote on some of the postponed  suspensions. Members are encouraged to keep their schedules flexible as  we work to fully fund government and prevent a shutdown at 12 midnight  tomorrow night.   Next week, on Monday, pending Senate action on full government  funding and H.R. 6119, the Further Extending Government Act, being  signed into law, the House is no longer expected to meet. This is a  change from our previously announced schedule. We will not be in  session Monday, assuming we have funded the government.   On Tuesday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning hour and 2  p.m. for legislative business.   On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning  hour and 12 p.m. for legislative business.   On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business, as  was previously scheduled.   The House will consider several bills under suspension of the rules.  The complete list of suspension bills will be announced by the close of  business tomorrow.   Additionally, the House will pass H.R. 4350, the National Defense  Authorization Act, again, a second time, to provide our troops with the  pay they deserve and our military with the tools it needs to carry out  its missions safely and effectively, keep America safe, and keep the  peace.   Again, I will reiterate that is the second time we will pass this  version. As I understand it, it will be the conference-agreed version  of the defense bill. This has been a discussion between the House and  the Senate.   The House will also consider H.R. 8363, the Protecting Our Democracy  [[Page H6893]]  Act, to reassert Congress' role as a coequal branch of government by  addressing the vulnerabilities exploited by the former President and  his enablers to weaken our democracy, undermine the rule of law, and  subvert the systems of checks and balances enshrined by the Framers in  our Constitution.   The House may also consider legislation to address the debt limit and  prevent a manufactured economic catastrophe that would derail our  recovery from the pandemic and cause needless suffering to millions of  American families.   I would reiterate that while we don't know the exact date at which  America will be unable to pay its bills, we will address this next  week, hopefully, in a bipartisan fashion.   Moreover, the House will be ready to act on H.R. 5376, the Build Back  Better Act, should the Senate amend it and send it back to the House.   Lastly, of course, additional legislative items are possible.    We have a list of suspension bills, which has been  announced and has been on our calendar for consideration. Those would  be the pieces of legislation with which we would deal, pending action  by the Senate.    Well, I think we will probably have to wait to see exactly  what is going to happen. As the gentleman knows, we have passed a debt  limit twice through this House. There has been a problem in the Senate,  and I would expect Senator Schumer and Senator McConnell will be  discussing that in the next few days.   Senator McConnell has made it very clear that he thinks that failing  to protect the full faith and credit of the United States of America  would have dire adverse consequences, so he has made it very clear he  thinks we ought not to do that. Senator Schumer has done the same.   Essentially, my answer to the gentleman is, we have passed it twice  in one form or another, so we can pass it and will pass it once the  Senate agrees on a version. The two leaders are discussing that, I am  sure. Now, I haven't talked to either one of them, but that is my  premise.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I agree with his  comments. It is my understanding, although I haven't talked personally,  but it is my understanding that introducing the conference-agreed bill  in the House, and passing it through the House will, under Senate  procedures, facilitate them resolving this issue, hopefully, in a  positive way next week.    Madam Speaker, I agree with the gentleman. We have talked  to the sponsor, and we have talked to others. I expect this bill to be  on the floor next week.    If the gentleman would yield?    With respect to the issues that I think we have broad  agreement on, the cliffs that were created on Medicare and sequester  are not good policy, and we ought to act on those. We are very seized  of that issue, and hopefully, we can resolve something next week.   The gentleman mentions doing it in a bipartisan fashion. The good  news is, and I know the gentleman will agree, that earlier this year,  we delayed to January 1 of this coming year these items, particularly  the 2 percent sequester by a vote of 90-2 in the Senate, meaning only  two people voted against it, and in the House, 384. We were unanimous  on our side, but you had the overwhelming majority on your side as  well. So by 384-38, we extended that.   I am hopeful that we will do that again in a bipartisan way because  not to do so, I think, would be very harmful to the medical community,  to the country, and, obviously, to patients that are served by the  medical community.   I am hopeful that we can resolve that as early as next week.
