 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to deliver a message to the  hard-working agriculture producers in Nebraska and across America who  feed the world.   At the end of last Congress, the House and Senate came together and  passed a 5-year farm bill that provided the certainty and the  predictability our farmers and ranchers needed during tough economic  times. President Trump signed this important piece of legislation into  law.   As a proud member of the Senate Ag Committee, I had the privilege of  working on this legislation and securing key provisions for Nebraskans.  Among these were measures that protected crop insurance, streamlined  trade promotion programs, bolstered opportunities for producers to use  precision ag technology, and unleashed broadband deployment throughout  rural America.   Because of this bill, folks in agriculture were feeling more  confident about planning for the future. Now we find ourselves in the  middle of a partial government shutdown, and there is some anxiety in  farm country as funding to the U.S. Department of Agriculture has  lapsed. In that regard, I want to provide some important updates to  producers who are concerned.   The year-round sale of E15 is critical, and it is a critical issue  for Nebraska's farmers, renewable fuel producers, and our rural  communities. Our State has 25 ethanol plants that employ more than  1,300 hard-working Nebraskans with high-paying jobs, which are mostly  located in rural communities, but for far too long, an outdated  regulation that banned the sale of E15 during summer months has held  our communities back.   Here in the Senate, I worked closely with a group of farm State  colleagues to demonstrate the benefits of higher blends of ethanol  fuel. I also championed bipartisan legislation, the Consumer and Fuel  Retailer Choice Act, to allow for the sale of E15 year-round. Our  efforts got President Trump's attention, and I was proud to support him  last fall when he announced that he would direct the EPA to initiate  the year-round sale of E15.   Through our continued efforts in the Senate and the action by  President Trump to follow through on his promise, rural America is on  the way to a major victory.   This week, some reports surfaced saying that the partial government  shutdown is going to delay EPA's rulemaking process for year-round E15.  I would like to reassure our fuel producers that this is simply not  true.   In fact, the EPA spokesman issued the following statement, saying:         This is a priority for both President Trump and Acting       Administrator Wheeler. The ongoing partial shutdown will not       impede EPA's ability to keep to our deadline.    I was pleased to learn that this rulemaking process is still on  track, and I want to make sure Nebraskans are aware of that fact as  well.   Additionally, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced he is  extending the deadline for agriculture producers to apply for payments  under the Market Facilitation Program. These payments are provided by  the USDA's Trade Mitigation Program, which was a good-faith effort that  recognized the economic hardship of our farmers and ranchers and the  problems they were facing.   I have heard from Nebraskans who have applied for this program and  who have received payments. Per Secretary Perdue's recent announcement,  the Agency will extend the application deadline for the period of time  equivalent to the number of days that the Farm Service Agency offices  were closed during the shutdown. This should assist farmers who are  interested in applying for the program but have been unable to do so  during this partial shutdown. I understand the concerns of Nebraskans  who are sincerely worried because USDA Farm Service Agency offices are  closed.   Agriculture is the economic engine of the State of Nebraska. Across  the State and in rural areas throughout our Nation, farmers are  thinking about spring planting. They want to be able to plan ahead and  make decisions about the future of their businesses. These hardships  are real, and they are impacting Nebraska families. That is why I am  continuing to have conversations with my colleagues about how we can  come together in a sensible way that properly secures our border and  ends these lapses in government funding.   Nebraskans know full well that I have long supported securing our  border because it is a critical national security issue. I have visited  the southern border, and I have spoken with our border agents. I have  seen areas where a wall is necessary and other areas where technology  or adding more border patrol is appropriate. Unfortunately, we have  seen border security, an issue that has long had support from  Republicans and Democrats, become deeply politicized.   As we continue to look and work toward a way forward, I want to keep  people updated and informed about the steps that our government  continues to take to provide certainty, stability, and peace of mind to  Nebraskans.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
