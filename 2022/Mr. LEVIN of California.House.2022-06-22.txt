 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, the substance use disorder crisis has touched almost  every American in one way or another. Too many families have felt the  extraordinary pain of burying a son or daughter, a father or a mother  who struggled with the disease of addiction.   Tragically, many families have also experienced the heartbreak and  deep frustration that comes after a loved one enters a residential  recovery home that ultimately doesn't provide them with adequate care  to get and stay on the path toward recovery.   We must ensure that residential recovery homes meet a high standard  of care and provide those who are struggling with the support they need  to recover.   We can and must do better. That is why I introduced the SOBER Homes  Act, parts of which are included in H.R. 7666, the legislation we are  voting on today. It includes $1.5 million for a Federal study of the  effectiveness of recovery housing and to identify recommendations  promoting the availability of high-quality recovery housing.   This legislation will help us better understand where these  facilities are falling short and how we can improve them to ensure  everyone in recovery housing receives the help they need and deserve.   Finally, I thank all the advocates who have been fighting so hard on  this issue. The information from this effort will save lives, which is  why I implore my colleagues to support this bill and vote ``aye.''
