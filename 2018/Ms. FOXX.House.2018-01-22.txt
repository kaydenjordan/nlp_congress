 Mr. Speaker, during times of strife and stagnation, the  most powerful tool we have at our disposal is the power of prayer.   It is with that in mind that I offer my most heartfelt prayers for  the men and women serving in uniform who are going without pay, and for  the 9 million children forgoing access to critical healthcare during  this Schumer shutdown.   House Republicans fulfilled our bipartisan mission to responsibly  fund the government, support our troops, and reauthorize CHIP for the  children who rely on the program. The reason that Senator Schumer and  Senate Democrats shut down the government is plain and simple. They  value the demands of illegal immigrants more than they value the needs  of American citizens.   It is now the third day of the Schumer shutdown and that is 3 days  too many in my book. I pray that the Senate Democrats who have shut  down our government will soon see reason and will fund the government.  Our citizens deserve better.   End the Schumer shutdown.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, by direction of the House Republican  Conference, I send to the desk a privileged resolution and ask for its  immediate consideration.
