 Mr. President, over the weekend, Iran held what its  Supreme Leader might call a Presidential election. To the rest the  world, including millions of Iranians, what actually happened was quite  clear. The regime's favored choice was selected from a limited field of  approved candidates in a carefully controlled bit of political theater.  There is no doubt this charade works as intended. The Ayatollah got a  President-elect with a record of strict adherence to his regime's  revolutionary orthodoxy. Meanwhile, former Presidential candidates who  emerged as leaders in the popular 2009 Green Movement remain under  house arrest. Like his predecessors, Ebrahim Raisi will serve as a  figurehead while the Supreme Leader and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard  actually run the show.   But even rigged elections have consequences, and the new most visible  figure in Tehran has a proven history as a hardline theocrat. For  decades, from his time on a so-called death committee in the 1980s, the  President-elect played an intimate role in the trial, conviction, and  summary execution of political prisoners and peaceful protesters. There  is no question he is an extreme hardliner, even in the Iranian context,  and now he is set to be the so-called counterpart to President Biden as  this administration reengages eagerly with the world's most active  state sponsor of terrorism.   In some circles, a looming turnover in the top ranks of Iranian  leadership is being spun as a reason for the White House to rush even  faster than it already is toward restoring the Obama administration's  failed nuclear deal. One particularly eager assessment in the New York  Times called the next 6  [[Page S4663]]  weeks ``a unique window for clinching an agreement,'' like some sort of  liquidation sale in which President Biden needs to take whatever he  can. Meanwhile, rational observers know that the fundamental reality of  the U.S.-Iranian relations certainly has not changed.   If the selection of a new hardline figurehead in Tehran sends any  signal, it is a reminder that showering the regime with sanctions  relief and expecting a change in behavior is a reckless and damaging  approach. In fact, President-elect Raisi has already said as much  himself. Iran's ballistic missile program is ``not negotiable,'' and  meeting with President Biden is not on the table.   Of course, Iranian politicians and diplomats are known to lie and to  dissemble, so we should pay closest attention to this regime's actions.  What will it actually do?   Here is the truth: Domestic political developments in Tehran don't  absolve the Biden administration of its responsibility to confront  Iran's nuclear and missile proliferation, its support for terrorism,  its abuses of human rights, and its relentless efforts to destabilize  the entire region.   If President Biden hopes to earn bipartisan support for an Iran  policy that could outlast his time in office, he needs to start  explaining how he intends to respond as Iran ramps up threats against  the United States and our closest partners in its backyard.   Remember, the thousands of rockets Hamas fired at Israel last month  were made possible by Iran. So were the precision-guided munitions in  Hezbollah's arsenal and the ballistic missiles and UAVs launched into  Saudi Arabia by the Houthis in Yemen. And the dozens of militia attacks  on U.S. interests in Iraq? Carried out by Tehran's reliable accolades.   The Biden administration has had months to develop a coherent  rationale for its eager engagement with the Iranian regime and months  to hash out a better plan than rewarding terrorist sponsors with  sanctions relief. An explanation to Congress is long overdue.                          For the People Act of 2021    Mr. President, now on an entirely different matter, later today, the  Senate will vote on whether to advance Democrats' transparently  partisan plan to tilt every election in America permanently in their  favor.   By now, the rotten inner workings of this power grab have been  thoroughly exposed to the light. We know that it would shatter a  decades-old understanding that campaign law should have a bipartisan  referee and turn the Federal Election Commission into a partisan  majority cudgel for Democrats to wield against their political  opponents. We know that it would let Washington bureaucrats direct  Federal dollars into politicians' campaign accounts--government money  for yard signs and attack ads. We know that it would let Democrats take  a red pen to election laws in each of the 50 States, neutering popular  precautions like voter ID while legalizing shady practices like ballot  harvesting across the board.   It is a recipe for undermining confidence in our elections, for  remaking our entire system of government to suit the preferences of one  far end of the political spectrum. And if they could, many Democrats  would pass it with the slimmest possible majority, even after its  companion faced bipartisan opposition over in the House. What a craven  political calculation. What a way to show your disdain for the American  people's choices.   Of course, it isn't even limited to election law. Among the most  dangerous parts of S. 1 is the way it would equip partisan regulators  to intimidate and to discourage private citizens from engaging in  political speech.   Unfortunately, this one is a familiar concept for too many Americans.  It is not hard to imagine Federal bureaucrats indulging ideological  grudges and chilling free speech. It has actually happened before. The  Nation was reminded just a few weeks ago how unable the Federal  Government can be to protect private citizens' personal information-- unable or just unwilling?    But conservatives in particular didn't need a reminder of what became  institutionalized discrimination under the last Democratic  administration. So when private contributors, nonprofit advocacy  groups, and religious organizations see that S. 1's disclosure  requirements would intentionally unlearn the lessons of the IRS's  abuses under Lois Lerner, they have plenty of reasons--plenty--to fear.   Naming and shaming is not a hypothetical concept; it has been a  concrete reality for thousands of private citizens. Today, Democrats  are asking for a green light to supercharge the intimidation machine  that makes all that possible.   We have heard this entire package described in many ways over the  years. It has been around for a while. The same rotten proposals have  sometimes been called a massive overhaul for a broken democracy,  sometimes just a modest package of tweaks for a democracy that is  working perfectly, and sometimes a response to State actions, which  this bill actually predates by many years. But whichever label  Democrats slap on the bill, the substance remains the same. It has  always been a plan to rewrite the ground rules of American politics.   By the way, no matter what far-left activists are telling our  colleagues, this most sensitive subject would not be the best place to  trash the Senate's rules to ram something through. In fact, these  issues would be the worst possible place to push through a power grab  at any cost.   The Senate is no obstacle to voting laws done the right way. I have  helped write legislation regarding our democracy that has soared  through this Chamber on huge bipartisan margins. The Senate is only an  obstacle when the policy is flawed and the process is rotten, and that  is exactly why this body exists.   Today, the Senate is going to fulfill our founding purpose, stop the  partisan power grab, and reject S. 1.
