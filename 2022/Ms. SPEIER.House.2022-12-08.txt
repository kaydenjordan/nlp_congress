 Mr. Speaker, this NDAA moves us forward in reforming the  military justice system. We took sexual assault out of the chain of  command last year in the NDAA. This year, we take sexual harassment out  of the chain, and we require trained investigators who will investigate  cases outside the brigade. Both are critical for the safety of military  personnel because sexual harassment begets sexual assault.   Suicide in the military is a crisis. This year, I visited bases in  Alaska twice that were hit hard by suicide deaths. This bill expands  the military and civilian behavioral health workforce. It authorizes  cold-weather pay and offers each servicemember stationed in Alaska a  paid trip home in 2023.   We need to increase the pay of military childcare center workers. We  have 19,000 families on waiting lists and are only using a third of the  capacity in our facilities. This bill provides for a study. I hope we  will do the right thing and make sure that these childcare providers  are making more than those who are flipping burgers at the local  restaurant. This bill also preserves crucial leave and paid travel for  servicewomen who must go to another State to receive an abortion.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this measure. I thank my committee  and the personal staff.
