 Mr. Speaker, it gives me great honor to thank our co- chair, the gentlewoman from Texas, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee,  the CBC's parliamentarian, a true constitutional scholar, and someone  who is fighting for us every day to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act,  and her co-anchor, Congressman Ritchie Torres, from New York, but he  would say the Bronx. Tonight, he is in the Speaker's chair.   I am very honored to have as our guest co-anchor today Congresswoman  Terri Sewell, another scholar, another lawyer, a person who has led us  every year across that bridge. She is known as a daughter of Selma.   Tonight is about Our Power, Our Message. As we also celebrate Women's  History Month and International Women's Day, it is fitting that our  anchors tonight are women.   I rise this evening for the Congressional Black Caucus' Special Order  hour, the first-annual John Lewis Special Order hour, on the 56th  anniversary of the Bloody Sunday march, and to echo Our Power, Our  Message. You will hear that a lot tonight.   This is a solemn moment and gives us the opportunity to speak  directly, Mr. Speaker, to the American people and reflect on the  critical importance of voting and voting rights in our country and on  why we must do everything in our power to fight attempts to curb voting  participation and continue to promote and advance voting rights.   Fifty-six years ago, our late colleague Congressman John Lewis, a  true  [[Page H1097]]  American hero, alongside hundreds of others, marched and risked his  life to protect the voice of the many. His courage, and that of so many  others, brought us the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a law passed by a  bipartisan Congress whose conscience had been shocked awake.   These Members of the Congress, Republicans and Democrats, could no  longer turn their eyes from the brutality that they witnessed on  television at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. They knew it  was time in history to come together for justice against all the  injustices.   Without the Voting Rights Act, Mr. Speaker, our democracy would be in  name only.   We are here tonight at another inflection point in this country,  where we shall decide to follow the forces of partisanship,  divisiveness, and anger, or we will do the right thing. I am so pleased  to be here today for that right thing. That right thing is for us to do  good and to make good trouble because history will judge all of us on  our good trouble.    Let me end by saying, tonight, the Congressional Black Caucus stands  here to remind you, as our late great brother, friend, and colleague  John Lewis said:         I say to the people here today, we must be prepared because       if you believe in something, if you believe in something, you       have to go for it. As individuals, we may not live to see the       end.    Tonight, through our message, the Congressional Black Caucus will  continue his fight in his name and the names of all others who laid the  foundation for the work we do. I call on all Members to do the right  thing because it is always the right time to do what is right.   Let's pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and H.R. 1  for the people.
