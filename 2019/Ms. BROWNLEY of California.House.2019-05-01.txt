 Madam Speaker, climate change is an  existential threat that requires the entire international community to  solve. The Paris Agreement was a monumental achievement, rightly  praised across the world and in Congress. The President's impulsive  decision to pull out of the agreement was one of the most dangerous  acts of his Presidency.   My district, Ventura County, knows all too well the devastating  economic and human toll of climate change, which has increased the  frequency and severity of deadly wildfires in our community.   Climate change is also a threat to our national security and military  readiness.   I am the proud Representative of Naval Base Ventura County, and I  know that climate change will increase problems with coastal corrosion  at our Navy base and other U.S. military installations worldwide. In  Ventura  [[Page H3358]]  County, the Army Corps of Engineers must replenish sand regularly or we  will lose land for military exercises, and buildings on the base could  literally fall into the sea.   As sea levels rise and the severity of coastal storms increase, these  problems will only grow more acute. Fortunately, House Democrats have  recognized these threats, and we have developed plans to address them  through the creation of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, on  which I proudly serve.   The Climate Action Now Act is our pledge to the world that many in  the United States Congress want our Nation to be a global leader in  solving this crisis. I urge my Republican colleagues to vote to protect  our children's and our grandchildren's future and our national  security. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the bill.
