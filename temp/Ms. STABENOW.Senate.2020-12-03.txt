 Madam President, first, let me join with so many of my  colleagues in wishing our distinguished friend and Senator from  Tennessee best wishes.   Thank you, Senator Alexander, for your incredible leadership and  working across the aisle. So many good things that you have talked  about are so meaningful to all of us. I appreciate the way you have  conducted yourself with the committees and with Members, and I have  enjoyed the opportunity to work with you. Electric vehicles didn't  quite get across the line this year with what we wanted to do in terms  of tax cuts, but I appreciate the chance to have been able to partner  with you. Certainly, I wish you the best in your next steps in work as  you end the year with your family. In whatever you do, I know you will  be very successful.                            ____________________     Madam President, it might be hard to believe it is  actually December. In normal times, a lot of families in Michigan would  be focused on getting ready for the holidays, and while Michigan  children might still be counting down the days until Santa arrives,  their parents have a lot bigger issues weighing on their minds.   A Michigan dad has been out of work for months and is wondering how  long his family will be able to keep scraping by in the new year after  his unemployment runs out.   A Michigan single mom whose hours have been cut and who has been  unable to pay the rent for months is wondering just how long it will be  until her family will be out on the street.   The owner of a Michigan small business is wondering if he will see  enough of a holiday boost to keep the doors open and his three  employees on the payroll.   A Michigan retiree who struggles to buy enough groceries is wondering  if it is safe to wait in a long line at her local food bank or if that  is where she will get sick.   Michigan families who have seen almost 9,300 of their grandparents  and neighbors and uncles and cousins and friends and community leaders  get sick and die from this horrible virus are wondering who is going to  be next.   The truth is that we are not just facing a health crisis right now-- we are facing an economic crisis; we are facing a housing crisis; and  we are facing a hunger crisis all at the same time. Coronavirus cases,  hospitalizations, and deaths keep rising, and we haven't even seen the  effects of Thanksgiving gatherings yet. We are seeing unemployment  claims tick up, and those are expected to get worse after seasonal jobs  will be cut in January.   Some studies have estimated that about 40 million renters in the  United States are at risk of losing their homes. There are already  10,000 eviction actions that have been filed in a number of States.  Those are 10,000 families who need to find new places to live right  now, in the winter, in the middle of a health pandemic.   We have all seen the massive lines of cars at food banks across the  country. In a normal year, the Food Bank of Eastern Michigan helps  about 14 percent of the population in 22 counties get enough food to  eat. This year, it is helping 40 percent to put food on the table.  Before COVID-19, the South Michigan Food Bank provided food to about 80  families a week. Now it is helping more than 500 families a week. This  is an emergency. These families, businesses, community organizations,  and seniors can't just wait around, hoping for a Christmas miracle.  They need help now, and it is our responsibility to do it now.   That is why I am so pleased that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle  have been working to come together on additional help. There are still  a lot of details to work out, but I am hopeful, in being part of the  process on the workings of the details, that we are going to be able to  come together on an agreement that will help families and businesses  and communities get through these tough times.   Whatever agreement we reach won't be perfect. We know that. It won't  be everything everybody wants. Yet we can't wait because time is  quickly running out. On December 26--only 23 days from now--vital  unemployment programs will expire, cutting off benefits that millions  of workers will need to be able to provide for their families.   If you are self-employed, if you are a contract worker, if you are a  gig worker, suddenly you will have zero help--zero.   Five days after that, on December 31, the Federal Reserve's emergency  lending program ends. That will cut off crucial credit that is keeping  businesses open and helping State and local governments provide  necessary services.   Also on December 31, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's  eviction moratorium expires, and the Federal foreclosure moratorium and  some opportunities for forbearance expire.   Imagine what it would be like to begin a new year with no roof over  your head or your family's, no place for your children to sleep, and no  place to stay clean in the middle of a raging pandemic.   And on January 1, millions of student loan borrowers will have to  resume their payments whether they can afford them or not.   These programs have been, literally, a lifeline for families, for  communities, for businesses during the pandemic. And while vaccines are  on the horizon and we are so happy to hear the progress, this pandemic  is far from over. Cutting off this vital help now would be like an  ambulance driver stopping 2 miles short of the hospital and making the  accident victim get out and walk the rest of the way to the emergency  room.   We need to face this health crisis, this economic crisis, this  housing crisis, this hunger crisis with seriousness and boldness.  People in Michigan and across the country are crying out for help. It  is time for this body to listen. It is time for Congress to lead.   We should not go home until we have passed at least a short-term  survival package to help Americans through the next few months. That is  our job. That is our job, and we should not go home until that job is  done.   We are the United States of America--United States of America.  Nothing is holding us back from helping our citizens other than  people's unwillingness to do it. Nothing.   We are the United States of America. There is no reason we are not  coming together, and shame on the Congress and the White House if we  don't act now to help our citizens.   There is nothing holding us back but the political will to do it, and  it needs to get done. There are many of us now on both sides of the  aisle working to do that, and we need to make sure that people lean in  together and get this done.   I yield the floor.
