 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a long- term public servant and New York-14 constituent, Linda Lauria.   On November 30, 2019, Linda Lauria, public affairs specialist, will  retire from the Social Security Administration. Linda's retirement will  mark the close of a phenomenal 34-year career that spans multiple  decades of public service.   Linda began her career with the Social Security Administration in  August 1973 as a claims development clerk in the east Bronx Social  Security office as a GS-2, as she proudly notes. Linda was subsequently  promoted to positions in the field, including service representative  and claims representative.   Linda has been instrumental in the timely resolution of several  thousand cases, eliminating barriers between our  [[Page H9157]]  most vulnerable people and their essential benefits.   Linda's outstanding contributions to the agency have been recognized  with several awards, including the Deputy Commissioner Citation and the  New York Regional Management Society's Regional Office Employee of the  Year. She has also been instrumental in helping my own district team  from the very beginning.   Throughout Linda's career, she has brought intelligence, technical  savvy, practical knowledge, and a strong commitment to excellence to  every assignment.   Today my staff, the Social Security Administration, and I thank Linda  for her dedication, passion, and commitment to our community.                            ____________________
