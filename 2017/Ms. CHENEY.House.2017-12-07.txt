 Mr. Speaker, on this historic day in this Chamber where  President Roosevelt appeared the day after the Pearl Harbor attack, I  rise to honor a World War II veteran and Pearl Harbor survivor, Mr.  Clarence Varos, who will turn 100 this weekend.   Born on December 10, 1917, Mr. Varos has served our country and State  in many ways. As a member of the U.S. Navy, Mr. Varos fought through  and survived the attack on Pearl Harbor. He risked his life in the  defense of freedom as a gunner on the USS Hyde, transporting marines in  the Pacific theater. After bravely serving our Nation in uniform, Mr.  Varos went on to dedicate 30 years of his life to the Union Pacific  Railroad.   I want to thank Mr. Varos for all he has contributed to our great  Nation and State. His sacrifice, bravery, and grit are an example to us  all. I look forward to congratulating Mr. Varos in person at  celebrations in his honor this weekend in Cheyenne. I would like to say  happy birthday to Mr. Varos and thank him for his service.                            ____________________
