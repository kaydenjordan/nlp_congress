 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, a little more than 2 years ago, with  Republican policies in place, American workers and families were  enjoying one of the best economic moments in a generation.   Unemployment was at a 50-year low. Inflation was very low at the same  time. Our economy was growing robustly, and workers were reaping the  benefits: Real wages were climbing. In fact, wages at the bottom of the  income distribution were growing faster than that at the top. In other  words, on our watch, working-class Americans were getting bigger  percentage raises than their bosses.   Under these conditions, the American people were looking forward to  the future. Satisfaction with the direction of our country was at a 15- year high. Consumer confidence was hovering near its highest level  since 2000, and small business optimism had set an alltime record high.   Republican policies helped create that environment, from cutting  redtape to passing the most comprehensive tax cuts and tax reform in a  generation.   Now, Democrats said the 2017 tax bill would not strengthen the  economy and would starve the Federal Government of money, but we  Republicans knew better. And sure enough, with our tax bill in place,  Federal revenues are at historic levels. The past fiscal year's nominal  corporate tax receipts were the highest they have been since 2007.  Individual income tax receipts just hit an alltime record high as well,  and they are on pace to climb even higher this year. Overall, Treasury  Department revenues just recorded their largest 1-year surge in 44  years.   So that is what has happened since the 2017 tax reform that Democrats  literally predicted would be ``Armageddon": tax cuts for American  families, record-setting tax revenues, and the best economy for working  families in a generation prior to the pandemic. Unfortunately, most of  our Democratic colleagues have a terrible track record when it comes to  economic policies and predictions. The tax reform they called  Armageddon preceded low inflation, high employment, and robust growth.   And what about on their watch?   Democrats setting policy on party lines decided on trillions of  dollars in reckless spending. That has bought us the worst inflation in  40 years, anemic growth, and now, on top of all of that, the threat of  rising unemployment and a possible recession.   Just as Senate Democrats were preparing to dump $2 trillion in  reckless spending on our economy, the Senate Democratic leader said:         I do not think the dangers of inflation, at least in the       near term, are very real.    President Biden said:         The risk is not doing too much. The risk is not doing       enough.    Secretary Yellen said:         [T]he price of doing too little is much higher than the       price of doing something big.    Well, they were all wrong, and American families are paying dearly  for it.   The Democratic leader claimed:         The dangers of undershooting our response are far greater       than overshooting.    And:         We cannot do too little. We cannot lock our country into a       long and slow recovery.    Well, if Democrats did not want a long recovery, mission  accomplished. A long and steady recovery with stable prices, rising  real wages, falling unemployment, and strong growth would have been  exactly what the doctor ordered, but the Democrats' policies helped  take that option entirely off the table for our country.   Instead, their decisions have fueled skyrocketing prices, a decline  in Americans' real incomes, and cornered the Federal Reserve into  having to raise rates sharply and potentially stop or reverse the  recovery altogether.   So, faced with this mess, what is our all-Democratic government  planning next? Are our colleagues admitting their mistakes and trimming  back their appetites?   Unfortunately, not--just the opposite.   Even now, with the evidence of a historic, self-inflicted policy  disaster piling up all around them, Democrats are reviving talks for  yet another party-line taxing-and-spending spree this summer. Even with  the economy teetering on the brink of a recession, even with families'  real incomes already falling rapidly on their watch, Senate Democrats  are reportedly behind closed doors, dreaming up--listen to this-- historic new tax hikes to drop on top of our economy at the very worst  possible time.   The same Democrats who wanted to pass trillions more in spending last  year now want to rush through huge new tax hikes. The same party that  spent 2021 trying to inflate their way out of inflation now wants to  spend 2022 tax-hiking their way right into a recession. You could not  invent--could not invent--a worse time for Washington Democrats to pile  on new tax hikes on our country.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
