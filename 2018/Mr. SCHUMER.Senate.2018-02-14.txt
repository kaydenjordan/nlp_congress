 Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1958 to the  language proposed to be stricken.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading  of the amendment be dispensed with.    Mr. President, as we enter the second day of the debate  on immigration, everyone should be focused on finding a bill to protect  the Dreamers and address border security that can get 60 votes. That is  the ball game.   The majority leader's desire to vote on an unrelated, partisan  immigration bill--legislation that is not only silent on Dreamers but  is silent on border security as well--is not a productive way to begin  debate.   Let's get to the crux of the issue. Let Republicans offer whatever  they want on DACA and border security, and we will do the same. The  leader supports the proposal by Senator Grassley, which is,  essentially, the President's plan. Let's vote on that first. We will  have several bipartisan bills to offer. We should vote on those too.   Democrats are focused like a laser on finding a bipartisan bill that  can pass the Senate to protect the Dreamers. Several moderate  Republicans are working toward that as well. The one person who seems  most intent on not getting a deal is President Trump.   President Trump's contribution to this debate has been to put forward  a proposal that contains a vast curtailment of legal immigration, far  outside the scope of DACA and border security, and has demanded that  the Democrats support it. Instead of making a proposal in good faith or  working with Democrats on a compromise, President Trump is trying to  force his unpopular, hard-line immigration agenda down the throats of  the American people by calling it a DACA bill.   The President's proposal, now the Grassley bill, is so extreme on  legal immigration that several Republicans have been critical of it,  including my friends from South Carolina and Arizona. Yet President  Trump somehow thinks that Democrats would be to blame for not getting a  deal on DACA because we didn't go blindly along with his partisan  plan--extreme as it is and with no input from Democrats.   That will not happen.   Only in a Kafkaesque, 1984 world could the Democrats be blamed for  the current predicament on DACA. As much as the President wants to turn  the world upside down, as much as he wants everyone to just accept what  he is saying, the American people know better. Everyone here knows that  President Trump has stood in the way of a bipartisan solution to DACA  from the very beginning. Let's take a quick look at the history.   First, it was President Trump who terminated the DACA Program last  August, not the Democrats and not the Republicans here. Unilaterally,  we are in this pickle--worse than a pickle--in this bad situation  because President Trump chose to end the DACA Program last August. That  stands out above anything else.   Then President Trump turned his back on not one but two bipartisan  immigration proposals. I went so far as to put the wall--the  President's signature campaign issue--on the table for discussion. That  still did not drive him to a deal.   Finally, now that we are working hard in the Senate to come up with a  bipartisan proposal, President Trump is just trying to gum up the  works. According to reports, President Trump may threaten to veto  legislation that doesn't match his hard-line demands--``my way or no  way'' and with no Democratic input. A statement this morning from the  White House said the President would oppose even a short-term bill to  protect the Dreamers.   So who is intent on kicking out these people who know no country but  America, who work in our factories and offices, who go to our schools,  who serve in our military? Who is intent on kicking them out? It is not  the American people, as 90 percent want to support the Dreamers. It is  not any Democrat and not a good number of Republicans on that side of  the aisle. It is just the President.   On three separate occasions, President Trump has stood in the way of  a bipartisan solution to DACA--a problem he created in the first place.  Yet the President is in this dream world. He thinks: Oh, I can blame  the Democrats for the impasse.   As I said, only in a 1984 world where up is down and black is white  could this be true. Only in a 1984 world where up is down and black is  white would the American public blame the Democrats for this. They know  where Trump stands. They know it. The American people know what is  going on. They know that this President not only created the problem  but seems to be against every solution that might pass because it is  not 100 percent of what he wants.   If, at the end of this week, we are unable to find a bill that can  pass--I sincerely hope that is not the case, due to the good efforts of  so many people on both sides of the aisle--the responsibility will fall  on the President's shoulders and on those in this body who went along  with him.   Bipartisan negotiations are ongoing and are, perhaps, very close to a  conclusion. Nothing is ever certain given the contentious nature of  this debate, but I am hopeful that Senators can put the President's  hard-line demands to the side and come up with a deal that works for  both parties. If we want to go beyond border security and the DACA  kids, let's do comprehensive reform. We did it once. It worked pretty  well in the Senate, but the House blocked it. Let's go back to it.  First, the issues at hand are the DACA kids and border security. That  is the only thing that can pass this Chamber--the only thing.   We need to push through to the finish line. There are only 2 days of  debate remaining this week. Everyone has to make a final effort to  reach consensus. That doesn't mean adding new demands or drawing lines  in the sand. It means being willing to compromise and take yes for an  answer. If we pass something, it might not be everything that either  the Democrats want or everything that the Republicans want, but it may  get the job done for the Dreamers and the overwhelming majority of  Americans who would like to see them stay in the country.                             Republican Tax Bill    Mr. President, on another matter--taxes--our Republican friends  argued that their massive corporate tax cut was not such a huge  giveaway to corporate America. They predicted that corporations would  spend the tax savings on benefits for workers. The evidence is already  mounting that those predictions were wrong. Since the passage of the  Republican tax bill, corporations have been pouring billions of dollars  into stock repurchasing programs, not into significant wage increases  or other meaningful investments in workers.   These stock buybacks--this stock repurchasing--which benefit,  primarily, the people at the top have reached a significant milestone.  Since the passage of the Republican tax bill, there have been over $100  billion in stock buybacks. As of last week, corporations had announced  twice the number of corporate share buybacks as during a similar period  last year. Let me repeat that. The number of corporate share buybacks  has doubled since the Republican tax bill passed.   Why is that so significant?   It is that share buybacks don't help the average worker. They inflate  the value of a company's stock, which primarily benefits shareholders,  not workers. It benefits corporate executives, who are compensated with  corporate stock, not workers, who are paid by wages and benefits. The  money corporations spend on repurchasing their stock is money that is  not being reinvested in worker training, equipment, research, new  hires, or higher salaries.   According to analysts at Morgan Stanley, companies that were surveyed  said they will pass only 13 percent of the Trump tax cut savings on to  workers in comparison to 43 percent that they will spend on share  buybacks. For manufacturers, it is even worse: 9 percent to go to  workers, 47 percent to share buybacks.   The Republicans made a conscious decision to give corporations and  the wealthiest Americans the lion's share  [[Page S933]]  of the tax cuts and promised it would trickle down to everyone else.  Unfortunately, trickle-down never works, and it is not what is  happening now. Corporate America is doing what is best for corporate  America, and working America is getting left behind. It goes to show  you just who President Trump and the Republicans were working for when  they crafted their tax bill. They gave corporations and the wealthiest  Americans a huge tax cut and cut out everybody else.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I modify my amendment No. 1958 with the  text at the desk.
