 Well, Mr. President, today, the Senate Judiciary  Committee continues a most historic hearing with a most qualified  nominee to the most consequential Court in all of the land.   Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is unlike any other Supreme Court nominee  in American history, but yesterday she made clear her approach will be  the same as the great jurists who came before her, ``to support and  defend the Constitution and this grand experiment of democracy that has  endured over these past 246 years.''   Her record shows that she is up to the task: a clerk for three  judges, including Justice Breyer; a Federal judge for nearly 10 years;  and a nominee who commands the endorsements of groups across the  political spectrum, including both law enforcement and victims' rights  groups.   Two days ago, a cohort of nine organizations that aid survivors of  sexual assault and domestic violence announced their support of Judge  Jackson, citing her ``mix of common sense'' and ``thoughtfulness,''  while adding  [[Page S1274]]  that ``Judge Jackson's rulings reflect the judicial consensus.''   A few weeks ago, the International Association of Chiefs of Police  also celebrated the judge for ``her dedication to ensuring that our  communities are safe and that the interests of justice are served.''   And in early March, nearly 60 former DOJ officials, including scores  of former U.S. attorneys, expressed their confidence that the judge's  appreciation for how the criminal justice system works would be a  critical addition to the Court.   Now, when the facts aren't on your side, some are tempted to change  the subject, and that is precisely what some Republicans tried to do  yesterday. Republicans showed they don't have a plan for addressing  Judge Jackson on her merits, so they expended a lot of ink and paper  pushing arguments that range from irrelevant to downright misleading.  As the judge's confirmation hearing continues today, I am confident  that Americans are going to see right through these flimsy broadsides  and focus on the judge's impressive, impressive record.   So, as we enter day 2 of the hearing, I thank my colleagues on the  Judiciary Committee who will engage seriously with the judge. I again  express my confidence she is on track for final confirmation before the  end of this work period.                                  H.R. 4521    Mr. President, on the competition bill and costs, last night, the  Senate cleared the first procedural hurdle on moving forward with jobs  and competitiveness legislation that both parties broadly support. In  fact, the vote last night was two more than the final passage a few  months ago on the Senate bill.   As a reminder, our long-term goal is to get to a conference committee  with the House to finalize a bill we can send to the President. To do  that, we must take the legislation that the House sent us, amend it  with the bill the Senate passed last summer--USICA--and return it to  the House so that they can request a conference. That is the elaborate  process the Senate requires us to do.   This legislation has been dissected and debated for well over a year  now, but the need to pass this bill really boils down to two simple  words: J-O-B-S, jobs, and C-O-S-T-S, costs. It will create more jobs by  bringing manufacturing back to America from overseas. It will lower  costs by taking aim at supply chains, address the chip shortage, and  increase innovation. Equally important, this legislation will revive  the grand tradition of American innovation that has fueled us and  helped our economy grow for much of the 20th century.   Our colleges, our universities, and our startups are some of our  country's most prolific job creators. We need to pass this bill to  strengthen each of them.   Through this bill, we will also address the chip shortage--an  especially severe scourge on American families. There is nothing  abstract about the shortage of chips. It impacts Americans' abilities  to buy cars, refrigerators, phones, and other household items.  Americans have faced long delays in finding these goods, and when they  are available, they now end up costing a lot more than they did before.  By passing bipartisan legislation that invests in domestic chip  production, we can help alleviate this vexing chips crisis.   America used to lead the world in chip production. We produced about  one-third of the world's supply. For the sake of American workers,  American consumers, and our national security, we must lead the world  again. Passing this bill is critical for achieving that goal.   Our efforts in the Democratic Senate at lowering costs extend to  other areas as well. Today, the Commerce Committee will hold a markup  on bipartisan legislation by Senators Klobuchar and Thune to reform  unfair shipping practices that are clogging up ports, diminishing  American exports, and ultimately hurting consumers. This bipartisan  shipping bill is exactly the sort of thing the Senate should focus on  because when there is a logjam at the Port of Los Angeles, the tremors  are felt by farmers in Minnesota and North Dakota, and ultimately  American consumers pick up the tab.   Chairman Murray will also hold a hearing today in the HELP Committee  on another very important issue: lowering the costs of childcare and  preschool. Today, families pay sometimes more than $10,000 per child on  childcare--more than some might pay for their annual cost for a  mortgage. Ten thousand dollars a year is simply out of reach for many  families. Not only do our kids suffer when they don't have somewhere  safe to stay, families suffer when parents can't enter the workforce,  and our country suffers as our economy's productivity is diminished.  The example of other countries that have better childcare is shown in  greater participation in the workforce, particularly by women.   I thank Chairman Murray and the members of the HELP Committee for  focusing on this issue. Today's hearing will surely inform the work of  Senate Democrats as we work on legislation we can consider which will  lower costs for the American people.                                    Russia    Mr. President, finally, on PNTR, this week, Members from both parties  must work together to take the next step in holding Putin accountable  by passing PNTR legislation approved overwhelmingly by the House of  Representatives. I believe it passed something like 224 to 8. Both  Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy are in support of the legislation.   The clearest message we can send Vladimir Putin is that we are united  in passing PNTR that will land a heavy blow against Putin's economy.  The PNTR revocation was approved by the House, supported by the  President, and would help make Putin pay a heavy price.   Time is of the essence to pass PNTR because Putin's savagery against  the Ukrainian people grows day by day and because the President is  meeting with the G7 Ministers in Europe.   On Monday morning, Putin's savagery showed itself once again.  Missiles obliterated a 10-story shopping mall in the center of Kyiv,  leaving an untold number of people dead in one of the largest attacks  on the city to date. In the south, residents of the once-thriving port  city of Mariupol fight on in what has become the most intense urban  warfare that Europe has seen since World War II and the most brutal at  Putin's hands.   In the words of one Mariupol resident:         The dead lie in the entrances, on the balconies, in the       yards. And you're not scared one bit. . . . Because the       biggest fear is night shelling. Do you know what night       shelling looks like? Like death.    That is a person who lives in Mariupol. These words should ring in  all of our ears.   It must be unacceptable for any nation so willing to slaughter  civilians as Russia to have normal trade relations with the United  States and the rest of the world, so the Senate must act quickly to  pass PNTR.   Every drop of Ukrainian blood demands a response, and the United  States has an obligation to stand behind this young democracy. Putin's  regime is wicked, and the best message we can send to him is to pass  the PNTR legislation with overwhelming bipartisan support.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
