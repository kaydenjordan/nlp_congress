 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday afternoon, Senate Democrats  finally dropped their filibuster of S. 1, the Strengthening America's  Security in the Middle East Act. It took 24 days and 4 cloture votes,  but enough of my Democratic colleagues have now voted to advance this  legislation concerning America's role in the world.   As I mentioned before, the bill would reaffirm our Nation's  commitment to Israel's security through military assistance and  cooperative missile defense, as well as loan guarantees. It would  deepen our ties of strategic cooperation with Jordan, as the security  and humanitarian ramifications of the Syrian civil war continue to take  their toll, and the legislation also includes the Caesar Syria Civilian  Protection Act, which would hold accountable those who have enabled and  carried out the butchery of the Assad regime.   But I would like to take a few moments this morning to discuss an  amendment that I plan to propose as well. The amendment I plan to  propose would expand on the legislation and take a further step to  emphasize the need for American leadership in our troubled world,  particularly with respect to our ongoing fight against al-Qaida and  ISIS in Syria and Afghanistan. My amendment would acknowledge the plain  fact that al-Qaida, ISIS, and their affiliates in Syria and Afghanistan  continue to pose a serious threat to us here at home. It would  recognize the danger of a precipitous withdrawal from either conflict  and highlight the need for diplomatic engagement and political  solutions to the underlying conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan.   We have seen the costs of a precipitous withdrawal before in Iraq,  and in Afghanistan, we have seen the downsides of telling the enemy  they can just wait us out; we will be gone on a date certain.   My amendment would also urge continued commitment from the U.S.  military and our partners until--until--we have set the conditions for  the enduring defeat of these vile terrorists. This measure would  reflect the conclusions of our Nation's military and national security  professionals. It would speak directly to our allies and reassure our  local partners who are doing the bulk of the fighting against a shared  enemy.   Simply put, while it is tempting to retreat to the comfort and  security of our own shores, there is still a great deal of work to be  done, and we know that left untended, these conflicts will reverberate  right here in our own cities.   We are not the world's policemen, but we are the leader of the free  world, and it is incumbent upon the United States to lead, to continue  to maintain a global coalition against terror, and to stand by our  local partners who are  [[Page S730]]  engaged in the daily fight against the terrorists.   My amendment would further condemn Iran for its hampering of  diplomatic efforts and its destabilizing work throughout the region. It  would call for greater consultation with the United States' allies and  partners in the region, especially Israel, with regard to future  stability we seek in a critical region, and it would reiterate the  importance of the administration's consulting and coordinating with  Congress on its long-term strategies for success in these struggles,  including a thorough accounting of the risk of withdrawing too hastily.   I am glad that, after needless political delays, our Democratic  colleagues finally allowed a first procedural vote on this legislation.   I am proud to support its provisions that concern Israel, Jordan, and  Syria, and I will be proud to offer this amendment so the Senate can  speak equally clearly on the fight against al-Qaida, ISIS, and other  bad actors that needs to continue in both Syria and Afghanistan.                                    H.R. 1    Mr. President, on a totally different matter, this week Democrats in  the House are beginning the committee process for a bill they are  saying is their party's signature priority for this Congress--their  signature priority. They are so focused on this legislation that they  have given it the ceremonial designation of H.R. 1--their top priority.   I think it more accurately could be described another way: the  ``Democratic Politician Protection Act.'' This sprawling proposal-- sprawling, comprehensive proposal--is basically the far left's entire  Christmas wish list where our Nation's political process is concerned.   What would it do? It would pile new Washington-focused regulations  onto virtually every aspect of how politicians are elected and what  Americans can say about them.   My Democratic friends have already tried to market this unprecedented  intrusion with all the predictable cliches: ``restoring democracy,''  ``for the people.''   Really? The only common motivation running through the whole proposal  seems to be this: Democrats searching for ways to give Washington  politicians more control over what Americans say about them and how  they get elected. It is an attempt to rewrite the rules of American  politics in order to benefit one side over the other.   I expect I will be talking about the ``Democratic Politician  Protection Act'' here on the floor for a long time, but I wanted to  just take a few minutes today to give my colleagues a quick tour--just  a quick tour through a few of its components.   To begin with, Democrats want to make the Federal Elections  Commission a partisan institution. Since Watergate, the FEC has been a  six-member body. Neither party gets more than three seats--neither  party. After all, the reason for that is this is a Commission with the  sensitive duty of regulating Americans' speech--Americans' speech about  politics and campaigns themselves.   The FEC should not be a weapon that one political party can wield  against its rivals, but the legislation the Democrats are moving  through committee would throw away--throw away--the bipartisan split.  It would reduce the FEC to a five-member body and--listen to this--let  sitting Presidents pick the majority--let sitting Presidents pick the  majority. Obviously, this is a recipe for turning the FEC into a  partisan weapon.   Democrats also empower the newly partisan FEC to regulate more of  what Americans can say. That 3-to-2 FEC would get to determine what  they subjectively see as ``campaign related,'' a new vague category of  regulated speech.   There would also be new latitude to decide when a nonprofit's speech  has crossed that same fuzzy line and subsequently force the publication  of the group's private supporters.   All of this appears to be custom built to chill the exercise of the  First Amendment and give Federal bureaucrats and the waiting leftwing  mob a clearer idea of just whom to intimidate.   And this just scratches the surface of this proposal. The House  Democrats are also eyeing an expensive new set of taxpayer subsidies  for political campaign consultants. They want a new six-fold government  match for certain types of political contributions--a new federally  funded voucher program to line politicians' pockets with even more  taxpayer dollars, plus--listen to this. That wasn't enough--taking our  tax money to spend on attack ads and bumper strips and the like. Listen  to this: 6 additional days of paid vacation for any Federal bureaucrat  who decides they would like to hover around a polling place while  Americans cast ballots.   So the new taxpayer subsidies don't even pass the laugh test, but  other aspects of the bill are even more disturbing. Perhaps most  worrisome of all is the unprecedented proposal to federalize our  elections, giving Washington politicians even more control over who  gets to come here in the first place.   Hundreds--literally hundreds--of pages are dedicated to telling  States how to run their elections, from when and where they must take  place to the procedures they have to follow, to the machines they have  to use.   Democrats want to import the inefficiencies of State and Federal  bureaucracy to ballot boxes and voter rolls, while making it harder for  States and localities to clean inaccurate data off the voter rolls,  harder to remove duplicate registrations, ineligible voters, and  errors, and harder to check every box Washington Democrats demand  before allowing you to pick your representatives.   Provision after provision would make it easier for campaign lawyers  to take advantage of disorganization, chaos, and confusion. Yet the  proposal does practically nothing to combat the real live voter fraud  that does happen right before our eyes.   It is suspiciously silent on the murky ``ballot harvesting''  practices that recently threw North Carolina's Ninth Congressional  District into total chaos. There are pages and pages rewriting election  law but nothing on this actual problem, perhaps because similar  practices are perfectly legal in California--perfectly legal--where the  Democratic Party made big gains in the House just last November.   So like I said, this has just been an introductory tour I am giving  this morning--just an introductory tour. This sprawling power grab  clocks in at 570 pages--570 pages. Seemingly every one of these pages  is filled with some effort to rewrite the rules to favor the Democrats  and their friends.    I have to say this: Our colleagues across the Capitol know what they  are after. So I am going to continue to shed light on these far-left  proposals many mornings. I want to make sure the American people  understand what this is all about. I want to assure the American  people, right from the outset, that my colleagues and I will fight to  prevent this one-sided power grab. It may pass the House, but not the  Senate.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, at 3 o'clock p.m. today, all postcloture  time on the motion to proceed to S. 1 expire and the  [[Page S731]]  Senate proceed to a vote on the motion to proceed to S. 1.    For information of all of our colleagues, the vote  will be at 3 o'clock.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 65.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading be dispensed  with.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk  for Senate amendment No. 65.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 12 noon,  Wednesday, January 30; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, that  following leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of S. 1 for  debate only.    Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:17 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, January 30, 2019, at 12 noon.
