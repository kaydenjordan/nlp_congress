 Madam Speaker, in preparation for reauthorizing the farm  bill in 2023, I rise today to deliver the first installment of my farm  bill impact series where I will be highlighting the various aspects of  the farm bill that I think deserve Congress' awareness and support.   If America is going to thrive, the people who feed, fuel, and clothe  America must thrive, and the farm bill contains certain programs that  have been critical to the success of agricultural producers in my  district. This week, I want to speak about two of those programs that  fall within the trade title of the farm bill.   Each year, $140 billion worth of agricultural products are exported.  My State of Kansas is known as the Wheat State, and 50 percent of all  wheat sold in the United States is exported. So Congress must think  critically and carefully about the international components of the  Trade title. Trade programs, which have longstanding records of success  in America, represent the partnership between the  [[Page H1020]]  public and the private sectors of our country. These programs are  essential because they spearhead innovative market access, new market  development, and promote agricultural sales overseas.   Through the Market Access Program, or MAP, U.S. agricultural trade  associations, cooperatives, State regional trade groups, and small  businesses cooperate to share the cost of overseas marketing and  promotional activities. MAP reaches virtually every corner of the globe  helping build markets for a wide variety of U.S. farm and food products  including dairy, wheat, grain, beef, soybean, and sunflowers that come  from my district.   The Agricultural Trade Promotion program or, ATP, was created in 2018  to help U.S. agricultural exporters develop new markets and mitigate  the adverse effects of other countries' tariff and non-tariff barriers.  The ATP supports consumer advertising, public relations, point-of-sale  demonstrations, trade fairs and exhibits, market research, and  technical assistance for farmers, ranchers, and our agriculture  producers.   I support whatever directly benefits farmers, ranchers, and  agricultural producers in this country because they are the lifeblood  of America. They keep us food-secure, and therefore free and self- determining as a nation. That is why I support these trade programs  within the farm bill and why I am bringing awareness to them now, to  ensure that they remain intact for the 2023 farm bill.   I also support these programs as a fiscal conservative because they  are a great return on investment for all Americans.   I will be back on the floor soon to deliver another installment of my  farm bill impact series and highlight more programs and titles within  the bill that I believe Congress must understand and support to ensure  that agriculture continues to thrive in Kansas and in America.                        Honoring Local Law Enforcement     Madam Speaker, I stand today to recognize the dedication of  law enforcement officers on the thin blue line, and condemn calls to  defund, disband, dismantle, or abolish the police.   No one dislikes bad police officers more than good police officers.  While some people are quick to share negative examples of law  enforcement, they fail to acknowledge the multitude of men and women  who bless our country with self-sacrificial care. Police officers are  the glue that holds communities together. They put their lives on the  line in the morning, and they go to their children's basketball games  in the afternoon. Most of us cannot even comprehend the burden of  responsibility that they bear for us and our families.   Today, I will share a story about an officer in my district who  exemplifies the very best qualities of Kansas law enforcement.   Drew Francis started his career in law enforcement 20 years ago as a  police officer at Dodge City Police Department. Since then, he has  served in patrol operations, investigations, and now, police  administration as Dodge City's Chief of Police.   Recently, a woman approached Drew and reminded him of a time earlier  in his career when he was dispatched to help her. She had been a victim  of repeated domestic violence, and when Drew arrived at her house, she  remembered that he took the time to talk with her about the importance  of removing herself and her children from the cycle of violence. The  woman said that Chief Francis inspired her to make this change, and she  felt that Drew had actually saved her life.   This particular story is an example of the little things that police  officers do daily, the positive impact of which may never be fully  comprehended.   In honor of these individuals who put their lives on the line for our  safety, I have cosponsored several pieces of pro-law enforcement  legislation, including a resolution condemning calls to defund the  police; the Protect and Serve Act, which enhances penalties for anyone  targeting and attacking law enforcement officers; as well as the David  Dorn Back the Blue Act, which supports State and local police  departments; and also, a resolution designating National Police Week.   I am so proud to represent a district where police officers like Drew  Francis live and work. America must stand in support of those who  protect and serve us, our law enforcement officers.                            ____________________
