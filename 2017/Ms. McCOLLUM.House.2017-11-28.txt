 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3115,  the Superior National Forest Land Exchange Act of 2017. This bill  mandates an exchange of more than 6,600 acres in the Superior National  Forest for the construction of a massive open pit sulfide-ore copper  and nickel mine.   This project is controversial with the majority of Minnesotans who  oppose the toxic sulfide-ore mining because it is a threat to our water  quality, public lands, and outdoor recreation in our State.   This legislation also raises serious due process concerns. There are  four pending lawsuits challenging the land exchange based on existing  environmental laws and concerns about the appropriate appraisal values.   Federal courts are still considering these suits, but this  legislation undermines the proper judicial review to expedite the  construction of the PolyMet mine.   Finally, this bill ignores the treaty rights of the Fond du Lac Band  of Lake Superior Chippewa, a federally recognized Tribal nation. The  Fond du Lac Reservation is downstream from the proposed mine site, and  the Tribal chairman has told Congress this mine will, and I quote the  Tribal chairman, ``pose a direct threat to the water and the fish, the  game, and the wild rice on which the Tribe depends.''   The National Congress of American Indians also strongly opposes this  legislation. H.R. 3115 undermines legal due process, environmental  safeguards, and the treaty rights of our Native American brothers and  sisters, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 3115.
