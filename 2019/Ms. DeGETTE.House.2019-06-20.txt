 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the en bloc  amendment and to offer my environmental justice amendment to H.R. 3055.   This amendment would require that the EPA identify 100 communities  across the country that are suffering from especially egregious  violations of environmental law and clean them up. It would require the  EPA to study what  [[Page H4950]]  happens when communities experience multiple sources of pollution and  then come up with better ways to protect them going forward. The  amendment has one simple goal, to ensure that every American has clean  air to breath, safe water to drink, and access to food that is free of  toxins.   While the goal may sound simple, the harsh reality is that we as a  nation have been failing to provide these staples of life to too many  communities for far too long. When we fail to protect our environment,  it is often the poorest among us who suffer the most. When we allow  pipes to become contaminated or when we allow companies to spew more  toxins into the air, it is usually lower income communities and  communities of color that get hurt the most. This amendment is for  them.   These communities include communities like Elyria Swansea and  neighboring Globeville which are neighborhoods in the northern part of  my district.   The people in these communities experience a wide range of health  problems on a daily basis, like throat irritation and watery eyes,  which are likely linked to their constant exposure to a long list of  toxins in the air. Whether it is hydrogen cyanide, whether it is other  kinds of waste or smog-causing pollutants, these people suffer every  day.   Mr. Chairman, I urge the Members to support my amendment and let  these communities be remedied.
