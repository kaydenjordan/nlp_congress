 Mr. Speaker, one of the greatest threats to free  speech is the ongoing politicization of online platforms.   Some, which have millions of users, have allowed liberal interest  groups to determine what content is available to the public. A recent  example is the Southern Poverty Law Center being allowed to censor  content that they deem hate speech.   The SPLC has a ``hate map'' that lists over 900 organizations. These  include pro-life, religious freedom, and border security groups, all  popular with the American people and all unfairly targeted by the SPLC.   Why do online platforms empower the SPLC to suppress conservative  views? There is only one answer: They want to promote their liberal  agenda even if it means stifling free speech.   This is a clear and present danger to democracy, and it represents  another effort to control what the American people hear and see.                            ____________________
