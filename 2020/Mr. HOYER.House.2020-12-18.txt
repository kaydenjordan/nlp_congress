 Mr. Speaker, the Republican whip and I have been  discussing where we are and to bring Members up to speed on what status  we have for today and the next few days.   Mr. Speaker, as everybody in the House knows, and America knows, as  of midnight tonight, the government will run out of authority to  operate and run out of funds, authorization, to be spent. As a result,  everybody is working very, very hard on both sides, the Senate and the  House, to try to come to agreement not only with respect to funding of  the government, but also with respect to the response to COVID-19 and  the pandemic that afflicts our people and has afflicted our economy in  a very negative way. So we are trying to get to an agreement, trying to  get paper done.   Mr. Speaker, I have told the Republican whip that we intend to ask  for a recess until 5 o'clock this afternoon, which would give us 3 more  hours to work on both the discussions. And I just got off the phone  with the Speaker, who just got off the phone with Senator McConnell,  and so we are hoping that, in the next 3 hours, we will have a clearer  picture of where we are.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise),  my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   For the general Membership, I would urge them, however, to keep  tonight free, tomorrow free, Sunday free, and such days thereafter as  we may need--and I hope we do not need any of those days--so that we  can, A, pass funding for the balance of the fiscal year until September  30 of next year, and that we can give the kind of relief that, frankly,  Mr. Scalise and I have been talking about for the last 3 weeks, for  small businesses, people on unemployment insurance, people who are  having trouble putting food on their table, transportation systems that  are about to shut down, and other relief that both sides are trying to  come to an agreement on.   Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member to keep their schedule free,  essentially, for such days as it takes to accomplish those two  objectives.   Unless the gentleman wants to say something further, I yield back the  balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to notify all the Members, and we will  certainly do that by email as well, that the negotiators who are trying  to come to an agreement between the two parties, and the House and the  Senate as well, are still working very hard to reach agreement both on  the omnibus so that we will be able to fund the government through  September 30 of this coming year and on the response to COVID-19, both  from a health standpoint and from an economic standpoint. We are  hopeful that they will reach agreement in the near future. They have  not reached one yet. There are still some significant issues  outstanding.   In light of that, I am announcing that there will be no votes  tomorrow. Even if an agreement were reached late tonight, the  administrative work necessary to memorialize that agreement in a bill  would take at least 18 hours or thereabouts, so that the first--next  votes that would be anticipated would be at 1 p.m. on Sunday.   This is a change. Some people had heard 2, and I had used 2, but we  are accelerating that to 1 p.m. on Sunday.   Members will receive 2 hours' notice for that vote, so that would  mean, if it is at 1 p.m., you will receive a notice at 11 a.m. That  ought to give time for Members, obviously, most of whom are going to be  staying in town if they don't live close by, to go to worship and then  come to the House floor.   But no votes before 1 p.m. on Sunday, this coming Sunday, and notice  will be given 2 hours prior to 1 p.m., so by 11 a.m.                            ____________________
