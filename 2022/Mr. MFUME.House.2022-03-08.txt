 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Scott for yielding,  and for also working so closely with Representative Adams to get us to  this point.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know how we got here, except that I know that we  can't, as a Nation, stay at this point. There is no reason that Black  colleges and universities, and the students that attend them, ought to  be threatened in this sort of way with this sort of almost impunity by  racists who think that they can do that and that there will not be a  response.   I happen to be chair of the Board of Regents at Morgan State  University, a historically Black college, founding itself 4 years after  Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, and has turned out, over  that period of time, thousands of bright young people who have come out  all over the country and are serving in different capacities.   In my State of Maryland, whether it was Morgan State University, or  Coppin State University, or Bowie State, you cannot imagine the sense  of uncertainty that students had, knowing that they were under threat  and that at any minute something could, in fact, happen.    Mr. Speaker, for them who are the extensions of a race of  people who have suffered, endured, and survived two centuries of  slavery, oppression, deprivation, degradation, denial, and  disprivilege, none of them should have to matriculate in this country  at an institution of higher education under those conditions simply  because they are Black.   I strongly urge this condemnation to be approved by this body.
