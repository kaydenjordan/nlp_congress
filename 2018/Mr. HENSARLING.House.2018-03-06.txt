 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 747, I call  up the bill (H.R. 4607) to amend the Economic Growth and Regulatory  Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 to ensure that Federal financial  regulators perform a comprehensive review of regulations to identify  outdated or otherwise unnecessary regulatory requirements imposed on  covered persons, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, before proceeding to the bill before us in the House,  not unlike yourself, I am a proud Texan--in my case, a fifth-generation  Texan.   In listening very carefully to the gentleman from Texas, Judge Poe, I  do wish to remind all my colleagues that it was this day in 1836 that  brave men in Texas took on the minions of tyranny at the Alamo. And  although they lost that battle, they inspired their nation at the time,  Texas, that would later become part of our Nation. So, on this day that  is special to all Texans, it should be special to all Americans.   We remember the cradle of liberty. Remember the Alamo. God bless  Texas.                                time  1230    Mr. Speaker, otherwise, I rise also, today, in support of H.R. 4607,  which is a very important piece of legislation brought to us by a very  hardworking member of the Financial Services Committee, the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk).   It is a bill that helps address the burden of unnecessary,  duplicative, and outdated regulations that too often have imposed cost  on our community financial institutions that ultimately make credit  more expensive and less available to our constituents. It passed out of  our committee with a very strong bipartisan vote of 38-17, and I  congratulate him for his bill.   Specifically, Mr. Speaker, this bill requires that all of the  prudential financial regulators that now include the CFPB and the NCUA,  the National Credit Union Administration--it ensures that all of our  financial regulators, not just some, but all, will participate in the  Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, known as  EGRPRA, a law that dates back to the Clinton era, and this ensures that  our agencies review all rules that are prescribed by themselves that  impact our insured financial institutions.   The purpose of this review, again, is to reduce regulation that is  proven overly burdensome, duplicative, or outdated, while maintaining  our safety and soundness standards. And, again, Mr. Speaker, all this  is is a review. It ensures a review.   Additionally, H.R. 4607 will require that these agencies meet every 7  years for a comprehensive regulatory evaluation, as opposed to the  current 10-year standard. This is especially important. I salute the  gentleman from Georgia for his leadership, because we have seen our  financial sector of the economy suffer under the weight, the load, the  burden of regulation, particularly because six of the seven heaviest  regulatory years occurred under the last administration; so we need a  more thorough review of these regulations. And requiring our Federal  agencies to simply review their actions in a transparent manner on a  more frequent basis, it is simple; it is fair; it is straightforward;  it is wise.   Mr. Speaker, a healthy financial system that provides equal  opportunity to all Americans to achieve financial independence can only  exist if we have smart regulation. And the explosive growth of  regulation, following the enactment of Dodd-Frank, has made it  significantly harder for our community banks and credit unions to serve  their customers and members.   And, in fact, the complexity and cost of this regulatory burden has  forced many of them out of business or has forced them to cut back  services to their customers and members, and it is one of the reasons  why, on average, we continue to lose one community bank or credit union  a day, or every other day, in America. This should not be happening.   Ultimately, Mr. Speaker, it is not the banks and credit unions we are  so concerned about. It is their customers. It is customers like  Missouri mom, Michele, who explained to us how frustrating it has been  for her 20-year-old daughter, with a full-time job, to get a loan to  buy her first car. And, again, her daughter has a first-time job. And  as Michele explained to us: ``It's a catch-22. You need credit to get  credit, but no one will give you the credit to begin with. I would like  to see our young adults be able to build the credit they need so they  can have a decent future.''   Mr. Speaker, it is for people like Michele and her daughter that we  need this regulatory review. It is why we need the bill from the  gentleman from Georgia. These are the people we are trying to help.   Like Anne in Wisconsin, who was trying to get a loan to remodel her  attached garage when her son was born, and she said: ``My husband and I  have very high credit scores, and we have equity in our home, but  because my husband has a seasonal job and finds other employment in the  winter, the many banks we contacted rejected our loan request. They  base that on our annual income only on the job he was currently in and  said it was part of the new regulation.''  [[Page H1384]]    Well, of course it is, Mr. Speaker. That is why they need to be  reviewed. It is people like Anne in Wisconsin we need to help.   Or Dan, a Navy veteran from Illinois, who actually had to close  down--close down the small auto finance company he started with his  wife 25 years ago, and he had to close it down because of new Federal  regulation. He explains: ``Large companies can afford a separate legal  department to deal with these issues and the myriad of new regulations.  A small business like ours cannot. We had to make a decision. It was  just not worth the risk to continue operations in this antibusiness  environment.''   So, Mr. Speaker, it is people like Michele, it is people like Anne,  it is people like Dan who deserve the opportunity to have credit for  their homes, their autos, their small businesses, and so we must ensure  that all of our Federal regulators--all of our Federal financial  regulators take a thorough comprehensive review of their regulatory  burden so that we can continue to support the people who need credit.   H.R. 4607, again, has garnered strong bipartisan support. It is  practical; it is common sense; and I urge all of my colleagues to adopt  it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), a very hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee and the author of H.R. 4607.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who is the chairman of the Small Business Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton), who is vice chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), who is yet another hardworking member of the  House Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer), who is a Democratic member of the  Financial Services Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from New Jersey an  additional 30 seconds.   Mr. GOTTHEIMER: It requires regulators to consider tailoring  regulations when appropriate. In short, the Comprehensive Regulatory  Review Act will cut bureaucratic red tape and help our economy thrive  without putting consumers at risk.   There should be nothing partisan about helping entrepreneurs and  businesses of all sizes grow, create jobs, and expand the economy. With  this measure, Democrats and Republicans join together to ensure  outdated, unnecessary, and burdensome regulations are eliminated or  reformed to better fit the needs of individual financial institutions,  which ultimately saves Americans money, helps consumers and families  grow--and businesses, too--and it protects, always, American consumers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Budd).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), who is a real leader on our committee for  commonsense regulation and the chairman of our Financial Services  Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to my friend on the other side  of the aisle. Again, her comments were very heavy on thematics, very  heavy on extraneous material. Unfortunately, it was a little light on  the facts of H.R. 4607.   The text of the bill is 3\1/2\ pages long; so it doesn't take very  long to read. But I remind all of my colleagues that this is common  sense. In and of itself, this bill changes no rules. All it does is  tell our regulators that every 7 years, why don't you look at what you  have done and publish a report.   If you want to change any rule, you have to go through the formal  rulemaking process to repropose a rule, to get public comment. So,  again, in and of itself, it changes no rules. I almost want to ask my  friend on the other side of the aisle: What is she scared of? What is  so wrong with simply looking at the rules that have been promulgated to  see if they are actually working? Are they helping our constituents?  Are they making economic opportunity more available for all?   What is so odd is, the original EGRPRA legislation that dates back to  the Clinton era was overwhelmingly supported on both sides of the  aisle.   So what the gentleman from Georgia is doing in H.R. 4607 is simply  saying all financial regulators, including the National Credit Union  Administration and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which  really didn't even exist in the Clinton era, ought to do the same  thing. They are saying, instead of doing it every 10 years, let's do it  every 7 years. Just take a look and report. That is all it is.   It is a self-reporting requirement, which I think, Mr. Speaker, is  why this has already been supported overwhelmingly on a bipartisan  basis in the House Financial Services Committee.   So with all of the various scare tactics and horror stories that we  have heard from the other side of the aisle on a mere reporting  requirement, again, I ask, Mr. Speaker: What are they scared of?   What we are ultimately trying to do here is make sure that the  regulatory burden is not such that it harms the very people I spoke  about earlier in my opening comments: that it doesn't hurt Dan, a Navy  veteran from Illinois who, because of the regulatory burden, was forced  to shut down his small business; that it doesn't hurt Anne in  Wisconsin, who is just trying to get a loan to remodel her garage; that  it doesn't hurt Michele and her daughter in Missouri. Her daughter was  just simply seeking a car loan to buy her first car.   These are the people whom we are trying to help.   And by the way, all banks--small, medium, and large--are lending to  businesses and to consumers, and we want them to do that in a robust  but responsible way.   So, from time to time, let's look at the regulations and ensure that  they are still helping us achieve equal financial opportunity for all  so that our constituents can achieve their share of the American Dream,  that they can achieve financial independence.   This received strong, bipartisan support, Madam Speaker, in the House  Financial Services Committee. It ought to receive strong, bipartisan  support on the House floor.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to vote for and adopt H.R. 4607,  and I yield back the balance of my time
