 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this en bloc  motion that contains a bipartisan amendment that I led with  Representatives McCaul, Eshoo, Stefanik, Stevens, Joyce, and Katko to  help reinforce U.S. technological leadership.   As the global economy becomes more interconnected, it is essential  that the United States maintains the ability to produce the hardware  that our high-tech economy depends on.   Semiconductors are fundamental components of our phones, medical  devices, and the future of our quantum computing. This amendment  authorizes $1.2 billion for research and development that allows our  domestic industry to continue to innovate and thrive.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative McCaul for working with me on  this amendment and our CHIPS Act, and I urge my colleagues to support  this motion.
