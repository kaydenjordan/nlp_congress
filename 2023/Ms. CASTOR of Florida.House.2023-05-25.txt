 Madam Speaker, I rushed down to the floor  because I just read a headline that said that the Republicans are not  headed to negotiations today. In fact, all of the Republicans have quit  here on a Thursday morning and have left town.   Meanwhile, back home in Tampa, I know that one of my neighbors is  expecting their Social Security check at the end of next week, and that  is at risk.   I have another neighbor in St. Petersburg on a fixed income watching  their retirement savings, expecting machinations in the market and  worrying about the ability to pay rent.   Republicans have left Americans wondering: Why do you want to inflict  job losses?   Why do you want to risk a recession?   Meanwhile, Democrats are here because we want to avoid those kinds of  things. We want to avoid job losses, avoid falling into a recession,  avoid harm to veterans, avoid harm to our neighbors, higher costs, harm  to our small business owners.   Enough of this manufactured MAGA crisis. We have to put people over  politics for a change and stop this careening from one crisis to  another, with chaos inflicted by the GOP.   Put people over politics. Get back to work. Let's fix this for the  people we represent.                            ____________________
