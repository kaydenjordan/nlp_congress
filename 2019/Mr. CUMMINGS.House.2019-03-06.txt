 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1, the  For the People Act.   Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend, Congressman   John Sarbanes, for his  vision and for his tenacity in introducing this bold and historic  reform package. He has given his blood, his sweat, and his tears, and I  thank him.   This sweeping legislation would clean up corruption in government,  fight secret money in politics, and make it easier for American  citizens across our great country to vote.   I have heard this bill dismissed as a ``power grab.'' In fact, it is  a power restoration. H.R. 1 would restore power to the American people  and break the hold of special interests.   For example, title VIII includes a bill that I introduced, the  Executive Branch Ethics Reform Act, which would ban senior officials  from accepting bonuses and other payments from private-sector employers  in exchange for their government service.    H.R. 1 would have prevented Gary Cohn, President Trump's former  economic adviser, from receiving more than $100 million in accelerated  payments from Goldman Sachs when he left to lead the Trump  administration's efforts to slash corporate taxes.   Title VIII also includes another bill that I introduced, the  Transition Team Ethics Improvement Act. This legislation would require  Presidential transition teams to disclose to Congress the team members  they submit to receive security clearances and which team members  receive security clearances.   This legislation also would require transition teams to have ethics  plans in place and to publicly disclose those plans.   H.R. 1 gives people the power to freely exercise their right to vote.  I have said quite often that when my mother died, at 92 years old, her  last words were not, ``Elijah, I love you.'' This former sharecropper,  her last words were: Elijah, don't let them take away our right to  vote.   I believe that we should be doing everything in our power to make it  easier, not harder, for American citizens to exercise their  constitutional right.   Unfortunately, some oppose our efforts. They think we should make  voting more difficult by cutting back on early voting, eliminating  polling places, and taking other steps to reduce the number of people  who do vote.                                time  1615    In some cases, they have even engaged in illegal efforts to suppress  the vote and target minority communities. Just look at what happened in  North Carolina.   In 2013, State legislators requested data broken down by race on how  residents engaged in a number of voting practices. They then used that  data to enact legislation that restricted voting and voter registration  in five different ways that disproportionately affected African  Americans.   You do not have to take my word. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals  found that this legislation was enacted with discriminatory intent. In  fact, the Fourth Circuit said that in North Carolina legislation  targeted African Americans with--they said this--``almost surgical  precision.''   We are better than that.   In Georgia, we saw actions just last year by officials to remove  people from the voter rolls and prevent them from registering in the  first place. H.R. 1 would establish procedures to automatically  register people to vote, extend early voting, absentee voting, and give  additional funding to States to maintain polling sites so that they can  do their job.   This legislation would help make it easier for hardworking Americans  to find the time to vote by making election day a Federal holiday and  encouraging the private sector to follow suit.   Federal court after Federal court, there are ongoing efforts to stop  people from voting. So I will fight until my death to make sure that  every citizen, whether they be Republican, Democrat, Independent, Green  Party, or whatever, has the right to vote.
