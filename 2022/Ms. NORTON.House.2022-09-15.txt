 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding to me.  And I appreciate her correction of the prior speaker on the other side  who repeatedly said that Federal employees could not be fired, ignoring  the figures that the Chair had given of 10,000 employees fired last  year.   This is a civil service system. It is not a private system. It rules  under the Constitution and under the rule of law. That is the  difference between working for the Federal Government and working for a  private employer.   I speak in strong support of the Preventing a Patronage System Act-- note that word--Patronage System Act, of which I am a cosponsor.   This bill would prevent a future President from reimposing the  schedule F scheme that would move tens of thousands of career employees  into positions that would essentially be a new form of political  appointment. The nonpartisan, apolitical civil service system is  critically important to how our government functions.   President Trump attempted to--former President Trump attempted to  illegally create this new class of Federal employees, in contravention  of the Constitution and, more specifically, these employees' rights.                                time  1300    We need to encourage the best to join the Federal Government, and  this type of ploy by the prior administration would hinder that effort;  instead, allowing an administration to engage in a patronage system.  The government needs experts, not political cronies.   I appreciate Congressman Connolly for introducing this important  bill, and I am pleased to be able to speak in support of it.    Madam Chair, I missed one committee of the whole vote due  to committee activity. Had I been present, I would have voted ``YEA''  on rollcall No. 436.
