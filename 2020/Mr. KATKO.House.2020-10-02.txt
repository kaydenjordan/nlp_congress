 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Adeline  Fagan, who passed away on September 19, 2020, at the young age of 28,  following a courageous battle with COVID-19.   Growing up in central New York, Dr. Fagan always knew she wanted to  practice medicine, and she was always helping people. That was her  passion.   She was a standout student at Bishop Ludden High School, my alma  mater, and at St. Joseph's and the University of Buffalo.   She traveled to Haiti four times on missions to serve those who lived  in areas where access to healthcare was limited.   Dr. Fagan later moved to Houston, Texas, to complete a residency as  an OB/GYN doctor, working rotations in the emergency room where she was  routinely exposed to COVID-19 patients.   Tragically, Dr. Fagan fell ill with COVID-19 and passed away last  month. Members of our community have come together to remember her life  and tremendous work as a daughter, sister, friend, and healthcare  provider. And it is my honor to do so before this body now.   Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House join me in  honoring the life of Dr. Fagan, a true hero, and all those who continue  their service among these challenges.                            ____________________
