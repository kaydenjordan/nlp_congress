 Mr. Speaker, it is wet in farm country.  In fact, our corn planting is so far behind that many South Dakota  producers aren't quite sure how they are going to feed the 5 million  cattle that are in our State.   Now, these producers don't want a new government program. They cannot  feed their cattle dollar bills. What they want, what they need, is the  flexibility to help themselves.   That is why Congresswoman Angie Craig and I introduced the FEEDD Act.  It would provide the USDA the flexibility needed so that producers can  go in and hay, graze, or chop cover crops that are on prevent plant  acres and do that before November 1. Moving that date from November 1  to September 1 could make a real impact. The forage we need will come  from those acres. It will come from that flexibility.   Already this bill has received 27 co-sponsors and has been endorsed  by 17  [[Page H4776]]  national ag groups. I look forward to working with them, to working  with the Agriculture Committee, to working with House leadership to  move this concept forward.   We also have another option. USDA could do this administratively, and  we continue to discuss with them the opportunity to get this success in  that way.                            ____________________
