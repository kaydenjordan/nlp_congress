 Madam Speaker, it is obvious today that there is an  intense hatred by the Democrats for President Donald Trump.   Why do they hate the man so much? Maybe it is because of the out-of- control government gone wild: the abuses of FISA, the abuses of the  FBI, the abuses in the State Department.   Maybe it is just the previous administration they are trying to cover  up.   It is sad. This is a shameful act in what we are doing today.   Shame on the Democrats. Shame on them for pursuing this.   I ask every Member to vote ``no'' and to take notice of who votes for  these Articles of Impeachment.
