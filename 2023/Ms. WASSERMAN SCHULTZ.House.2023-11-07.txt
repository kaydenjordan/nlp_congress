 Mr. Speaker, two years ago, thousands of  Cubans peacefully demonstrated for their basic rights, and their  corrupt rulers responded with a brutal, indiscriminate crackdown.   Maykel Castillo Perez and Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara both helped  forge the historic and resurgent prodemocracy movement on July 11. They  have been imprisoned ever since. Maykel, a Latin Grammy-winning rapper,  coauthored the song ``Patria Y Vida,'' an anthem for the mass  demonstrations. Luis Manuel, an Afro-Cuban visual artist, has fought  passionately for free expression and against censorship.   Maykel disappeared from public view after being detained without a  warrant on May 18, 2021, and a kangaroo court sentenced him to 9 years  in prison. The U.N. reports Maykel remains in prison ``solely for his  prodemocracy activism,'' enduring inmate threats, solitary confinement,  and denied family visits and medical attention. Yet he still rebels  however he can. On the anniversary of the July 11 protests, he sewed  his mouth shut and tattooed ``Patria Y Vida'' on his arm. Maykel told  friends: ``I have enough strength to keep bleeding . . . I prefer with  great pride to descend in a coffin than to bow.''   Luis Manuel's despicable treatment is compounded by the jarring  legacy of anti-Black racism in Cuba. On July 11, he too was arrested  after posting a video on his plans to join Cuba's mass democracy  demonstration.   Like Maykel, he was tried behind closed doors and thrown in a maximum  security prison. Due to abuse, bad medical care, and denial of food and  water, Luis Manuel is suffering from extreme weight loss and severe  medical issues.   I am grateful the Biden administration granted humanitarian parole to  both Luis Manuel and Maykel, but for the Cuban regime, exiling these  patriots isn't enough. Their very existence is a threat.   While these cases are egregious, thousands of peaceful prodemocracy  protesters have been jailed, tortured, or killed. If we truly intend to  live up to our Nation's values, we must work tirelessly to liberate  those who continually sacrifice their freedom for others.   As co-chair of the Cuba Democracy Caucus, I proudly join forces with  Freedom House and Amnesty International to demand justice for Maykel  and Luis Manuel through the Defending Freedoms Project.   I intend to use my platform to ensure their unconditional release is  a top priority in any discussion of Cuba policy.   I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me.   (Spanish translation of the statement made in English is as follows:)    Hoy me levanto para exigir la liberacion inmediata de dos presos de  conciencia cubanos. Maykel Castillo Perez y Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara  ayudaron a empezar el movimiento pro-democracia el once de julio.   Ellos estan encarcelados desde ese dia. Maykel, rapero y ganador del  Grammy Latino, es coautor de la cancion ``Patria y Vida'' que fue himno  de las protestas.   Luis Manuel es un artista visual afrocubano que ha luchado duro por  la libre expresion y contra la censura.   Maykel desaparecio de la vista del publico tras ser detenido sin  orden judicial, y un tribunal irregular lo condenoa nueve anos de  prision.   Segun el informe de las Naciones Unidas, Maykel sigue encarcelado  ``unicamente por su activismo a favor de la democracia''.    Sin embargo, todavia se manifiesta como puede. En el aniversario de  las protestas, se cosio la boca y se tatuo ``Patria Y Vida'' en el  brazo.   El trato despreciable recibido por Luis Manuel se ve agravado por el  preocupante legado del racismo contra los Afrocubanos.   Tambien fue arrestado luego de publicar un video sobre sus planes de  unirse a manifestaciones masivas por la democracia en Cuba.   Al igual que Maykel, fue condenado y encarcelado atras de a una  prision de maxima seguridad. Luis Manuel a sufrido una perdida extrema  de peso y graves problemas medicos.   Agradezco que President Biden este ofreciendo libertad humanitaria a  Luis Manuel y Maykel, pero para la dictadura cubana exiliarlos no es  suficiente. Su propia existencia es una amenaza.   Si queremos estar a la altura de los valores de nuestra nacion,  debemos trabajar todos los dias para liberar a los que sacrifican por  los demas. Como copresidenta del Caucus para la Democracia en Cuba, voy  a luchar al lado de Freedom House y Amnistia Internacional para  demandar justicia para Maykel y Luis Manuel.   Voy a hacer todo lo posible para abogar por su liberacion  incondicional.   Espero que mis colegas de ambos partidos se unan a mi.   I'd like to share more about these brave patriots, in their own words  and those of people who know them well. The following is a letter  written by Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara to the Miami Herald, entitled:  `Cuba's authorities have stolen my youth just for speaking my mind'. It  was published July 10th of this year, two years after his arbitrary  arrest.   [[Page H5477]]              I am an artist and a political prisoner in Cuba. I was       arrested on July 11, 2021, on my way to a protest in which       thousands of my compatriots rose up across the island to       demand freedom.        I've been imprisoned ever since.        Last year, I was sentenced to five years in prison on       charges of contempt and insult to national symbols, because I       used the Cuban flag in a performance in August 2019. This is       how the Cuban government views my art. I was tried, alongside       my dear friend, the Grammy Award-winning rapper Maykel       Castillo--known as El Osorbo--who is now serving a nine-year       sentence for similar offenses. My imprisonment is a result of       the Cuban authorities' systematic strategy to silence the       voices of young people. They have been harassing me for       years, arresting me 50 times between 2017 and 2021 and also       through defamation, violation of privacy, threats and police       beatings. But it wasn't until the historic protest of 2021       that the regime decided to lock me up for a longer period of       time so I could no longer communicate with my people.        I'm imprisoned in Guanajay, a maximum-security penitentiary       southwest of Havana. Many of my fellow prisoners are serving       life sentences for murder. The authorities have separated me       from other political prisoners. I share a cell with three       others. I'm allowed to talk to other inmates in the hallway,       but I'm only taken out to the yard when other prisoners are       gone. I should be allowed to spend an hour outside every day,       but I'm only let out occasionally at the whim of the guards.        I've lost weight because of the scarcity of food and poor       quality of meals. I'm often afraid to eat because the food       looks rotten. After I was sentenced in June 2022, the rules       for visiting me changed. Now my family can only visit me once       a month, instead of twice. No one else is allowed. Even my       beloved uncle is banned because of his involvement in       activism.        More than 1,800 Cubans, mostly young and Black, were       arrested in the protests in 2021. Of these, 897 have been       tried, and 777 remain in prison. Many are minors. Some have       been sentenced to up to 30 years for sedition. But there's no       evidence that the protest was premeditated. It started in a       small town outside Havana, when a young boy posted a video on       Facebook of people protesting power outages. Within hours,       thousands of Cubans decided to take to the streets.        Since that day, hundreds of young Cubans have been trapped       behind bars. Every day is the same. Violence is constant.       Only one's body changes. Your hair falls out and your face       ages prematurely from pain, frustration and sadness. Your       friends leave the country. Lovers' caresses are long gone.       The soundscape here is always the same. All you hear is the       murmur of death slowly approaching. In these harsh       conditions, human beings are stripped of their youth. They       wander the four square meters of their cells with no sense of       future.        I speak as a young man in today's Cuba. We are full of       energy and confidence, determined to lend our talents to the       quest for a truly democratic and free Cuba. The regime that       has survived for 64 years on the Caribbean's largest island       is once again trying to crush a generation, just as it       crushed and erased those who preceded us.        Today every young Cuban is a political prisoner. A censored       artist. An exile inside and outside Cuba. Even if you're an       accomplice of the system, you will inevitably be crushed like       the others, because to be young is to be daring and reckless,       eager to bring change to the world. It means fighting for       love, dreams and utopia. But these qualities are       considered crimes in Cuba, and that condemns us all to       martyrdom.        Today, as I approach the age of 35 behind bars, I reflect       on the loss of youth under a dictatorial system. Forced to       survive political violence, we all lose 90% of our physical       and intellectual productivity. Only 10% is left for creative       and life-affirming pursuits.        On behalf of the young Cubans locked up in the island's       horrible prisons, I appeal to people of conscience around the       world to support our struggle to liberate ourselves and our       country. All we did was demand the right to choose our       political future and to speak our minds.        No one should have to give up their youth for such a just       cause.    Next, I'd like to share a story written by Julyssa Lopez and  published January 6th, 2023 in Rolling Stone magazine detailing Maykel  Osorbo's life and current detention. The article is titled ``Two Years  After `Patria Y Vida.' Cuban Rapper Maykel Osorbo Remains in Jail.''         Maybe it was the excitement of post-lickdown celebrations       or the simple triumph of getting through the worst of the       pandemic, but the energy felt different at the 22nd annual       Latin Grammys back in November of 2021. Thousands of people,       dressed in shimmering gowns and slick suits, had gathered at       MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas for the awards ceremony.       At the end of the night, when it was time for the anticipated       Song of the Year category, the air turned electric as people       waited to hear who might take home the trophy--maybe be a       massive pop name like Cammilo or Rauw Alejando, who were both       nominated and sitting in the audience.        Instead, the award went to ``Patria Y Vida,'' a song that       started out in a small studio in Miami and spiraled across       the streets of Cuba in 2021. The title, which inverts the       popular Fidel Castro-era slogan ``patria o muerte,'' took on       such force that it became a common chant during the       unprecedented demonstrations that swept the island that       summer. Despite its political impact, no one expected       ``Patria Y Vida'' to win in Las Vegas, particularly because       of how traditional the Latin Recording Academy can be. Five       of the song's performers--Yotuel Romero, Descemer Bueno,       Eliexer ``El Funky'' Marquez Duany, Alexander Delgado       Hermandez, and Randy Malcom Martinez--appeared onstage,       shocked and tearful, to accept the award. But there was one       artist notably absent: the rapper Maykel Osorbo.        At that precise moment, Osorbo was sitting in Kilo 5 Y       Medio, a maximum-security prison in the rural, tobacco-rich       region of Pinal del Rio, Cuba, far from the glamour and       glitterati of the awards show. By then, he'd been jailed for       six months, after authorities detained him on accusations       that included assault, resistance, public disorder, and       ``propagating the epidemic,'' all of which outside lawyers       supporting him say are false charges. His family heard from       him only sparingly, and they worried about his health, which       had deteriorated since his arrest.        Since the late 2010s, Osorbo--whose real name is Maykel       Castillo Perez--had gained attention on the island as one of       the most public figures of Movimiento San Isidro (MSI), a       collective made up of dissident artists and intellectuals in       Havana. He was also known for his bold, outspoken music,       which caught the ear of Romero. Romero had begun working on       ``Patria Y Vida'' in October of 2020, and he'd been       collaborating with other artists who, like him, had moved to       the U.S. from Cuba. Still, he felt the track--which was       inspired by the political anthems of nueva trova legend       Silvio Rodriguez--needed the voices of people still living on       the island. He asked Osorbo to be part of the song, aware       that the music risked provoking the Cuban government; the       lyrics call for freedom and mention several activists by       name. Bus Osorbo wasn't afraid.        He and his close friends El Funky recorded verses in       secret, sending them to Romero through WhatsApp. Over the       next few months, they watched in awe as the song caught on in       Cuba, becoming a rallying cry as unrest started brewing in       the country. Frustrations had been mounting as Cubans faced       food and supply shortages something many saw as a direct       product of government mismanagement and the effects of the       pandemic--though others, including Cuban president Miguel       Diaz-Canel, pointed to the effects of the U.S. embargo.       Additionally, there was a tightening of restrictions during       lockdown that reflected the Cuban government's broader limits       on civil liberties. Osorbo continued working with MSI, often       using his platform to speak out and demand justice for people       who'd been detained for expressing themselves. His rising       popularity and outspokenness made him a frequent police       target and, according to the humanitarian organization       Prisoners Defenders, he was arrested and beaten multiple       times before he was thrown in prison in May 2021.        Meanwhile, tensions in Cuba boiled over in July that year,       resulting in rare nationwide protests. Many of them were set       to the sound of ``Patria Y Vida''--a sign that even if Osorbo       was locked away, the messages he'd gotten out were still       resonating with people.        After the Latin Grammys that November, there was a faint       sense of hope: Perhaps such massive international attention       would eventually mean Osorbo's release. In February 2022, the       United Nations Group on Arbitrary Detention responded to a       complaint, spearheaded by Prisoners Defenders, and determined       that Osorbo had been ``persecuted and arbitrarily detained       for exercising his fundamental rights to freedom of opinion,       expression, assembly, association and participation.'' They       demanded his release, and Osorbo's friends organized to fight       for him. El Funky, who moved to the U.S. in 2021, released       music lambasting Cuban authorities for imprisoning artists,       and Osorbo's partner, the activist Anamely Ramos, spoke out       at demonstrations and rallied supporters on social media.        But in June 2022, a court in Havana made its final       decision. Osorbo was sentenced to nine years in prison;       artist Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, a close MSI associate,       was sentenced to five. Javier Larrondo, the president of       Prisoners Defenders, believes some of the recognition Osorbo       got for his music did help. In addition to winning Song of       the Year, ``Patria Y Vida'' also secured the award for Best       Urban Song, making Osorbo a two-time Latin Grammy winner--      and, perhaps, lightening his sentence. ``Given the way crimes       were fabricated the way they were for Maykel, if he'd been       hidden in anonymity, he perhaps could have even had a 12- or       13-year sentence dropped on him,'' Larrondo says.        Still, the sentence was a painful one for him and those       who'd been following Osorbo's case. Osorbo will turn 40 this       August: he'll be almost 50 by the time he's released. People       have continued to denounce his imprisonment: Last month on       Christmas Eve, the Argentine-Venezuelan singer Ricardo       Montaner called for his liberation. Others, like El Funky,       want to make sure Osorbo isn't forgotten. ``We're going to       keep making music, keep speaking up, until Maykel is free,''       he says.        Maykel Osorbo grew up in Old Havana as an only child. When       he was 10 years old, his mother left in the dead of the       night, part of a swell of Cubans who left the island after       the 1994 Maleconazo protests that led then-  [[Page H5478]]       president Fidel Castro to briefly allow citizens to leave the       island voluntarily. Osorbo was largely on his own after that.        ``Maykel had a hard childhood,'' says El Funky, who met       Osorbo in the neighborhood as a kid. ``He had to become a man       at a really young age and went through really difficult       things.'' They stayed friends throughout the years, and they       always had a love of music in common. They both wanted to be       performers, but El Funky had to put his career ambitions on       hold in 2005, after his first child was born, to focus on       opening a cafe with his father.        In 2013, Osorbo came knocking on his door. ``He said,       `Compadre, you have talent, we've known each other for years.       There are all these music festivals in Cuba with prizes. I       have a studio where we can work without a problem,'' El Funky       remembers. At first, El Funky told Osorbo that he was done       with music, but Osorbo had a way of inspiring. Within a few       months, they were releasing songs together and independently,       building recognition as artists in the neighborhood. They       rapped about life in Cuba, and invariably what they were       releasing was political. ``I've always said that anyone who       writes songs about everyday realities in Cuba is talking       about the situation in Cuba,'' he says. ``So, without meaning       to, we were making protest music.''        Osorbo's work took on a radical urgency in 2018, when Cuba       proposed Decree 349, a law that prohibited any artistic       expression in both public and private spaces without approval       by the government's Ministry of Culture. Authorities were       also given the power to shut down artistic activity that they       deemed as containing ``sexist, vulgar or obscene language.''       Many artists and poets spoke out against the law, many of       them eventually creating the MSI collective. Osorbo took on a       central role alongside Otero, who was arrested dozens of       times for staging demonstrations and art performances.       Osorbo's music became more direct than ever, filled with       lacerating critiques of the government. In late 2020, he       teamed up with El Funky for ``Diazcarao,'' a heated,       blistering rap that directly took aim at president Diaz-      Canel. El Funky believes that song is what started to rattle       the government, just before ``Patria Y Vida'' exploded into       the world.        Once they'd recorded their parts in ``Patria Y Vida,''       Osorbo and El Funky decided to take a huge risk by shooting a       few scenes for a music video Romero was planning. They worked       with the video director Anyelo Troya, who pawned off one of       his cameras to get better equipment for the shoot, and snuck       into an abandoned building in the dead of night. The Cuban       government had enforced lockdown curfews, and they'd all face       fines and even jail time if they got caught. They had three       friends stand watch the entire night, switching off so they       could sleep, and featured Otero in the video as well. Once it       was finished, the video made an impact quickly, garnering one       million views within three days.        ``People who know me and my work were like, `Now you really       went crazy.' I knew there was going to be a fallout,'' El       Funky remembers. Ramos says that shortly after the song came       out, she heard people starting to use the phrase 'patria y       vida' casually on the street, and she noticed neighbors       playing the song in public. She says that she was stunned by       how much other Cubans were connecting to ``Patria Y Vida,''       but she was concerned about Osorbo. ``All of us knew when we       saw the reaction it got that there were going to be       consequences. We know the authorities weren't going to       forgive something like that.''        Cuba, at the time, had been ramping up arrests on artists       in particular. A 2021 report from the international NGO       Freemuse, which has been documenting and researching       incidents of censorship and suppressing freedom of       expression, showed that Cuba's rappers are some of the most       persecuted rap artists in the world. Prisoners Defenders       outlined more than 120 ``repressive police acts'' committed       against Osorbo between 2019 and 2021, including beatings and       arbitrary detentions. In one incident, he was picked up by       police when he was at a park with his two-year-old daughter,       who was left alone after authorities took him away.        Clashes that intensified that April ultimately led to his       arrest. According to Prisoners Defenders, Osorbo had been       walking to MSI headquarters when he saw police harassing a       woman on the street. He attempted to intervene, and police       moved to arrest him instead, despite not having a reason. By       then, Osorbo had become a beloved figure in town, and       neighbors quickly jumped in and helped him escape. They       surrounded police officers and screaming at them to let       Osorbo go, showing the mass support he had from Cubans. (An       image of Osorbo holding one handcuffed arm up in the air       after evading arrest went viral.) Almost a month later, on       May 18, authorities picked him up again, handcuffing him       shirtless and without shoes on while he was at home. Like       many of the previous arrests, this one was made without an       arrest warrant or clear charges against him. He's been held       ever since.        EI Funky was detained at one point as well, but ultimately       let go. ``I'm not the type of person they were going to       arrest,'' he says. ``I've done stuff, don't get me wrong, and       I'm a person who has a lot of support, but I don't have a       personality like Maykel and Luis Manuel. These guys are       leaders--natural leaders. When they thought of things, what       they'd come up with was so ingenious that it was a danger to       the state.''        In addition to his work with Prisoners Defenders, Larrondo       is a singer who's played the most renowned Venues in Spain       and several other parts of the world. He's performed with the       legendary Celia Cruz and sang on an album alongside artists       such as Gloria Estefan and Alejandro Sanz. He understands the       value of freedom of expression intimately. His interest in       Osorbo's case came from his experiences both as a musician       and a defender of human rights, and he's been working with       the hope of finding organized, systematic ways for the       artistic community to show solidarity with artists who are       oppressed around the world.        ``Patria Y Vida'' was the main storyline at the 2021 Latin       Grammys, and the song's two wins made headlines around the       world. There was some inevitable controversy, with skeptical       fans and musicians arguing that ``Patria Y Vida'' reflected a       Western, anti-left political agenda and noting that the       government organization USAID has used Cuba's hip-hop scene       in the past as a way to infiltrate the Cuban government.       (Some Cuban rappers Rolling Stone spoke to have countered       that regardless of what the U.S. has done, Cuba's artists and       hip-hop scenes have their own voice.) But more broadly, the       Latin Recording Academy was applauded for swaying from its       more risk-averse tendencies and recognizing a song with a       strong social message.        And then, as the months passed, Osorbo's story largely       faded from mainstream coverage--and, seemingly, from the       Latin industry and Latin Grammy's consciousness. Osorbo, who       remains behind bars, wasn't mentioned at the 2022 awards       ceremony this past November, and El Funky says no one       contacted him about other efforts to raise awareness.       However, he has kept writing music about Osorbo and other       political prisoners in Cuba, refusing to back down. Artists       such as Romero have also spoken out; he's currently working       on a documentary about ``Patria Y Vida.''        Larrondo believes that cases such as Osorbo's illustrate a       violation of fundamental rights, and that limits on artistic       expression--like other human-rights violations--require       bigger, broader movements in response. ``In the music       industry. as well as in the sports industry. there isn't a       systemic process to show solidarity with oppressed artists or       athletes,'' he says. ``I say this thinking of the Iranian       case of the athlete sentenced to death. I haven't seen soccer       players, or soccer clubs, express themselves against that       sentencing in a big way, doing things like organized moments       of silence at stadiums. the same way I haven't seen artists       defending the freedom of Maykel Osorbo in a massive way.''        He adds: ``The fact that some artists have stood up for       Maykel is good, but without some coordination or a major       response from the collective art world to support a Latin       Grammy winner, and a constant, permanent message--without       that. you can't have that person set free from prison. Any       artist in any regime could suffer things similar to Maykel.''        Ramos worries constantly about Osorbo's medical condition       in prison. She says he went through a critical period in       which skin lesions and boils appeared on his skin, perhaps a       result of contracting scabies or an infection in prison.       Though he's since stabilized, she wonders if the symptoms       could be a sign of cancer, and she believes the Cuban       government is actively withholding medical attention--      something it has been accused of doing with prisoners in the       past. Beyond that. she says Osorbo's mood has dipped,       especially after the holidays ``He's really not doing well,       and he's been that way for a long time.'' she says.       ``Especially these days toward the end of the year, which is       a tough time that you typically spend with family.''        Despite all this, Osorbo recently managed to share an audio       recording, which was posted on his social media accounts.       It's a message of gratitude to his family, his friends, and       above all, those who have supported him. ``Those supporters       have been there for me at all times, they have made me       grow,'' Osorbo says. ``They have made me leave behind who I       was and they've made me who I am.''     Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.   Let me be clear. The act that the gentleman is trying to defund does  not require auto manufacturers to install kill switches. It does not do  that.   Passive drunk driving technology is a vital tool in safeguarding our  loved ones and other innocent people on our roads. This new technology  offers a lifeline of hope to not only save lives  [[Page H5520]]  but to prevent the lifelong emotional toll and gargantuan costs these  accidents inflict on families.   Deadly drunk driving accidents can echo across generations, but we  can seize this opportunity to stop such tragedies.   Between 2019 and 2021, Florida saw a 31 percent increase in drunk  driving crashes. In Mr. Massie's home State of Kentucky, 190 people  were killed in drunk driving crashes in 2021 alone. That was a 26  percent increase.   When we saw these grim statistics, we acted in a bipartisan fashion  in Congress. How often do we see that? Both Republicans and Democrats  supported the HALT Act to require auto manufacturers to make this  passive technology standard in new vehicles.   The sponsor of this misguided amendment will tell you that he worries  about privacy concerns. We heard the same inane calls with seat belt  requirements.   You don't have a right to engage in potentially fatal behavior that  we know poses a major health threat to public safety.   Passive drunk driving technology is pro-police. This anti-drunk  driving technology lightens the load on police officers, allowing them  to focus on more pressing safety concerns.   The importance of this technology goes far beyond statistics. It is  about saving lives, preventing heartbreak, and making our roads safer.  It is a passionate call to action to prevent alcohol-impaired driving  from shattering the lives of those we hold dear.   This amendment, I understand, was dubbed the kill switch amendment,  and it does not require a kill switch. It simply requires passive  technology to help us prevent drunk driving.   In the name of the 406 people who were killed by a drunk driver in my  own State of Florida last year alone, I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no'' on this amendment. Let's take steps to reduce deaths due to  drunk driving, not increase them.
