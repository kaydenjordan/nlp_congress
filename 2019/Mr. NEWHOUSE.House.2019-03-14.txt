 Mr. Speaker, it is hard to believe that it has been  almost a year since we lost our beloved colleague, the Honorable Louise  Slaughter.   Louise always believed personal relationships could transcend  politics. She set an example for us all through her acts of kindness,  particularly with those of us in the other party.   We bonded as members of an exclusive club, a club I wish upon no one:  those of us who have lost our spouses. Somehow she made me feel like I  was helping her through the loss of her husband when, in fact, she,  being much smarter than I, knew that, through my attempts to help her,  she was really helping me through the loss of my wife.   It was recently announced that Louise, the first female chair of the  House Rules Committee, would be inducted into the National Women's Hall  of Fame. What a deserving honor.   I will always appreciate my friendship with the Honorable Louise  Slaughter and will never forget the efforts she made to take me under  her wing from across the political aisle.                            ____________________
