 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 10 minutes, and that following my remarks, the Senator from  Washington, Mrs. Murray, be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                                  Healthcare     Mr. President, a week ago Saturday night, I was having  dinner with my wife. It was about 8:30 in the evening, and the  telephone rang, my cell phone, sitting in my pocket. I pulled it out,  and it was the White House operator. The President was calling. So I  walked out of the restaurant, sat on a curb outside in the dark, and  had about a 15-minute conversation with the President of the United  States while my dinner got cold.   President Trump said: I am calling about the cost-sharing reduction  payments. I have cut them off as of October 1. The court says they are  illegal. I don't want insurance companies to be bailed out. I think I  can get block grants to replace ObamaCare, but I don't want people to  suffer in the meantime.   So he said to me: I think I might want to get a bipartisan interim  deal, a short-term deal. I have called Chuck Schumer and told him that.   The President put that out in a tweet that day.   So the President said to me: Why don't you negotiate with Senator  Murray and try to get one; meaning a short-term, bipartisan deal.   I said: Well, what about the CSR payments?   He said: I can put them back, and you can use that as a negotiating  tool to get a better deal with the Democrats.   I responded that I was already working on an agreement with Senator  Murray.   He said: Finish it, and let me know.   He called me again last Saturday. We talked about it again, and we  talked twice yesterday.   I reported to the President that we finished our negotiations and  that we are here today to present to the Senate the agreement we  recommend.   The bill has 22 sponsors, half Democratic and half Republican--very  few bills come to the floor with that many cosponsors originally--and  there are a number of others on the Republican side and I understand  from Senator Murray a number on the Democratic side who support the  idea.   I ask unanimous consent that a list of the cosponsors I am about to  read be printed in the Record following my remarks.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the agreement  that Senator Murray and I would like to present to the Senate for its  consideration and the President's consideration and the consideration  of the House of Representatives be printed in the Record following my  remarks.   The Republican Senators who are cosponsoring the Alexander-Murray  proposal, in addition to me, are Senator Rounds, Senator Graham,  Senator McCain, Senator Cassidy, Senator Collins, Senator Ernst,  Senator Murkowski, Senator Burr, and Senator Corker. I thank them all  for doing that. Senator Murray will talk about the equal number of  Democratic cosponsors that we have.   We hope Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer, the President of the  United States, and the House of Representatives will consider our  proposal. This is a first step--improve it and pass it, sooner rather  than later. Our purpose is to stabilize and then lower the cost of  premiums in the individual insurance market for the years 2018 and  2019.   In plain English, most Americans get their insurance from the  government or on the job. About 6 percent of insured Americans, or 18  million Americans, go into the individual market to buy it. They are  the ones we are worried about. They are the ones we are seeking to  help. There are 350,000 such people in Tennessee--songwriters, farmers,  small business women--they are the ones who are terrified by the  prospect of skyrocketing premiums and even the possibility that they  might not be able to buy insurance at all.   Our agreement tries to help in two ways. No. 1, it permanently amends  the Affordable Care Act to give new flexibility for States to create  insurance policies that have a larger variety and lower costs. No. 2,  it continues the cost-sharing reduction payments during 2018 and 2019.   Now, first, about cost-sharing. Cost-sharing reduction payments are  subsidies that pay for co-pays and deductibles for low-income  Americans. That is what they are. Every Democrat wants them to  continue, so do many Republicans, including every Republican in the  majority in the House who voted for their repeal-and-replace bill this  year because it continued the cost-sharing payments for two years.   Let me say that again. Every Republican in the House of  Representatives who voted to repeal and replace ObamaCare this year  voted for a provision that continued the cost-sharing payments for 2  years. Our bill does the same thing. The only difference is, we  eliminate any question about whether paying them is legal.   Now, why would so many Republicans and so many Democrats support  these payments for 2 years and why would the President of the United  States be interested in them? It is because the Congressional Budget  Office has told us that if we don't do it--if we let them expire-- premiums in 2018 will go up an average of 20 percent. They  [[Page S6605]]  are already set, in most cases. The Federal debt will increase by $194  billion because of the extra cost of subsidies to pay the higher  premiums, and up to 16 million Americans may live in counties where  they are not able to buy any insurance in the individual market.   So unless the cost-sharing payments, which the President says are  illegal--and I agree with him. The Federal Court in Washington, DC, has  told him they are illegal, not properly authorized by Congress. Unless  they are replaced by something else temporarily, there will be chaos in  this country, and millions of Americans will be hurt.   The President says there should be no bailout of insurance  companies--no bailout of insurance companies. I agree 100 percent and  so does Senator Murray. She can speak for herself. I have said to the  President in our telephone calls--as I mentioned, 4 of them in the last  10 days--that if there is a way to improve the language in our bill, we  would like to do that. We have a page and a half to make it clear that  the benefits go to consumers, not insurance companies. That can always  be improved.   Some conservatives object to the idea of paying them at all, but I  would ask this: What is conservative about unaffordable premiums? What  is conservative about $194 billion of new Federal debt? What is  conservative about creating chaos so millions can't buy insurance or at  least failing to deal with the chaos that has been created? What is  conservative about a four-lane highway that would be the chaos that  leads to a single-payer solution for insurance in this country? Do we  really think that if 50 counties in Tennessee or Iowa or Kansas or any  State are in a situation where no one can buy insurance on the  individual market, that government-sponsored insurance is not far  behind? Of course it is. That is why Senator Graham and Senator Cassidy  have cosponsored our bill, because our bill would have been part of the  Senate Republican repeal-and-replace bills if budget rules had allowed  it.   Senator Graham and Senator Cassidy know that if we repeal and replace  ObamaCare in 1 year or 2 years or 3 years, it takes 2 or 3 years for it  to take effect. We still need the cost-sharing payments for the  interim, and you can't pass those in the Senate with 51 votes. It takes  60. Democrats are for it. The Republican House majority has voted for  it. The sponsor of the Senate repeal-and-replace bills are cosponsors  of this agreement. It sounds like something that might actually become  law before the end of the year.   Second, flexibility. The biggest difference between the Senate  Republicans and the Senate Democrats with regard to health insurance  and the individual market is whether Washington should write more of  the rules or States should write more of the rules. Our position has  been that States should write more of the rules. We have had about 50  votes--maybe more--and we have lost them all. We have made thousands of  speeches, and we have lost them all. In the last 7 years, we haven't  moved an inch toward our objectives of giving States more flexibility  in creating insurance policies in the individual market. This agreement  does.   It provides and authorizes States to offer an insurance policy called  catastrophic insurance for people of all ages that would keep a medical  catastrophe from turning into a financial catastrophe. It encourages  interstate agreements among States in health insurance. It streamlines  the innovation waiver--section 1332, we call it--for States that want  to do what Alaska did, which is to create a fund to pay for the very  sick and then reduce premiums for everybody else by 20 percent and use  no new Federal dollars. Most important, it changes the law to make it  easier for States like Iowa, Oklahoma, New Hampshire, Minnesota,  Massachusetts, Tennessee, Alaska, and many others to use their  creativity to write policies that offer more choices and lower costs.   Some have said: Well, that is not enough. Well, that is more than we  have gotten for 8 years, and it is the first step.   I welcome anyone who wants to negotiate further with Senator Murray  or Senator Schumer. That is what the legislative process is about.   Now, because I forgot to do it when I listed the sponsors, I would  like to add Senator Isakson and Senator Grassley to the sponsor list,  which would be two additional Republican sponsors, I would say to  Senator Murray. That gives us a total of 12. I thank Senator Grassley  for his support.   The only thing I would say to those who want to negotiate further to  get more flexibility is to keep in mind that with the cost-sharing  payments, you can't get most of those changes without 60 votes in the  Senate.   I thank Senator Murray for being an able and effective negotiating  partner. We have worked on many pieces of legislation together. She is  tough and respected in her caucus. She does what she says she will do,  and she is interested in getting a result. I respect that and I thank  her.   I thank President Trump for his encouragement. He called me 10 days  ago, he called me last Saturday, and he called me again yesterday. I  thank him for his encouragement--to encourage someone to come up with a  bipartisan agreement to cover these 2 years so people wouldn't be  harmed--and his willingness to consider what we are offering today.   I thank Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer because they have  created an environment in which Senator Murray and I could make this  proposal. I hope they and our other colleagues will seriously consider  it.   The President was right to suggest that we need a short-term  agreement so people will not be hurt. Now, some people are still  objecting to the idea of continuing these temporary cost-sharing  payments for 2 years and the other provisions that would have as the  objective to keep premiums from going up in 2018 and for premiums to  begin to go down in 2019.   They are listening to groups around Washington, DC. I would suggest  they listen to some other people. Listen to the waitress, listen to the  songwriter, listen to the bricklayer, listen to the small  businesswoman, and the people of America--and there are 350,000 in  Tennessee--who may be terrified by the prospect of increasing premiums  or even by the prospect of not being able to buy insurance at all.  These are people who don't get insurance from the government. They  don't get it on the job. They might never know when they are going to  lose their job and they will be in this individual market.   We have a solution here. Senator Murray and I--24 total Senators--are  offering it today. We are certain it can be improved. We look forward  to working with those who would improve it, but I do not believe  Congress would want to fail to deal with a problem that will hurt  millions of Americans if we allow it to continue.   I predict this agreement that we 24 Senators are suggesting today  will become law in some fashion before the end of the year. I think  most Senators and most House Members will be looking around for a  solution when they consider the consequences of a failure to act. When  they look for a solution, I believe this solution supported by 24  Senators--half Democrats, half Republicans--will be the easiest  solution to adopt. I believe all the Democrats want it. Almost all of  the House Republicans have already voted for it this year, and the  Senate Republican leaders who would prefer to repeal and replace  ObamaCare would put it in their bill if they could get it in there, but  they can't because the budget rules will not allow it.   I thank the Presiding Officer.

I yield the floor to Senator Murray.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.    I yield the floor to Senator Murray.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.    Mr. President, if I could ask a question, through the  Chair, to the Senator from Washington.   In my conversations with President Trump, he has made it clear--and  several of my colleagues have made it clear on the Republican side-- that they don't want to bail out insurance companies. What I responded  is that I 100-percent agree.   I have already said this to the President, but I think it is  important for our colleagues to know that probably the most heated  debate Senator Murray and I had was not over whether we agreed with  that but on how to actually do it in the most effective, strongest,  toughest way possible.   So I wish to emphasize the point that these payments are designed to  help low-income Americans pay their copays and deductibles. We have in  our agreement about a page and a half of language that requires every  State to make sure the benefits of those payments go to the consumers  in 2018 and not to the insurance companies.   I wish to ask Senator Murray if she sees any disagreement at all  between her and me, and most of our colleagues on that side of the  aisle and over here, about whether we want to bail out insurance  companies or whether we  [[Page S6609]]  would be willing to consider any effective language that would improve  our own language.    Mr. President, I am very pleased to draw attention  today to the 200th anniversary of the birth of Baha'u'llah, the founder  of the Baha'i Faith.   The Baha'i Faith has over 5 million followers around the world,  including over 2,000 in Tennessee. Baha'is come from virtually every  racial, ethnic, national, tribal, and linguistic background on the  planet.   On October 22, 2017, Baha'i communities across the United States and  around the world will commemorate the 200th anniversary of the birth of  Baha'u'llah--the founder of the Baha'i Faith--and celebrate his life  and his teachings.   Baha'u'llah was born to a noble family in 1817 in Persia, modern-day  Iran. As a young man, he was known for his charity and service to  others and was called the father of the poor. In 1844, he founded the  Baha'i Faith, a new and independent religion with its own scriptures,  laws, teachings, and practices.   Baha'u'llah proclaimed a message of justice, unity, and peace. This  message called for, among other things, the equality of women and men,  an end to racial prejudice, universal education, interfaith harmony,  and international cooperation. As a result of his teachings,  Baha'u'llah was imprisoned and exiled for over 40 years by the Persian  and Ottoman empires.   Despite the injustice and oppression he faced throughout his life,  Baha'u'llah continued to promote a message of peace and unity based  upon harmony within the human race. In every place to which he was  banished, he touched the lives of all those around him. Even some of  his opponents, after meeting him, became his friends and admirers.   Today Baha'is in Iran are still persecuted for their faith, and human  rights experts have called their situation one of the clearest and most  severe cases of religious persecution in the world.   The Baha'i Faith first arrived in the U.S. over 120 years ago.  Baha'is now live in every State of the Union, including Tennessee,  where the community has grown to over 2,000 members.   Wherever they live, Baha'is champion the principles that Baha'u'llah  proclaimed. They strive to build a better world by being good citizens,  serving their communities, and working side by side with others to  promote the common good.   On this important occasion, I congratulate the Baha'i community of  Tennessee and across the United States on the bicentennial of the birth  of Baha'u'llah.                            ____________________
