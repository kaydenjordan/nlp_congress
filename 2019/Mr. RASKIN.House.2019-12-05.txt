 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 741 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 741         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 4) to amend       the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to revise the criteria for       determining which States and political subdivisions are       subject to section 4 of the Act, and for other purposes. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       The amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by       the Committee on the Judiciary now printed in the bill,       modified by the amendment printed in part A of the report of       the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution, shall be       considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2) one motion       to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order without intervention of any point of order to consider       in the House the resolution (H. Res. 326) expressing the       sense of the House of Representatives regarding United States       efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a       negotiated two-state solution. The amendments to the       resolution and the preamble recommended by the Committee on       Foreign Affairs now printed in the resolution, modified by       the amendments printed in part B of the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution, shall be       considered as adopted. The resolution, as amended, shall be       considered as read. The previous question shall be considered       as ordered on the resolution and preamble, as amended, to       adoption without intervening motion or demand for division of       the question except one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Foreign Affairs.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Wednesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 741, providing for consideration of  two measures.   First, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 4, the Voting  Rights Advancement Act of 2019, under a closed rule. The rule self- executes a manager's amendment offered by Chairman Nadler and provides  1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and  ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary. The rule provides one  motion to recommit.   Additionally, the rule provides for consideration of H. Res. 326,  expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding United  States efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a  negotiated two-state solution, under a closed rule.   The rule self-executes two manager's amendments offered by Chairman  Engel. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Foreign  Affairs.   Madam Speaker, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is one of the great  legislative achievements of American history. It is perhaps the  greatest single statute of the 20th century, in a century of great  statutes, including the National Labor Relations Act and the Fair Labor  Standards Act.   But the Voting Rights Act was born out of the blood, sweat, and tears  of the American civil rights movement; in the wake of Freedom Summer;  in the murders of Schwerner, Chaney, Goodman, and other civil rights  heroes; and in the after the famous March on Washington, where Dr. King  made his ``I Have a Dream'' speech.   The Voting Rights Act transformed American politics by bringing into  our elections millions of voters who had been disenfranchised for a  century after the Civil War ended. It changed the nature of politics in  the Deep South and across the United States, and it changed the  politics of the United States Congress as well.   Theoretically, the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments had solved the  problem of disenfranchisement after the Civil War. The 13th Amendment  abolished slavery; the 14th Amendment established equal protection; and  the 15th Amendment banned discrimination in voting. But after the  dismantling of reconstruction, African Americans were subjected to a  regime of disenfranchisement that included violence, terror,  grandfather clauses, literacy tests, poll taxes, and an ever-expanding  panoply of devices, tricks, and tactics to keep Black people from being  able to register to vote and to participate in elections.   The civil rights movement and President Lyndon Johnson fought for the  Voting Rights Act, which passed in 1965 and which included a package of  strong remedies targeting discriminatory voting practices and devices  in the areas where discrimination was most egregious and virulent.   A key component of the Voting Rights Act was section 5, the  preclearance requirement, which compelled covered States--that is, the  States to which it applied--to stop discriminating and to subject all  changes in their voting practices to the Department of Justice or to  the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.   States were covered if they had used illegal voting discrimination  devices like literacy tests, poll taxes, and character exams, and if  fewer than 50 percent of the people were registered to vote or allowed  to participate.  [[Page H9266]]    The Voting Rights Act was challenged immediately in litigation called  South Carolina v. Katzenbach, but in 1966, the Supreme Court rejected  arguments that the Voting Rights Act violated the Constitution.   The Supreme Court said Congress may use any rational means to  effectuate the constitutional prohibition on race discrimination in  voting. It upheld the preclearance requirement against attack.   Specifically, it was said by South Carolina that it violated the so- called equal footing doctrine, but the Supreme Court said that the  equal footing doctrine applied to the admission of States and not to  the Congress' power under section 5 of the 14th Amendment or section 2  of the 15th Amendment.   All of this worked for the Voting Rights Act to usher in a new era of  real democracy in America. The preclearance requirement meant that the  States, counties, and jurisdictions that had been discriminating had to  submit to the Department of Justice or to Federal court their plans for  changes. That worked to enfranchise millions of voters across America.  It worked for the election of thousands of African American elected  officials at the local, State, and Federal levels.   The genius of section 5 was that jurisdictions had to submit  potentially discriminatory changes before the harm took place. Anybody  can go ahead and sue under section 2 after an election is over, but  then it is too late because the harm has already been done, the  election has taken place. So even if you win in court, the court is not  going to order a rerun of the election. It is not going to require all  the voting to take place again, so it is too late at that point.   Section 5 puts the burden on the potentially discriminating parties  to prove that they are not discriminating when they make changes in  voting laws.   It works all the way up until 2013, when the Supreme Court rendered  its 5-4 decision in Shelby County v. Holder. The Shelby County case  struck down the section 4(b) formula for which States were covered,  declaring that this formula was now out-of-date because it went back  many, many decades to the 1960s and 1970s and that the Congress would  need to update the formula to address current needs in the field and to  show that the formula relates to the current problems that we are  targeting.    The Court said specifically that coverage was based on decades-old  data and eradicated practices, like literacy tests, which don't exist  anymore. So when it got struck down, dozens of States and counties that  were previously required to preclear changes related to voting didn't  have to do it anymore, and they began very quickly, almost instantly,  to roll back various kinds of voter protections and to pass strict  voter identification laws, to pass massive voter purges, to implement  cuts to early voting, to close polling places, and so on.   I am going to read from one of the witnesses who testified before the  House Judiciary Committee, Kristen Clarke, the president and executive  director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, who said:   ``We have vetted complaints from tens of thousands of voters in  Shelby, many revealing systemic voting discrimination. In short, this  is how Shelby has impacted our democracy.   ``First, we have seen the resurgence of discriminatory voting  practices, some motivated by intentional discrimination, and this  discrimination has been most intense in the very jurisdictions that  were once covered by section 5. They range from the consolidation of  polling sites to make it less convenient for minority voters to vote to  the curtailing of early voting hours, the purging of minority voters  from the rolls under the pretext of list maintenance, strict photo ID  requirements, abuse of signature match verification requirements . . .  , the threat of criminal prosecution, and more.                                time  1230    ``Second, we have seen increased levels of recalcitrants in hostility  among elected officials who institute and reinstitute discriminatory  voting changes with impunity. . . .''   ``Third, the loss of public notice regarding changes in voting  practices that could have a discriminatory effect is significant. . .  .''   ``Fourth, the public no longer has the ability to participate in the  process of reviewing practices before they take effect. . . .''   ``Fifth, the preclearance process had an identifiable deterrent  effect that is now lost.   ``Sixth, the status quo is not sustainable. Civil rights  organizations are stepping up to fill the void created by the Shelby  decision at insurmountable expense.   ``And finally, this will be the first redistricting cycle in  decades'' in which redistricting takes place without the Voting Rights  Act.   That is one example of testimony that we got from all over America  about what the Shelby County v. Holder decision meant by dismantling  section 5 by knocking out section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act.   H.R. 4 is doing precisely what the Supreme Court invited us to do in  the Shelby County decision: to pass a new coverage formula for the  Civil Rights Act preclearance requirement based on new data in a new  formula designed to address current contemporary problems.   The Judiciary Committee and the House Administration Committee had a  combined total of 17 hearings: 9 on the Judiciary side with its  Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and  8 in the House Administration Committee's Subcommittee on Elections.  They heard about restrictive and discriminatory practices taking place  in numerous States across the country, including Texas and Georgia,  where, after the end of preclearance, Georgia voters faced a myriad of  new voting barriers, including the closure of more than 200 precinct  polling places, spoiled voter registration materials, purging of more  than 1 million voters in a racially discriminatory way, restrictive  voter ID laws, systematic rejection of absentee ballots, and more.   We also looked in North Carolina, which passed a so-called monster  voter suppression law, which resulted in race discrimination in  accessing the polls, including the closure of dozens of polling sites  and long voting lines. The law eliminated same-day voter registration,  reduced early voting by a week, curtailed satellite polling sites for  elderly and disabled voters, and so on.   Madam Speaker, this legislation is the product of massive legislative  inspection of voting conditions across the United States of America  today, and it threads the needle that was offered to us by the Supreme  Court in the Shelby County decision by amending the Voting Rights Act  to revise the section 4(b) criteria and providing other voter  protections at the same time.   Specifically, the bill creates a new coverage formula that applies to  all States and hinges on a finding of repeated voting violations in the  preceding 25 years.   It establishes a process for reviewing voting changes in  jurisdictions nationwide, focused on a limited set of measures such as  voter ID laws and the reduction of multilingual voting materials; it  requires reasonable public notice for voting changes; it allows the  Attorney General authority to request Federal observers; and it  increases accessibility and protection for Native American and Alaska  Native voters.   Just turning, now, to H.R. 326, for more than 20 years, American  Presidents from both political parties and Israeli Prime Ministers have  supported reaching a two-state solution that establishes a democratic  Palestinian state to coexist peacefully and constructively side by side  with a democratic Israel.   Middle East peace talks have favored the two-state solution and  opposed settlement expansions, moves towards unilateral annexation of  territories, and efforts to arrive at Palestinian statehood outside the  framework of negotiations with Israel.   In 2002, President Bush stated: ``My vision is two states, living  side by side in peace and security.''   In 2013, President Obama reiterated this exact same commitment,  stating that: ``Negotiations will be necessary, but there is little  secret about where they must lead--two states for two peoples.''   This resolution emphasizes the sentiment of the past 20 years of  peace talks  [[Page H9267]]  by expressing the sense of this House of Representatives that only a  two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can ensure  Israel's survival as a secure democratic state and fulfill the  legitimate aspirations for a secure and democratic Palestinian state.  It further expresses the sense that any U.S. proposal that fails to  endorse a two-state solution will put a peaceful end to the conflict  only further out of reach.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  My good friend from Arizona chides me for having described section 5,  the preclearance requirement of the Voting Rights Act, as genius, which  is amazing to me because this has been a bipartisan national commitment  and a  [[Page H9268]]  bipartisan commitment in Congress since 1965 when it passed on a  bipartisan basis, since 1982 when it was reauthorized on a bipartisan  basis, and since 2006 when President Bush signed it, as well, and  celebrated it.   So we have had Presidents Bush, Clinton, and Obama, a continuous  array of Presidents, supporting it, and Congresses supporting it.   If you don't have it, here is what happens: The NAACP Legal Defense  Fund testified to us about successful litigation they had in Texas  against a restrictive voter ID law that had discriminatory racial  impact. They won on the lawsuit under section 2, but it was too late.   In the meantime, who was elected in Texas?   A U.S. Senator, all 36 Members of the House of Representatives, a  Governor, a lieutenant governor, and so on.   The reason why section 5 is genius and why we need to restore the  precoverage formula is because it requires States to submit in advance  laws that could be potentially discriminatory.   I was amazed to hear again the language of federalizing control and a  Federal takeover of elections when this has been a bipartisan  commitment for decades grounded in the Constitution of the United  States which tells us in Article I, Section 4 we can regulate  elections; Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment saying we can regulate  elections to prevent race discrimination; Section 5 of the Fourteenth  Amendment, and the republican Guarantee Clause, which tells us we must  guarantee to people of the States a republican form of government,  which means representative government based on democracy.   Finally, I will allow my friend to portray what is going on in her  State her way, and she paints a lovely picture. I would just refer her  to page 25 of the Judiciary Committee report which says that in Arizona  polling places were closed throughout the State, many with significant  populations of Latino voters, in advance of the 2016 election. Maricopa  County, 31 percent Latino, closed 171 polling places, Mohave County  closed 34, and so on. So there is another story to be told there which  is embodied in the work.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Gottheimer).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from New Jersey 10  additional seconds.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Ms. Sewell), who has been such a magnificent leader on this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, all I will observe is that the gentleman  from New York oddly begins by attacking a resolution for being a  recycled version of language we have already adopted on a massive  bipartisan basis in the House. Then he closes by attacking us for this  resolution being partisan and divisive in some way. Obviously, those  two things don't match up.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to thank my friend from Arizona, who rightfully invites us to  focus on legislation that will bring us together.   The gentlewoman from Indiana, who I have not had the good fortune of  meeting yet, accuses me of wasting not just time, but something called  ``clock time,'' which sounds like a really low blow.   In any event, I think our legislation actually will bring us together  and should bring us together. The rule is for two pieces of legislation  that I thought ought to have and would have complete bipartisan  support.   The first is simply to update the preclearance coverage formula,  section 4(b) in the Voting Rights Act, as we were instructed to do by  the Supreme Court in the Shelby County v. Holder decision.   The Voting Rights Act is the product of a massive political and  social struggle in the country to make America move forward, but it had  been supported by huge bipartisan majorities in 1965, in 1982, and in  2006. Yet, today, our friends across the aisle now attack it as a  Federal takeover of State elections, which is absolutely flabbergasting  that the Republican Party, the party of Lincoln, is now attacking the  Voting Rights Act and the preclearance requirement for being some kind  of assault on Federalism when it vindicates the right of all Americans  to vote, as we are not only authorized to do under the 14th and 15th  Amendments, but we are obligated to do under the republican Guarantee  Clause to make sure that all Americans are in a representative  relationship with their government.   So I invite them to come on back over to this side of the Voting  Rights Act.   Obviously, we are all for a two-state solution, as American  Presidents of both parties have been for, for the last several decades,  so I invite them to come back over for that, too.   This resolution cannot be both a tired rehash of everything we have  done in the past, as was claimed, but also some kind of partisan  departure. The partisan departure is on their side.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and a ``yes'' vote  on the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Lesko is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 741         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 2207) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986       to repeal the excise tax on medical devices. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Ways and Means; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 2207.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
