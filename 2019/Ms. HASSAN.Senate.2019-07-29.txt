 Mr. President, today I would like to congratulate  Mr. Jim Tufts of Exeter, NH, on his retirement, after his long,  productive, and impactful career of making a difference for young  people and their families throughout our region and country.   After graduating from the University of New Hampshire, Jim spent 2  years as an assistant coach at Winnacunnet High School in Hampton, NH.  In 1977, he joined Exeter High School as the physical education teacher  and varsity head coach of both the boys soccer and hockey teams.   Jim has coached over 1,650 games, and his teams have accumulated  almost 1,000 career wins and won a combined eight New Hampshire  Interscholastic Athletic Association, NHIAA championships. He has also  served as chairman of the Physical Education Department at Philips  Exeter Academy for the summer school program. In 1988 he became the  coach and local program coordinator of the Exeter Area Athletes and  runs the Learn to Play Hockey Program to introduce hundreds of young  people to ice hockey.  [[Page S5139]]    For 50 years, Jim has volunteered with the New Hampshire Special  Olympics, which was first organized in the State in 1970 by his mother,  Jean Tufts. He has served as the director of the Exeter Special  Olympics Program for 32 years, and in 2003 he was named Special  Olympics Coach of the Year by the National High School Athletic Coaches  Association. Jim has organized students from Exeter High School and  surrounding high schools to get involved as peer coaches for the  athletes, making the Exeter Special Olympics an incredible community  event.   It is Jim's devotion to Special Olympics athletes--and the example he  has set for the athletes he coaches in all of his different roles--that  has made a unique and life changing difference for thousands of young  people and their families.   Jim, accompanied and guided by his wife, Leslie, and sons, Matt and  Kyle, has been a tremendous asset to Exeter High School and to the  entire Seacoast region. He has given back to his community in countless  ways with humility and an exceptionally positive attitude. Jim has  taught all of us that talent and compassion, strength and kindness, go  hand in hand. His town, State, and country are better because of his  example.   Mr. President, I hope you will join me in honoring a dedicated  Granite Stater, Jim Tufts.                            ____________________
