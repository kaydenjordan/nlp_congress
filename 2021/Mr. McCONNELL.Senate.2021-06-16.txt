 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Key economic indicators continue to show that our  Nation's recovery is still facing significant head winds.   Last week, we learned that inflation has logged its steepest increase  since the 2008 financial crisis. There are more unfilled jobs in  America than at any point on record, and, when asked, more than 90  percent of the small business owners trying to fill them say they are  having trouble finding qualified candidates.   So how did we get here?   When COVID-19 arrived last spring, emergency shutdowns put the brakes  on what had become a roaring economy. The pro-growth agenda enacted by  Republicans had helped drive unemployment to its lowest level in a  half-century. Take-home pay was rising and rising fastest for lower  earners, and millions of new workers were coming off the sidelines to  join a competitive market for American talent.   The past year presented harsh new challenges, but thanks to the  bravery of frontline workers, the genius of scientists, and targeted,  bipartisan relief measures passed here in Congress, our Nation was  beginning to turn the corner.   The Biden administration actually inherited the conditions for  success. It had a bipartisan roadmap of how best to support our  economic recovery.   Alas, but instead, the Democrats chose to ram through trillions of  dollars in liberal pet projects--a relative pittance for actual  pandemic relief and a massive expansion of Federal unemployment  benefits that has made staying home the most sensible financial  decision for literally millions of American workers.   As one pair of economists put it recently, ``The stimulus bill  stimulated unemployment, not employment.'' To be specific, their  analysis found it created conditions in at least 19 States where a  family of four could claim the equivalent of a six-figure salary by  staying out of the workforce.   Let me say that again. One recent study found that in 19 States, a  family of four, with two working parents, would have had to earn at an  annual rate of more than $100,000 from working for it to make financial  sense not to stay home. In 19 States, it made more sense to stay home  than to go back to work.   But burying American workers in incentives to stay home hasn't just  hurt rehiring; it has also magnified supply shortages. A few months  back, the recovery made possible by bipartisan action last year had our  economy geared up for a rush of consumer spending, but today, short- staffed producers are having to pass the rising costs on to households  just as this rush was set to ramp up.   A tough year forced American families to put off some big purchases,  but now they are facing some of the worst sticker shock in a  generation. Used car  [[Page S4559]]  prices are 30 percent higher than last year, and the cost of some home  appliances has spiked nearly as much. Everyday essentials are getting  pricier too. Milk is up 7 percent, and gas has jumped by more that 50  percent.   Consumers are feeling the real cost of what the White House Chief of  Staff called ``the most progressive domestic legislation in a  generation.'' But it didn't have to be this way. These are exactly the  conditions economists have been writing about and warning about for  months.   Back in March, the Washington Post ran an ominous line:         For policy experts and even members of Biden's own party,       the improving picture is raising questions about whether the       stimulus bill is mismatched--    Mismatched--         to the needs of the current moment.    Sure enough, not just any member of the President's party but a top  economist under both the last two Democratic administrations, Larry  Summers, cautioned even earlier that a massive spending plan like the  one Democrats were proposing could ``set off inflationary pressures of  a kind we have not seen in a generation.'' Prescient, to say the least.  That is exactly what has happened.   These exact fears have been realized, and experts are still clear  about the source of the problem. ``Labor shortages are the last thing  that we need'' with inflation on the rise. Until very recently, the  White House has been unwilling to connect these dots.   States have been on their own to turn off the perverse incentives  driving the shortages. To date, 25 States have done so, announcing  suspensions of excessive Federal unemployment supplements. But across  the country, Main Street has already been feeling the pinch.   In my State of Kentucky, the consequences of Democrats' misguided  spending are growing more serious. Small business owners in particular  are nearing a breaking point. One restaurant owner in Clark County  wrote to me to say that ``each week it gets harder to create a full  schedule. Restaurants are already reducing hours of operation. Next  will come closing.''   I have heard the same story from constituents all over the  Commonwealth. A sign manufacturer in Woodford County had to ask his  staff to work as many as 10 hours of overtime each week just to keep up  with demand. An outdoor supplies maker in McCracken County saw shipping  costs quadruple in the past year. He can't find a prospective employee  who will even show up for an interview. He can't even find a  prospective employee who will show up for an interview. After 25 years  of production, he is facing the prospect that his company may not be  able to stay afloat.   The Commonwealth still has 90,000 fewer workers than we did before  the pandemic. In the past year, the Consumer Price Index in Kentucky  and surrounding States has increased by a whopping 7 percent. The  recovery teed up by smart, targeted, bipartisan policies last year has  been buried under an ill-advised, self-inflicted avalanche--avalanche-- of spending. Folks in Kentucky know all too well what happens when  Democrats get carried away here in Washington. They know who ends up  footing the bill back home.   Higher prices at the gas pump and the grocery store, just as families  were hoping to put a year of sacrifices in the rearview mirror--these  are the real-world effects of the Biden administration's multitrillion- dollar economic debacle. These are the effects that Republicans and  nonpartisan experts have warned about literally for months.   The American people are, nevertheless, resilient. Job creators,  innovators, and skilled workers are ready. But as our economy slowly  gets back up to speed, it certainly won't be because Democrats stroked  an outsized check; it will be in spite of it.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, 57 years ago on Father's Day, 1964,  future U.S. Senator from Kentucky Jim Bunning pitched the perfect  game--the seventh in Major League Baseball history--for a 6-0 win by  the Philadelphia Phillies over the New York Mets. Jim would have been  90 years old this summer, and in recognition of his legendary career in  baseball and politics, the Behringer-Crawford Museum in Covington,  Kentucky is celebrating his life with an exhibit running from this  Father's Day until August. Today, I recognize Senator Jim Bunning as an  outstanding Kentuckian and a lifelong champion on both the pitcher's  mound and the Senate floor.   It is fitting that Jim would be honored at the Behringer-Crawford  Museum, which has celebrated everything great about northern Kentucky  for over 70 years. The exhibit, entitled ``From the Mound to the  Hill,'' encapsulates the essence of Jim's life as an all-around  Kentucky hero. It is rare that leaders are able to excel in one, let  alone two, fields, but Jim earned acclaim with grit, determination, and  tenacity.   After his prodigious, 17-year baseball career with the Tigers and the  Phillies, which included 224 wins and 2,855 strikeouts, Jim returned  home to Campbell County to serve at all levels of local, State, and  national government. He dedicated his life to the people of Kentucky,  and our gratitude for his public service is apparent in tributes like  the one at the Behringer-Crawford Museum.   I served with Jim in the Senate for his entire tenure and was proud  to work alongside a man of deep conviction and strongly held  principles. As he once said, ``I have been booed by 60,000 fans in  Yankee Stadium, standing alone on the mound, so I never cared if I  stood alone in Congress, as long as I stood by my beliefs and my  values.'' Jim was never afraid to defend his ideals and fight for  Kentuckians in the Senate, a trait his constituents wholeheartedly  admired. He truly deserves his place in the Hall of Fame, not just for  baseball, but for life.   No commemoration of Jim would be complete without also honoring his  wife Mary, a truly remarkable woman who led her own admirable life.   The Northern Kentucky Tribune highlighted the Behringer-Crawford  Museum's exhibit in a recent article. I ask unanimous consent that the  article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               [From Northern Kentucky Tribune, June 9, 2021]   Behringer-Crawford Museum Exhibit Chronicles Dual Career of Baseball                       Star, U.S. Senator Jim Bunning         It will be 57 years to the day. Father's Day, Sunday, June       21, 1964.        That's the day Northern Kentucky's Jim Bunning, a member of       the Philadelphia Phillies, pitched the seventh perfect game       in major league history--a 6-0 win over the New York Mets at       Shea Stadium.        It was the first perfect game in the National League since       1880 and Bunning's second no-hitter. His first came as a       member of the Detroit Tigers on July 20, 1958, against the       Boston Red Sox.        Behringer-Crawford Museum's From the Mound to the Hill       exhibit, a pictorial history of the baseball life of       Southgate's Jim Bunning, is on display now through August.       Rex Morgan, a life-long friend of Bunning, donated the       material to the museum.        ``Jim Bunning was truly a local hero,'' said Jason French,       curator of exhibits at Behringer-Crawford Museum. ``When we       were given the opportunity to display such an extensive       collection of Bunning memorabilia, it was less of a question       of `if' than `when.' We felt that the summer of his 90th year       would be a great way to honor his memory.'' Bunning was born       October 23, 1931.        Bunning was the sole major league baseball athlete to be       elected to both the United States Senate and the National       Baseball Hall of Fame. He pitched from 1955 to 1971 for the       Tigers, Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates and Los Angeles Dodgers.       When he retired, he had the second-highest total career       strikeouts in major league history. He currently ranks 19th.        A graduate of St. Xavier High School in Cincinnati in 1949,       Bunning received a bachelor's degree in economics from Xavier       University in 1953. He was elected to the Philadelphia       Phillies Baseball Wall of Fame in 1984, and in 1996, to the       Baseball Hall of Fame via the Veterans Committee. In 2001,       his uniform number, 14, was retired by the Phillies.        After retiring from baseball, Bunning returned to his       native Northern Kentucky and was elected to the Fort Thomas       city council, then the Kentucky State Senate, in which he       served as minority leader. In 1986, Bunning was elected to       the United States House of Representatives from Kentucky's       4th congressional district and served in the House from 1987       to 1999. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1998 and served       two terms as the Republican junior senator. In July 2009, he       announced that he would not run for reelection in 2010.       Bunning gave his farewell speech to the Senate on December 9,       2010.        ``When we were approached about being a permanent home to a       massive Jim Bunning memorabilia collection, there was little       chance that we were going to turn it down,'' French said.       ``Jim was such an icon and local legend. He did so much for       our community and was always there for Behringer-Crawford       Museum, too. Housing his collection is quite natural for us       and exemplifies our partnership with the Northern Kentucky       Sports Hall of Fame.''        Hall of Fame members will be admitted to BCM free on       Saturday, June 19 to view the Mound to the Hill Jim Bunning       display, as well as adjunct displays featuring the Negro,       Cuban and Mexican leagues.        Behringer-Crawford Museum opened to the public in 1950 as a       natural history museum based on the collections of William       Behringer, an avid collector, traveler, diarist and Covington       resident, featuring fossils, minerals, animal specimen and       other oddities from his world travels. It is the only museum       totally dedicated to the people, history, culture and art of       Northern Kentucky.        Admission to the museum: $9 for adults, $8 for seniors       (over 60), $5 for children (3-17 years old) and free for       children under 3. Hours of operation are Tuesday through       Saturday, 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and Sunday, 1 to 3:30 p.m.                            ____________________
