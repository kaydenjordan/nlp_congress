 Madam Speaker, I rise to demand justice  for a family still in search of answers.   Over 3 years after his murder, Army Specialist Enrique Roman- Martinez' mother, Maria, and sister, Griselda, still don't know what  happened to their beloved son and brother.   Before he was even old enough to vote, Enrique felt called to serve a  purpose much greater than himself. His dedication to our Nation  compelled him to enlist in the Army when he was only 17 years old.   While stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Specialist Roman- Martinez went camping in the Outer Banks with seven of his fellow  soldiers. On May 22, 2020, he disappeared. Seven soldiers camping with  him failed to report him missing. They failed to provide information  that could lead to solving his murder. Instead, they claimed that he  was suicidal.   However, a week later, when his head surfaced, Specialist Roman- Martinez was found washed ashore--only his head.   He was only 21 years old, just old enough to order a beer for  himself. He had the rest of his life ahead of him, a life he chose to  begin by selflessly serving his country.   His family deserves the truth. As the mother of an Air Force veteran,  I will never forget that awful feeling of waking up every day and not  knowing whether my son will ever come home.   Our military makes a sacred commitment to never leave a servicemember  behind, and it is their moral obligation to inform families if their  loved one is killed.   It is an impossible, unthinkable conversation, a conversation that I  feared every single day during my son's deployment, but it is essential  closure for the families of those who made the ultimate sacrifice.   It has been over 3 years, and the murder of Enrique Roman-Martinez  remains unsolved. The Army's failure to provide his family with the  answers they deserve is unacceptable.                                time  1015    Last year, I introduced The Enrique Roman-Martinez Military Cold Case  Justice Act to reform how the military handles cold cases and ensure  that a tragedy of uncertainty like this never happens again.   I am pleased that my legislation was included in our annual  government funding law and that I recently had the opportunity to visit  the new Army cold case unit to monitor the Army's improvements to their  cold case review process.   However, the harsh truth remains: Enrique's family is still waiting  for answers they may never find. They are also still waiting for the  remains they may never find.   I call on anyone with information on Enrique Roman-Martinez's murder  to come forward and shed light on what happened. As the Roman-Martinez  family's voice in Congress, I will continue doing all I can to deliver  justice for them.   Enrique was one of the Inland Empire's best and brightest, and we  feel the pain of his loss every single day.   Maria and Griselda's lives will never be the same after the murder of  their son and brother, and the very least that we can do is grant them  closure.                            ____________________
