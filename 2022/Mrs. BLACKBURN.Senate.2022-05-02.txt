 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, well, I think, from the President's  comments at the Correspondents' Dinner the other night, it may have  taken a year, but, finally, the President and the White House are  starting to realize that they have lost the American people when it  comes to their agenda. I think it is because you can only betray  someone so many times before they stop giving you a 2nd chance, a 3rd  chance, or even a 15th chance at doing something.   After 16 months of alternating between anger, confusion, and fear,  all Tennesseans can do is just have a laugh at what the White House is  saying and how they are trying to spin what is actually happening and  how they are trying to tell you that what you are seeing is really not  what you are seeing. They know--the American people know; Tennesseans  know--that much of what you hear coming out of this administration is  coupled with a threat; it is coupled with a falsehood; sometimes it is  even coupled with a mandate.   Joe Biden has lost what little control he had, but rather than  reexamining his priorities, he has decided to cause as much pain as he  can before the Democrats lose power. This is a pattern. The Biden  administration doesn't lead; they mandate. They don't come to Congress  and say: Let's do this or that; they throw out an Executive order.  Then, when those mandates and orders that they are tossing out like  they are candy backfire, they come about this by trying to inflict as  much pain as they can.   When business owners pushed back on pandemic mandates that made their  survival impossible, this administration didn't relent; they doubled  down. They just accused everybody who disagreed with them of being a  danger to their communities.   We all heard the stories: Oh, they are putting profit over people.  Oh, they don't care about their communities. They just want to keep the  doors open.   But no--what they wanted to do was serve their communities.   When parents asked questions about what their kids were learning in  school, the Justice Department threatened to throw them in jail if they  protested curriculum influenced by critical race theory and other  radical ideologies. When the administration saw their climate panic  message wasn't resonating anymore, they came out with a plan to double  down again and take away the few transportation and energy options  people could still afford. Their response to historic levels of  inflation is to tax and spend the American people into submission.   See, this is the way they do it: If you are a parent, you show up to  ask questions about what you are seeing your child study. Then they  want to report you and say: You are the one who is causing a problem.   Isn't it amazing how this administration has allowed cancel culture  to infiltrate everything that they do?   It is their way or the highway, as we would say in Tennessee, because  they plan to run over you; they plan to cause pain. This is not  governing; it is punishment--punishment for your beliefs; punishment  for your actions; punishment for standing up for the Constitution, for  democracy, for freedom of speech. They are going to punish you.   Now, I thought that the administration had hit rock bottom with their  response to the recordbreaking inflation they created, but their plan  to address Joe Biden's border crisis has been what has taken the cake.  It is foolish, and it is dangerous.   The situation along our southern border is bad, and it is getting  worse. Just this weekend, I spent some time out in West Tennessee. I  was over in Benton County, which is the northwest corner of the State,  and talked with Sheriff Kenny Christopher. He told me that his officers  are finding fentanyl in about 80 percent of the drugs they seize.  Everything is laced with fentanyl. This is marijuana, heroin, gummy  bears--everything. Fentanyl is on the loose, running wild. Between 2020  and 2021, 64,000 people in this country died from fentanyl overdoses,  and 2,014 of them were Tennesseans. Where is this coming from? It is  coming right across that southern border.   It is so important to note that this is a problem that escalated  after Joe Biden became President. The cartels knew, with the Border  Patrol, that Donald Trump had its back but that now, with Joe Biden, it  is running wide open. Every town is a border town, every State a border  State. We are losing control over the flow of drugs. The cartels are in  control of that southern border. You don't come across without them.  Nothing comes across without them. They are so emboldened that every  law enforcement officer I meet with can tell you what cartel hub--that  is right, cartel hub--here in this country, on U.S. soil, is setting up  their drug trafficking, human trafficking, sex trafficking operations.  Control is lost at that border.   In March, CBP recorded more than 220,000 encounters with people  trying to illegally enter the country. Fortunately, they were able to  use title 42 and expel about 100,000 of those 220,000 individuals.   Title 42 has been a lifesaver for the Border Patrol. Don't believe  me. Go ask them. They will tell you: That is a lifesaver. They have  used it more than 1 million times to deny entry and ease the strain on  their limited resources. They need it. They need title 42, and they  will tell you they need title 42.   So, of course, the Biden administration is getting ready to take  title 42 away. Let's just open that border up. It is endangering our  sovereignty, endangering our people. Every town is a border town, every  State a border State; but let's throw caution to the wind, open the  border. Come one, come all. We had 160 different countries come across  that border last year. Let's see if we can break that record this  year--that is what this White House is saying, total disregard for the  American people. Because if you take away title 42, you are going to  see not 6,000 illegal entries a day, you are going to see 18,000  illegal entries a day.   They know that this is what will happen. And do they have a plan? No,  they don't have a plan. They are expecting that 18,000 people a day.  That works out to over a half million a month--a half million a month.   Now, you know, Secretary Mayorkas admitted last week in his hearing  that he just didn't seem to have a plan, but he was expecting this to  happen.   In Tennessee, we have 345 cities, towns, and villages--345. Out of  those 345 cities and towns, 90 percent of those towns have a population  of 20,000 or less; so it is the equivalent of the population of a  typical Tennessee town coming across the southern border every day. How  long can we sustain that?   Your State of Illinois, Madam President, you all have about 1,200  towns and cities that are incorporated. You have got 102 counties. Out  of those 1,299 incorporated towns and cities, 90 percent of those,  likewise, are 20,000 or less in population. Or if you had a half  million a month, that is equal to a Naperville, Aurora, and Rockford  together. How long could Illinois sustain that?   See, this policy not only affects the border with the United States  and Mexico and those towns and communities and counties, it is every  county in this country.   When Mayorkas was speaking last week over in the House, what he  didn't do was confirm that the administration has a plan to reduce  illegal immigration or, indeed, if they care at all about  [[Page S2239]]  securing the border. Imagine that: a Secretary of the Department of  Homeland Security who does not believe in a secure border. You cannot  make this stuff up. You can't make it up.   For weeks now, a bipartisan group of Senators has pressed the  Department of Homeland Security for their plan to secure the border, to  secure this country. And for weeks, they have ignored our concerns.   As of today, Chairman Durbin has no plan to summon Secretary Mayorkas  for a hearing so we can ask him directly.   Last week, however, things escalated during a hearing at the House  Appropriations Committee when the Secretary confirmed that the  administration is considering pulling staff and resources out of the  VA-run facilities and sending them to the border.   This is crazy. It is not part of the Department of Veterans Affairs'  ``Fourth Mission'' to help the Biden administration save face. But even  if it was, the VA is already struggling to serve veterans.   We are on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Our case backlog for  benefits, for healthcare, is over 260,000 cases. And you are going to  take resources and medical personnel and administrative personnel and  do what with them? Send them to the border.   Getting basic care through the VA has become almost impossible. You  hear it. I hear it. We all hear it from our veterans. And they know  that these facilities are understaffed. This is why they are wanting to  go to community care. And the Agency is experiencing a 15-year high in  turnover for nurses.   And what does this administration do? They say: We are going to take  the people left working in VA healthcare and administration, we are  going to shift them down to the border because the Border Patrol needs  some help. Meanwhile, the people who have put on the uniform and have  fought for this Nation can't get healthcare. And this administration  acts like they don't give a ripping flip about any of it: the veterans,  our Nation's sovereignty, securing the border, protecting our citizens,  eliminating the impact of drugs that are flooding our streets. To make  our veterans suffer, that is unconscionable.   The administration knows that border encounters have consistently  increased since the day they took power--they know this; they have  watched it--and it appears that they have intentionally and  purposefully allowed it.   They know that as long as the border is open, that people from all  around the globe are going to come. As I said, 160 different countries  last year; of that, 42 known terrorist watch list individuals--42 of  them.   But rather than keeping title 42 in place or embracing ``Remain in  Mexico'' or building a wall or giving the Border Patrol the resources  they have asked for years to defend this border, this administration  has decided the way to go about this is to let the veterans suffer. If  they have waited 3 months, 6 months, a year, they can wait a little  longer. That is their thought: Take the resources out of VA and send it  to the border.   There is nothing compassionate about this narrative. There is nothing  caring. There is nothing right about this narrative.   You know, it is the reason that--as the President said, he knows his  approval rating is low. He knows there is a reason for it. He is not  doing anything about it. He is choosing not to do anything about it. He  is choosing not to shift his priorities.   I will tell you, I have spent a lot of my adult life in the greatest  creative community on the face of the Earth. We are surrounded by some  writers and storytellers. And I would say that for some of the great  authors and storytellers in the neighborhood, they couldn't mash  together a plotline as convoluted as this one, because people would say  that would never happen in the United States. You would never see us  purposefully running up inflation or running up the cost of energy or  opening our southern border and allowing terrorists and drug dealers  and sex traffickers and human traffickers and gangs to run in.   You would never knowingly allow cartels to set up shop on U.S. soil.  You wouldn't do that. But this administration has, and they did it  because they know pain is the point. Suffering is the point. We are  going to do this to you.   It goes back to what I said many weeks ago. We, as conservatives,  have a vision for better days, for hope, for opportunity for all, for  preserving the freedom of this great Nation, for preserving our rights,  for protecting faith and freedom and families and hope and opportunity.  And I fear that my Democratic colleagues, they have got an agenda. The  agenda is what we are going to do to you in order to push a Marxist  socialist agenda.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I honor a superb leader,  liaison, and soldier. After a year of service with the Army Office of  the Chief, legislative liaison, as the chief, Army Senate Liaison  Division, COL Scott Wilkinson was selected to serve as the deputy  commanding officer for Support with the 101st Airborne Division at Fort  Campbell. On this occasion, I believe it is fitting to recognize  Colonel Wilkinson's distinguished service and dedication to fostering  the relationship between the U.S. Army and this Chamber.   Colonel Wilkinson grew up in an Army family. He received his  commission in 1994 as the Distinguished Military Graduate of the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology ROTC program and his  undergraduate degree from Harvard University. An aviation officer by  designation, Colonel Wilkinson has led our Nation's young men and women  at home and abroad, most prominently as the chief of staff for the U.S.  Army Special Operations Command, located at Fort Bragg, NC, and  commander of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, located at  Fort Campbell, KY. Colonel Wilkinson has also served in multiple  command and staff positions within the 160th Special Operations  Aviation Regiment. Known as the Night Stalkers, soldiers of the 160th  Special Operations Aviation Regiment are highly trained and have been  actively and continuously engaged in the combat operations since  October 2001.   The Army has consistently relied upon Colonel Wilkinson for his  exceptional leadership and unparalleled  [[Page S2243]]  work ethic. He has deployed widely for training across Europe, the  Middle East, and Africa; operationally in support of Operations JOINT  ENDEAVOR and JOINT GUARD in Bosnia-Herzegovina; and to combat in  support of multiple contingencies and named operations including  ENDURING FREEDOM, FREEDOM SENTINEL, IRAQI FREEDOM, INHERENT RESOLVE,  and YUKON SCEPTER.   Colonel Wilkinson has excelled in numerous other leadership positions  in the Army, most recently as the chief, Army Senate Liaison. In the  Russell Senate Office Building and around the globe, Colonel Wilkinson  continued the tradition of strengthening Army relationships with  Members of Congress and their staffs.   Over the course of the last year, Colonel Wilkinson provided support  to multiple congressional delegations to locations within the United  States and to various countries around the world. He became a trusted  adviser and friend to many of us. He distinguished himself by going  above and beyond the call of duty to facilitate and successfully  execute each and every trip, despite any number of weather, aircraft,  and diplomatic complications.   This June, Colonel Wilkinson departs Washington, DC. This Chamber  will feel his absence. I join many past and present Members of Congress  in my gratitude and appreciation to Colonel Wilkinson for his  outstanding leadership and unwavering support of the missions of the  U.S. Army. I especially recognize his patient and supportive family,  Mrs. Mindy Wilkinson, and his two daughters, Blakely and Parker. I wish  this Army family the best as they move to Fort Campbell.                            ____________________
