 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to  me.   Mr. Speaker, here we are again: the special interests are running the  show in Washington. Pointblank, this resolution will make it harder for  Americans to get justice. Specifically, this will unwind critical new  rules that allow financial consumers to take collective action. You  heard that right. This is an effort to take away your ability to sue  big banks when they run you over. Instead, the majority wants to force  you into unfair, bureaucratic arbitration processes that severely  disadvantage you in favor of the Wall Street firms.   I always ask the same question when the Republicans bring these  measures up here to gut consumer protections: Who back home is asking  for this? Who is coming to the townhalls and begging to repeal this  rule? Who is asking you to make it harder to seek damages when someone  is being harmed by a big bank?   Nobody is asking for this. In fact, as Keith Ellison said a few  minutes ago, there are 100,000 people who are beseeching us to support  this rule to protect them out there. Nobody is asking to repeal this  rule or shut this rule down.   I know who wants it here in Washington. It is the big money special  interests, the so-called swamp. We can't let this happen. The American  people should be furious.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this reckless, shameful  effort.
