 Mr. President, it is my great honor. as Chair of the U.S.  Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees  Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Spending Oversight to recognize  July 1, 2021, as the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the  Government Accountability Office (GAO), and commend it for its service  to the people of the United States. I am grateful to Comptroller  General Gene Dodaro and to GAO's 3,200 employees who work hard to  ensure that federal programs are well managed and fiscally responsible.  As we recognize the GAO, I also encourage my colleagues to continue to  partner with the GAO as we work together to help improve the  performance of the federal government for the benefit of the American  people. I urge my colleagues to join me in adopting this resolution.                            ____________________
