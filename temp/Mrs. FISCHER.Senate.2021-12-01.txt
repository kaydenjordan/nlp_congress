 Madam President, I rise today to honor a devoted  American patriot on her retirement from Federal civil service. Mrs.  Robin Squatrito has served as the Director of Legislative Affairs for  North American Aerospace Defense Command and United States Northern  Command in Colorado Springs, CO, for over 15 years. During that time,  she has provided expert legislative advice to nine NORAD and USNORTHCOM  commanders, served as the principal liaison between the commands and  the congressional defense committee staffs, and facilitated a  tremendous collaborative relationship between NORAD, USNORTHCOM, and  Congress--including my staff and me--as the commands have stood  constant watch over the United States and Canadian homelands.   In fact, Robin was a member of USNORTHCOM from the day the command  was established in October 2002. At that time, she was serving our  Nation as a colonel in the U.S. Air Force and was hand-selected by the  first commander of USNORTHCOM, Gen. Ralph Eberhart, to be the Director  of his Commander's Action Group. USNORTHCOM was established in the  aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001, and Colonel Squatrito  played an instrumental role in ensuring the command was organized and  ready to safeguard our homeland from further attacks. When she retired  after 26 years in uniform, it was only a matter of time before she  answered the call to serve once more.   From the day Robin returned to NORAD and USNORTHCOM as a civil  servant, she has been a tireless advocate for our national defense. She  is  [[Page S8861]]  well known inside and outside the headquarters as a passionate advocate  for NORAD and USNORTHCOM, as well as for the men and women responsible  for executing their critical missions. She is also recognized for her  knowledge, remarkable attention to detail, and dedication, spending  whatever time is necessary to make certain that every product that  passes across her desk is as close to perfect as possible. Robin has  repeatedly demonstrated her passion for doing the right thing and her  commitment to high standards as she has guided nine NORAD and  USNORTHCOM commanders through countless posture hearings, briefings,  CODEL visits, office calls, phone calls, and numerous other engagements  with Members of Congress and our staffs.   Robin's colleagues and her family will tell you that she has always  been one of the first leaders at work in the morning, and can often be  found at her desk well after standard duty hours. And for Robin, time  away from the office has never meant she was off duty. She is never far  from her phone or her email in order to ensure commanders and Members  of Congress always receive a prompt and professional response to any  question, request, or concern. That is one of the reasons why Gen. Glen  VanHerck, the current commander of NORAD and USNORTHCOM, has said Robin  is ``one of the most diligent and dedicated professionals I've had the  privilege of serving with over my more than 34 years in uniform.  Robin's devotion to our country, homeland defense, and our commands is  boundless. She embodies the true meaning of selfless service for a  noble cause.''   And it is certainly fitting to offer our Nation's sincere thanks to  Robin's family for their decades of service and sacrifice. That  includes her husband, retired Col. Joe Squatrito, who also served our  Nation with honor as an Air Force officer. It also includes their  children, Michael and Stacey. As the entire Squatrito family looks  forward to the coming new year with limitless opportunities and  adventures ahead of them, Robin and Joe are also preparing to take on  important new titles and responsibilities as first-time grandparents.   It is my honor to thank Robin Squatrito for her lifetime of devoted  service to our Nation. I wish her and her family all the very best in  her extraordinarily well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
