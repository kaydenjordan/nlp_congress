 I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the House came together with the Senate to  raise the debt limit, which I think was good because another closedown  of our government would have been disastrous. So I am proud, as  President pro tempore, to sign the joint resolution that raises the  debt limit, and that will go now to the President. The Speaker signed  it, I have signed it, and now the President will be able to sign the  bill. I was very, very proud to do that.                                   S. 1605    Mr. President, on another matter, we are going to soon have the  opportunity to vote on passage of the fiscal year 2022 National Defense  Authorization Act, the NDAA. As they do every year, I am sure Senators  will get out press releases touting all of the things in this bill that  they support, as I do: a pay raise for the military, increases for  medical research, investments to counter Chinese aggression. These are  things all worth talking about, but let's be honest and go beyond the  rhetoric, tell the American people about what we are doing and what we  are not.   We can stand here on the Senate floor--we can do it back home--and  declare our unwavering support for our troops and their families, can  claim to support a strong national defense, but until we put our money  where our mouth is and provide the funding we say we support, then  those words ring hollow. It is only rhetoric.   Now, the NDAA is an important piece of legislation, and I applaud  those Senators who put it together. It sets overarching policy for the  Department of Defense. It guides our national security. But--but--make  sure people understand that what it does not do is provide the funding  to implement the policies it sets. It says what the policies will be;  it declares what the funding should be; but there is not one penny--not  one penny--in this bill. That is the job of the Appropriations  Committee.   As we prepare to vote for the NDAA, Republicans have not come to the  table to negotiate top-line spending numbers so that we can actually  enact an appropriations bill to pay for our national defense. Some have  said that they would be fine if the government ended up operating under  a full-year continuing resolution. Fortunately, there are some key  Republicans, as with all Democrats, who don't want a continuing  resolution; they would like to get the bills done. But we have to  actually do it. We can't talk about it. We can't be private and say  ``Oh, yeah, I am for you on that,'' but we actually do it.   So I suggest that if people are wondering whether a continuing  resolution helps us, do the math. A full-year CR would not only reduce  defense spending by $35 billion compared with what is in the NDAA bill,  but it would actually cut defense spending below last year's level.  Just think about that.   We can talk about all the wonderful things we are doing, but if we  don't pass the appropriations bill, if we only have a continuing  resolution, we cut defense spending below last year's levels. So  instead of the $35 billion that they are touting and one minute waving  the flag and declaring they support our troops and our military and  then the next day have no problem in cutting the funds--if we refuse to  go ahead and actually pass the appropriations bills and go instead to a  continuing resolution, we are cutting funds. It almost makes me think  of Alice in Wonderland. I wonder if we are going through the looking  glass.    Democrats have put a fair offer on the table to get us through this  morass. It provides a 5-percent increase for defense programs compared  to last fiscal year, a 13-percent increase for all other programs. The  5-percent increase for defense we picked because it is equal to the  increase contained in the NDAA that we are going to vote on today.   I would predict that the large majority of Senators, Republicans and  Democrats alike, will vote for the NDAA with that 5 percent increase.  Well, stop holding up the appropriations bill that actually has the  money--that has the money. The NDAA is a promissory note; the  appropriations bill is the cash.   The money we have in appropriations is equal to the increase for  defense programs that Republicans unanimously endorsed when the NDAA  was marked up in the Senate Armed Services Committee. It is equal to  the increase that just passed the House. In the U.S. Congress, that is  as close to a consensus as I have seen around here, and I have been  here a few years.   One Republican House appropriator has even said publicly that he  wants an appropriations deal at the NDAA levels because the NDAA fully  funds our defense needs for the coming year. I want him to know that is  the offer the Democrats put on the table 2 months ago. So far, I have  heard deafening silence.   We have to go for it. We have people in both parties who understand  the need for an appropriations bill. I recommend we all get together  and get it done because the men and women who serve in the military  deserve more than lipservice.   Any Senator who votes for this authorization bill today should have  no problem embracing an offer that provides the money to actually pay  for it. They certainly should not be putting us on a course for a full- year continuing resolution, which would cause cuts in our national  defense and, I believe, would weaken our national security.   Secretary Austin has said that a full-year's CR would be unsound,  misappropriate billions of dollars, and erode the U.S. military  advantage relative to China. The Secretary also noted that investments  in research, infrastructure, and public health are equally critical to  our national security.   I ask unanimous consent that Secretary Austin's full statement be  printed in the Record at the end of my statement.   The strength of our military and national security is built on the  strength of our people. Without domestic investments in education,  healthcare, research, economic development, and science, we can't  maintain our military. Without combating the opioid, substance abuse,  and mental health crises facing our country today, we will no longer be  able to recruit the best of the best. We need full-year appropriations  bills to make these investments so people can sit and see what we have  and where we are going with it.   Recently, some Members on the other side of the aisle have taken to  the floor of the Senate to decry a lack of progress on the  appropriations bills. They criticize Democrats for not bringing bills  to the floor. But let's be real. The only reason we have been unable to  move more bills through committee or bring bills to the floor for  debate is because Republicans have said they oppose them until we have  a top line. OK. Then negotiate the very top line they require to move  bills instead of refusing to negotiate that top line. Come  [[Page S9170]]  on. You can't put barriers across the highway and then complain that  traffic is stopped.   I have been calling for bipartisan and bicameral negotiations with  the White House to reach an agreement on top lines since March--March,  April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and now  December. It is probably time enough to get moving.   In October, I released a comprehensive proposal, with the support of  House Democrats, on a path forward. I would ask the Republicans to join  us at the negotiating table. We have a job to do. We are 10 weeks into  the fiscal year. Let's step up and make a serious offer on a top-line  agreement. We Democrats have done that. Republicans need to do that  now--not one that panders to the extremes of their base--and do it in  the next few weeks.   I have been here for a lot of years. Most of the time I have been  here, I have been on the Senate Appropriations Committee. I have seen  Republicans and Democrats come together. I have seen Senators from the  left and the right come together, knowing that you have to have a  consensus, knowing that you don't pass appropriations bills on sound  bites and on a wish list; you do it with substantive work.   Our staff has been working throughout recesses and everything else to  have this, so let's get to work. Let's negotiate full-year  appropriations bills that address our country's many needs, including  our country's national defense. We have done this over and over again  over the years. We can easily do it now.   I have talked with the leaders of both parties. I think we are ready.  I think anybody who fully understands how appropriations work know that  a continuing resolution for the year is not the way to go. It doesn't  help the country. It doesn't help the people whom we represent. It  certainly doesn't help the credibility of the U.S. Senate. And we are  in a position where the House wants to work with us. Let's get to work  and spend a few days doing that. Let's pass the omnibus with the  individual appropriations bills in it. It has been done in the past. It  can be done again.   My staff has been working night and day and weekends. We have  everything together. I have talked with several Senators on both sides  of the aisle. They want to go forward. Well, let's go forward for the  sake of the country, for the sake of this body that I respect so much.   Every single day, when I walk here into the Senate, I think what a  privilege it is to be here. But with that privilege comes a  responsibility--a responsibility to the people of this country, the  people we represent. We can fulfill that responsibility by passing  these appropriations bills.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                             Immediate Release   statement by secretary of defense lloyd j. austin iii on the impact of              a full-year continuing resolution--dec. 6, 2021         The Department of Defense once again faces the threat of a       continuing resolution to fund our programs and operations       into the new year. While the short-term CR passed by Congress       was a necessary measure to keep the government open and       provide additional time to reach agreement on full-year       appropriations bills, some have even suggested a CR could       last an entire year, an unprecedented move that would cause       enormous, if not irreparable, damage for a wide range of       bipartisan priorities--from defense readiness and       modernization, to research and development, to public health.        A full-year CR would be a fiscally unsound way of funding       the Department of Defense and government as a whole. It would       misalign billions of dollars in resources in a manner       inconsistent with evolving threats and the national security       landscape, which would erode the U.S. military advantage       relative to China, impede our ability to innovate and       modernize, degrade readiness, and hurt our people and their       families. And it would offer comfort to our enemies, disquiet       to our allies, and unnecessary stress to our workforce.        Essentially, in terms of real dollars, a CR would represent       a budget cut--and a significant one at that.        I urge Congress to reach a bipartisan, bicameral agreement       on FY 2022 appropriations, and avoid a full-year CR, in the       coming weeks.        First and most importantly, failure to reach an agreement       would put our military and their families under additional       and needless stress. It would mean that providing the 2.7       percent pay increase the President proposed and they so       richly deserve--as well as housing allowances and other new       benefits--would come at the expense of suspending many of       their change-of-station moves and force us to limit the       numbers of new recruits we bring in. And it would result in       over five billion dollars in cuts to our operating accounts,       too, hurting the readiness of our troops and curtailing our       ability to cover the health-care needs of military families.        More than 100 military construction projects--many of which       directly impact the quality of life of our people--would also       be delayed if Congress maintains current funding levels under       a full-year CR. And make no mistake about it, the impacts of       those delays would be felt not only across the Department,       but also in local communities around the country as job       opportunities are lost and revenue for local businesses       diminishes.        Of course, failing to reach an agreement on appropriations       would also significantly impact the programs, the       technologies and the initiatives we are trying to undertake       to ensure we remain the most capable military in the world.       The Department's efforts to address innovation priorities       such as cyber, artificial intelligence and hypersonics       programs would be slowed.        At a time when our adversaries are advancing their concepts       and capabilities to erode our strategic advantages . . . and       as we begin to knit together a truly groundbreaking vision of       integrated deterrence . . . our hands will be tied. We will       be forced to spend money on things we don't need and stop       spending money on investments we desperately do need.        And I'd note that as important as full-year appropriations       are for the Department of Defense, investments at the State       Department, in research and development at the major research       agencies, and in infrastructure and public health are equally       critical to our national security.        Again, I strongly urge Congress to seize this opportunity       to sustain American competitiveness, advance American       leadership, and enable our forces by immediately reaching a       bipartisan, bicameral agreement on full-year 2022       appropriations. It's not only the right thing to do, it's the       best thing they can do for our nation's defense.     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
