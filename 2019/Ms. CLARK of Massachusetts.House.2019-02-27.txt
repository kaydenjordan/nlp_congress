 Madam Speaker, after the Parkland  shooting, high school students in my district told me a heartbreaking  truth. They didn't believe that Congress cared about their lives or  their future. Sadly, I understood why.   Complacency defined the Republican Congress' position on gun  violence. They did nothing after moviegoers were slaughtered in Aurora,  kindergartners were murdered in Newtown, and after one of our own  colleagues, Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, was shot doing her job as a  U.S. Representative.   After 46 people were gunned down at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, I  sat on this very floor in protest. My colleagues and I sat in  solidarity with a very clear but somber message: No more. No more  moments of silence. No more inaction while Americans had senseless  deaths due to gun violence. No more would the entirety of solutions to  gun violence be tweets with our thoughts and prayers.   It has been 2 years since the sit-in and, finally, the inaction has  come to an end. Thanks to the brave survivors, the students, the  advocates, and the family members, we have been able to pass  commonsense gun safety.   Today is a new day, and we will continue this fight.                            ____________________
