 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New Mexico for  yielding.   I am so very pleased to join my colleague, Deb Haaland, as one of the  first Native American women--it is about time--to join this body in  celebrating Native American Heritage Month.   It is fitting here in November, as we think about Thanksgiving, to  celebrate Native American Heritage Month, considering the welcoming of  foreigners to this land first inhabited by the Native peoples.   This month really allows us the opportunity to formally remember the  great contributions that Native Americans have made, and they continue  to make to bridge our communities and to improve our Nation.   All you have to do is walk right down the street to the Smithsonian  National Museum of the American Indian to just get a glimpse of the  many ways that Native Americans have contributed to the fabric of our  Nation, despite the many hardships, the broken promises, and trials  they have faced.                                time  1645    Indeed, as you walk through that museum, you will see the dozens and  dozens and dozens of documentation of the treaties that have been  executed and violated in this country.   But the rich culture and heritage of Native Americans have still come  through all of these hardships. They have been an indelible and  undeniable impact on the American way of life. I am reminded of that  every single day in my community.   In fact, I hail from Wisconsin, where Earth Day was inaugurated by  the late, great Senator Gaylord Nelson because, indeed, one of the  things we have learned in Wisconsin from our Native community is to  have stewardship over our environment, one of the legacies of the  Native peoples.   My home State is proudly home to 11 federally recognized Native  American Tribes, and I am so proud of the many contributions that these  Tribes have made to the cultural and economic richness of my State. In  fact, the city of Milwaukee, which I represent, has a name that is  derived from some of the Native brothers and sisters who inhabited the  region: the gathering place by the water, the beautiful land, or the  pleasant land. In fact, the host committee from the Democratic National  Convention is called the Good Land Committee.   These Tribes have helped refine and strengthen our State. In my home  city of Milwaukee, the Forest County Potawatomi Foundation has not  shied away from helping to address some of the most intractable  problems facing our communities, including high unemployment, access to  basic and higher education, ensuring better access to healthcare, and  reducing health disparities, among other things.   I am so inspired by the dedication of the Forest County Potawatomi to  invest in Milwaukee and to give a helping hand to those serving the  most vulnerable in the broader community, from young children to  seniors in our community.   In my life as an elected official, first at the State level and now  in Congress, I have had so many wonderful friends and allies in the  Tribal community. As a matter of fact, I grew up in a community where I  had many friends, and I learned so many things from my Native friends.   I am extremely honored to now serve in this body with the first  Native American women--what a difference one session makes--who have  been elected to this body and to be able to work across the aisle, even  before they arrived, with concerned colleagues with Native backgrounds,  such as Mr. Cole and Mr. Young, on legislation to address the needs of  Native Americans.   Madam Speaker, I want to take just a few seconds, if the gentlewoman  from New Mexico will indulge me, to reinforce my commitment to the  first peoples of this Nation. As they are citizens of this Nation, I  want to remind the body that Native people are dual citizens. Because  of their treaty rights--and it is in the Constitution--they are  sovereign nations, and we ought to double down on our efforts of the  Federal Government to fully live up to these trust obligations.   Unfortunately, the history of our country is not the same as our  aspirations. Our country's policies toward our Tribal communities is  not a proud one. It actually is quite horrifying, which is why  remembering, commemorating, and celebrating our Native brothers and  sisters is so important, in order to remember the great things but also  to remind us of where we have fallen short so that we learn from our  past and that our history never repeats itself.   You have heard some of the things that my sister Deb Haaland has  talked about here. She talked about the abrogation of families and  moving Native American people into assimilation programs. Part of that  legacy has come to pass because we have not protected the sanctity of  our Tribal obligations, respected sovereignty, and promoted the  political, economic, and social self-determination for Native American  communities. This is of paramount importance if we are not to repeat  the same negative legacy.   As we celebrate this month, let us rededicate ourselves to the  numerous bills and initiatives that can help make a difference to our  Native brothers and sisters. Let this not be just some moment, some  little 5 minute or Special Order talking about how wonderful Native  Americans are.   One of our key legislative priorities this year is a strong  reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. For too long, non- Native men could assault Native American women with impunity. The  Violence Against Women Act that passed the House earlier this year,  sitting over in the Senate graveyard, would take more steps to end this  [[Page H9051]]  scourge by empowering Native law enforcement and Native courts to  protect Native American women and children from domestic violence.   The need for affordable housing in Indian Country cannot be  overstated. Some of the poorest and most remote communities in this  country are Native American communities. Native American elders and  children are living in deteriorated housing with mold and structures  that cannot protect them against the harsh environment.   NAHASDA, the Native American Housing Assistance and Self- Determination Act, provides Tribal governments the ability to provide  safe and affordable housing to Tribal communities that is consistent  with their status as sovereigns. We need to stop punting and finally  undertake a real reauthorization to unlock the potential of these  programs to improve housing for all Native Americans. I continue to  work with House and Senate colleagues to find a path forward so we can  finally have this program reauthorized.
