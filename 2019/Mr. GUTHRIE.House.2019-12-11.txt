 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise  today in opposition to H.R. 3.   Two of the issues that I often hear about back home are robocalls and  drug prices. Last week, despite ideological differences on both sides  of the aisle, we came together to address robocalls. I am disappointed  that the same cannot be said for drug prices.   Republicans, Democrats, President Trump, doctors, pharmacists,  patients, we all want lower drug prices. Yet, the Democrats have chosen  to pursue partisan poison pill legislation that will go nowhere.   I was proud to cosponsor the Lower Costs, More Cures Act, a bill that  includes only bipartisan solutions to lower drug prices. My Democratic  colleagues have agreed to these provisions in the past. The Lower  Costs, More Cures Act will allow the continuation of lifesaving  innovation in healthcare research while lowering drug prices for  Kentuckians.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose H.R. 3, and I urge my colleagues to support  the Lower Costs, More Cures Act.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the consequences of  the drug pricing bill H.R. 3.   There is no doubt we must act to lower prescription drug prices for  Americans and for Americans to pay only their fair share. However, this  bill is not the right path.   We often hear stories about the way other countries pay for their  drugs and other country payment systems. What you don't often hear are  stories about patients who are unable to receive care and access to  lifesaving drugs because of the limitations in their country.   For Louise Moorhouse, we have examples of how much less is offered in  these other countries, but it is personal. For example, Louise  Moorhouse is a teacher in England. Hope was within reach when she  enrolled in a trial for Kuvan, a drug used to treat PKU, a rare genetic  metabolic disorder. If left untreated, the disease can result in mild  to severe neurological issues.   When Louise was in the clinical trial for Kuvan, she was able to eat  and function like anyone else. Sadly, Louise discovered after the trial  that the drug that helped her live a more normal life was not covered  by the United Kingdom's National Health Service.   Despite the agency's acknowledgment of the drug's efficacy, as the  drug is not covered by the NHS, she no longer has access to this drug.  Instead, she has returned to taking 80 pills a day, in conjunction with  a highly restrictive diet.                                time  2130    In the United States, we have access to innovative drugs. The keyword  is ``access.''   When people talk about H.R. 3, what they want to say is that we can  completely transform the way we pay for drugs and never talk about or  never even acknowledge the way we completely transform the way we  receive and have access to drugs. We know that from the Congressional  Budget Office.   There are other studies that say we can lose 100 different cures that  are coming down the path. So, as Americans want relief from  prescription drug prices, Americans also want access to these  innovative drugs.   President Carter is alive today because of access to one of his  experimental drugs that are becoming lower cost and more affordable for  everyone.   My point is there doesn't have to be a choice. We can have both. We  can have lower prices and not completely lose access to these drugs and  continue the great innovation that we have.   That choice is H.R. 19. It is a bill that will be on the floor  tomorrow. Every bit of it is bipartisan. Every single piece of it has a  Republican and a Democrat cosponsor. It is something we know the Senate  will take up and the President will sign and give relief to the  American people and continue to give access to the great innovations  that we have.   Madam Speaker, I hope that we can take that bill up tomorrow, and I  thank the gentleman for yielding.
