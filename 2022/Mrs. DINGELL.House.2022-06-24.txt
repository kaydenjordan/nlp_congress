 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Bipartisan  Safer Communities Act. It is past time that Congress take action to end  the gun violence epidemic that is harming communities across the  Nation. We need to protect all people who are vulnerable to gun  violence, and this includes survivors of domestic abuse.   Existing Federal laws allow abusive dating partners to access  firearms. Known as the ``dating partner loophole,'' this dangerous gap  in Federal law puts survivors of domestic abuse at risk every day.   I thank people for including this and acknowledging that this is an  issue. However, it is critical that the Department of Justice swiftly  issue regulations and definitions pertaining to the implementation of  the dating partner provisions.   The definition of ``dating relationship'' in this act is not intended  to be overly restrictive, and the definition should be broadly  constructed to cover dating relationships as commonly understood in the  Violence Against Women Act.    Mr. Speaker, intimate partner violence is a serious  issue, and 50 percent of domestic violence fatalities are caused by  their intimate partner. I understand this. I lived in it.   Let's be clear: this is a significant bill. We have made progress,  but we have more work to do.                                time  1215     Mr. Speaker, I rise to enter into a colloquy with my  esteemed colleague from California, Congressman Mike Thompson,  regarding the S. 2938, Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.   Mr. Thompson, is it your understanding and intent in supporting this  bill that the Department of Justice promulgate regulations pertaining  to Section 12005?   Is it further your understanding and intent in supporting this bill  that the Department of Justice in those regulations define the meaning  of the terms `serious,' `continuing,' `recent,' and `recently?'    Mr. Speaker, I am glad for the clarification from the  gentleman from California and pleased to know it is the legislative  intent that the Department of Justice promulgate regulations to govern  the application of section 12005, including defining the terms  `serious,' `recent,' and `recently.' A consistent and authoritative  interpretation of these terms that is reflective of the lived  experiences of survivors of dating violence is critical to the  successful implementation of this section.   Rulemaking is necessary to both ensure that in its application, the  law actually protects victims of dating violence and to stave off  chaos. A lack of clearly defined terms will encourage trial level  litigation into the specifics of the intimate relationship. State  judges who are adjudicating these cases will be determining the  relationship between the victim and the perpetrator based on the laws  of their state. The introduction of `serious,' `continuing,' and  `recent' should not be read to require judges to include specific  findings of seriousness or continuity. Instead, the existence of a  dating relationship must be determined based on the enumerated factors  set forth in subparagraph (B) of this section, with the acknowledgment  that a finding of a dating relationship under a state law with a  definition that is substantially similar to federal law constitutes a  finding of `dating relationship' for the purpose of this section.   For example, in my state of Michigan, the term `dating relationship'  means `frequent, intimate associations primarily characterized by the  expectation of affectional involvement. This term does not include a  casual relationship or an ordinary fraternization between two  individuals in a business or social context.' This very clearly  parallels the definition of `dating relationship' in the Bipartisan  Safer Communities Act, and a finding of a `dating relationship' under  Michigan law must constitute a finding of a `dating relationship' for  the purposes of this section.   The Bipartisan Safe Communities Act shrinks the dating loophole, but  it does not eliminate it. I will keep leading the fight to fully close  it in future legislation. No dating abuser who has shown by his actions  that he poses a danger to his victim, whose actions led to the issuance  of a protective order after a hearing, should be legally allowed to  possess firearms for the duration of the order.
