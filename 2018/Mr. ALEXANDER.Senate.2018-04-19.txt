 Mr. President, today I would like to express my  support for S. 140, an act to amend the White Mountain Apache Tribe  Water Rights Quantification Act of 2010 to clarify the use of amounts  in the WMAT Settlement Fund.   The Senate initially passed this legislation on May 8, 2017, by  unanimous consent. The House of Representatives passed this legislation  on January 10, 2018, with an amendment. That amendment adds an  important provision safeguarding the sovereignty of Native American  tribes.   This new provision was the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act, introduced  by Senator Moran. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs voted to  favorably report the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act by voice vote, with  only three committee members requesting to be recorded as voting  against the bill, on February 17, 2017.   Private sector labor relations in the United States are regulated by  the National Labor Relations Act, NLRA. Created in 1935, the National  Labor Relations Board, NLRB, administers the NLRA. The five members of  the NLRB have 5-year, staggered terms. I am pleased the Senate recently  confirmed Mr. John Ring, a well-qualified nominee, to a position on the  NLRB.   The NLRA seeks to mitigate and eliminate labor-related impediments to  the free flow of commerce. The law exempts ``the United States or any  Federal Reserve Bank, or any State or political subdivision thereof . .  .'' from NLRB jurisdiction. However, the NLRA is silent about the  application of the law to Native American Tribes.   In its 1976 Fort Apache Timber Co. case, the NLRB held ``individual  Indians and Indian tribal governments, at least on reservation lands,  are generally free from state or even in most instances Federal  intervention, unless Congress specifically provided to the contrary.''   However, in a 2004 decision, San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino, the  NLRB reversed Fort Apache Timber Co. The NLRB held that the NLRA could  be applied to commercial activity on tribal lands.   Under San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino, the NLRB applies a  subjective test to determine whether it will assert jurisdiction. If  the activity is commercial, it asserts jurisdiction; if the NLRB  determines the activity is a traditional tribal or government function,  the board does not assert jurisdiction.   Native American Tribes are sovereign and, as such, should be treated  the same as State and local governments under the NLRA. S. 140, as  amended by the House of Representatives, would amend the NLRA to  include ``any Indian tribe, or any enterprise or institution owned and  operated by an Indian tribe and located on its Indian lands,'' to the  list of other exempted entities, such as State and local governments.   Under the bill, an ``Indian tribe'' would be defined as ``any Indian  tribe, band, nation, pueblo, or other organized group or community  which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services  provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as  Indians.''   I commend Senator Moran for his leadership on Tribal labor  sovereignty, and I hope the Senate will pass the legislation so it can  be signed into law.                            ____________________
