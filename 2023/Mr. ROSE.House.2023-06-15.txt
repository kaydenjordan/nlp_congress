 Madam Speaker, the Constitution is clear. The people's  elected Representatives, Congress, have the power to legislate, and the  courts have judicial authority.   Unfortunately, in recent years, those powers have been diluted by  overreaching and unelected administrative branch bureaucrats that  believe they are the sole arbiters when it comes to administering  policies, not the American people through their Representatives.   Regardless of which political party is in office, both Republicans  and Democrats alike should be concerned about willfully giving away  their constituents' voices when deciding pressing matters.   The Separation of Powers Restoration Act, which I am proud to  support, would restore a separate but equal government our Founding  Fathers intended and give back to the people, the American people and  their Representatives the capacity to make policy. This is as common  sense as it gets and should draw wide bipartisan support.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in voting ``yes'' on  H.R. 288.                            ____________________
