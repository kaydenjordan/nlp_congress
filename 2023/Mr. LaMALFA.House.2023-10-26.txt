 Mr. Speaker, a recent study that has taken over 10 years  by the University of Idaho has shown that cattle and sage grouse can  indeed coexist.   There has been a great battle for many years over the sage grouse  habitat in Western States, including in my own district in northern  California, and the interaction of cattle on that, whether grazing is  appropriate or not.   It is found during the study that not only is there no net negative  effect for light to medium grazing but that it actually can be a  positive benefit in helping to move about the soil and increase the  insect biomass that is important for the grouse itself.   The idea of it being a negative has been dispelled by a very long and  comprehensive study. It goes to show that what mankind can do with the  interaction of nature can be very positive.   Grazing is also very well adapted to fire safety as a plus in our  forested areas, as well. We need more to be done by the U.S. Forest  Service to have grazing be part of the solution for wildfire in Western  States.                            ____________________
