 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to honor two exceptional  North Carolina women who left us this year, former Senator Dr. Katie  Dorsett and former Representative Mary McAllister. I admired and was  friends with both of them.   They were both educators who went into public service, proud products  of historically Black colleges and universities. Both advocates on  behalf of African Americans, they founded and led organizations to  combat sickle cell anemia.   They both knew the highs of winning elected office and doing  exceptional work for their constituents and the lows of personal  tragedy. Both women were predeceased by a child they loved like a best  friend.   They were both county commissioners and State legislators and, most  of all, trailblazers.   Katie Dorsett was the first Black woman on the Greensboro City  Council, and I was proud to follow in her footsteps. After serving on  the city council, she was elected to the county board of commissioners  and went on to serve in Governor Hunt's administration and the North  Carolina State Senate. We served together in the General Assembly, and  Katie was a longtime friend and mentor whose friendship I cherished.   When the Greensboro News and Record remembered her in July, they  wrote: ``She carried herself with dignity and always spoke her mind.''   That was Katie. She was a great leader and a strong advocate for her  community, and the State of North Carolina is poorer without her.   Mary McAllister was also a legislator, a county commissioner who  broke barriers for Black women. She was the first Black woman to win a  countywide election in Cumberland County, North Carolina. She changed  the way the county commission elected commissioners so she wouldn't be  the last.   A fountain of confidence, Mary had a sense of humor, and she could  build relationships with anyone. She wasn't afraid to stand up to the  good ol' boys club in the legislature, and we became fast friends. It  is no surprise that her first campaign slogan was ``Mary Has Moxie.''   I am humbled to have the opportunity to honor these strong,  phenomenal women on the floor today.   Thank you, Mary, and thank you, Katie, for opening doors for the next  generation of Black women leaders. I am here on the floor of the U.S.  House today because you crossed the threshold first.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the conscience of the  Court and one of the greatest fighters American women have ever had.  Justice Ginsburg's dissents spoke for all of us--with a righteous  anger, a moral clarity, and an eye to equality.   Her lifetime of advocacy for women extended far beyond her service on  the bench.   Though she is irreplaceable, Justice Ginsburg will have a successor.  But Americans deserve better than an impeached President's last-minute  nomination just weeks before the election.   We must honor Justice Ginsburg's dying wish that she not be replaced  until the next President is installed. This nominee will shape the  future of our country, and the American people deserve a say.                            ____________________
