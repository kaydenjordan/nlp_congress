 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 4952) to direct the Secretary of Health and  Human Services to conduct a study and submit a report on the effects of  the inclusion of quality increases in the determination of blended  benchmark amounts under part C of the Medicare program, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4952         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Seniors Access to       Quality Benefits Act''.       SEC. 2. DETERMINATION OF BLENDED BENCHMARK AMOUNT STUDY.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the inclusion of quality increases in the determination of       blended benchmark amounts under section 1853(n)(4) of the       Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-23(n)(4)) undermines the       goal of delivering high-quality care under the Medicare       program under title XVIII of such Act.        (b) Study and Report.--Not later than one year after the       date of enactment of this section, the Secretary of Health       and Human Services, in consultation with relevant       stakeholders, shall conduct a study and submit to Congress a       report on the effects of the inclusion of quality percentage       increases under section 1853(n)(5) of such Act in the       determination of blended benchmark amounts under section       1853(n)(4) of such Act. Such study and report shall include       an analysis of the following:        (1) The authority of the Secretary to remove such increases       from the determination of such amounts.        (2) The effects of including such increases in the       determination of such amounts on Medicare Advantage       organizations (including the effects on any contracts entered       into by such organizations).        (3) The financial impact of including such increases in the       determination of such amounts by county.        (4) The effects of including such increases in the       determination of such amounts on individuals enrolled in a       plan under part C of title XVIII of such Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4952,  currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 4952, the Improving Seniors Access to  Quality Benefits Act, will allow us to take a deeper look at how the  Medicare Advantage benchmark cap is affecting people across the Nation.  I have been working with Mr. Kind and other Members to address this  inequity that affects seniors in high-quality plans across the country.   The Medicare Advantage program was designed to give seniors a choice  in their healthcare and utilize the private  [[Page H7116]]  sector to provide better care and benefits. Medicare Advantage plans  receive a capitated payment rate to cover the patient's total cost of  care. In order to encourage quality, seniors enrolled in high-quality  plans receive a quality bonus payment that goes directly to seniors in  the form of reduced cost sharing or extra benefits.   The Medicare Advantage program is very popular and has been working  well for many years. In my district in western Pennsylvania, more than  half of Medicare beneficiaries choose Medicare Advantage. Nationwide,  Medicare Advantage enrollment has grown to 30 percent of Medicare  beneficiaries. That number is even higher with 48 percent of the  Hispanic and 38 percent of African American Medicare beneficiaries  choosing Medicare Advantage.   Unfortunately, the Affordable Care Act implemented a cap on payments  to Medicare Advantage plans. This misguided benchmark cap policy has  penalized approximately 5.8 million American seniors being denied  important benefits like care coordination, vision, dental, and wellness  programs.   This issue has cost seniors in my district and across the country  millions of dollars in benefits that they are entitled to. We talk  often about paying for value in the Medicare program, and this policy  undermines that goal.   The benchmark cap is clearly a problem, and we need more information  on it. The Improving Seniors Access to Quality Benefits Act requires  the Secretary of HHS to analyze and report to Congress on the impact of  including quality bonus payments in the Medicare Advantage benchmark  cap. It also establishes a sense of Congress that this issue undermines  the goal of delivering high-quality care in the Medicare program.   It is my understanding that the Department of Health and Human  Services has limited secretarial authority to make this change on its  own. I hope to work together with the Secretary on policies such as  this to encourage high-quality plans for seniors.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation has broad support from many  stakeholders, including America's Health Insurance Plans, the Better  Medicare Alliance, the Healthcare Leadership Council, Meals on Wheels  America, the National Minority Quality Forum, the Alliance of Community  Health Plans, and many others.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this legislation, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                        Committee on Ways and Means,                                        House of Representatives,                                      Washington, DC, July 13, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden: I write to you regarding H.R. 4952,       the ``Improving Seniors Access to Quality Benefits Act'' the       Committee on Ways and Means ordered favorably reported that       was also referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce.        I ask that the Committee on Energy and Commerce waive       formal consideration of the bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House Floor.        I acknowledge that by waiving formal consideration of the       bill, the Committee on Energy and Commerce is in no way       waiving its jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in       those provisions of the bills that fall within your Rule X       jurisdiction. I would support your effort to seek appointment       of an appropriate number of conferees on any House-Senate       conference involving this legislation.        I will include a copy of our letters in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this legislation on the House       floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Energy and             Commerce,                                     Washington, DC, July 16, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for your letters regarding       H.R. 4952, the ``Improving Seniors Access to Quality Benefits       Act,'' H.R. 6138, the ``Ambulatory Surgical Center (ACS)       Payment Transparency Act of 2018,'' and H.R. 6311, the ``To       amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the Patient       Protection and Affordable Care Act to modify the definition       of qualified health plan for purposes of the health insurance       premium tax credit and to allow individuals purchasing health       insurance in the individual market to purchase a lower       premium copper plan.''        The Committee on Energy and Commerce will forgo       consideration of both bills so that they may proceed       expeditiously to the House Floor.        I appreciate your assurance that by forgoing action on       these bills, the Committee is in no way waiving its       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in the bills.       I also appreciate your offer of support for the appointment       of conferees from the Committee to any House-Senate       conference involving this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, it is estimated that the ACA's benchmark cap negatively  impacts more than 40 percent of counties across our country. The  Improving Seniors Access to Quality Benefits Act will require the  Secretary to fully evaluate the impact of including quality bonus  payments under the benchmark cap on our seniors residing in these  counties.   This bill was brought through the committee process in a bipartisan  fashion. Now on the floor, I strongly recommend my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to vote in favor of H.R. 4952 to ensure seniors are  not missing out on additional healthcare benefits or reduced cost  sharing as a result of the ACA's benchmark cap.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
