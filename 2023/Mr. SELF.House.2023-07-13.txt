 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the contributions to  western civilization by the Iron Lady of the U.K., Margaret Thatcher.   In an era characterized by rapid social and economic change, America  finds itself at a crossroads. The principles that once made our Nation  a beacon of freedom and prosperity are under attack on multiple fronts.   In the midst of these consequential times, our attention should turn  to one of history's most influential leaders, Great Britain's Prime  Minister Margaret Thatcher. Her unwavering commitment to fiscally  responsible principles and resolute leadership skills provide  invaluable lessons for an America pushing back against a growing tide  of socialism.   Margaret Thatcher understood that the engine of a thriving economy  lies in the power of free markets. Her resolute vision of limiting the  size and scope of government, disassembling monopolies, and lowering  taxes revitalized the British economy.   Similarly, America needs a decisive leader, steadfast and determined  to thwart the death spiral of out-of-control spending and woke cultural  influences that have migrated from academia to boardrooms, and now into  public policy.   While President Ronald Reagan's policies helped subdue the threat of  communism abroad, different qualities are needed to decapitate the  snake emerging from within our current culture. Prime Minister Thatcher  inherited a kingdom in decay, struggling with much of what ails America  today. From her lonely perch at number 10 Downing Street, through what  seemed to be sheer will and determination, from the ash heap of  history, a United Kingdom rose on her shoulders.   Thatcher's unapologetic patriotism and emphasis on national  sovereignty resonated with people from all walks of life all over the  world. In an era of globalization, America must safeguard its financial  interests, values, and identity. A leader cut from the same cloth as  Margaret Thatcher would prioritize secure borders, promote American  jobs, and ensure that our national interests are not compromised by  supranational organizations.   By reaffirming our commitment to sovereignty, we can forge a future  where America's interests are always at the forefront of our  decisionmaking process.   Prime Minister Thatcher's vision of a free society extended beyond  economics. She was a staunch defender of individual liberty,  recognizing that government should serve as a protector, not as a nanny  state. She understood the immorality of socialism. She trusted  individuals to make their own choices, championed personal  responsibility, and promoted self-reliance.   America needs a leader who upholds these timeless virtues, resists  the encroachment of woke ideologies, and recognizes the pitfalls of  out-of-control spending that bloats the bureaucracy that seems to  dictate every aspect of our lives.   As socialism gains traction in America's political discourse, it is  crucial to remember the destructive consequences of such policies in  the past. Thatcher recognized the pitfalls of collectivism, firmly  rejecting the notion of big government's corrosive effect on individual  liberty and economic growth.   She recognized the critical aspect that socialism is not only  economically inefficient, but is immoral. By advocating for free-market  principles and resisting the deceptive allure of socialism, America can  maintain its foundation as the land of opportunity and avoid the  pitfalls that led to the demise of other republics such as the Greek  and Roman Empires.   Margaret Thatcher's leadership provides an inspiring template for  America to follow. Her legacy reminds us that the preservation of  individual freedom and fiduciary trust are paramount for the survival  of prosperous economies.   As our challenges mount, we need a leader who embraces the principles  of economic freedom, national sovereignty, individual liberty, and  personal responsibility. Thatcher's unwavering resolve, steadfast  values, and commitment to commonsense policies serve as a powerful  reminder of the transformative impact a leader can make.   America needs a bold leader whose focus is riveted on reviving our  Nation's spirit, restoring our economy, and defending the principles  that have made us exceptional. Adhering to Maggie Thatcher's legacy  will guide us toward a brighter future that ensures America remains a  shining example of freedom, prosperity, and opportunity for generations  to come.                            ____________________
