 Madam Chairman, we all deplore and mourn the  monstrous, despicable, and evil massacre in Charleston. But that  terrible crime was committed 67 days after the perpetrator applied to  purchase the firearm.   As Mr. Collins said, this was preventable if, under current law, it  was a failure of the FBI and not of the law.   This bill is not about public safety. Most gun predators already get  their firearms illegally. A recent Johns Hopkins study found that  California's universal background check had no effect on gun violence.   Their true objective is to make gun ownership by law-abiding people  so legally hazardous and so bureaucratically time-consuming that people  simply give up. This bill cleverly and, I believe, insidiously sets up  a potentially never-ending bureaucratic review process.   As Mr. Collins said, a background check is only good for 30 calendar  days from the day you apply. But this bill sets up a 20-business-day  delay process. Now, what that means is, if a single holiday falls  within that window, or the store is closed on weekends, or you slip a  single day on that timetable, your background check is no longer valid,  and you have to start all over again in a perpetual cycle of Kafkaesque  proportions.   Now, would a bureaucracy be so abusive as to play this game? Well, of  course it would. Just ask Lois Lerner.
