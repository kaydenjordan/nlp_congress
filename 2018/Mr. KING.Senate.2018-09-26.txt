 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Sunrise  County Economic Council of Washington County as they celebrate their  25th anniversary. Founded using funds left over from the Quoddy Job  Opportunity Zone, an initiative from then-Governor John McKernan, SCEC  has used a grassroots approach to economic development in Washington  County. They have worked tirelessly across political, economic, and  municipal boundaries to promote development in one of the least  populated counties in the State.   SCEC was founded in 1993 by a group of businesses and community  leaders to promote economic and community development. SCEC brings  together community-focused businesses, not-for-profit organizations,  municipalities, and citizens to all work together to create jobs and  promote prosperity in Washington County. During my time as Governor, we  created the Investing in Washington County initiative, which was a  partnership between SCEC and State agencies working through the cabinet  subcommittee on economic development. Since then, SCEC has been  dedicated to job creation and development and continues to play a vital  role in Maine's economic prosperity.   Today SCEC has several programs and initiatives to achieve their  goals to improve their community and promote development. One of these  programs is Family Futures Downeast. This program aims to break the  cycle of poverty by providing children with a safe, secure environment,  high-quality education, and supporting parents through postsecondary  education and career development. Parents enroll at the University of  Maine Machias or Washington County Community College and their children  are enrolled in early-education programs right on campus. Families  receive support from a variety of partners, including college  preparatory and tutoring services, workforce training, career  counseling, and financial support. This program is life-changing for  parents and children. Thanks to the program, children are thriving in  high-quality childcare, parents can pursue opportunities without  worrying about their children's care, and parents are on path to long- term, higher-paying jobs right in Washington County.   Another SCEC program is the Washington County Leadership Institute.  Founded in 1997, the institute provides Washington County citizens with  the skills, insight, and professional network to be more effective  leaders in their communities. Participants come from all sectors,  including small business, finance, education, tourism, healthcare,  nonprofit, and municipal government. Institute graduates have gone on  to serve on planning boards, school boards, filled a variety of  volunteer positions, and served in the legislature.   I am honored to join all of the communities of Washington County and  the entire State of Maine in congratulating Sunrise County Economic  Council for 25 years of incredible work. I look forward to their  continued growth and service to the State, and I thank them for their  dedication to making Maine such a special place to call home.                            ____________________
