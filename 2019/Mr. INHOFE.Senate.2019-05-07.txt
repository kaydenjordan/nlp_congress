 Madam President, today I wish to honor Lieutenant Colonel  Richard ``Dick'' Cole, of the United States Air Force, who was the last  living link of the Doolittle Raiders and passed away on April 9 at the  age of 103. The Doolittle Raiders were comprised of 80 heroic U.S. Army  Air Forces airmen who flew 16 modified B-25 Mitchell bombers off the  USS Hornet aircraft carrier on the first Allied retaliatory strike on  the Japanese Home Islands, just a few months after Pearl Harbor.   In an age before midair refueling and GPS, the USS Hornet weighed  less than a quarter of today's fortress-like aircraft carriers. With  then-Lt. Cole as the copilot to then-Lt. Col. Jimmy  [[Page S2682]]  Doolittle, the B-25 Mitchell bomber #40-2344, would take off with only  467 feet of takeoff distance. This audacious and unprecedented raid was  a one-way mission against enormous odds. What made the mission all the  more challenging was a sighting by a Japanese patrol boat that prompted  the task force commander, U.S. Navy Adm. William Halsey, to launch the  mission more than 650 nautical miles from Japan, 10 hours early and 170  nautical miles farther than originally planned. Flying at wavetop level  around 200 feet with their radios turned off, Cole and the Raiders  avoided detection for as much of the distance as possible. In groups of  two to four aircraft, the bombers targeted dry docks, armories, oil  refineries, and aircraft factories in Yokohama, Nagoya, Osaka and Kobe,  as well as Tokyo itself. The Japanese air defenses were so caught off  guard by the Raiders that little anti-aircraft fire was volleyed and  only one Japanese Zero followed in pursuit. With their bombs delivered,  the Raiders flew towards safety in nonoccupied China, but had to bail  out when their aircraft ran out of fuel.   The bombing mission sent a message that America was ready to fight  back, and bolstered spirits on the home front. Lt. Col. Cole remained  in the China-Burma-India Theater flying combat and transport missions  from May 1942 to June 1943, followed by service with the 5th Fighter  Group in Tulsa, OK, from June to October 1943. He retired from the Air  Force on December 31, 1966, as a command pilot with more than 5,000  flight hours in 30 different aircraft, amassing more than 250 combat  missions and more than 500 combat hours. His decorations include the  Distinguished Flying Cross with two oakleaf clusters; Air Medal with  oakleaf cluster; Bronze Star Medal; Air Force Commendation Medal; and  Chinese Army, Navy, Air Corps Medal, Class A, First Grade. All  Doolittle Raiders were also awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in May  2014.   In his final years, Lt. Col. Cole remained a familiar face at Air  Force events in the San Antonio area and toured Air Force schoolhouses  and installations to promote the spirit of service among new  generations of airmen. On September 19, 2016, Lt. Col. Cole was present  during the naming ceremony for the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider, named  in honor of the Doolittle Raiders. While he may have slipped the surly  bonds of earth to reunite with his fellow Raiders, his legacy will  forever live on in the hearts and minds of Americans.   On behalf of my colleagues in the U.S. Senate, I wish to offer our  eternal thanks to Lt. Col. Cole and our condolences to his family. May  we never forget the courage and honor of the Doolittle Raiders.                            ____________________
