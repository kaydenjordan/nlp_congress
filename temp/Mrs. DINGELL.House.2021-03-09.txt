 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the PRO  Act.   This bill supports workers in this country by implementing meaningful  and enforceable penalties for companies that violate workers' rights.   It expands accessibility to collective bargaining and closes  loopholes used to exploit workers while strengthening workers' access  to fair union elections.   Unions are the bedrock of our Nation's prosperity and success. Many  of us have been impacted by their good work. Healthcare benefits,  pensions, safe working conditions, vacations, and holidays, teacher-to- student ratios, nurse-to-patient ratios were all negotiated and pushed  forward by unions. Too many of us take for granted benefits that we  enjoy because of hard-fought battles by unions.   A January 2021 Bureau of Labor Statistics report highlights that  nonunion worker median weekly earnings were 84 percent of earnings for  workers who were union members. Further research also underscores that  strong unions lead to higher wages for all workers, regardless of their  union status.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the International  Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers.          International Federation of Professional & Technical             Engineers, AFL-CIO & CLC,                                     Washington, DC, March 8, 2021.        Dear Representative: On behalf of 90,000 workers       represented by the International Federation of Professional       and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), we urge you to vote for the       Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2021, H.R. 842 (PRO       Act). The bipartisan PRO Act, sponsored by House Education       and Labor Chair Bobby Scott, restores the original intent of       the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (NLRA) and levels       the playing field between workers who want to form unions and       employers who exploit weaknesses in the current law to       frustrate union organizing drives and interfere with workers'       legal rights to organize and bargain collectively.        If enacted, the PRO Act would counter the all-too-common       anti-union intimidation tactics that workers who are       organizing a union are subjected to. For example, upwards of       50 professionals employed by Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF)       are currently voting by mail to form a union with the       Nonprofit Professional Employees Union-IFPTE Local 70 (NPEU)       so that they can have a voice in creating a workplace that is       anti-racist, cooperative, equitable, inclusive, just,       respectful, and transparent. These are attorneys, legislative       affairs professionals, and communications professionals whose       personal and professional dedication to their work ties their       working conditions to ALDF's mission. Unfortunately, the       employer's anti-union campaign has included spending       undisclosed resources to hire an anti-union firm to engage in       some of the very anti-worker behavior that this bill seeks to       correct. This includes activities such as weekly coercive       union avoidance meetings and anti-union communication filled       with misinformation, intimidation aimed at discouraging union       activity, as well as misclassifying employees as management       ahead of the unionization vote.        This bill meaningfully restores workers' rights to       determine for themselves if they want a union by providing a       fair process for union recognition if the National Labor       Relations Board (NLRB) determines that the employer illegally       interfered with the union representation election. Provisions       in the bill also allow the union or the employer to request a       mediation-arbitration process for first contract negotiations       that take longer than 90 days. Language in this bill that       prohibits captive audience meetings and reinstates the       requirement that employers disclose the hiring of and       compensation for anti-union consultants will help workers       make informed choices when they receive information from       their employers. By clarifying and updating the NLRA's       definitions for employee, supervisor, and employer, the PRO       Act clarifies the definition of joint employer and closes       loopholes that allow employers to misclassify workers.       Furthermore, this bill gives the NLRB the authority to       conduct economic analysis as it sets policies and       regulations, increases penalties against employers who       violate the NLRA, requires employers to reinstate workers       while the NLRB investigates the retaliatory firing, and gives       unions the ability to collect fair-share fees.        For all the reasons above, IFPTE requests you vote for the       PRO Act. We urge you to vote against any amendments that       weaken sections of the bill, especially sections that       prohibit and prevent the misclassification of workers.       Further, IFPTE is hopeful that the Rules Committee makes in       order and the House approves Rep. Andy Levin's SAFE Act as a       part of the underlying bill. The inclusion of this provision       would remove the longstanding NLRB prohibition against       administering union elections electronically.        Thank you for considering our request. Should you have any       questions, please feel free to contact either of us.            Sincerely,      Paul Shearon,        President.      Matthew Biggs,        Secretary-Treasurer/Legislative Director.
