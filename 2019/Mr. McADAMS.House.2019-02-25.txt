 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 47, the Natural  Resources Management Act, which we will vote on tomorrow. This  comprehensive public lands package has numerous provisions that benefit  my State of Utah and makes permanent the Land and Water Conservation  Fund.   In my district, this legislation provides an important land  conveyance to Juab County that will be used to house personnel to  prevent and fight wildfires. This bill also facilitates a land transfer  in Utah County to Utah's School and Institutional Trust Lands  Administration, or SITLA.   SITLA holds lands in trust, proceeds which support Utah's education  system. This land transfer will ultimately benefit Utah State  University and its students.   I also want to congratulate my colleague, Representative   John  Curtis, for his work in bringing together and working with State, city,  and county stakeholders in Emery County. The Emery County title in this  bill has broad local support and will protect over 600,000 acres of  wilderness, the largest wilderness designation in 25 years.   This legislation is good for Utah's economy. The Land and Water  Conservation Fund should never have been allowed to expire because it  is such a vital program.                            ____________________
