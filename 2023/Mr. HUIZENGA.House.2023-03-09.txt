 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service  of Lieutenant Ethan Quillen.   On Wednesday, February 22, volunteer firefighter Ethan Quillen  responded to a downed power line call during a severe ice storm that  swept through his hometown of Paw Paw, Michigan.   He acted like so many other volunteer firemen around the country. His  incredible life of service was tragically ended in the line of duty  when a falling tree struck a high voltage power line that he was  standing under.   Ethan had volunteered at the fire department since 2019, eventually  working his way up to lieutenant. He was a father, a husband, a Marine  Corps veteran, and a hero, a hero who for the well-being of his fellow  Americans and Paw Paw neighbors consistently put service over self  while asking for nothing in return.   On behalf of the people of Paw Paw, Michigan, the Fourth  Congressional District, the State of Michigan, and our Nation, I  recognize and thank Ethan for his service and his sacrifice and pray  for blessings and peace for his family.                            ____________________
