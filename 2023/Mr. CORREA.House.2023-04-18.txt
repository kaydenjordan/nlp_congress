 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Cal State Fullerton's  president Fram Virjee and his spouse and partner of 37 years, Julie. I  congratulate both of them on their upcoming retirement after more than  5 years at Cal State Fullerton.   As president of Cal State Fullerton, the largest university today in  California, Fram and his great partner, Julie, have been part of the  Titan community. Under both their leaderships, Cal State Fullerton is  today the largest university in California and is number one in  graduating women in California. Today, Cal State Fullerton is the  number four best bang for your buck university in the United States.   Before coming to Cal State Fullerton, Fram served as executive vice  chancellor, general counsel, and secretary to the board of trustees of  the Cal State University system. Before coming to Cal State University,  Fram was a partner at O'Melveny and Myers.   Fram and Julie are involved in a lot of nonprofits, and they both  founded and have supported the Yambi Rwanda, a nonprofit dedicated to  improving the lives of Rwandans.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate, President Fram Virjee and Julie on their  retirement. I am sure it is not going to be their retirement. As a Cal  State Fullerton alumnus, I am proud to consider them both very good  friends. Go Titans.                            ____________________
