 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman, my friend from Georgia, for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes for debate.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate the rule for this measure, the  Matthew Young Pollard Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Years  2018 and 2019.   Today's bill comes to us through a process that is marginally better  than that which we saw last year. As many of you may remember, last  year, it took my friends on the other side a couple of tries to get the  Intelligence Authorization Act to the floor.   Though that one was, unlike today's bill, cosponsored by the ranking  member, Republicans raised the ire of many of us on this side of the  aisle by trying to move this bill under suspension of the rules. After  that move fell flat, the Republican-led Rules Committee reported the  bill under a closed rule, blocking no fewer than 13 amendments. That  bill, though passed, never saw sunlight in the Senate.   Today's bill avoids some of those avoidable self-inflicted wounds and  is indeed better for it. But unfortunately, drama of some kind or  another seems to follow Intelligence Authorization Acts, no matter  what.  [[Page H6124]]    Last night at the Rules Committee, we witnessed, in my view, the  unprecedented silencing of one of our colleagues. Congresswoman Norma  Torres had just begun her first question of the chairman of the  Intelligence Committee, Mr. Nunes, when she was gaveled down by the  chairman of the House Rules Committee. Subsequently, he abruptly  recessed the meeting.   It is, in my view, Congresswoman Torres' unquestionable right, based  on longstanding committee practice, to question a witness. And it is  absolutely unbelievable and, in my view, a great shame that she was not  able to continue her line of questioning.   When the hearing reconvened after a near 20-minute recess, rather  than answering questions, Chairman Nunes was permitted to leave. He had  made the request, indicating that he had matters before the Ways and  Means Committee.   This was not just unfortunate for Mrs. Torres, but also for the rest  of us on the committee, because during that short recess, the Trump  administration issued its Statement of Administration Policy on today's  underlying bill. Frankly, the administration's statement raised more  questions than it answered.                                time  1230    It would have been helpful to have Mr. Nunes at the hearing so that  we could ask him important and relevant questions about the  administration's statement and what that statement meant for his bill.   Now, I look forward to our meetings returning to normal next week,  and I look forward to them being run as they have been in the past,  with witnesses staying before the committee until all of our members  have been able to ask all of their questions.   Mr. Speaker, the bill is also not without its laudatory provisions.  As my friend from Georgia has mentioned several of them, let me proceed  to add to that particular observation of his.   It increases pay for professionals in the intelligence community who  have expertise in the cyber arena or have extensive knowledge in  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics--all areas that are  crucial to the success of the intelligence community's core mission.   Footnote there: I served for 8 years on the Intelligence Committee,  and I know full well, firsthand, the importance of this particular  aspect of the committee's duties and the agency's duties.   The bill, at the insistence of Democrats on the committee, addresses  Russian meddling in our elections by requiring the intelligence  community to brief key congressional leaders and committees on threat  assessments related to foreign meddling in our Federal elections. The  bill also requires the Director of Intelligence to publicly post a  report on foreign counterintelligence and cybersecurity threats to  Federal election campaigns.   Although these provisions are welcomed, it is beyond any doubt that  more must be done to strengthen our defenses against any foreign  interference in our Federal and State elections and to rebuild  Americans' confidence in the democratic process and in its  institutions.   Mr. Speaker, there has also been good bipartisan work on a matter  that has been, for years, as it is today, near and dear to my heart,  and that is increasing diversity hires and promotions within the  intelligence community. Indeed, I have not stopped championing these  twin causes since leaving the House Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence as its vice chair.   Diversity is a mission imperative for the intelligence community.  Three of my predecessors, two of whom are deceased--Lou Stokes from  Ohio and Julian Dixon from California--as well as my classmate and  colleague Sanford Bishop, who served on the committee as well, worked  assiduously in an effort to increase minorities and give them  opportunities to climb the ranks.   We also, in my view, now need to recruit who will be able to blend  in, speak foreign languages, and understand the cultures in countries  that are now central to our foreign policy interests. At the end of the  day, such diversity is achieved through the hiring process; and,  therefore, we need to ensure that we are hiring more Arab Americans,  Iranian Americans, Pakistani Americans, Chinese Americans, Korean  Americans, and many other Americans from diverse backgrounds as we  confront a myriad of threats and work hard to better understand our  adversaries wherever they may lurk. We do not seek this diversity in  the name of political correctness but, rather, in the name of national  security.   Mr. Speaker, even with these sensible additions, I can understand why  some of my colleagues are reluctant to support today's bill.   When we live in the shadow of a President who is bent on denigrating  the brave men and women of the intelligence community in a brazen  attempt to undermine the crucial work they do on a daily basis; when we  live under the shadow of a President who has, as a candidate for the  highest office in the land, compared those in the intelligence  community to Nazis; when we live under the shadow of a President who is  quicker to take the word of an authoritarian dictator like Vladimir  Putin over the studied and sober word of his own intelligence  community--all positions, by the way, that not only undermine our own  intelligence community, but also the relationships that we have with  allies and the world over--one would be right to pause and consider  whether he or she should vote in favor of handing over immense and  powerful authorities to such a person.   I certainly understand the great cause for concern in handing such  authorities over to this administration. In fact, last night at the  Rules Committee, I offered a sensible amendment, in my view, that would  have reinstated the cybersecurity coordinator on the National Security  Council.   As many may remember, in the not too distant past we had such a  coordinator. Why? Because this country faces, on an hourly and, indeed,  minute-by-minute, second-by-second basis, attempted and sometimes  successful attacks on our Nation's cyber infrastructure, both private  and public. It made sense to President Bush's and President Obama's  administrations to have a person who could coordinate the complicated  responses to these myriad attacks.   The now-President and his national security adviser, on the other  hand, had the inspired idea to jettison the position of cybersecurity  coordinator from the ranks of the National Security Council. Now, the  optics alone of the current administration canning a cybersecurity  coordinator are enough to make one shake one's head, but the real-world  effects of such a misguided and reckless action should be cause for  great concern.   My friends on the other side of the aisle will tell us that sacking  the cybersecurity coordinator was done in the name of bureaucratic  efficiency, when what the Trump administration has really done, in yet  another misguided decision, is make protecting our country more  difficult and more cumbersome.   It is time that Republicans take these threats seriously and stop  aiding and abetting an administration that puts its own personal  interests ahead of those of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Torres), who is my and Mr. Collins' distinguished  colleague on the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I invite, Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Georgia to show me an  example of where we shut down a Member that was asking a question.   And I might add, Chairman Nunes did not send a designee. He came to  the committee himself, and then Mr. LoBiondo, which is not  unprecedented, as you have outlined the numbers, took his position at  that time.   But I know of no time that we have failed to allow a Member of the  committee to ask questions. Can the gentleman give me such an example?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I will take that as my  colleague doesn't have an answer. I will take that as my colleague's  nonresponse to my question with reference to show me a precedent in  that regard. There was none.   I have been on that committee for 16 years, and we talk all over each  other all the time and back and forth, but in an orderly manner, and  yesterday's example was not orderly.   If we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment  to the rule to bring up Representative Nadler's bill, H.R. 6135, the  Keep Families Together Act. This important proposal would prohibit the  Department of Homeland Security from separating children from their  parents, except in extraordinary circumstances, and limit the criminal  prosecution of asylum seekers.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal), a member of the Judiciary Committee, to  discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Washington.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Nevada (Mr. Kihuen), who is a member of the Financial Services  Committee, to further discuss our proposal for the previous question,  and I apologize for botching his last name.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is left on both  sides of the aisle?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Espaillat), who is a member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee, Education and the Workforce, and the Committee on Small  Business, to further discuss our proposal for the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  myself the balance of my time to close.   Mr. Speaker, we consider today's important bill as we approach the  hour of our President, Donald John Trump's, private sit down with  President Vladimir Putin in Russia. We don't know what will come of  this meeting, but if past is indeed prologue and we look to the  President's handling of his negotiations with North Korean dictator Kim  Jong-un, or his steadfast denial of the obvious, namely Russia's  meddling in our elections, or his policy of tearing toddlers away from  their mothers and fathers, then we can assume that nothing good will  come from this upcoming get together.   And I would urge those traveling with him to sweep the room with  Vladimir Putin because he will certainly be being listened to.   We can assume that there will be further concessions that benefit  Russian interests. We can assume that the President will further insult  our friends and allies, as he did yesterday morning in Brussels. We can  assume that he will further erode the institutions created by the  greatest generation, institutions that have made and kept the United  States the dominant power in an uncertain world, institutions that have  kept war off of western European soil for more than a generation,  institutions that have kept at bay those nation-states that champion  oppression and fear rather than freedom and the rule of law.   Finally, I will say this. In the current environment, it is more  important than ever to stand united against those forces that wish to  see us divided. It is more important than ever that we support the  difficult and brave work of those individuals who make up our  intelligence community. And the latter can be achieved, quite simply,  by Republicans in this Chamber taking a note from our Republican  friends on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and learn how to  call a spade a spade.   The assessment that the Russians meddled in our election; that the  Russians concertedly attempted to undermine Secretary Clinton's chances  to be elected the first female President of the United States; that the  Russians did this work to favor the election of the current President  are all trustworthy and well-founded assessments.                                time  1300    And remember, that it is not Alcee Lamar Hastings saying that, though  I do. That is the assessment of the entire Republican-led Senate Select  Committee on Intelligence. That is the assessment of the intelligence  agencies of this community.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back the  balance of my time.  [[Page H6127]]         Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my staff and I worked with Democratic  staff members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence  and received input from the majority staff to craft what I believe is a  commonsense amendment that will increase diversity throughout the  intelligence community.   Mr. Chair, I just want to depart from my prepared remarks to say a  word about the young man who is seated with me, Tony Matthews. It is a  good indication of what the Brookings Institution does when they send  us fellows from either the Democratic or Republican side, and I am very  pleased that he has been with my office and, in many respects, is the  author of this amendment.   The amendment directs the Office of the Director of National  Intelligence to, in consultation with heads of other intelligence  community agencies, create and implement a plan that will successfully  expand the intelligence community's recruitment efforts so that rural  and underserved regions in the United States are more fully represented  in these efforts.   It is my belief that this amendment will provide a unique opportunity  for the intelligence community agencies to actively join forces in  order to broaden their respective recruitment efforts and, by so doing,  increase the diversity among their ranks. Although we have seen  improvement in some areas--for instance, an increase in minority hiring  for fiscal year 2017 over that of fiscal year 2016--we have also seen a  disappointing decrease in the percentage of women hired over that same  period of time. I believe that we can do better in both metrics, and I  think one smart way of doing that is getting agencies to broaden their  searches geographically.   This country's strength is born from its dedication to the rule of  law, the belief that the best form of government is one that is of the  people, by the people, and for the people--and from its diversity.   It is time for our intelligence community agencies to more fully  commit to reaching all American people in an effort to let them know  that inspiring and important work awaits them in the intelligence  community. Indeed, by more fully tapping into this diversity, we can be  assured of at least one result: the strengthening of our intelligence  community. If the intelligence community is to succeed in its global  mission, it must have a global force.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``yes'' vote on my amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff), the distinguished ranking  member with whom I had the pleasure of serving on the Intelligence  Committee when I was there some 100 years ago.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
