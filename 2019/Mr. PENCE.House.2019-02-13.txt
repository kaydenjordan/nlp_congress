 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reaffirm my unwavering  commitment to life, the protection of the unborn, and the protection of  those who survive the violence of the unborn.   The greatness of our free society can best be measured by how it  cares for the most vulnerable. I am deeply troubled by the efforts by  some to expand late-term abortion and remove any conceivable limits on  this horrific practice.   In the face of such an onslaught, let the miracles of conception,  pregnancy, and childbirth serve as a solemn reminder of the constant  fight for life. On this, there should be no question that Members of  Congress from both parties should agree to the fact that every child  born into this world has the right to live.   We must stand together for life and the unborn and protect those who  cannot protect themselves when handed abortion's death sentence.   I pray that one day each and every life, born and unborn, is  respected, valued, and given the chance to pursue his or her dreams.  That is why I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 962.   We must never, ever give up in the fight for life.
