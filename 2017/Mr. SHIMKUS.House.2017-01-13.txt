 Mr. Speaker, I am on the Energy and Commerce Committee  the healthcare bill came through. We can debate how many hearings, how  many questions, and all of that. The public has rendered judgment on  this healthcare law.   In 2010, Republicans took back control of the House over two issues:  ObamaCare and cap-and-trade. And then our base was saying to repeal  ObamaCare, all the way back to 2010.   In 2014, the Republicans took over the Senate. Our base is saying:  You have got the House. You have got the Senate. Repeal ObamaCare. It  is harmful. It is destructive--and I will tell you why in a minute.   So why should anybody not expect us, in 2016, when the public has  rendered judgment again in a national election that we have to repeal  ObamaCare?   So when I talk to my constituents and people talk to me, this is  going to happen, and we know there is going to be a replacement.   There are two different ideologies of how to provide care. We believe  in markets; you believe in centralized control. We believe in people  choosing the best plan for them in the private markets; and those who  need help and assistance to get in those markets, we are going to help  them get in those markets. But to have our Federal Government say that  you only have one of four choices--my constituents pay for health care  that they can't use because they can't pay the deductibles, so they are  forced to buy something that they can't use.   So this is timely. I am glad we are moving expeditiously, and we look  forward to the year ahead.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we believe healthcare protections ought to  be enshrined in the law and not left up to insurance companies.   I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule. It  sets into motion the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.   This repeal-only bill takes money intended to fund health care for  middle class families and it hands it to the wealthy families and to  big health corporations in the form of tax cuts. The public does not  know this.  [[Page H484]]    According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, this bill  would give the 400 highest income families in the United States an  average tax cut of $7 million a year. It would rob millions of families  of the money they need for their insurance. It hands it over to the  wealthy, including nearly $250 billion over 10 years in tax cuts for  health insurance companies and drug manufacturers.                                time  1015    Where are the majority's values? We should be providing more  Americans with health insurance, not fewer; and we should be creating  jobs, not eliminating them. This bill is a disgrace. It is a betrayal  of the working families of this Nation.
