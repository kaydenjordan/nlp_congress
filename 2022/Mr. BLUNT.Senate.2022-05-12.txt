 Madam President, in reserving the right to object, my  colleague Senator Paul is well-intended in this recommendation, and I  listened to it carefully, as I am sure others did.   The Page Program, which has been in effect since 1829, has become a  program of both opportunity and education and is a program that the  Page Board, the Senate Page Board, has responsibility for.   I would say, in looking at the immediate future, the pages who are  here now, the pages who have agreed to be pages in the summer, and the  pages, I think, who are in line to be pages in the fall--and their  families--have all looked at these recommendations. They have all  decided they are recommendations they would be able to meet. Maybe more  importantly, they also have decided to make that family decision for  their children to be here and be pages as high school juniors, perhaps,  because of the standards that have been set that they are well aware  of.   I would hope that Senator Paul would continue to talk to the Page  Board. I think the Page Board has a very important job to do. They  accept an incredible responsibility of the relationships that they have  decided to enter into between the pages, their families, and the Page  Board in representing the Senate.   That Board has some oversight from the Rules Committee, and I yield  to the chairman of the Rules Committee.
