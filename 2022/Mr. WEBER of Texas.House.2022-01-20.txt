 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the 76th  Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, Representative Dade  Phelan of Beaumont, Texas.   Speaker Phelan, who is serving his fourth term representing the great  District 21, is one of the most conservative Speakers in our State's  history and has made it his priority to significantly improve the lives  of Texans every single day.   As only the fourth Republican to hold the Texas House Speakership  since 1871, or 151 years, he has set the bar high for any who might  follow in his footsteps. He fought to pass landmark legislation that  protects businesses, taxpayers, the unborn, religious freedoms, and our  Second Amendment rights.   Under his leadership, the Texas House led on criminal justice reform  issues, healthcare affordability, police funding, and addressing winter  storm Uri's long-term impact on our State.   I cannot express how proud we are in Texas 14 to claim Speaker  Phelan, his wife Kim, and their four precious boys, Ford, Mack, Hank,  and little Luke, as our own.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Speaker Phelan for all he does for Texas.                            ____________________
