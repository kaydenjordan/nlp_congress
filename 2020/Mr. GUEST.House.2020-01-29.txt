 Madam Speaker, today, President Trump signed the historic  United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement and fulfilled a campaign  promise to modernize trade with two of our largest trading partners.   The USMCA is projected to generate $68 billion in new economic  activity and create over 175,000 new jobs for hardworking Americans.   President Trump and Republicans fought to complete the USMCA on  behalf of American farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and small business  owners.   As a rural State with strong agricultural, manufacturing, and  business sectors, Mississippi stands to benefit greatly from this  agreement by expanding markets for high-quality Mississippi poultry and  livestock and hundreds of manufacturing products.   This trade agreement will provide a boost to our economy that has  grown significantly under Republican leadership and is another example  of free market economic principles at work to provide new employment  opportunities for all Americans.                            ____________________
