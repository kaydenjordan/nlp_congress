 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of retired  Colonel John Edward Gray of Mount Ulla, North Carolina, who passed away  earlier this month at age 94.   Colonel Gray was born in Cleveland, North Carolina, on August 24,  1925, and went on to serve in five campaigns against the Japanese in  the Pacific theater in World War II.   Following the war, he returned home and resumed his education at  Davidson College. After he graduated in 1949, he served again in both  the Korean and Vietnam wars.   Selfless, legendary, valiant are all the words that come to mind when  thinking about all that this man accomplished in his life.   Colonel Gray is survived by his wife of 72 years, Sue, and his 5  children, 12 grandchildren, and 1 great-grandchild.   Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring the life of Colonel John  Edward Gray.                            ____________________
