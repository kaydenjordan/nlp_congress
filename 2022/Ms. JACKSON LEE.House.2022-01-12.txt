 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R.  1836, the Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act, which will expand  eligibility for post-9/11 G.I. Bill educational benefits to members of  the National Guard and the Reserves.   Current law defines the term ``active duty'' as those individuals who  are on full-time duty in the active military service of the United  States, including full-time training duty, annual training duty, and  attendance, while in the active military service, at a school  designated as a service school by law or by the Secretary of the  military department concerned.   H.R. 1836, will expand eligibility criteria to include those training  in full-time National Guard duty, which includes the National Guard,  the Army National Guard, and the Air National Guard, as well as those  same members when performing active duty.   Under current rules, service members need three years on active-duty  to be eligible for full Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, which include 36  months of in-state college tuition, a monthly living stipend and other  payouts.   Reaching that amount of time mobilized to active-duty is difficult  for guardsmen and reservists, and outdated and confusing eligibility  requirements means the difference of tens of thousands of dollars for  college for those individuals.   For example, the deployment of thousands of Guard troops to Capitol  Hill following the January 6 attack counted towards GI Bill  eligibility, because the mission was being paid for with federal funds.   However, troops mobilized for crowd control during racial equality  protests in Washington, D.C., last summer were not able to count that  time, because those missions weren't funded by federal dollars.   Some other riot response missions across the nation were funded by  federal funds, and did count towards the education benefits.   Similarly, tens of thousands of Guard and Reserve troops have been  mobilized for pandemic response missions over the last two years, but  their eligibility varies depending on the specific orders and units  involved.   For years, members of the National Guard and Reserve Components have  been disadvantaged and overlooked in the accumulation of their  education benefits while performing the same or similar service as  their Active-Duty counterparts.   Time and time again, through natural disasters, global pandemics, and  threats to our democracy, our National Guard and Reserve members have  answered the call to serve.   But despite taking on the same risks and doing the same jobs as their  active-duty counterparts, these service members don't have access to  the same benefits.   This has become much clearer and more severe during the COVID-19  pandemic.   Members of the National Guard and Reserve Component have risked their  lives on the front lines of this pandemic, administering aid and  protecting the Capitol on training status.   Our brave men and women continue to selflessly answer our nation's  call and are long overdue the benefits befitting their service.   The Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act of 2021 will ensure the men  and women of the National Guard are entitled to GI Bill education  benefits when activated for service either for training or for  operational needs of our country, just like their Active- Duty  counterparts.   I want to thank all of our armed serviceman and women for their  selfless dedication to our protection every day.   In my home state of Texas, the National Guard has been deployed time  and time again to assist citizens and save lives during numerous  natural disasters, including the Winter  [[Page H59]]  Freeze of last February and the tragic Hurricane Harvey.   The Texas National Guard is host to nearly 21,000 troops, including  its army and air components.   The National Guard is a diverse force that includes all ethnicities:   White: 69 percent;   Black: 15 percent;   Hispanic: 10 percent;   Asian: 3 percent;   Male: 83.1 percent;   Female: 16.9 percent   This bill, in which we further the benefits and recognition that our  servicemen and women deserve, also reminds us that we have an  overriding duty to protect the health and dignity of those serving  today.   For this reason, I would like to discuss the crisis that our National  Guardsmen and Guardswomen have been thrust into at the Texas Governor's  direction on our Southern Border.   In March 2021, the Texas Governor launched the ill-fated and  ineffective Operation Lone Star which he claimed was necessary to stem  a so-called invasion of migrants at Texas' southern border.   As of November 2021, more than 10,000 Texas National Guardsmen have  been deployed to the southern border in pursuit of this folly.   According to published media accounts, National Guard members who  have been activated for Operation Lone Star are experiencing habitual  pay delays and poor working conditions during the border mission,  including being exposed to COVID-19, and many are missing the equipment  necessary for safety and mission success.   In addition, the National Guard has faced austere conditions and  limited resources, leading to unsanitary conditions such as the lack of  portable restrooms.   Rather than addressing these conditions, just last week the Texas  Governor filed a frivolous lawsuit in federal court challenging the  authority of President Biden, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed  Forces to require that members of the National Guard be vaccinated  against COVID-19.   There is no merit to this nuisance law suit as demonstrated by the  summary rejection of similar arguments raised by neighboring Oklahoma  Governor Stitt.   The Texas Governor's failure to comply with the policies intended to  reduce the spread of COVID-19 among the Armed Forces will mean that  there will be less military personnel available national disasters that  have struck Texas in recent years, such as the winter freeze of last  year.   This will also mean that there are fewer personnel to respond to any  attacks on the homeland.   Encouraged by the Texas Governor's obstinacy, about 40 percent of the  members of the Texas Army National Guard are refusing to get  vaccinated, which puts at risk their colleagues and the persons they  are sworn to defend and protect.   National Guardsmen and Guardswomen deployed in this disastrous  mission at the Texas Governor's insistence face the deadly spread of  COVID-19, unsanitary conditions, lack of pay, and a lack of a certain  future.   These uniformed men and women deserve better, and some of them,  seeing no alternative to their present reality, have decided to end it  all.   Five National guard soldiers have shot and killed themselves in the  past three months, and one more survived a suicide attempt.   One of these men, private first class Joshua R. Cortez, was preparing  to accept a ``lifetime job'' with one of the nation's biggest health  insurance companies in late October last year, but the Texas National  Guard had other ideas.   Operation Lone Star required involuntary activations to meet the  Texas Governor's troop quotas, and Cortez was one of the soldiers  tapped to go on state active duty orders--with no idea how long the  mission would last.   In November, the 21-year-old mechanic requested a hardship release  from the mission: ``I've been waiting for this job and I'm on my way to  getting hired . . . I missed my first opportunity in September when I  had to go on the flood mission in Louisiana. . . . I can not miss this  opportunity because it is my last opportunity for this lifetime job.''   Cortez's company commander recommended approval. But his battalion  commander and brigade commander disapproved.   Within 36 hours of his request being denied, Cortez drove to a  parking lot in northwest San Antonio and shot himself in the head.   Three other soldiers tied to Operation Lone Star have died by  suicide, including:   Sgt. Jose L. De Hoyos was found dead in Laredo, Texas, on Oct. 26. He  was a member of the 949th Brigade Support Battalion's headquarters  company.   1st Sgt. John ``Kenny'' Crutcher died Nov. 12, as time ran out on his  temporary hardship waiver. He was the top NCO for B Company, 3rd  Battalion, 144th Infantry.   1st Lt. Charles Williams, a platoon leader in Crutcher's company,  died at home overnight Dec. 17 while on pass.   The string of suicides raises urgent questions about the mission's  conditions and purpose, as well as the way it's organized and manned  through indefinite involuntary call-ups.   This is an excellent and common-sense bill that will enhance the  benefits of our servicemen and women.   We must also act to ensure that our servicemen and women are  protected from COVID-19, both for their own safety and the safety of  our nation.   When called to action, the National Guard performs the name duties as  our active duty forces, oftentimes in extraordinarily difficult  situations.   Although we cannot bring back the lives lost due to the Texas  Governor's misguided actions, we can remember the names of those we  have lost and work to ensure that we treat all members of our military  equally and with dignity and respect.    Madam Speaker, today is my birthday, and I could not  think of a better gift for the American people.   In the last 24 hours, we found that five States--Republicans--decided  to put in false certifications to determine that Trump actually won the  November 2020 election. In a bill in Texas that was passed after the  big lie, they allowed the legislature to overturn a duly held election.   Do you not think there is a siege on the rightful vote of Americans  no matter who they are, of people of color and young people?   I am so happy that we decided to move forward on the Freedom to Vote:  John R. Lewis Act that will stop the detrimental gerrymandering that  wants to eliminate Members of color.   It is time now that the relic of the filibuster no longer promotes  discrimination and racism but frankly that we move on protecting  democracy, on cradling democracy, on recognizing that we are patriots  who stand to support the idea of the Constitution.   Madam Speaker, I support this rule because the Constitution rules and  the American people deserve the right to vote.   Madam Speaker, as Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime,  Homeland Security, and Terrorism, and a senior member of the Homeland  Security, and Budget Committees, I rise in strong support of the rule  governing debate for the Senate Amendment to H.R. 5746, the ``Freedom  to Vote: John R. Lewis Act.''   We are here tonight because we must act, and this legislation  provides the tools to address discriminatory practices and seeks to  protect all Americans' right to vote.   On August 6, 1965, in the Rotunda of the Capitol, President Johnson  addressed the nation before signing the Voting Rights Act--considered  the most effective civil rights statute ever enacted by Congress:   ``The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for  breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which  imprison men because they are different from other men.''   This bill is the result of tireless work and compromise by my  colleagues in the House and my colleagues in the Senate.   The signing of the Voting Rights Act came after, in that same year,  in Selma, Alabama, hundreds of heroic souls risked their lives for  freedom and to secure the right to vote for all Americans by their  participation in marches for voting rights on ``Bloody Sunday,''  ``Turnaround Tuesday,'' or the final, completed march from Selma to  Montgomery.   Those ``foot soldiers'' of Selma, brave and determined men and women,  boys and girls, persons of all races and creeds, loved their country so  much that they were willing to risk their lives to make it better, to  bring it even closer to its founding ideals.   The foot soldiers marched because they believed that all persons have  dignity and the right to equal treatment under the law, and in the  making of the laws, which is the fundamental essence of the right to  vote.   On that day, Sunday, March 7, 1965, more than 600 civil rights  demonstrators, including our beloved former colleague, the late  Congressman John Lewis of Georgia, were brutally attacked by state and  local police at the Edmund Pettus Bridge as they marched from Selma to  Montgomery in support of the right to vote.   ``Bloody Sunday'' was a defining moment in American history because  it crystallized for the nation the necessity of enacting a strong and  effective federal law to protect the right to vote of every American.   However, since the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the  right to vote has been under constant assault.   The Voting Rights Act was enacted at a time when many African  Americans in southern states had been denied the right to vote, and  when attempting to register, organize, or even assist others in their  attempt to register to vote meant risking their jobs, homes, and racial  violence.   Prior to the enactment of the VRA, litigation initiated under the  Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960 failed to eliminate discrimination  in voting because jurisdictions simply shifted to different tactics in  order to disenfranchise African Americans.   Nearly fifty-seven years later, we face another turning point in the  life of the nation and for the dignity of men and women and the destiny  of democracy.   Although the Supreme Court has described the right to vote as the one  right that is preservative of all others, this ``powerful instrument  that can break down the walls of injustice'' faces grave threats.   The threat stems from the decision issued in June 2013 by the Supreme  Court in Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), which  invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, and paralyzed the application of  the VRA's Section 5 preclearance requirements.   According to the Supreme Court majority, the reason for striking down  Section 4(b) was that ``times change.''   Now, the Court was right; times have changed.   But what the Court did not fully appreciate is that the positive  changes it cited are due almost entirely to the existence and vigorous  enforcement of the Voting Rights Act, and that is why the Voting Rights  Act is still needed.   As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated in Shelby County v. Holder,  ``[t]hrowing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to  work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella  in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.''   The current Supreme Court majority has simply never understood, or  refuses to accept, the fundamental importance of the right to vote,  free of discriminatory hurdles and obstacles.   In fact, were it not for the 24th Amendment, I venture to say that  this conservative majority on the Court would subject poll taxes and  literacy tests to the review standard enunciated in Brnovich v. DNC.   Protecting voting rights and combating voter suppression schemes are  two of the critical challenges facing our great democracy.   Without safeguards to ensure that all citizens have equal access to  the polls, more injustices are likely to occur and the voices of  millions silenced.   And this is exactly what we have seen over this past year.   The polarization of Americans is ever increasing, as seen during the  2020 election through tactics meant to impede the right of certain  Americans to vote, such as the removal of mailboxes and the closing of  postal stations in order to impede mail-in voting.   After the former president was soundly defeated at the ballot box in  what experts unanimously proclaim was the most secure election in  history, still the former president and his cronies propagated the Big  Lie that the election was illegitimate because it was rife with fraud.   The former president persisted in this specious claim even though,  despite ample opportunities to do so, they produced not a scintilla of  evidence to persuade any of the 61 state and federal courts that  entertained the claims.   But to this has been added reactionary state laws passed or  introduced to suppress, abridge, restrict, or deny the right to vote of  millions of eligible Americans, particularly persons of color, young  persons and persons with disabilities, and working parents, precisely  the constellation of persons whose votes determined the outcome of the  2020 presidential election.   In the aftermath of the 2020 election, according to the Brennan  Center For Justice, between January 1 and July 14, 2021, at least 18  states enacted 30 laws that restrict access to the vote, some making  mail voting and early voting more difficult, others imposing harsher  voter ID requirements, and making faulty voter purges more likely.   In total, more than 400 bills with provisions that restrict voting  access have been introduced in 49 states in the 2021 legislative  sessions.   My home state of Texas is ground zero for this desperate effort to  hold back an American future led by the ascendant coalition of young,  racially diverse and all other tolerant, imaginative, and innovative  voters who became energized and inspired by Barack Obama in 2008 and  the belief in a new and just America.   To combat not their ideas but instead their increasing numbers, the  Republican legislature and Governor of Texas passed and signed into law  SB1, which:   Bans drive-thru voting, 24-hour voting, and the distribution of  mailin ballot applications;   imposes new and extraneous ID requirements for voting by mail;   authorizing ``free movement'' to partisan poll watchers, effectively  turning them into vote suppression vigilantes;   requires monthly checks of voting rolls to facilitate purging  unwanted voters; and   imposes onerous new rules for voter assistance.   All of this is more than enough to sound the warning bell that we are  now engaged, as President Lincoln observed at Gettysburg, in a  [[Page H67]]  great contest testing the proposition that this nation, or any nation  conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men and  women are created equal, can long endure.   This is the present crisis in which we find ourselves and it indeed  is soul trying.   But as Thomas Paine wrote on Christmas Eve in 1776:   ``The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis,  shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now,  deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is  not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the  harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too  cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives everything  its value.''   The work for civil rights and voting rights involved tens of  thousands of individuals who fought to correct the course of the nation  by setting it on a path of equal rights and justice for all.   The efforts of Dr. Martin Luther King, Ralph Abernathy, Andrew Young,  Hosea Williams, Coretta Scott King, and John Robert Lewis, among  others, as well as the thousands of foot soldiers in the civil rights  movement succeeded in waking the nation to the idea that change was  needed.   The result of their work was the establishment of protections that  allowed voters of every race, creed, color, and political belief to  cast ballots free of interference or threat.   The blood spilled during these difficult times is not forgotten by  the communities that saw and experienced these battles, which is why  laws like Texas SB1 cannot go unanswered by the United States House of  Representatives and Senate.   To meet the challenge we have been called upon to face and overcome,  what is needed is for men and women of courage, conscience, and  conviction to step forward and come to the aid of their country by  passing the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act to strengthen the  foundation of our democracy upon which all else depends, including the  important necessary investments to Build Back Better and mitigate the  effects of Climate Change.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this rule governing  debate of Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr.   It is often said that his were the words of a giant who could  galvanize all of America around the wonderful concept of the ``beloved  community.''   Dr. King was assassinated in 1968, and so many have come from his  spirit, but I thought this year, in the midst of the very divisive  fight for voting rights, we could just remember his marches, his words,  believing in a dream, and recognizing the goodness of America.   He marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. He walked with our friend  John Robert Lewis and his other friends Hosea Williams, Reverend Andrew  Young, and Ralph David Abernathy. And he always thought that he could  never give up, as he went to the White House with Lyndon Baines Johnson  and insisted on the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights  Act.   We must honor him in these coming days not by words and tributes but  by doing the right thing, building on the democracy that he so much  dreamed for, even though his life was cut short, and to thank his  family--Martin Luther King III and all of his children and his wife-- for the sacrifice they made for America. I pay tribute to Dr. Martin  Luther King, Jr.                            ____________________
