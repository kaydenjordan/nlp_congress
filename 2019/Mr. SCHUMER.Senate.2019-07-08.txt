 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, let me congratulate the U.S. Women's  National Team on winning the World Cup yesterday. It is the second  title in a row and fourth overall, the most for any nation. Boy, did  they make us proud.   The team's sustained level of excellence is something for all of us  to exult in, to be proud of, as are the heart, skill, and sheer joy the  U.S. women bring to the pitch. As they make their way home, I send them  my congratulations, my thanks, and a formal invitation for the team to  come to the Upper Chamber for a celebration as they visit our Nation's  Capital. It would be my honor to host America's winning team.   I want to send a special congratulations to the New Yorkers on the  team, Allie Long and Crystal Dunn, the latter of whom made a crucial  tackle in the final, leading to our second and decisive goal in the  final period. New York is proud of them both, as well as the entire  roster.   While today we celebrate their victory, we also recognize that these  women athletes have challenges and they make us really think about the  future of women's sports. They make us grapple with the deep unfairness  in how female athletes are treated and paid compared to their male  counterparts. Similarly, it is an unfortunate reality that women in the  workforce see their male colleagues paid significantly more for the  same work.   We have come a long way in terms of the prominence of and support for  women's sports over the past decade, but we have not come nearly far  enough. Every young girl who has had to play on weeknights instead of  weekends because that is when the boys play, who has had to accept  older equipment because the boys got the new stuff, who has had to play  on the other field or rink or court because the boys were using the  main one--every girl who has gone through that knows this to be true.  As a parent of two girls who played soccer, basketball, baseball, and  lacrosse, I know this to be true.   I think when it comes to U.S. women, it is absolutely right to be  talking about their pay right now. They have shone a light on the fact  that, in our society, women are simply not treated fairly because of  their gender. Something needs to change here. What the U.S. women did  was extraordinary, and they deserve to be compensated fairly. All women  need to be compensated fairly, period. We ought to pay attention to  this not just once every 4 years during the World Cup, but year in and  year out.   How about the equal payment amendment that the House has passed? Why  don't we put it on the floor of the Senate in honor of the women who  won the World Cup? Why don't we do that, Leader McConnell?   I am sure there will be lots of encomia from the other side about  these women. Let's act so we can help all women achieve equality--equal  work, equal pay.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on healthcare, tomorrow the Fifth  Circuit will hear oral arguments in the case of Texas v. United States.  The fate of our entire healthcare system hangs in the balance. This  challenge to the Affordable Care Act, brought by Republican State  attorneys general and regrettably supported by President Trump and his  administration, represents the latest efforts by Republicans to  dismantle healthcare as we know it in America.   After failing to repeal our healthcare through Federal legislation,  Republicans have now turned to the courts. If Republicans get their way  in this case, the impact on Americans would be catastrophic; that is  not an exaggeration--catastrophic. It would result in the elimination  of protections for people with preexisting conditions, possibly  increasing costs for 133 million Americans under 65.   If you have a son or daughter with cancer and the insurance company  cuts you off, that is catastrophic, nothing less. How many people will  go through that if our Republican friends have their way? It would  result in skyrocketing prescription drug costs for seniors or Medicare.  Let's say there is a lifesaving drug, but it is too expensive, and you  can't afford it, that is catastrophic to most Americans.   Millions of people would be kicked off Medicaid, leaving the most  vulnerable out to fend for themselves. Again, you desperately need  care, but no one will give it to you. That is catastrophic.   Bring it all together, and what our Republican friends want to do is  make Americans pay higher prices for inferior care. That is cruelty on  a massive scale.   Of course, we have been here before. For nearly 2 years, the  administration pushed Congress to repeal the ACA--a crusade that failed  on the Senate floor multiple times. President Trump's budget calls for  trillions in cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. He has opened up the  floodgates for junk plans that don't cover the things that really  count, like cancer treatment, maternity care, addiction services, and  he has deliberately worked to make it harder for people to sign up for  healthcare.   On that court case, 47 Democrats wished that we would join the  lawsuit. We asked Republicans to join us in that. I think it was only  one who was. Where are our Republican friends? They talk about wanting  to preserve preexisting conditions, but they are mum when the  administration they support tries to repeal them. It is hypocrisy-- hypocrisy. If you believe in supporting people's protections for  preexisting conditions, you oppose the lawsuit and join us in saying  that lawsuit should not be filed. Our Republican friends know where the  people are, but they are afraid. They are quivering that Donald Trump  will be angry with them if they oppose his lawsuit. Shame on them.   Our Republican friends can never argue that they are the party of  healthcare. When President Trump argues that Republicans are the party  of  [[Page S4685]]  healthcare, God help the middle class. They are the party of no  healthcare; the party of repeal with no plan to replace.   This lawsuit is just the latest salvo against the American people,  and it shows that so long as Republicans are in power, the healthcare  of the American people will not be safe. If they are successful in  striking down the Affordable Care Act, Republicans--all of them--will  own the consequences.                            ____________________     Madam President, last week, the DHS inspector general  released a report detailing horrid conditions at border facilities.  This is the President's own DHS inspector general saying how bad  conditions were. Then we found reports of a secret Border Patrol  workers' Facebook group that revealed a toxic culture at U.S. Customs  and Border Protection. Everything we had heard anecdotally, everything  we feared about the mindset of CBP proved to be true in that Facebook  group.   Over the weekend, the New York Times and then the El Paso Times  released the latest account of conditions at the Border Patrol station  in Clint, TX. A facility built for 100 adults has become a modern-day  internment camp for up to 700 children at a time, many locked up for  weeks on end. Some children go without beds to sleep on. There are food  shortages and insufficient sanitation. For heaven's sake, we read  reports of children suffering from outbreaks of scabies, lice, and even  chicken pox. This is cruelty--cruelty--once again.   These awful conditions show that for too long, the CBP has operated  as an agency out of control. It must be reined in immediately,  beginning with its leadership. Internal investigations will not suffice  because CBP leadership--particularly Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan-- is far too callous in their treatment of children and their families.  Too many of the CBP leaders have had this attitude for too long, and it  has infested itself down to too many who are the rank and file in that  agency. We need untainted professionals to be brought in from outside  the CBP structure immediately.   President Trump turns to his typical tactics of denial, distortion,  and distraction. President Trump should be focused on fixing the  problems that exist instead of blaming others. The truth, of course, is  that we should never have been in this situation in the first place.  The suffering imposed on migrant children is the result of the  administration's own mishandling of family arrivals through Central  America.   While Donald Trump says he is serious about fixing our immigration  challenges, he has done just about everything to make matters worse.   President Trump, you want to fix the border? Then do what Democrats  have been asking you to do for a long time--let the asylum seekers  apply for asylum in their home countries, increase the number of judges  to process the cases, and, for heaven's sake, restore aid to those  Central American countries of Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua to  help them crack down on gang violence and cartels so people will not  flee for fear of their lives from the gangs.   President Trump, stop finger-pointing at Democrats for this mess of  your own making. You are the President. As this problem festers and  gets worse, the American people realize you are the Chief Executive. It  is your problem to solve.   We will join you, if you have anything reasonable to propose, but  just finger-pointing at Democrats for this mess of your own making,  President Trump, is like poking holes in your own umbrella and then  blaming the clouds when you get wet.   I urge President Trump and Senate Republicans to seriously consider  these measures because unless we make structural reforms to our  immigration system, we have done nothing to reverse what is happening  at the southern border.                            ____________________     Madam President, President Trump's hypocrisy and his  diving into mistruths over and over again reared its ugly head once  again. We can't become used to it because it is such a bad thing for a  President to be so abjectly dishonest about so much of what is  happening and so much of what he does. It happened again.   Today, amazingly enough, President Trump tried to claim credit as a  leader on environmental protection, of all things. This is laughable.  The same President who pulled us out of the Paris Agreement, who has  filled his administration with oil and coal cronies, who has slashed  protections for clean air, clean water, and protections for public  lands, and who has denied basic science now wants to call himself a  leader on the environment. Give me a break.   Try as he might say otherwise, President Trump has proved himself  probably the staunchest ally of the worst polluters of any President we  have ever had.   On climate change, the President's record is particularly egregious.  In 2 years, his government has gutted oil, coal, and pollution  standards, has erased climate data from government websites, and even  censored words like ``climate change'' from appearing in official  government documents. This is somebody who is a leader of environmental  protection? How gullible does he think the American people are? Even  Trump supporters may agree with him on this issue, but to say he is  protecting the environment is ludicrous.   Some of these things are just the tip of the iceberg. Would someone  who is a leader on environmental protection hire oil and coal lobbyists  to run the EPA and Department of Interior and cripple the National  Climate Assessment? He completely caves to the oil and gas industry.  Every time they say jump, he says how high. Now he has the temerity-- the gall--to say he is the leader of environmental protection. Again,  give me a break.   To be fair, President Trump's speech does have one silver lining. The  mere fact that he even spoke today on the environment forces us to an  unavoidable conclusion: Climate change is real. It is a serious problem  that deserves action, including action in this Chamber.   The Republican majority, Leader McConnell, could take action on this  issue at a moment's notice, but, for now, they are happy keeping their  heads in the sand. They have not brought a single measure to the floor  that would deal with the issue of climate, even as their views grow  increasingly out of step with most Americans.   They cannot continue to keep their heads in the sand as our planet  faces serious problems today and even far more serious problems for our  children. It is an issue that can't wait a day longer, and yet the  masters of this legislative graveyard refuse to act. I fear the  majority in this body will refuse to act until either they are no  longer the majority or, even worse, it is too late.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
