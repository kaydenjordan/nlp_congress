 Mr. President, today's Congressional Budget Office  analysis of the Trump-McConnell healthcare bill gives us 22 million  reasons why this legislation should not see the light of day. What CBO  tells us in truth is that this bill really has nothing to do with  healthcare; rather, it is an enormous transfer of wealth from the sick,  the elderly, the children, the disabled, and the poor into the pockets  of the wealthiest people in this country.   According to CBO--and that report came out just a few hours ago--this  bill would throw 22 million Americans off of health insurance, cut  Medicaid by over $770 billion, defund Planned Parenthood, and  substantially increase premiums for older Americans. Under this bill, a  64-year-old with an income of $56,000 could see his or her premiums  increase from $4,400 under current law to $16,000--an increase of  nearly 850 percent. How are older workers in this country going to deal  with an 850-percent increase in their premiums? Meanwhile, the Trump- McConnell bill would provide a $231 billion tax break to the top 2  percent and hundreds of billions more in tax breaks to the big drug  companies and insurance companies that are ripping off the American  people every day.   At a time when the middle class of this country continues to shrink  and when families all across America are struggling to make ends meet,  to put food on the table, to pay their rent, to save a few bucks for  retirement, we cannot take from working-class families and we cannot  take from the sick and the elderly and the children in order to give  even more to the very wealthiest people in this country--people who are  at this moment doing phenomenally well.   Mr. President, this, in fact, is a barbaric and immoral piece of  legislation. But let's be very clear. It is not just Bernie Sanders who  opposes this bill. It is not just every Member in the Democratic caucus  who opposes this bill. It is not just that the overwhelming majority of  the American people oppose this legislation. According to a recent NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll, only 16 percent of the American people  thought this bill was a good idea. This bill is opposed by virtually  every major healthcare organization in this country--the people on the  frontlines, the people who today, yesterday, and tomorrow are dealing  with healthcare issues, dealing with the sick, working in hospitals,  working in community health centers. Almost without exception, every  major healthcare organization in this country opposes this bill.   Maybe my Republican friends might want to get beyond the politics,  get beyond Republicans and Democrats, and ask the people who really  know about healthcare in America and ask yourself, how does it happen  that virtually every major healthcare organization in this country  opposes this legislation?   The AARP opposes this legislation--the largest senior group in  America, which knows what high premiums for healthcare will do to their  membership. The American Hospital Association knows a little bit about  hospitals and what will happen to rural hospitals if this legislation  is passed. The American Medical Association is a conservative  organization. This is the doctors organization all over this country.  This is not any progressive radical group; these are our doctors, the  doctors we go to. They oppose this legislation because they know what  will happen if there are massive cuts to Medicaid, if 22 million people  are thrown off of health insurance. The American Academy of Family  Physicians knows what this legislation will mean to the children of our  country. The American Psychiatric Association, the Federation of  American Hospitals, the Catholic Health Association, the American Lung  Association, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the March of Dimes, the  National MS Society, the American Nurses Association--every one of  these  [[Page S3756]]  organizations opposes the Republican legislation; not Bernie Sanders  but every major healthcare organization says do not go forward with  this disastrous bill.   This is what the AARP, the largest senior group in America, said  recently:         This new Senate bill was crafted in secrecy behind closed       doors without a single hearing or open debate--and it shows.       The Senate bill would hit millions of Americans with higher       costs and result in less coverage for them.        AARP is adamantly opposed to the Age Tax, which would allow       insurance companies to charge older Americans five times more       for coverage than every one else while reducing tax credits       that help make insurance more affordable.    I ask all of my Republican friends to think for a moment about the  implications of this bill and what it will mean to your constituents  when they lose the healthcare they currently have. Put yourself in  their place. Today you have health insurance, but tomorrow, next year,  you might not. What does that mean? Think about it.   What does it mean if you are an individual today--and, sadly, there  are too many of them. If you are a person today suffering with cancer  and you are fighting for your life--maybe you are on radiation  treatment. Maybe you are on chemotherapy. You are scared to death. You  don't have a lot of money. You have cancer. You are struggling. And now  you are reading in the papers that this Republican bill may take your  health insurance away from you? How do you think they feel? I suspect  scared to death. It is the same with people who have heart disease, who  have asthma, who have diabetes or any other life-threatening illness.  What happens to those millions of people when they cannot afford to go  to the doctor when they are sick, cannot afford to buy the medicine  they desperately need?   Mr. President, I know this is a sensitive issue, but I am going to  raise it, and that is that the horrible and unspeakable truth is that  if this legislation were to pass, and I am going to do everything I can  to see that it doesn't, but if it were to pass, many thousands of our  fellow Americans every single year will die, and many more will suffer  and become much sicker than they should. That is not, again, Bernie  Sanders talking; that is exactly what a number of studies have shown.  Study after study, including one from the American Journal of Public  Health to the New England Journal of Medicine, to the Harvard School of  Public Health have told us. Again, this is not Bernie Sanders engaging  in a rhetorical debate; this is what scientists and doctors who have  studied the issue are telling us.    In fact, just this afternoon, a few hours ago, the Annals of Internal  Medicine, a prestigious medical journal, published an article from  researchers at the City University of New York School of Urban Public  Health at Hunter College and Harvard Medical School entitled: ``The  Relationship of Health Insurance and Mortality: Is Lack of Insurance  Deadly?'' That is the title of the article appearing today.   According to a summary of this article, ``Insurance decreases the  odds of dying among adults by at least 3 percent and as much as 29  percent and `being uninsured substantially raises the risk of dying.'  ''   The coauthor of this article, Dr. David Himmelstein, commented:         According to the CBO, the Senate Republicans' plan would       strip coverage from 22 million Americans. The best estimate       based on scientific studies is that about 29,000 Americans       would die each year as a result.    I know no Republican wants to see anybody die--none of us do--but  that is the reality we are dealing with, and you cannot ignore it. If  somebody has cancer, if somebody has heart disease and you take away  their health insurance, I don't need studies from Harvard University to  tell me and to tell you what you know to be the case. This is the  United States of America, and we can do better than that.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article that appeared  today in the ``Annals of Internal Medicine'' be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:             [From Annals of Internal Medicine, June 27, 2017]      The Relationship of Health Insurance and Mortality: Is Lack of                             Insurance Deadly?      (By Steffie Woolhandler, MD, MPH, and David U. Himmelstein, MD)         (About 28 million Americans are currently uninsured, and       millions more could lose coverage under policy reforms       proposed in Congress. At the same time, a growing number of       policy leaders have called for going beyond the Affordable       Care Act to a single-payer national health insurance system       that would cover every American. These policy debates lend       particular salience to studies evaluating the health effects       of insurance coverage. In 2002, an Institute of Medicine       review concluded that lack of insurance increases mortality,       but several relevant studies have appeared since that time.       This article summarizes current evidence concerning the       relationship of insurance and mortality. The evidence       strengthens confidence in the Institute of Medicine's       conclusion that health insurance saves lives: The odds of       dying among the insured relative to the uninsured is 0.71 to       0.97.)        This article was published at Annals.org on 27 June 2017.        At present, about 28 million Americans are uninsured.       Repeal of the Affordable Care Act would probably increase       this number, while enactment of proposed single-payer       legislation would reduce it. The public spotlight on how       policy changes affect the number of uninsured reflects a       widespread assumption that insurance improves health.        A landmark 2002 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on the       effects of insurance coverage on the health status of       nonelderly adults buttressed this assumption. The IOM       committee responsible for the report found consistent       evidence from 130 (mostly observational) studies that ``the       uninsured have poorer health and shortened lives'' and that       gaining coverage would decrease their all-cause mortality.        The IOM committee also reviewed evidence on the effects of       health insurance in specific circumstances and medical       conditions. It concluded that uninsured patients, even when       acutely ill or seriously injured, cannot always obtain needed       care and that coverage improves the uptake of essential       preventive services and chronic disease management. The       report found that uninsured patients with cancer presented       with more advanced disease and experienced worse outcomes,       including mortality; that uninsured patients with diabetes,       cardiovascular disease, end-stage renal disease, HIV       infection, and mental illness (the five other conditions       reviewed in depth) had worse outcomes than did insured       patients; and that uninsured inpatients received less and       worse-quality care and had higher mortality both during their       hospital stays and after discharge.        At the time of the IOM report, only one adequately       controlled observational study had examined the effect of       coverage on all-cause mortality. In this review, we summarize       key evidence on this issue (Table 1), focusing on studies       that have appeared since the IOM report and other previous       reviews. Although not reviewed in detail here, more recent       studies generally support the earlier reviews' conclusions       that insurance coverage improves mortality in several       specific conditions (such as trauma and breast cancer),       augments the use of recommended care, and improves several       measures of health status.                                   METHODS         We searched PubMed and Google Scholar on May 19, 2017, for       English-language articles by using the following terms:       ``[(uninsured) or (health insurance) or (un-insurance) or       (insurance)] and [(mortality) or (life expectancy) or (death       rates)].'' After identifying relevant articles, we searched       their bibliographies and used Google Scholar's ``cited by''       feature to identify additional relevant articles. We limited       our scope to articles reporting data on the United States,       quasi-experimental studies of insurance expansions in other       wealthy nations, and recent cross-national studies. We       contacted the authors of 4 studies to clarify their published       reports on mortality outcomes.        We excluded most observational studies that compared       uninsured persons with those insured by Medicaid, Medicare,       or the Department of Veterans Affairs because preexisting       disability or illness can make an individual eligible for       these programs. Hence, relative to those who are uninsured,       publicly insured Americans have, on average, worse baseline       health, thereby confounding comparisons. Conversely,       comparisons of the uninsured to persons with private       insurance (which is often obtained through employment) may be       confounded by a ``healthy worker'' effect: that is, that       persons may lose coverage because they are ill and cannot       maintain employment. Nonetheless, most analysts of the       relationship between uninsurance and mortality have viewed       the privately insured as the best available comparator, with       statistical controls for employment, income, health status,       and other potential confounders.        Finally, we focus primarily on nonelderly adults because       most studies have been limited to this group, and this group       is likely to experience large gains or losses of coverage       from health reforms. Since the advent of Medicare in 1966,       almost all elderly Americans have been covered, precluding       studies of uninsured seniors. Although Medicare's       implementation may not have accelerated the secular decline       in seniors' mortality, the relevance of this experience,       which predates many modern-day therapies, is unclear.        Children have also been excluded from most recent analyses       of the relationship of  [[Page S3757]]       insurance to mortality. Deaths in this population beyond the       neonatal period are so rare that studies would need to       evaluate a huge number of uninsured children to reach firm       conclusions, and high coverage rates make assembling such a       cohort difficult. The few studies addressing the effect of       insurance on child survival have found that coverage lowers       mortality and few policy leaders contest the importance of       covering children.                        RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS         Only one well-conducted randomized, controlled trial       (RCT)--the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment (OHIE)--has       assessed the effect of uninsurance on health outcomes. In       2008, the state of Oregon opened a limited number of Medicaid       slots to poor, able-bodied, uninsured adults aged 19 to 64       years. The state held a lottery among persons on a Medicaid       waiting list, with winners allowed to apply for a slot. The       OHIE researchers took advantage of this natural experiment to       assess the effect of winning the lottery on the 74,922       lottery participants.        Many lottery winners did not enroll in Medicaid, and 14.1%       of lottery losers obtained Medicaid through other routes       (some also got private coverage). Hence, the difference in       the ``dose'' of Medicaid coverage was modest, an absolute       difference of about 25%; to adjust for this, the OHIE       researchers multiplied outcome differences by about 4.        At 1 year of follow-up, the death rate among lottery losers       was 0.8%, and the winners' death rate was 0.032% lower, a       ``dose-adjusted'' difference of 0.13 percentage points       annually. This difference was not statistically significant,       an unsurprising finding given the OHIE's low power to detect       mortality effects because of the cohort's low mortality rate,       the low dose of insurance, and the short follow-up.        The findings on other health measures, obtained from in-      person interviews and brief examinations on a subsample of       12,229 individuals in the Portland area, help inform the       mortality results. Most physical health measures were similar       among lottery winners and losers in the subsample. However,       winners had better self-rated health, were more likely to       have diabetes diagnosed and treated with medication, and were       much less likely to screen positive for depression. Medicaid       coverage was associated with a nonsignificant decrease of       0.52 (95% CI, 2.97 to -1.93) mm Hg in systolic blood pressure       and 0.81 (95% CI, 2.65 to -1.04) mm Hg in diastolic blood       pressure. In addition to the low dose of insurance, these       wide CIs reflect the lack of baseline blood pressure data;       this precludes analyses that take advantage of paired       measures on each individual, which would reduce the variance       of estimates.        In sum, the OHIE yields a (nonsignificant) point estimate       that Medicaid coverage reduced mortality by 0.13 percentage       points, equivalent to a (nonsignificant) odds ratio of 0.84.        Two older RCTs are also relevant to the effect of insurance       and access to care on mortality, although neither directly       compared insured and uninsured persons. In the RAND Health       Insurance Experiment, random assignment to full (first-      dollar) coverage reduced diastolic blood pressure by an       average of 0.8 mm Hg (P < 0.05) relative to persons randomly       assigned to plans that required cost sharing, an effect size       similar to the blood pressure findings in the OHIE. Unlike       the OHIE, the RAND Health Insurance Experiment obtained       baseline blood pressure readings, allowing researchers to       determine that for participants with hypertension at       baseline, full coverage reduced diastolic blood pressure by       1.9 mm Hg, mostly because of better hypertension detection;       the effect was larger among low-income (3.5 mm Hg) than high-      income (1.1 mm Hg) participants.        The Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program also       suggests that removing financial barriers to primary care in       populations with high rates of uninsurance may reduce            TABLE 1.--SUMMARY OF STUDIES ON RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSURANCE COVERAGE AND ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                Estimated                                                         Information on     Mortality Effect      Study, Year (Reference)         Participants       Baseline Health     of Coverage vs.        Comments                                                                                Uninsured ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- RCTs     Oregon Health Insurance       74,922 nondisabled  Retrospective       OR, 0.84 (NS).....

That population-based RCT carried out in the 1970s       screened almost all residents of 14 communities, with       oversampling of predominantly black and poor locations.       Persons with hypertension were randomly assigned to free       stepped care in special clinics or referral to usual care.       Although the clinics' staff treated only hypertension-related       problems, they provided informal advice and ``friendly       referrals'' for other medical issues. Strikingly, all-cause       mortality was reduced by 17% in the intervention group, with       similar reductions in deaths due to cardiovascular and       noncardiovascular conditions.        Finally, a flawed RCT carried out by the Social Security       Administration starting in 2006 bears brief mention. That       study randomly assigned people who were receiving Social       Security disability income and were in the waiting period for       Medicare coverage to receive immediate or delayed coverage.       Unfortunately, randomization apparently failed, with many       more patients with cancer assigned to the immediate coverage       than to the control group, precluding reliable interpretation       of the mortality results. Interestingly, persons receiving       immediate coverage had rapid and significant improvements in       most measures of self-reported health.            MORTALITY FOLLOW-UP OF POPULATION-BASED HEALTH SURVEYS         Several routinely collected federal surveys that include       information about health insurance coverage have been linked       to the National Death Index, allowing researchers to compare       the mortality rates over several years of respondents with       and without coverage at the time of the initial survey. One       weakness of these studies is their lack of information about       the subsequent acquisition or loss of coverage, which many       people cycle into and out of over time. This dilutes coverage       differences and may lead to underestimation of the effects of       insurance coverage.        Sorlie and colleagues analyzed mortality among respondents       to the 1982-1985 Current Population Survey, with follow-up       through 1987. In analyses limited to employed persons, the       relative risk for death associated with being uninsured was       1.3 for white men and 1.2 for white women (neither overall       figures nor those for minorities were reported).  [[Page S3758]]       The study's lack of data on important determinants of health,       such as smoking, and its reliance on employment status as the       only proxy for baseline health status weaken confidence in       its conclusions.        Kronick used data from the 1986-2000 National Health       Interview Surveys, with mortality follow-up through 2002. The       mortality hazard ratio for uninsured versus insured       individuals was 1.10 (95% CI, 1.03 to 1.19) after adjustment       for demographic variables, smoking, and body mass index. The       hazard ratio fell to 1.03 (95% CI, 0.95 to 1.12) after       additional adjustment for baseline health, defined by using       self-reported disability and self-rated health. Although the       self-rated health scale is known to be a valid predictor of       mortality, it may introduce inaccuracies in comparisons of       uninsured versus insured persons. Recent data indicate that       gaining coverage improves self-rated health, before       improvements in objective measures of physical health are       detectable (or plausible). This suggests that uninsurance may       cause people to underrate their health, perhaps because of       anxiety or the inability to gain reassurance about minor       symptoms. Analyses, such as Kronick's, that rely on self-      rated health for risk adjustment therefore may inadvertently       compare relatively sick insured persons to relatively healthy       uninsured persons, obscuring outcome differences caused by       coverage. Studies that include more objective measures of       baseline health should be less subject to any such bias.      MORTALITY FOLLOW-UP OF POPULATION-BASED HEALTH EXAMINATION SURVEYS         Two studies have analyzed the effect of uninsurance on       mortality using data from the National Health and Nutrition       Examination Survey (NHANES), which obtains data from physical       examination and laboratory tests among participants.        Franks and colleagues analyzed the 1971-1975 NHANES, with       mortality follow-up through 1987. They compared mortality of       uninsured and privately insured adults older than age 25       years, adjusted for demographic characteristics, self-rated       health, smoking, obesity, leisure time exercise, and alcohol       consumption. In addition, their models controlled for       evidence of morbidity determined by laboratory testing and       medical examinations performed by NHANES staff. By 1987, 9.6%       of the insured and 18.4% of the uninsured had died. After       adjustment for baseline characteristics and health status,       the hazard ratio for uninsurance was 1.25 (95% CI, 1.00 to       1.55).        Wilper and colleagues' study (which we coauthored) used       data from the 1988-1994 NHANES, with mortality follow-up       through 2000. The study assessed mortality among uninsured       and privately insured persons age 17 to 64 years, controlling       for demographic characteristics, smoking, alcohol       consumption, body mass index, leisure time activity, self-      rated health, and physician-rated health after the NHANES       physician completed the medical examination. The study also       included sensitivity analyses adjusting for the number of       hospitalizations and physician visits within the past year,       limitations in work or activities, job or housework changes       due to health problems, and number of self-reported chronic       diseases, which yielded results similar to those of the main       model. In the main model, being uninsured was associated with       a mortality hazard ratio of 1.40 (95% CI, 1.06 to 1.84).    QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF STATE AND PROVINCIAL COVERAGE EXPANSIONS         In two similar studies, Sommers and colleagues compared       mortality trends in states that expanded coverage to low-      income residents (before implementation of the Affordable       Care Act) with trends in similar states without coverage       expansions.        Their analysis of Medicaid expansions in Maine, New York,       and Arizona during the early 2000s found that adult mortality       rates fell faster in those states than in neighboring ones (a       relative reduction of 6.1%, or 19.6 deaths per 100,000),       coincident with a decline in the uninsurance rate of 3.2       percentage points. Mortality reductions were largest among       nonwhites, adults age 35 to 64 years, and poorer counties.       Sommers and colleagues' subsequent reanalysis using data that       allowed better matching to control counties yielded a       slightly lower estimate of the mortality effect. As the       authors note, the large mortality effect from a relatively       modest coverage expansion may reflect the fact that Medicaid       enrollment often occurred ``at the point of care for patients       with acute illnesses,'' leading to the selective enrollment       of those most likely to benefit from coverage.        A study of the effect of Massachusetts' 2006 coverage       expansion compared mortality trends in Massachusetts counties       with those in propensity score-matched counties in other       states. Mortality decreased by 2.9% in Massachusetts relative       to the comparison counties, a difference of 8.2 deaths per       100,000 adults, with larger declines in poorer counties and       those with lower coverage rates before the expansion.                       OTHER QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES         Several researchers have used data from the Health and       Retirement Study (HRS)--a longitudinal study that has       followed cohorts enrolled at age 51 years or older--to assess       the effect of insurance coverage on mortality. The HRS       periodically surveys respondents and their families and has       been linked to Medicare and National Death Index data.        McWilliams and colleagues found significantly higher       mortality rates among uninsured compared with insured HRS       respondents, even after propensity score adjustment for       multiple predictors of insurance coverage. Baker and       colleagues found that respondents who were uninsured       (compared with those who had private insurance) had higher       long-term but not short-term mortality. After adjustment for       multiple baseline characteristics, including instrumental       variables associated with coverage (such as a spouse's union       membership), Hadley and Waidmann found a strong positive       association between insurance coverage and survival before       age 65 years. Black and colleagues suggested, on the basis of       a ``battery of causal inference methods,'' that others       overestimated the survival benefits of insurance and that       uninsured HRS respondents had only slightly higher (adjusted)       mortality than those with private coverage. Finally, studies       have reached conflicting conclusions as to whether the health       of previously uninsured persons improves (relative to those       who were previously insured) after they reach age 65 years       and become eligible for Medicare. Overall, the preponderance       of evidence from the HRS suggests that being uninsured is       associated with some increase in mortality.        Some studies using other data sources suggest that death       rates drop at age 65 years, coincident with the acquisition       of Medicare eligibility, whereas others do not.        Finally, several studies have assessed the relationship       between insurance coverage and hypertension control, a likely       mediator of any relationship between coverage and all-cause       mortality. Lurie and colleagues followed a cohort of 186       patients who lost Medicaid coverage because of a statewide       policy change and a control group of 109 patients who       remained eligible. Among those who lost coverage, 5 died       within 6 months (compared with none in the control group; P =       .16), and the average diastolic blood pressure of those with       hypertension increased by 10 mm Hg (compared with a 5-mm Hg       decrease in controls; P= 0.003). At 1 year, 7 patients who       had lost Medicaid and 1 control had died; blood pressure       differences were slightly less marked than seen at 6 months.       A similar study of patients terminated from Veterans Affairs       outpatient care because of a budget shortfall found marked       deterioration in hypertension control among the terminated       patients relative to controls who maintained access. These       clinic-based findings accord with cross-sectional population-      based analyses of data from NHANES, which have found worse       blood pressure control among uninsured than insured patients       with hypertension.         EVIDENCE FROM OTHER NATIONS AND FROM CROSS-NATIONAL STUDIES         The United States lags behind most other wealthy nations in       life expectancy and is the only one with substantial numbers       of uninsured residents. Although many factors confound cross-      national comparisons, a recent study suggests that worse       access to good-quality health care contributes to our       nation's higher mortality from medically preventable causes       (so-called amenable mortality). Similarly, a recent review of       studies from many nations concluded that ``broader health       coverage generally leads to better access to necessary care       and improved population health''.        Quasi-experimental studies assessing newly implemented       universal coverage in wealthy nations have reached similar       conclusions. For instance, Taiwan's rollout of a single-payer       system in 1995 was associated with an accelerated decline in       amenable mortality, particularly in townships where coverage       gains were larger. In Canada, a study exploiting the       different dates on which provinces implemented universal       coverage estimated that coverage expansion reduced infant       mortality by about 5% (P < 0.03).        Finally, a recent study of cystic fibrosis cohorts also       suggests that coverage improves mortality. Such patients       live, on average, 10 years longer in Canada than in the       United States. Among U.S. patients, those without known       coverage have the shortest survival; among the privately       insured, life expectancy is similar to that among patients in       Canada.   TABLE 2.--WHY THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP OF HEALTH INSURANCE TO MORTALITY                             IS HARD TO STUDY ------------------------------------------------------------------------   ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Deaths, especially from causes amenable to medical treatment, are rare  among nonelderly adults, who account for most of the uninsured. Because insurance might prevent death by slowing the decline in health  over several years, short-term studies may underestimate its effects. Many people cycle in and out of insurance diluting differences between  groups. Randomly assigning participants to no coverage is unethical in most  circumstances. Observational studies must address reverse causality. Illness sometimes  causes people to acquire public insurance by qualifying them for  Medicaid, Medicare, or Department of Veterans Affairs disability  coverage. Conversely, illness may cause job loss and resultant loss of  private coverage. In cohort studies, adequate control for baseline health status is  difficult, particularly in uninsured patients, whose lack of access  lowers self-rated health and also causes less awareness of important  risk factors, such as hypertension or hyperlipidemia.  [[Page S3759]]    Quasi-experimental studies, which exploit factors associated with  coverage (such as policy changes), rest on unverifiable assumptions  (e.g., that without a coverage expansion, mortality trends in states  expanding coverage would parallel those in comparator state). ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                 DISCUSSION         The evidence accumulated since the publication of the IOM's       report in 2002 supports and strengthens its conclusion that       health insurance reduces mortality. Several newer       observational and quasi-experimental studies have found that       uninsurance shortens survival, and a few with null results       used confounded or questionable adjustments for baseline       health. The results of the only recent RCT, although far from       definitive, are consistent with the positive findings from       cohort and quasi-experimental analyses.        Several factors complicate efforts to determine whether       uninsurance increases mortality (Table 2). Randomly assigning       people to uninsurance is usually unethical, and quasi-      experimental analyses rest on unverifiable assumptions.       Deaths are rare and mortality effects may be delayed,       mandating large studies with long follow-up. Many people       cycle into and out of coverage, diluting the effects of       insurance. And statistical adjustments for baseline health       usually rely on participants' self-reports, which may be       influenced by coverage. Hence, such adjustments may under- or       overadjust for differences between insured and uninsured       persons.        Inferences about mechanisms through which insurance affects       mortality are subject to even greater uncertainty. In some       circumstances, coverage might raise mortality by increasing       access to dangerous drugs (such as oral opioids) or       procedures (such as morcellation hysterectomy). On the other       hand, coverage clearly reduces mortality in several serious       conditions, although few are common enough to have a       detectable effect on population-level mortality. The       exception is hypertension, which is prevalent among the       uninsured and seems a likely contributor to their higher       death rates. Although uncontrolled hyperlipidemia is also       more common among the uninsured, the OHIE--the only RCT       performed in the statin era--found no effect of coverage on       cholesterol levels.        Finally, our focus on mortality should not obscure other       well-established benefits of health insurance: improved self-      rated health, financial protection, and reduced likelihood of       depression. Insurance is the gateway to medical care, whose       aim is not just saving lives but also relieving human       suffering.        Overall, the case for coverage is strong. Even skeptics who       suggest that insurance doesn't improve outcomes seem to vote       differently with their feet. As one prominent economist       recently asked, ``How many of the people who write such       things . . . choose to just not bother getting their       healthcare?''                              Key Summary Points         In several specific conditions, the uninsured have worse       survival, and the lack of coverage is associated with lower       use of recommended preventive services.        The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, the only available       randomized, controlled trial that has assessed the health       effects of insurance, suggests that insurance may cause a       clinically important decrease in mortality, but wide Cls       preclude firm conclusions.        The 2 National Health and Nutrition Examination Study       analyses that include physicians' assessments of baseline       health show substantial mortality improvements associated       with coverage. A cohort study that used only self-reported       baseline health measures for risk adjustment found a       nonsignificant coverage effect.        Most, but not all, analyses of data from the longitudinal       Health and Retirement Study have found that coverage in the       near-elderly slowed health decline and decreased mortality.        Two difference-in-difference studies in the United States       and 1 in Canada compared mortality trends in matched       locations with and without coverage expansions. All 3 found       large reductions in mortality associated with increased       coverage.        A mounting body of evidence indicates that lack of health       insurance decreases survival, and it seems unlikely that       definitive randomized, controlled trials can be done. Hence,       policy debate must rely on the best evidence from       observational and quasi-experimental studies.     Mr. President, this issue is really not just about  healthcare. This is a profound moral debate defining who we are as a  people today and whom we want to be as a people in the future.   A great nation is not simply one judged by how many millionaires and  billionaires we have and by how many tax breaks we can give to  billionaires. A great nation is judged by how we treat the weakest and  the most vulnerable amongst us--those people who don't have fundraising  dinners, those people who don't contribute hundreds of thousands of  dollars into the political process. A great nation is judged by how we  treat the children, the elderly, the sick, the poor, the people who  have disabilities. This is what a great nation is. This legislation is  not worthy of a great nation. This legislation must be defeated.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.
