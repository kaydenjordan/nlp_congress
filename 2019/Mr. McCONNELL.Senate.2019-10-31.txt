 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, to lead off, I would certainly be  remiss not to congratulate the 2019 World Series champions, the  Washington Nationals. This year, our national pastime came down to a  dramatic finish. The Nationals and the Astros traded blows right up  until the final innings of game seven.   For the first time ever, the away team won all seven games of the  series. And now Stephen Strasburg, Max Scherzer, Anthony Rendon, Juan  Soto, and the rest of the 2019 Nationals are bringing a World Series  trophy here to the Nation's Capital for the first time since 1924. Back  then, of course, the home team was officially the Washington Senators,  although still often called the Nationals. That is a distinguished name  for a team.   This squad has to be hands-down the most athletic, most resilient,  most team-spirited bunch of ballplayers certainly this city has ever  had. These remarkable players; their manager, Dave Martinez; the  Nationals' front office; and the team's owners, the Lerner family--and  I particularly want to mention Ted Lerner, the patriarch, who is 94  years old. Many people thought he might not be around to see the  Washington Nationals' first championship, but he was. He is a great  owner, a great friend of the city, and it was fun to see him after the  game revel in this great accomplishment. They achieved, actually, a  small miracle. For a couple of weeks, they gave us something that all  of Washington, DC, could unite around--a miracle indeed. It is  something we can use around here these days. Congratulations to the  champions.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, later today we are  going to vote on something that should not be controversial: funding  for our national defense, for supporting servicemembers and their  families, for sustaining American global leadership and strategic edge.  This vital priority is not something that can take a back seat to  partisan dysfunction.   Our men and women in uniform don't get to go on sabbatical while they  wait  [[Page S6310]]  for Congress to get its act together. They have to stay vigilant,  remain in harm's way, and stay at their posts.   Our military commanders don't get to put critical overseas operations  on pause until Washington does its job. Their objectives loom large  whether or not we give them a predictable planning foundation.   Russia, China, and Iran will certainly not take a water break if  uncertainty leaves our Nation flat-footed. They will keep growing their  defense spending and seeking to expand their influence.   I had hoped our Democratic friends would be able to put impeachment  aside long enough to at least fund the Department of Defense. We had  heard public pronouncements from Speaker Pelosi and my colleague the  Democratic leader that they intended to work with us on substantial  legislation. If anything qualifies as substantial legislation, it is  this. It meets the Pentagon's request for targeted investments in the  U.S. military of the future. There are new resources for expanded  missile defense capabilities, trauma training, fleet maintenance, and  key partnerships with allies around the world.   But, alas, the Democratic leader announced at a press conference  Tuesday that he plans to filibuster the annual funding for our Armed  Forces. This would put our colleagues across the aisle in quite an  unusual position. The same Democrats who have recently rediscovered  hawkish-sounding positions on Syria and the Middle East are really  going to filibuster $745 million for the Counter-ISIS Train and Equip  Fund, for Iraq and for Syria, and filibuster all the other broader  funding of our Armed Forces? Really? The same Democrats whose latest  effort to impeach the President hinges on delayed military assistance  to Ukraine are themselves--themselves--going to filibuster funding for  the exact same program, the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative?  Really? It looks like it. The Democratic Party is too busy impeaching  President Trump for supposedly slow-walking assistance for Ukraine to  fund the exact same program themselves?   These are political gymnastics performed at an Olympic level--at an  Olympic level. The core message here is hard to miss: Our Democratic  colleagues have a priority list. Picking fights with the White House is  priority No. 1. And our men and women in uniform fall somewhat further  down.   It does not have to be this way. Even in a time as politically  charged as an impeachment inquiry, it doesn't have to be this way. Back  in 1998, just days before the Republican House began its impeachment  inquiry into President Clinton, the House and the Senate passed a  regular appropriations bill.   Then, some weeks later, even after the inquiry was underway, both  Chambers were still able to pass more bills to address the fundamental  business of funding the government, and President Clinton signed it  into law during the impeachment.   So if Democrats follow through on their threat to filibuster the  Defense funding later today, they will frankly be making even the 1998  impeachment period look like a clinic--a clinic--in bipartisan  cooperation.   A Democratic filibuster of Defense funding is not the vote the  military families and military installations in their home States  deserve. It is not the vote our commanders deserve, and it is not the  vote our national security deserves.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on a related matter, speaking of  past precedent, I understand this morning House Democrats will finally  cast their first impeachment vote on an impeachment resolution, which I  understand they are afraid to actually call an impeachment resolution.   As I mentioned yesterday, Democrats' draft does not even come close  to restoring the kinds of customary due process rights and protections  that past impeachment inquiries included, either for President Trump or  for their own Republican colleagues in the minority.   Here is what their resolution announced today. This is basically what  it says: ``No due process now . . . but maybe some later . . . if we  feel like it.'' It says: ``No due process now . . . but maybe some  later . . . if we feel like it.'' This is not a fair way to treat any  American, and it certainly is no way to conduct something as grave as  an impeachment process, which seeks to overturn the American people's  choice in a democratic election.   I hope the House of Representatives sees the light and steps away  from their unfair and arbitrary process.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on another matter, many of us  have been concerned for some time about the trajectory of our  strategically important NATO ally Turkey under the leadership of  President Erdogan.   Despite the hopes of the Obama administration and others that he  would be a model of Islamic democracy, Erdogan has instead used  democracy to work toward undemocratic ends. Freedom of the press,  secularism, and human rights have suffered under his rule, while  corruption has flourished. Opposition to Erdogan is growing, but the  political space for Turks to express their opposition is shrinking.   Obviously, in recent days, our concerns have centered on Turkey's  incursion into northeast Syria. We are angry about the damage Turkey  has caused for our local Kurdish partners in Syria.   I have spoken at length about my concerns on Turkey's incursion and  my opposition to withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria, but I believe we  need to be guided by our strategic interests, not emotions, as we seek  to contain the damage of Turkey's incursion, peel Ankara away from  Moscow, and encourage better behavior at home and abroad by Erdogan's  government.   I hope we will carefully consider all of our options to achieve these  important objectives and carefully examine whether a broad mandatory  sanctions bill is really the best solution.   We should think carefully about what specific effect we want  sanctions to have, how Turkey will respond to them, and how Russia or  others may exploit growing tensions between Washington and Ankara.   Before targeting an economy that is highly integrated with Europe's  economy, we should seek a better understanding of the specific economic  impact that broad sanctions will have on the global economy, on our  European partners, and on American workers and job creators. We should  reflect on whether we would be better off working in concert with  European allies to shape Turkey's behavior versus abruptly forcing  European companies to cut ties with Turkey through the threat of  sanctions.   Before using these kinds of policy tools--the kinds we use against  Iran and North Korea--against a democracy of 80 million people, we  should consider the political impact that blunt sanctions will have on  the Turkish people. Will sanctions rally them to our cause or to  Erdogan's? Would more targeted sanctions perhaps avoid some of these  unintended consequences? These are just some of the critical questions  I hope our committees of jurisdiction and the administration are able  to examine before we act.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on one final matter, I have  spoken at length in recent weeks about the protests in Hong Kong and  the situation in Syria. I would like to close today by recognizing  other important developments in the Middle East that, regrettably,  haven't received much attention.   Massive protests are underway in Lebanon and Iraq. Millions have  taken to the streets to demand more responsive, more transparent, and  less sectarian governance, and an end to rampant corruption. By all  accounts, these protests are cross-sectarian, directed at an entire  class of political leaders who have behaved undemocratically and  unethically.   The protests are also directed at Iran. The Islamic Republic has long  sought, through proxies like Hezbollah and Iraqi militias, to undermine  the sovereignty of Lebanon and Iraq. Now even Shiite communities that  have typically been heavily influenced by Iran are demanding  politicians represent their interests instead of Tehran's interests.  [[Page S6311]]    Unsurprisingly, the Iranian regime is reportedly involved in  violently suppressing peaceful protests in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and,  of course, Iran itself. The mullahs are showing the same fear as the  Chinese Communist Party. They are afraid of citizens demanding reform  and speaking up for basic freedoms. The United States should stand with  the protesters.   The administration should use the tools at its disposal to expose  corruption and foreign interference in these nations, impose  consequences for violent crackdowns on peaceful protests, and work with  the Lebanese and Iraqi leaders who are committed to doing right by  their people.                            ____________________     Madam President, for the information of the Senate, in  the managers' package of amendments that was announced last night,  amendment No. 1121 was misidentified as a Murkowski amendment. It is  actually an amendment by Senator Whitehouse that Senator Murkowski  cosponsored.    Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
