 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, and I rise because  I love my country.   I rise because the winds of change are blowing across America. The  winds of change are blowing through this House of Representatives.  There will be changes in this House, and these changes are taking place  because we are not respecting the will of the people. The people are  speaking to us, and we must listen. The winds of change are blowing.   We have an opportunity to do more than talk about invidious  discrimination. We have an opportunity to do more than talk about  racism. We have an opportunity to do something that can change the  course of history.   H. Res. 992 addresses the change that we need.   To my dear brother who just spoke, I would have you sign on to H.  Res. 992. It would provide a department of reconciliation. Yes, the  Emancipation Proclamation was not a declaration of reconciliation. It  is time for us to reconcile.   We have survived slavery, but we didn't reconcile. We have survived  Jim Crow's laws and Bull Connor's dogs, but we didn't reconcile. It is  time to reconcile.    All the commissions are fine, and I support them, but a department  that reports directly to the President of the United States of America  is in order. We need a secretary of reconciliation, someone who wakes  up every morning with his mission of reconciling by way of developing a  strategy and implementing a strategy to eliminate racial segregation as  it exists in many places still, but racism, more specifically, and  invidious discrimination.   Every day, invidious discrimination and racism will be addressed.  This is the means by which we can also get updates on progress.   We can institutionalize a methodology by which we can realize true  racial reform in this country, racial equity, as it were. This  department would have as its mission to eliminate discrimination  against all the protected classes. The secretary of reconciliation will  report to Congress twice a year and explain the progress that is being  made, or lack thereof.   This department would be funded with a minimum of 10 percent, or the  equivalent of 10 percent of what the Defense Department's budget is, a  minimum of 10 percent of the equivalent of the Defense Department's  budget. We know that the Defense Department's budget will be funded;  that means that the department of reconciliation will be funded.   Those who do not recognize the winds of change, those who believe  that we can go back to bigotry as usual, you are mistaken. This  resolution is a means by which we can send a message to all Americans  that we understand that the time has come for change. Now is the time  to bring about the change by way of a department of reconciliation.   I close with this. We don't have to listen, but I guarantee you we  will feel the effects of not listening. The winds of change are blowing  through this House of Representatives.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, for those who are not sure as to why  we are here today, please allow me to explain it to you.   We are here today because Ahmaud Arbery's murder was captured on  video.   We are here today because Ms. Cooper was captured on video as she  used incited language, the language of a Black man assaulting a White  woman, to summon the police.   We are here today because all 8 minutes and 46 seconds of George  Floyd's demise were captured on video.   And the American people don't like what they have seen. They don't  agree with what they see. They know that they have been lied to. They  know that, if these things hadn't been captured on video, we would not  be here today.   Carlyle was right: ``No lie can live forever.''   William Cullen Bryant was right: ``Truth, crushed to earth, shall  rise again.''   Dr. King was right: ``The arc of the moral universe is long, but it  bends towards justice.''   We are here today to bend the arc of the moral universe towards  justice.
