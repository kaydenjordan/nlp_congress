 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Minnesota, who has been the foremost leader in the House of  Representatives for a very long time to permanently repeal the medical  device tax.   Mr. Speaker, there are more than 7,000 medical device companies in  the United States that contribute hundreds of billions of dollars to  our economy every year. These companies employ over 400,000 Americans,  while creating lifesaving technologies that benefit patients around the  world.   Many of these manufacturers are located, as my colleague said, in my  home district of northeast Indiana. In fact, Warsaw, Indiana, in my  district, is known as the orthopedic capital of the world.   There is no doubt that this tax was incredibly destructive while it  was in effect. Data from the U.S. Department of Commerce indicates that  29,000 jobs were lost in the industry between 2012 and 2015. Suspension  of the tax has reduced some of the damage, but long-term investments  and planning are impossible without full repeal.   Without permanent repeal, we will never be able to fully recover the  jobs destroyed by ObamaCare, and patients will continue to be denied  new, lifesaving products.   The Protect Medical Innovation Act will ensure that the medical  device industry does not just survive but thrives, and this commonsense  and bipartisan legislation would permanently repeal the medical device  tax and, thereby, remove a mindless roadblock to economic growth and  patient health.   I want to thank my friend again, Representative Paulsen, for his  tireless efforts on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support  passage of H.R. 184.
