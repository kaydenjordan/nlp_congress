 Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to H.R. 3003 because, if this  bill passed, it would punish our communities more than it would punish  the criminals. As written, this bill would deny critical funding for  our police departments.   As a former 20-year prosecutor in local counties, I know firsthand  how much our local police rely on Federal funding not just to do their  job, but to be safe when they keep our communities safe. Any decrease  in any sort of funding would decrease the safety of our officers as  they strive to protect and serve our communities. This law will not  only affect our police officers' safety, but it will negatively affect  the sense of security in our communities.   Yes, the underlying intent of the law is to make it easier for ICE to  target undocumented people who are criminals--I get it--but it is not  that simple.   In the past few months, my district has seen two large-scale raids by  ICE. Yes, they swept up criminals, but they also snagged collaterals,  law-abiding people who were here in the wrong place at the right time.  Those operations cast a complete pall over the community that affected  our ability to enforce our laws.   As a gang prosecutor, over and over I experienced people who were  afraid to come forward out of fear of retaliation. Now they are afraid  of the police, afraid of the courts, and afraid of our government. That  is why I am opposed to H.R. 3003.    Mr. Speaker, this week, it was confirmed that the  Senate's Better Care Reconciliation Act is not just mean, it can't even  be passed by the majority party.   The nonpartisan CBO revealed that if that bill did pass, in our  Nation, 22 million people would lose their healthcare coverage over the  next 10 years. That means in my district, on the central coast of  California, 49,000 people would lose their insurance, and 16,000 people  would lose their coverage they gained due to the Affordable Care Act.   So because of that score, the Senate couldn't pass the bill, and they  delayed the vote on it. So now, we have the time. So now, let's slow  down. Let's do something the American people are yearning for. Let's  come together, Republicans and Democrats, not just to repair our  Nation's healthcare, but to find bipartisan solutions for what is best  for all of our constituents and all of our communities for healthcare  all across our country.                            ____________________
