 Madam Speaker, I, too, look forward to reviewing  the whistleblower's complaint, shortly.   I want to start by saying thank you to the whistleblower. We don't  know if it is a man or a woman, the person's identity, yet, but I want  to say thank you for having the courage and the bravery to come forward  and reveal--at least in terms of what we have seen from the  transcript--abuse of power by the President of the United States.   We must protect a whistleblower who comes forward and puts himself or  herself and their career on the line. I hope that this Congress will be  committed to doing that.   These are very serious charges, an abuse of power that includes  coercing a foreign leader into digging up dirt against a political  rival for the President's political gain, to win reelection; asking a  personal lawyer, his personal lawyer, to go along with this.   It appears as though the State Department and, perhaps, the Secretary  of State may also be implicated in this scandal.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to passing this resolution. I hope all  will support it.                                time  1530
