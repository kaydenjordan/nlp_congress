 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I send a question to the  desk on behalf of myself, Senator Daines, and Senator Cruz.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senators Alexander, Daines, and Cruz is for the  House managers:         Compare the bipartisanship in the Nixon, Clinton, and Trump       impeachment proceedings. Specifically, how bipartisan was the       vote in the House of Representatives to authorize and direct       the House committees to begin formal impeachment inquiries       for each of the three Presidents?    Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, in the Nixon  impeachment, you look back and think about the vote in the House  Judiciary Committee. It ended up bipartisan, but it didn't start that  way. The parties were dug in, as parties are today. The Republicans and  Democrats saw it differently. But as the evidence emerged, a bipartisan  consensus emerged on the committee, and a number of Republicans--Tom  Railsback, who just passed away, and Caldwell Butler, who loved Richard  Nixon--he was a huge fan of Richard Nixon's. But they couldn't turn  away from the evidence that their President had committed abuse of  power, cheated the election, and they had to vote to impeach him.   When it came to the Clinton impeachment, that was--again, it started  out along very partisan lines, and it ended along partisan lines. I  believe the reason why, as I said a short while earlier, was that we  never had a high crime and misdemeanor. That was the problem.   With Nixon, we had clear abuse of Presidential authority to upend the  Constitution, scheme to cheat in an election, and Members of both  parties voted to impeach. With Clinton, we had private misconduct. Yes,  I would call it a crime because he lied about that under oath, but it  wasn't misuse of Presidential authority. As I said, any husband caught  in an affair could have lied about it. And it didn't involve the use of  Presidential authority. So we never got beyond our partisan divisions  on that. And many of us--and I will include myself--believed that it  was being done for a partisan purpose, because it didn't reach a high  crime and misdemeanor.   In the Trump case--and I will say I have been disappointed, because I  serve with a number of Republicans in the House whom I like, whom I  respect, whom I work with on legislation, and I honestly believed that  when this evidence came out, as with the Nixon administration, we would  have a coming  [[Page S721]]   together. But it didn't happen, much to my disappointment.    I think you have a new opportunity here in the Senate. For one thing,  this is a smaller body. You are, as has been mentioned, the greatest  deliberative body on the planet. You have an opportunity to do  something that we didn't have a chance to do, which is to call  firsthand witnesses and hear from them.   A lot of things have happened since the impeachment articles were  adopted. One of them was emails that have been released that we didn't  know about.   It has been said by counsel that the Freedom of Information Act  information shows that if you follow the process, you get information.  No, they had to sue, and they are still in a lockdown fight over the  Freedom of Information Act and redactions that were not proper. So that  is a big fight that is still going on, but we got information.   But most tellingly, Mr. Bolton has now stepped forward and said he is  willing to testify. He is willing to come here and testify under oath.  And I think we can all learn something. As Mr. Schiff has mentioned, I  think we can structure this in such a way that it would respect the  Senate's need to do other business, which we also do in the House.   Let's get that done, and let's see if that kind of information can  help the Senators come together, as happened in the House Judiciary  Committee so many years ago when we dealt with the serious problem of  Presidential misconduct--abuse of power to cheat an election--when  Richard Nixon shocked the Nation and ultimately had to resign.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Ms. Manager.
