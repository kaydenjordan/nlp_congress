 Mr. President, I rise to thank my constituent,  Congressional Research Service analyst Eugene P. Boyd, on his four  decades of service to the U.S. Congress. Mr. Boyd retired in January  2020, but, as with many other milestones, recognition of his retirement  was disrupted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.   Mr. Boyd, a resident of Clinton, MD, began his CRS career in 1979 as  an analyst focusing on urban policy and federalism. Throughout his  career, he provided expert advice to the House and Senate on topics  that included economic development, empowerment zones, gentrification,  and intergovernmental relations.   Mr. Boyd began his career as a relocation specialist for the Prince  George's County Housing Authority. He earned a bachelor's degree in  urban planning from Virginia Commonwealth University and a master's  degree in urban planning from Howard University.   Mr. Boyd is noted especially for his commitment to and expertise on  the District of Columbia, including detailed knowledge of the city's  policies and politics that helped Congress understand the effects of  its lawmaking on the Nation's Capital. He coordinated a CRS team that  supported congressional consideration of the 1997 Capital  Revitalization and Government Reorganization Act. He advised Congress  throughout its oversight of D.C. revitalization during the 1990s. More  recently, his work focused on the Puerto Rico Financial Oversight and  Management Board--FOMB--and the Community Development Block Grant-- CDBG--Program's role in disaster recovery. He also aided Congress in  understanding challenges facing local governments that drew national  attention, such as the Flint, MI, water system.   Mr. Boyd's colleagues regard him as a leader, mentor, and friend. In  addition to guiding his colleagues in their official duties, Mr. Boyd  served in his personal capacity as an active member of the  Congressional Research Employees Association--CREA--and as a director  and vice chairman of the Library of Congress Federal Credit Union. His  colleagues always appreciated his kindness, humor, impeccable sartorial  style, and expert culinary contributions. Above all, they treasured him  as a gentleman and a professional who made CRS a better place to work.   Some of Mr. Boyd's most important life's work occurred outside of the  office. He was a member of only the second class to integrate the  public high schools in Newport News, VA. He knew well the realities of  segregation, which inspired his lifelong belief in the importance of  democratic participation. He is a committed mentor, especially to young  Black men, individually and through the Concerned Black Men  organization. And in a true act of selflessness, in 1992 Mr. Boyd  helped save the life of a 13-year-old boy in Oklahoma, whom he had  never met, by serving as a bone marrow donor. Mr. Boyd is so humble  that many of his longtime colleagues did not know about his personal  sacrifice until after he retired.   The U.S. Congress and our Nation are better informed because of  Eugene Boyd's service to the legislative branch. I ask my colleagues to  join me in wishing Mr. Boyd and his beloved wife Sharon Butts, also a  CRS retiree, and daughter Lauren, all the best as Mr. Boyd begins the  next chapter of his life of service to his community and his country.                              ____________________
