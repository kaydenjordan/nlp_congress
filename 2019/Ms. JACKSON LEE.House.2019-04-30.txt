 Mr. Speaker, we have gone through some very  difficult times, and I want to call the roll: Tree of Life, Robert  Gregory Bowers; Mother Emanuel Church, Dylann Roof; Christchurch,  Brenton Harrison Tarrant; just recently, in San Diego, John Earnest;  and recently arrested, Mark Steven Domingo.   First of all, I want to thank the FBI and its investigation for  stopping Mark Steven Domingo.   I challenge all of us, as colleagues, to begin the debate and  discussion on hate, White nationalism, and Nazism, for it is not  something that we can allow to seed and grow. We can't allow someone  who wants to attack a White nationalist group that is meeting because  of hatred, nor can we allow someone to gun people down in their  synagogues or mosques or churches.   America is better than this, and we as Members of Congress need to  begin to discuss race, discrimination, Nazism, White nationalism,  sexism. We need to discuss it in a way that is even more than  legislation.   So I call upon the Nation, I call upon this President to stand up and  announce to America that enough is enough and that he stands for the  unity of all of us.                            ____________________
