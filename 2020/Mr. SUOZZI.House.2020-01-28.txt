 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4331, the  bipartisan Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2019.   By voting for this legislation, we are standing with the Tibetans and  their religious and cultural way of life that the Chinese Government is  seeking to eliminate.   Since President Nixon went to China in 1971, most Americans have  believed that with increased exposure to our economic system and to our  system of democracy, the Chinese Government would become more like us.  That simply hasn't happened.   Whether it is the Hong Kong students, Uighur Muslims, Christians, or  Tibetan Buddhists, China does not support our way of life. It does not  support religious liberty.   Freedom of religion is a fundamental freedom. We must raise our  voices loud and clear for all that are harassed, imprisoned, tortured,  persecuted, or killed seeking to live out their faith. An attack on  religious freedom anywhere is an attack on religious freedom  everywhere.  [[Page H599]]    Chinese officials in Tibet continue to severely restrict religious  freedom, speech, movement, and assembly. They continue to restrict  access to the unique cultural environment of Tibet.   In July 2018, authorities displaced over 200 under-18-year-old monks  from at least two monasteries in Tibet and forced them to attend  government-run schools.   In October 2018, Chinese Communist Party officials opened a new  political education camp to train Tibetans in Chinese Communist Party  ideology, particularly grassroots party-building and antiseparatism.   International journalists have said that the isolation of Tibet is  worse than that of North Korea, allowing the Chinese Government to  conceal human rights abuses.   The aspirations of the Tibetan people for dignity and freedom are  viewed by the Chinese Government as a direct threat to their existence  as an authoritarian state.   Reeducation and surveillance methods pioneered in Tibet are being  used to target the Uighurs in Xinjiang, where the Chinese Government  has created a surveillance state unlike anything the world has ever  seen.   The Chinese Communist Party's repugnant campaign to destroy the  cultural and religious identities of Tibetans and Uighurs requires more  than just words of condemnation. We must stand up to any country that  restricts individual liberty and religious freedom.   This legislation would urge the administration to place economic or  visa sanctions against Chinese officials who interfere with the process  of recognizing the next Dalai Lama.   Chairman McGovern and I hosted a townhall in Queens, New York, this  past summer with the largest Tibetan diaspora community, and we learned  of their inability to visit their families in Tibet.   This legislation will also direct the Department of State to  establish a United States consulate in Lhasa, Tibet, to enable U.S.  citizens better access to Tibet.   I am proud to be part of a legislative body that continues to  advocate for Tibetans, for Uighurs, and for human rights and the rule  of law in China.    To quote the Dalai Lama: ``Tragedy should be utilized as  a source of strength. No matter what sort of difficulties, how painful  experience is, if we lose hope, that's our real disaster.''   The United States' strength is in our values, and our policies should  not be separated from them. We must not lose hope.                                time  1445
