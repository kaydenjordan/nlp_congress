 Madam President, I am wondering if my colleague would  yield for 1 minute.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators  Cortez Masto, Cardin, and Hickenlooper be authorized to sign duly  enrolled bills or joint resolutions from July 21, 2022, until July 25.    Madam President, for the past 6 months, I have been  pleased to work with a bipartisan working group of about a dozen  Senators for potential reforms of the Electoral Count Act and some  related matters. I particularly want to thank our leaders of that  bipartisan group, Senators Collins and Manchin, for organizing the  group, keeping us focused on getting results, and leading to a process  that has resulted in a positive outcome.   This week, we are unveiling our proposed legislation. Our  legislation, the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition  Improvement Act of 2022 will reform and modernize the badly outdated  1887 ECA. In 1887, the Electoral Count Act was passed. It is in bad  need of reform.   On July 18, 2022, the Wall Street Journal ran an editorial authored  by former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State Jim  Baker, who had previously served as Chief of Staff for President  Reagan. In this editorial they wrote:         We stand on opposite sides of the partisan divide, but we       believe it is better to search for solutions together than to       remain divided. This is particularly true of a vexing problem       that could wreak havoc during the 2024 presidential election:       the inadequacy of the Electoral Count Act of 1887.        The act is an antiquated, muddled and potentially       unconstitutional law that allows uncertainty during a       critical step in the peaceful transfer of power. . . .       Weaknesses in the law started to become apparent after the       2000 election.    The editorial continues:         In 2021, the ambiguities of that law helped lead to the       violent assault on the U.S. Capitol as efforts were being       made to toss out several states' slates of electoral votes.       Fortunately, those efforts failed, and the rightful winners       took office. But the threat of confusion remains. Left       unclosed, loopholes in the act could allow a repeat of the       same destructive path that occurred in 2021.    The Washington Post has written several editorials on this subject as  well. The June 19, 2022, editorial in the Post entitled ``Fix the  electoral count law now, before Trump tries to exploit it again''  reviewed the recent House committee hearings on the January 6  insurrection. The editorial wrote:         The House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol       attack heard damning testimony detailing how President Donald       Trump and a coterie of partisan lawyers advanced a dangerous       argument: that the vice president has the legal authority to       overturn a presidential election when Congress meets to count       electoral college votes. Trump official after Trump official       testified that they knew it was wrong. John Eastman, a       lawyer who advocated for the theory, acknowledged as much       in front of Mr. Trump on January 4, according to testimony       from Greg Jacob, who was Vice President Mike Pence's       general counsel. But Mr. Trump and his allies nevertheless       waged a relentless public campaign to pressure Mr. Pence       to betray the Nation's democracy. Belief in this       antidemocratic nonsense spurred the January 6 mob, which       infamously chanted, ``Hang Mike Pence.''    The Post editorial continued:         Americans went most of their history without having to       worry seriously about arcane electoral college procedures.       Even in closely fought, acrimonious presidential elections,       losing candidates accepted their defeats with grace rather       than seeking the vulnerabilities in the law to exploit. The       country no longer has that luxury. Congress should have no       higher priority than fixing the electoral college process.    The recommendations that are coming out of this bipartisan group  would do just that--fix the Electoral Count Act.   I want to thank the work of the American Law Institute, which  convened a bipartisan working group to consider possible ECA reforms.  In particular, I want to thank cochairs Bob Bauer and Jack Goldsmith  for their contributions to our efforts. I also want to thank the staff  at Protect Democracy for their suggestions and work here.   Our legislation aims to ensure that Congress can accurately and  correctly tally the electoral votes cast by the States, which should be  consistent with each State's popular vote for President and Vice  President of the United States. Our legislation clarifies some of the  ambiguities in terms of the appropriate State and Federal roles in  selecting the next President and Vice President of the United States as  set forth in the U.S. Constitution.   In our constitutional system, election law, like many other areas of  law, involves shared powers between the Federal Government on the one  hand and State and local governments on the other. Article I, section 4  of the Constitution provides:         The Times, Places, and Manner of holding elections for       Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each       State by the Legislature thereof.    That clause of the Constitution continues by concluding:         But the Congress may at any time [by law] make or alter       such Regulations.    We have the power here, and that is what the Electoral Count Act is  about.   Article II, section 1 of the Constitution provides:         Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature       thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole       Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may       be entitled in the Congress.    The Constitution also provides:         The Congress may determine the Time of choosing of the       Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes;       which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.    The 12th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1804, sets out a  framework for Congress to tally and count the electoral votes from the  States. Congress later passed the Electoral Count Act, the ECA, in  1887, in the aftermath of a contested Hayes-Tilden Presidential  election of 1876 in which States sent competing slates of electors to  Congress.   Our legislation takes several key steps to modernize the ECA and  reduce the opportunity for constitutional mischief when it comes to  Congress properly counting the electoral votes of the States.   First, the legislation helps to make it easier for Congress to  identify a single, conclusive slate of electors from each State. The  legislation requires each State's Governor as responsible for  submitting the certificate of ascertainment identifying that State's  electors. A State may designate another individual besides the Governor  to carry out this function, such as the Secretary of State, if such an  individual is named before the election day itself.   Again, the State executive official reporting their electoral votes  to Congress must do such ``under and in pursuance of the laws of such  State providing for such ascertainment enacted prior to election day.''   Our legislation, therefore, seeks to avoid circumstances in which a  State attempts to change the rules after election day due to political  pressure that may arise if a particular favored candidate loses the  election.   Congress could not accept a slate of electors from an official not  authorized to do so by State law enacted prior to election day. Our  legislation provides that States following these rules will have their  appointments of electors treated as conclusive by Congress subject to  any subsequent State or Federal judicial relief granted prior to the  date of the meeting of electors.   Our legislation states that the determination of the Federal courts  shall be conclusive on questions arising under the Constitution or laws  of the United States.   Second, the legislation modernizes the ``failed election'' language  in the ECA to specify that a State could modify its period of voting on  election day only as necessitated by ``extraordinary  [[Page S3601]]  and catastrophic'' events ``as provided under the laws of the State  enacted prior to [the election day].''   This provision makes it clear, if a State legislature tries to  override the popular vote in their State, that that would not be  allowed.   Third, the legislation provides for the expedited judicial review of  certain claims relating to a State's certificate identifying its  electors. We have limited this special judicial review in our  legislation to only be available to the aggrieved Presidential  candidates. This special procedure allows for challenges made under  Federal law and the U.S. Constitution to be resolved more efficiently  by using a special three-judge panel with a direct and timely appeal to  the U.S. Supreme Court.   Fourth, the legislation makes clear that the Vice President has a  purely ministerial role in the joint session of Congress to count the  States' electoral votes. In particular, our legislation states that the  Vice President does not have the power to solely determine, accept,  reject, or otherwise adjudicate disputes over electors. That  specifically includes objections over the proper list of electors, the  validity of electors, or the votes of the electors.   President Trump pressured the Vice President to use this illegal  method in order to overturn the 2020 election results. Ultimately, this  effort was rejected by Vice President Pence, in his capacity as  President of the Senate, as he presided over the January 6, 2021, joint  session.   Fifth, our legislation increases the threshold needed to lodge an  objection to electors from one Senator and one Representative to one- fifth of the duly chosen and sworn Members of both the House and the  Senate. Similarly, article I, section 5 of the Constitution provides  ``the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question  shall, at the Desire of one fifth of those present, be entered on the  Journal.''   This will reduce the risk and likelihood of frivolous objections  being lodged, which requires a lengthy debate and vote in the separate  Houses. The House has to vote separately; the Senate has to vote  separately; and it takes a lot of time. For example, on January 6,  2021, the Senate voted to reject, by a vote of 6 to 93, the objection  against the electors of Arizona and voted 7 to 92 on the objections  raised as to the electors from Pennsylvania.   Sixth, our legislation clarifies that, if electors are not lawfully  appointed or if an objection is sustained by Congress rejecting  electors as not lawfully appointed, those electors would not be  included in the denominator for determining the majority of the whole  number of electors appointed.   That means we can reach a decision on the day that we count the  votes.   The main focus of our work over the past 6 months has been on this  sorely needed reform in the ECA, but our working group came up with a  number of bipartisan reforms on some other matters related to  elections.   The Presidential Transition Improvement Act would help promote the  orderly transfer of power between Presidential administrations. As we  saw in 2020, the failure of a timely ascertainment of the winner by the  Administrator of the U.S. General Services Administration and the  uncooperative attitude of the Trump administration led to a delay in  providing transition resources to the incoming Biden administration.  This legislation provides clearer guidelines for eligible candidates  for President and Vice President to receive Federal resources to  support their transitions, including allowing more than one candidate  to receive these resources during the time period when the outcome of  an election is in reasonable doubt.   The Postal Service Election Improvement Act seeks to improve the  handling of mail-in ballots by the U.S. Postal Service and provides  guidance and best practices to the States to improve their mail-in  ballot processes if State law allows.   The Election Assistance Commission Reauthorization Act would  reauthorize the Election Assistance Commission for 5 years. The EAC  administers grants to States and develops nonbinding guidance and best  practices for election officials in various areas, including cyber  security, election audits, and voting accessibility.   What this legislation does not include is any substantive provision  to strengthen voting rights in this country, which is desperately  needed, and I am sorely disappointed by that omission. Our Nation has a  long history of bipartisan work on voting rights issues. I repeatedly  raised voting rights issues with our larger group as well as with our  smaller subgroup on voting practices.    Let me take a moment to remind my colleagues of our voting rights  history.   The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was approved by a broad bipartisan vote  of 328 to 74 in the House and by a vote of 79 to 18 in the Senate, and  Congress had a long bipartisan track record of clarifying its intent in  response to restrictive Supreme Court decisions--that is, until  recently.   In 1982, Congress amended section 2 of the Voting Rights Act after  the Mobile v. Bolden decision in which the Supreme Court interpreted  section 2 as prohibiting only purposeful discrimination. That was very  restrictive, making the Voting Rights Act much less effective. Congress  responded to that decision by clarifying that section 2 explicitly bans  any voting practice that had a discriminatory result irrespective of  whether the practice was enacted or operated for a discriminatory  purpose. The 1982 amendments--these are the amendments that corrected  the Supreme Court's restricted decision--passed the House by a vote of  389 to 24 and the Senate by a vote of 85 to 8. They were signed into  law by President Reagan, a bipartisan action.   Over 20 years later, Congress acted to address two Supreme Court  rulings to clarify congressional intent regarding section 5 of the  Voting Rights Act. This reauthorization passed 390 to 33 in the House  and 98 to 0 in the Senate. It was signed into law by President George  W. Bush--again, a bipartisan action.   So, after the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County v. Holder in  2013 and after Brnovich in 2021, Congress should have acted to clarify  the intent of the Voting Rights Act, but it didn't, and now we are  faced today with totally unnecessary partisan gridlock on voting  rights. We saw this gridlock play out this January when the Senate  refused to even take up and debate the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis  Act.   Let me mention one section of the VRA in particular. Section 2 of the  Voting Rights Act protects against discriminatory voting laws. It  prohibits any jurisdiction from implementing a ``voting qualification  or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure . . . in  a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right . . . to  vote on account of race,'' color, or language minority status.   For nearly 40 years, case law has interpreted section 2 to combat  racial discrimination without partisan favor. Prior to the Brnovich  case, the Supreme Court and several circuit courts had adopted a  standard to ensure the effective implementation of these provisions  consistent with the text and purpose of the Act as amended in 1982.   The Brnovich decision deviated from congressional intent behind  section 2. The Court adopted an unduly narrow reading of section 2 and  went beyond the statutory interpretation by courts for decades by  outlining five new guideposts. The decision is not tethered to the  statutory text and is inconsistent with the statute's purpose and  historical usage.   It wasn't the first time the Court narrowed our law, but in previous  efforts, we came together, Democrats and Republicans, to make sure that  the Voting Rights Act was effective. So I am disappointed that we could  not make progress in our working group to address the needed fix to  section 2.   We should have also looked at the issue of the right of private  action. Since the Voting Rights Act's enactment in 1965, Congress has  intended that voters be able to sue directly to enforce the Voting  Rights Act rather than depend entirely upon the U.S. Department of  Justice, which has finite resources to protect voting rights.   I want to thank my colleague Senator Murkowski for consistently  raising this issue.   The Voting Rights Act's private right of action is settled law as  Congress has repeatedly noted in its Voting Rights Act's amendments.   Even though the private right of action is clear and settled law, our  group should have removed any ambiguity about its intent by proposing  language making it more explicit the statute's existing right for  private action. Just  [[Page S3602]]  as we resolved ambiguities in the ECA and its potential  misinterpretation, we should have done the same with this critical  right of private action under the Voting Rights Act--a missed  opportunity.   As a recent report from the Brennan Center points out, State  legislatures have been working to make it harder to vote after the 2020  elections, even after witnessing record turnout during the pandemic.  The Brennan Center wrote that in 2022:         [S]tate lawmakers, who spent 2021 passing laws that made it       harder to vote, have focused more intently on election       interference, passing nine laws that could lead to tampering       with how elections are run and how results are determined.        Election interference laws do two primary things. They open       the door to partisan interference in elections, or they       threaten the people and processes that make elections work.       In many cases, these efforts are being justified as measures       to combat baseless claims of widespread voter fraud and a       stolen 2020 election.    The Brennan Center noted that in many of these same State  legislatures, lawmakers have continued to introduce or enact laws that  restrict access to the vote. Legislation is categorized as restrictive  if it would make it harder for eligible Americans to register, stay on  the rolls, and/or to vote as compared to existing State law.   Free and fair elections are fundamental to who we are as a nation.  For this reason, I strongly support the bipartisan working group's  proposal to reform and modernize the ECA. As we saw in the 2020  elections, different interpretations of the Electoral Count Act can  lead down a dangerous path to another January 6-style insurrection,  when former President Donald Trump and his enablers attempted to  overturn a free and fair election won by President Joe Biden.   Congress's work will not be complete when we pass this bipartisan  proposal. We still must take up and pass voting rights legislation in  order to safeguard the right to vote, which should be a right  guaranteed to all Americans, regardless of their race, wealth, or  social status.   I yield the floor.
