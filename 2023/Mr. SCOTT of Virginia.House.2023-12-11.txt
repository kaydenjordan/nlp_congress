 Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons health care  costs are so high is that consumers and employers often do not have  enough information about what they are paying for.   This makes it hard for patients to find affordable, high-quality  health care providers. And it prevents employers from spending workers'  premium dollars carefully. It also hinders competition, which keeps  health care costs in check. And finally, it limits our ability as  policymakers to improve the health care system.   Americans deserve to know what they are being asked to pay. The Lower  Costs, More Transparency Act helps ensure health care costs are driven  by those who provide the highest quality services, not those with the  most market power.   This bill includes several bipartisan priorities for our Committee  Members, and I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  working together on this package.   I am especially pleased that it strengthens oversight of the direct  and indirect compensation earned by health plan service providers. This  includes not only pharmacy benefit managers but also--critically-- insurance companies serving as third-party administrators for self- funded plans.   I was also pleased to work with my colleagues to ensure strong  privacy protections for workers.   Finally, I appreciate my colleagues' bipartisan commitment to  incorporating technical corrections to ensure that the reporting  requirements for pharmacy benefit managers apply fully to multiemployer  plans, state and local government plans, and retiree-only plans-- consistent with the intent of the legislation.   Moving forward, we must continue to promote transparency and  competition and take direct action to lower health care costs for  workers and their families.
