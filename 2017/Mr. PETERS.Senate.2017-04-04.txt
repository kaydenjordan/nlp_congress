 Mr. President, the U.S. Supreme Court is a pillar of our  Nation's democracy, and I take very seriously the Senate's  responsibility to advise and consent on nominees to serve in this  revered institution. Our constitutional democracy is a system of checks  and balances with three coequal branches of government. Each branch is  intended to serve as a check on the other two.   If congressional Republicans are unwilling or unable to check  President Trump, this leaves our courts as the last line of defense  against an administration that is committed to expanding the already  vast power that is provided to the Executive.   We have seen this play out over the past 2 months as President Trump  has twice rolled out unconstitutional travel bans only to have Federal  courts stop their implementation. The President's reaction was telling.  He lashed out at the ``so-called `judge' '' and urged his Twitter  followers to blame not only the judge who stayed a travel ban but the  entire Federal court system should an attack occur.   Judge Gorsuch wants us all to know that he found these attacks on the  judiciary ``disheartening.'' He told me as much when we met. He made a  point to use the same language when in meetings with a number of my  colleagues. Personally, I would say that these attacks on the judicial  branch are more than disheartening--they are appalling, and I would say  they are dangerous.   Judge Gorsuch is, by all accounts--and in my opinion--a good man, but  as I have reviewed Judge Gorsuch's record and previous rulings, I have  to say that I find them disheartening.   I find it disheartening that he has regularly sided against everyday  Americans' rights, including women's reproductive rights, workers'  rights, and civil rights. I find it disheartening that, instead of  allowing women access to basic healthcare, Judge Gorsuch authored a  concurring decision that argued that corporations have religious  beliefs.   Yes, we all know that corporate law creates a legal fiction of  personhood, but let's be real. Corporations are not people. They are  not humans, and I have never sat next to a corporation at church.  Corporations do not have religious beliefs. To say otherwise defies  common sense.   Judge Gorsuch's ruling and the subsequent Supreme Court decision in  Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., is a dangerous step backward for  women's health. This ruling puts corporations before people and could  leave women in Michigan and across the country without access to  essential healthcare services. This decision is a step backward for  women. It is, instead, a step forward for the growing power that  corporations have in this country. Courts not only serve as a check  against a powerful executive branch, but they are supposed to put  individuals on a level playing field against large, powerful  corporations.   I am disheartened that Judge Gorsuch was the only Tenth Circuit judge  to rule against a Detroit truckdriver who was unfairly fired for not  staying in his disabled trailer after waiting for hours in dangerously  cold weather. In a 2-to-1 decision in TransAm Trucking v. DOL, Judge  Gorsuch ruled that TransAm Trucking  [[Page S2335]]  was in the right when it fired Alphonse Maddin for walking away from  his disabled semi instead of risking death by hypothermia.   I am also disheartened by Judge Gorsuch's ruling on accommodations  for disabled students. In Thompson R2-J School District v. Luke P.,  Judge Gorsuch ruled that schools only need to provide meager  accommodations to satisfy the Individuals with Disabilities Education  Act.   During Judge Gorsuch's confirmation hearing, the Supreme Court handed  down a decision that ruled unanimously against his position. Even the  most conservative judges on the Court overruled him.   Chief Justice John Roberts powerfully wrote:         When all is said and done, a student offered an educational       program providing ``merely more than de minimis'' progress       from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an       education at all.    Whether it is ruling against children who want an equal opportunity  to get a quality education or women who want access to healthcare or a  truckdriver who simply wants to make it home safely at the end of his  shift, I am disheartened that Judge Gorsuch often fails to take into  account the human face behind each case.   The U.S. Supreme Court is often the last line of defense for everyday  Americans, and Judge Gorsuch's previous rulings indicate he believes  that corporations have greater rights than individuals. As millions  have been spent by the corporate elite in support of his nomination to  the Supreme Court, the judge has failed to acknowledge how deeply the  Citizens United decision has corrupted our government by opening the  floodgates for special interest money to pour into our elections.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle will tell you that Judge  Gorsuch is a mainstream judge. I would argue that most Michiganders do  not consider the Koch brothers or the Heritage Foundation to be  mainstream. Mainstream Michiganders would tell you that our winters can  be bitter cold and that you cannot sit in a stalled vehicle for hours  without risking life and limb. They would tell you that corporations  are not people and, therefore, do not have religious beliefs. They  would tell you that all children deserve a chance at a quality  education.   A lot of my colleagues will be discussing Senate procedures and rules  and precedent in the coming days, and I will simply say this:  Michiganders and all Americans deserve a true mainstream, consensus  Supreme Court Justice who can earn broad bipartisan support and not  merely squeak by.   Now, more than ever, we need the Supreme Court to be our Nation's  North Star, not a weathervane that responds to rapidly shifting  political winds.   Serving on the Supreme Court requires more than education, more than  experience, and more than a pleasant demeanor. A Supreme Court Justice  must have sound judicial philosophy and the ability to interpret the  law as intended by the Constitution and by the Congress.   I am extremely concerned that Judge Gorsuch's judicial approach is  out of step with mainstream Michigan values, and I urge my colleagues  to join me in opposing his nomination.    I yield the floor.
