 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  his leadership and yielding me the extra time to speak.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I share my colleagues' goal of ensuring that our trade  laws are fairly enforced. I certainly share our collective goal  promoting domestic manufacturing and jobs.   Let's be honest. The idea that our President wants to ship jobs to  China and make us dependent on China for our energy, this may sound  good, this political hyperbole may sound good, but it is flatout  nonsense.   If this legislation were to become law, it would cost, not create,  American jobs. In the long run, it would make it harder, not easier,  for our country to become energy independent.   This bill would make it impossible to deploy solar energy quickly  enough here in our country, here in the United States of America. It  would undercut the climate change investments in the Inflation  Reduction Act; the biggest investment in fighting climate change and  creating green jobs in our history.   This is an investment that we need. We have already heard from  numerous speakers on the impact that we have felt from climate change:  fires, floods, drought, and an increase in agricultural pests. This is  at a point where we need to deploy everything we can to make sure we  address the issue of climate change.   We all want solar products manufactured right here at home. That will  happen. But in the short run, our domestic industry can't increase  production fast enough to meet our demand or meet our climate goals.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
