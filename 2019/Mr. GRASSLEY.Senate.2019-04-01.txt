 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for 3 minutes for three different short remarks.    Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote on the  disaster spending bill. That bill contains funds for the 2018  hurricanes and wildfires and renews the extra funds for nutrition  assistance in Puerto Rico, which is about to expire.   The Senate amendment also expands eligibility to include ongoing  Midwest floods like we presently have in Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, and  Nebraska, but other States will have it as well.   At a time when some families in Iowa have everything that they own  underwater and the people of Puerto Rico are facing a funding cliff,  now is not the time to play politics with the disaster relief bill.   To my colleagues across the aisle who have been spending a lot of  time in Iowa lately as Presidential candidates, if you vote against  moving forward with the Shelby amendment, how are you going to look  Iowans in the eye and justify a vote against moving this disaster  relief bill ahead?                                   Tariffs    Mr. President, now I will talk about trade. I am calling on the  administration, specifically on President Trump, to promptly remove  section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and  Mexico. This will help to clear the path for the USMCA agreement and  have it ratified not just in the Congress of the United States but in  all three countries.   These tariffs and the retaliations are having a negative impact on  Americans. The agreement for Mexico, Canada, and the United States is  supposed to be a free trade agreement, but we don't have free trade  with these tariffs in place.   As Finance Committee chairman, I look forward to helping the  President with this important task. I had a chance to be at the White  House with several other Senators on that very same issue. I said to  the President something like this: You said you put the tariffs on  because Mexico and Canada weren't going to negotiate. They have  negotiated. Mr. President, you say that you have a good agreement, and  I agree that you do have a good agreement. They negotiated in good  faith. Then, wouldn't you think that the right thing to do would be to  remove the tariffs so we can move ahead?   Now, one of the important things about this is the situation in  Canada more than in the United States. Their House of Commons will  adjourn in June for their elections in October. This must be done in  the next 2 months. Well, I guess now you would say in the next 3  months, if this is going to be done this year, and I would think the  President would want to get it done this year.                        Holds Disclosure Requirements    Mr. President, this is my last 1-minute comment. All Senators now  have a copy of my letter sent with Senator Wyden's signature explaining  the holds on nominations and bills and the disclosure of those holds  and the requirements that come with such holds.  [[Page S2106]]    After many years of working on the issue, the two of us, meaning  Senator Grassley and Senator Wyden, worked in good faith with the  leadership of both parties to craft a measure everyone could accept,  and it passed the Senate overwhelmingly in 2011.   The last I checked--and this is sad to say--Senator Wyden and I are  the only ones that have holds listed in the calendar. Surely, we aren't  the only ones who are holding up nominations or legislation.   I urge all Senators to comply with the holds disclosure requirements.  I also want to remind our leaders, meaning my colleague from Kentucky  and my colleague from New York, that anyone with a hold, meaning any of  the 100 Senators with a hold, must give permission to object in their  name.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
