 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of my bill,  H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and ask for  its immediate consideration in the House.    A parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I understand the guidelines the Chair just  cited. However, seeing no objection from leadership or committee  members on either side of the aisle, does that constitute clearance and  allow the Chair to entertain my motion under the rules of the House?    Further parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, again, seeing no objection on either side  of the aisle, can the Chair advise what is required pursuant to section  956 of the House rules to allow my motion for discharge of the Born- Alive Act to be considered.    Mr. Speaker, can the ruling of the Chair be challenged?    Mr. Speaker, I ask the Chair to rule on the motion of  unanimous consent.    Mr. Speaker, if this unanimous consent request cannot be  entertained, I urge the Speaker and the majority leader to schedule the  Born-Alive Act on the floor immediately so we can stand up and defend  the sanctity of life.    This bill, Mr. Speaker, does not impose any  restrictions.
