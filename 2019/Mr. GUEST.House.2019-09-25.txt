 Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Committee on Homeland  Security and a former prosecutor, I rise today to express my concerns  regarding H.R. 2203.   While the bill is referred to as the Homeland Security Improvement  Act, the legislation does not make improvements to our homeland  security, and, in fact, would have no positive impact on resolving the  crisis at our southwest border or preventing any future homeland  security crisis.   It is the responsibility of Congress to fix gaps in our immigration  system that benefit criminals such as human traffickers and drug  smugglers.   Instead of addressing these needs, this bill would create even more  loopholes.   H.R. 2203 would establish a new and unnecessary position at the  Department of Homeland Security that would serve as an additional  barrier for law enforcement officers charged with protecting our  communities. This new position would overlap with existing positions at  DHS, and a panel of appointees or bureaucrats with no prior experience  in law enforcement would oversee the border and immigration enforcement  process.                                time  1615    Democrats must recognize the efforts, dedication, and sacrifices made  each day by members of our law enforcement community to uphold the rule  of law. Rather than undermining their roles and duties, we should be  focusing on how we can assist these brave men and women who work to  maintain our Nation's security.   I recently introduced H.R. 3990, the Operation Stonegarden  Authorization Act. This bill would establish a grant program for States  bordering Mexico or Canada or those with a maritime border. These  grants would provide much-needed resources to help Customs and Border  Protection and local law enforcement officers efficiently carry out  their mission on behalf of the American people.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in  promoting respect for our law enforcement community and providing a  sense of gratitude for the work they do to keep us, our families, and  our communities safe.   As a member of the Committee on Homeland Security, I voted against  this bill when it was considered in committee. Now, I strongly  encourage my colleagues to join me in voting against this partisan  measure and to, instead, work across the aisle to find real solutions,  bipartisan solutions, to make America a safer place to live, to  worship, and to raise a family.
