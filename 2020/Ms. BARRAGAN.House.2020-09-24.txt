 Mr. Speaker, commissioned in 1943, the USS Iowa was the  most powerful American warship of her time. The ship saw action in  World War II, and even transported President Franklin D. Roosevelt.   Since 2012, the battleship has been berthed in my district in San  Pedro, California.   Today, Senator Feinstein and I introduced a resolution to formally  name the Battleship USS Iowa Museum the ``National Museum of the  Surface Navy.'' This resolution honors the men and women who have  served and continue to serve in the surface forces of our Nation by  designating this museum as a monument to their sacrifice.   In decades past, the USS Iowa defended our Nation. Today, it educates  the next generation as a museum and promotes the causes of veterans.   Given the challenges of operating the museum in the COVID-19 era, I  say thank you to the dedicated people who have kept this museum  afloat--literally.                            ____________________
