 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this measure. And  I do so as someone who, in 2008, actually was a member of the  conference committee when we passed the reauthorization of the Higher  Education Act. Unfortunately, that is the last time Congress has moved  forward, and we are about 3 or 4 years overdue in terms of modernizing  and updating that law.   But I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, having been to the meetings--and we  actually met as conferees and we had votes and we had discussion,  unlike a lot of the short-circuited processes that unfortunately  dominates most of our business these days--it was a healthy process.                                time  1515    This issue of teacher preparation in setting up standards was totally  noncontroversial. There were a couple of items on which the two sides  actually debated, but this one was a no-brainer. It just makes perfect  sense that we want to make sure that there is at least a minimum  standard out there to make sure that kids are getting the opportunities  they need, particularly with the changing demands and needs of the  workforce.   What also just sort of astonishes me is the manner in which this  regulation was issued, which was only last October. The ink is, really,  barely dry on it. We have a new incoming administration with a new  Secretary, whom I will talk about in a second, and they have more than  ample opportunity to go back into the regulations process and amend it,  make changes, if they so choose. Instead, rather than using a scalpel,  we are using a chain saw to basically carve out, in essence, a section  of the law because the ability of the Department's to go back and do a  similar regulation is not allowed under the Congressional Review Act.   This is a measure which, as I said, was just totally  noncontroversial, on which we had a very strong vote, by the way, in  terms of the final result of the conference that took place back in  2008, and the process that is being used is just tremendous overkill.    Mr. Speaker, frankly, I think, as we stand here today  in the Chamber--and just an hour or so ago, we had a Secretary who was  confirmed in an unprecedented procedure during which the Vice President  had to come in and break the tie--it, unfortunately, has the look of,  really, being part of a pattern that we are seeing emerge here with the  confirmation hearing process during which the incoming Secretary showed  almost no regard for the notion of accountability in terms of charter  schools and voucher programs, which, for the taxpayer and for the kids  and the parents who really depend on our education system, is just a  totally unacceptable approach.   As I said, this CRA bill on the teacher preparation program is just  part of the same cloth. It is saying that we are just going to carve  out a section which was a totally bipartisan, commonsense provision  back in 2008 and that we are going to handcuff the ability of the  Department to even come in with a substitute. The chances of Congress,  at this point, coming in with new legislation--I mean, I am the eternal  optimist. Hopefully, that will happen, but it sure hasn't happened over  the last 3 or 4 years since the HEA, Higher Education Act, expired.   This is really, I think, a very unfortunate effort that is being put  forth here on the floor. As I said, given what is going on with the  Department and the vote that took place here earlier today, for those  who really care about making sure that our free public education  system, which has been, basically, part of America since Abraham  Lincoln first proposed it back in the  [[Page H1045]]  middle of the Civil War, we need to be totally on guard--on standby--to  make sure that the taxpayer is protected in terms of making sure these  grant programs go to school districts and systems that are actually  following through with programs of value and to make sure that we  protect the pillars of public education. Anyone watching that  confirmation process over in the Senate, I think, was extremely worried  and alarmed, which is why, I think, we had this avalanche of emails and  calls that came in all across the country during that process.   I strongly urge a ``no'' vote for all of the reasons I have stated.
