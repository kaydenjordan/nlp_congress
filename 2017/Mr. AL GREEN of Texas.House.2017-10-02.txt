 Mr. Speaker, our Nation is in mourning. Many  hearts are bleeding.   Mr. Speaker, there is much suffering. Lives have been lost in a  senseless and needless manner in Las Vegas.   Mr. Speaker, there is a right time for all things. This is a time for  our Nation to mourn and for hearts to heal.   Mr. Speaker, I announce that impeachment is postponed. Let us mourn,  and let us heal.                            ____________________
