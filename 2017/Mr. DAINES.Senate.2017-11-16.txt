 Mr. President, this week I have the distinct honor  of recognizing Garfield County's fire warden, Ray Hageman, for his  actions to organize and coordinate the local response to the Lodgepole  Complex fire. Ray and his team worked to preserve the lives and  livelihoods that were threatened by this devastating fire. Their  actions exemplify the resolute character of the Treasure State.   The Lodgepole Complex fire was one of the largest fires of the 2017  wildfire season. When first responders finally defeated the flames,  well over a quarter million acres of land had burned. Ray was on the  frontlines of this rural fire, orchestrating the distribution of local  equipment, coordinating effective initial response techniques, and  helping to integrate the efforts of partner firefighting organizations  from outside the county.   Effective local leaders like Ray are supported by the committed team  members they lead, team members like Garfield County's Anne Miller, who  was the public information officer for the Lodgepole Complex fire. Anne  worked around-the-clock at the beginning of the fire to build a common  understanding of a changing fire environment. By enabling open and  clear lines of communication, she strengthened the team's fire response  efforts and saved many Montanans from potential loss of property and  life.   Ray and his team weathered one of the largest wildfires in the  Nation. Their courage in the face of adversity serves as an inspiration  to all Montanans. Thank you, Ray, for leading under such difficult  circumstances and working hard to protect Montanans from  wildfires.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
