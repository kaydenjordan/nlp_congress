 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today to  anchor the CBC Special Order. I would like to thank CBC Chairman Cedric  Richmond for his leadership in this effort. Chairman Richmond has been  leading this effort and raising the question about when the President  said what do we have to lose. The chairman indicated that we have a lot  to lose.   So for the next 60 minutes, we have an opportunity to speak directly  to the American people about issues of great importance to the  Congressional Black Caucus and the millions of constituents we  represent. Tonight's Special Order is about gun violence. I thank my  colleagues for joining me here today to speak about the national  epidemic of gun violence, an important topic to us all.   The Black community is at a critical time because we have a lot to  lose because too many of our neighbors, unfortunately, have been  subject to gun violence at a consistent rate, a crime which often goes  unpunished because of unreliable witnesses.   On February 14, this Nation once again witnessed a horrific tragedy  that took place at a high school in Florida. Seventeen lives were taken  at the hands of a gunman with way too much firepower. The horror and  tragedy that shook the Florida high school should be an unimaginable  event in our country. Yet, tragically, our Nation has lost too many  loved ones at the hands of gun violence, to the point where we often  see the same reaction: hand wringing, blaming going around, but nothing  being done to stop the violence.   The city of Philadelphia knows all too well the lives we have lost at  the hands of gun violence. In 2017, we saw the city experience its  largest homicide epidemic since 2012. There were over 370 homicides in  Philadelphia, according to the data from the Philadelphia Police  Department.   And with the continuing scourge of gun violence in Philadelphia, last  year I hand-delivered a letter to Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh  Shapiro outlining our Commonwealth's need to use all resources possible  to advocate for commonsense gun reform. Since I handed that letter to  the Commonwealth's attorney general, we have had more heartbreaks in  America, including the unspeakable tragedy at a church, a place of  worship and refuge, in Texas, and the mass shooting in Las Vegas.   Mr. Speaker, there is a gentleman who is our leader from our Caucus  who will speak to this issue. He knows an awful lot about it. I have  watched him in the short period of time I have been here: the Honorable   James Clyburn from the Sixth District.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask the gentleman a question.   If the gentleman could just talk a little more about that magic he  talked about and how do we get there. Does the gentleman have any sense  of how we get there?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, you just heard the gentleman from South Carolina, in my  view, lay out a very clear vision of what it should be like from an  aspirational standpoint.   Speaking of the leader of the Congressional Black Caucus leading the  conscience of this body, the gentleman from the great State of  Louisiana, he knows a little bit about that--from my understanding,  there is legislation that he has--and that is Chairman Cedric Richmond  from the Second District of Louisiana.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Richmond).    Mr. Speaker, before the gentleman leaves, being that this  is the 50th anniversary of Dr. King's assassination, I would ask the  gentleman, to the point that he raises about the moments of silence, if  we look back and look where we are today, are we any closer to  addressing these moments of silence, because I hear frustration in his  voice?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for laying out that  eloquent statement.   Next is someone who is from the great State of Illinois, who, since I  have been here, has been relentless on this issue, particularly from an  inner-city standpoint, an urban standpoint. I have watched her over and  over again constantly stand up and make comments, and I wonder if she  thinks anybody is listening, but I am going to give her that  opportunity to say a few things here this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the Second District of  Illinois (Ms. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask just one question to the  gentlewoman from Illinois, who has been speaking to this issue a lot.   Does the gentlewoman have any sense of optimism of people hearing her  in any way? Does she see any signs?   I mean, she just ticked off some information. What are her thoughts  about change around here?    Mr. Speaker, I have someone who I have had the utmost  respect for. He smiles. I told him he could get elected in  Pennsylvania. He is from the great State of Mississippi. I don't want  to shock the people of Mississippi. He is not leaving Mississippi.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the Second Congressional  District of Mississippi (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the gentleman, since I  have never seen this thing called an AR-15, can he describe what this  gun looks like?    Yes.    Mr. Speaker, I thought the gentleman gave a really clear  sense of what the challenge is and what we face today.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, coming behind the gentleman from Mississippi,  we have someone who knows a little bit about weaponry. She herself has  a background. She was the police chief in Orlando. And since she and I  are in the same class, I have learned a lot from her.                                time  2015    And coming behind the gentleman from Mississippi, who laid some  things out here, is someone who has run a police department, and she  couldn't be a better person for us to have come. I yield to the  gentlewoman from the State of Florida (Mrs. Demings), from the 10th  District.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my colleague from Florida  a question, since she talked about her law enforcement background. And  she is correct, Congress is to make laws.   This Presidential administration talks about being law and order. Is  he really law and order and on the side of the police if this is  happening and running amok? I mean, if you were police chief and you  had that responsibility of protecting people--and we in Congress, as  was stated by the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, the  moments of silence. If you were on the front line again, you were out  there, and you still know a lot of the people who are part of the  police departments, how do you think the police departments feel when  they are outgunned and the challenges that they have? Can you talk a  little bit about that?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida.   Mr. Speaker, I have someone who, when I came here, I said I have to  meet her. She is a very dynamic person. She is the Honorable Barbara  Lee from the 13th Congressional District of California, and I yield to  the gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I think showing those pictures, if anything,  should get our point across. I hope that those pictures will send a  message to all of us.   Closing out tonight--and I think all our colleagues really just  summed up this gun violence issue--is someone who, again, I have known  well and admired, the Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee from the 18th  District of Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).
