 Madam Speaker, if I understand,  the Republican argument is that the document doesn't contain an  explicit quid pro quo.   Well, let me remind my friends, you don't need to state an explicit  quid pro quo to break your oath. You don't need to state an explicit  quid pro quo to break the law. You don't need to state an explicit quid  pro quo when you have conducted the quid pro quo, when you have  withheld the military aid.   You don't need to state an explicit quid pro quo when you have  launched a cover-up by violating the law by refusing to produce the  whistleblower complaint as you are required to do.   All of these actions are contained in the recent statements of the  President and in the plain language of the White House document. And  the idea, the idea that we can't wait a day to get the transcript  ignores the fact that, for three weeks, they have ignored the law in  producing the whistleblower complaint; and we would not have it ever if  it weren't for the actions of the Democrats in this House.   And the talking point that this issue should hinge on the  explicitness of the quid pro quo is nothing more than a smokescreen to  hide the fact that the President's conduct is a violation of the law,  and a violation of his oath, and more than justifies the production of  the whistleblower complaint and the launching of an impeachment  inquiry.
