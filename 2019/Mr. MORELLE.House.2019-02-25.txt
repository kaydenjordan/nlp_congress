 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained due to inclement  weather in New York and missed votes. Had I been present, I would have  voted YEA on Roll Call No. 88 regarding the ``Innovators to  Entrepreneurs Act of 2019 (H.R. 539)'' and YEA on Roll Call No. 89  regarding the ``Recognizing Achievement in Classified School Employees  Act (H.R. 276).''                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION
