 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Madam Speaker, I rise today, not just as a new Member of  Congress, but as someone who has spent my career as a consumer  protection lawyer studying families pushed to the brink of financial  ruin.   I have sat all day long listening to the personal stories of families  driven to bankruptcy by predatory loans, financial scams, and unlawful  and immoral debt collectors.   I rise today as someone who has personally spoken to thousands of  families in foreclosure; as someone who has had to look into the eyes  of parents and children and tell them: ``I'm sorry, but the bank is  going to take your house.''   These are not experiences that someone can forget. I carry these  stories of California families with me every day. That is why I ran for  office. It is why I stand up for a level playing field for families.   I cannot fathom how the minority, with this amendment, is shrugging  off the devastation of the 2008 collapse.   Ten years ago, in 2009, Orange County was coming off a year when home  prices fell 30 percent. Imagine being a family planning for retirement  and, all of a sudden, your primary source of security is gone.   Ten years ago, in May 2009, California had an unemployment rate of 11  percent.   Do Members of this body not remember how many of our friends and  neighbors spent sleepless nights wondering if they could keep a roof  over their heads?   The 2008 economic collapse cast a long shadow. One study from the CDC  found that suicides, spurred by evictions and foreclosures, doubled  between 2005 and 2010. Those are going to be difficult victims to  locate.   Because of this human tragedy, Congress acted and created the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency whose sole focus is to  ensure that financial services companies and Wall Street megabanks  could not again cheat families and tank our economy.   We created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, even though  special interests were spending $3 million a day to defeat it. Think  about it; an industry so wealthy that even in its collapse, they had  $40 million to spend on lobbyists.   Now these same special interests are, again, attacking the CFPB. This  amendment is just another effort by the same Members who voted against  the CFPB's very creation to limit the agency's effectiveness.   In my nearly 2 decades as a consumer advocate, I have never met a  single American, Democrat, Republican, or Independent, who likes being  cheated. If the Members today were listening to their constituents, and  not special interests, they would support the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau.   I am a proud capitalist, and it is in that deep belief in healthy and  strong markets, that I rise today in opposition to this motion to  recommit.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss women's access to  essential healthcare services.   I am the mother of three beautiful children. When I gave birth to my  first child, to my second child, and to my third child, I was given the  time and opportunity to plan for these pregnancies and welcome these  children. I was privileged enough to have the ability to make an  informed decision to become a mother at a time in my life when I was  ready to care for children.   Prior to having children, I had access to birth control. I received  healthcare that helped me have three healthy pregnancies and helped me  to be able to get pregnant when I was ready. But too many women in this  country don't have these choices.   Across the world, maternal mortality rates are decreasing. Pregnancy  and birth are less dangerous across the globe, but not in the United  States. While our country is a leader in so many ways, we are failing  our Nation's women by not delivering the care they need during and  after they give birth.   Too many women don't have access to prenatal and postnatal care. Too  many women already don't have access to birth control or abortion  services, and if we do not fight back, this crisis is only going to get  worse. If we do not fight back, women are going to die.   The bills currently passing at the State level will not stop  abortion. Overturning Roe v. Wade will not stop abortion. These acts  will only stop safe abortion.   Research has found that every year approximately 25.1 million women  receive an unsafe abortion, and 68,000 women die annually of bleeding  and infection, almost entirely in countries where abortion is illegal  or inaccessible.   If we continue down this road, women will die. The laws being passed  in Alabama, Missouri, and Georgia are not pro-life. They are not  protecting the lives of women and families that we were elected to  serve.   Alabama has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the  country, but instead of focusing on ensuring that women have access to  the healthcare services they need when they choose to have a pregnancy,  the State is choosing to punish those who do not become mothers.                                time  1815    Alabama State legislature has said that they just simply don't have  the funds to expand Medicaid to cover more low-income women, families,  and other individuals. Yet they have the millions of dollars necessary  to fight a legal battle to overturn Roe v. Wade. These laws are anti- choice, anti-women, and anti-life.   In the Alabama bill, the penalty for aborting a pregnancy caused by  rape is higher than the penalty for raping a woman. Let me say it  again: in the Alabama law, the penalty for aborting a pregnancy caused  by rape is higher than the penalty for committing the rape.   This is not the country we want to be.   How is that upholding our values?   Let's also note that women who have a miscarriage--a tragic event-- could be criminally investigated to determine if the miscarriage was  related to an attempted abortion or was otherwise somehow the fault of  the woman.   According to March of Dimes, 10 to 15 percent of pregnancies end in  miscarriage. Most miscarriages happen in the first trimester, before  the 12th week of pregnancy, but nearly 5 percent of pregnancies that  ended with miscarriages happened in the second trimester.   As a mother I cannot imagine the pain of losing a child in the first,  second, or even third trimester. For those who choose to get pregnant,  this loss is devastating. Imagine you and your partner try for years to  get pregnant. You can't afford expensive treatments like IVF because  they are not covered under your insurance. You desperately want to be a  mother, but nothing seems to be working. Finally, after 3 years, you  take a home pregnancy test, and you find out you are pregnant. A short  trip to the doctor confirms this incredible and exciting news. You and  your partner are overjoyed. But 5 months later you start bleeding and  rush to the emergency room. More than halfway through your pregnancy,  you have miscarried and will now have to deliver a stillborn child. You  and your partner are heartbroken.   Imagine that a few days after this tragic loss you find out that you  and your doctor are both being investigated for attempting to abort the  child whose death you are still mourning.   This is cruel and inhumane. These bills are not intended to stop  abortion, and they will not stop abortion. They are not intended to  save lives, and, in fact, these bills will take lives.   This is the proof. If we really want to reduce the number of  abortions in this country, we must ensure safe access to women's  healthcare, including birth control and comprehensive family planning  options.   I want women in Alabama, in Georgia, in Missouri, and in every State  across the country that has passed or is attempting to pass legislation  to challenge Roe v. Wade to know that I stand with them.   I want women in Orange County to know that they elected someone who  will fight for their access to essential healthcare services.   I want women in California and across the country to trust that my  colleagues and I will fight for women  [[Page H4116]]  to have the healthcare and the respect that they need and deserve  regardless of their income, race, or location.   Protecting women's access to healthcare is one of my top priorities,  and I will fight to ensure that every woman has the access they need to  live a healthy life on their own terms.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Omar).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Omar for her remarks,  and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 24 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, May 23, 2019, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
