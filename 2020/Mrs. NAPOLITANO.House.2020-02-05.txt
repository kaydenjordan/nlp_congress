 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Malinowski) for H.R. 4044, the reauthorization of the very popular  National Estuary Program, or NEP. It allows more proactive measures to  be eligible under the program.   The strong bipartisan support this bill has received is evidence of  its widespread popularity and success. I am very pleased that several  members of this committee have all cosponsored the bill. The bill  represents the commitment to our coastal areas and the vital role they  play in economic drivers, natural water filters, and protection from  flooding events.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge the EPA and States to work together to  designate more national estuaries that can be eligible for this  program, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill, H.R. 4044.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 1132) to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act  to establish a grant program to support the restoration of San  Francisco Bay, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1132         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``San Francisco Bay       Restoration Act''.  [[Page H786]]            SEC. 2. SAN FRANCISCO BAY RESTORATION GRANT PROGRAM.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1132, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1132. Introduced by the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier), H.R. 1132 builds off existing  bay restoration work under EPA's National Estuary Program.   In my home State of California, the importance of a healthy watershed  and improved water quality has never been more apparent. In fact, the  San Francisco Bay estuary drains more than 40 percent of our State's  waters.   That is why I am thankful to see several of my colleagues from  California as original cosponsors, including members of this committee:  Mr. Garamendi, Mr. Huffman, and Mr. DeSaulnier.   At our June hearing, the subcommittee learned about the ongoing  sources of pollution to this 1,600-square-mile estuary. Simultaneously,  habitat destruction has forever changed the geography of the bay area.  More than 90 percent of shoreline wetlands and 40 percent of the total  aquatic ecosystem have been lost.   This new EPA program office will concentrate Federal efforts to  address water quality challenges and ecosystem health in the bay. This  will improve the environment and economy for the bay area region that  is home to 8 million people and an annual GDP of $775 billion.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 1132, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters in support of H.R. 1132,  the San Francisco Bay Restoration Act, from the National Audubon  Society and Save the Bay.

Peter DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Sam Graves,      Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, Washington, DC.      Hon. Grace Napolitano,      Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Bruce Westerman,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Water Resources and           Environment, Washington, DC.        On behalf of the National Audubon Society's more than 1       million members, our mission is to protect birds and the       places they need for today and tomorrow. We write to offer       our support for the following bills related to important       coastal and water conservation issues that will be the       subject of the September 19, 2019 Markup before the Committee       on Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.           HR 4031--Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2019         The Great Lakes are home to 30 million people and 350       species of birds, but increasing challenges are on the       horizon for the world's largest body of freshwater.       Fluctuating water levels exacerbated by climate change,       invasive exotic species and excess nutrients are putting even       more stress on this ecosystem that is so important for birds       and people. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has helped       clean up toxic pollutants, protect wildlife by restoring       critical habitat, and help combat devastating invasive       species.        HR 4031 would increase funding for conservation projects to       $475 million over five years, by increasing the Great Lakes       Restoration Initiative's authorization incrementally from       $300 million per year to $475 million per year.                  HR 1132--San Francisco Bay Restoration Act         The San Francisco Bay Area, home to the Pacific Coast's       largest estuary, is also home to a rapidly growing population       of 8 million people, and provides for a host of social and       economic values through ports and industry, agriculture,       fisheries, archaeological and cultural sites, recreation, and       research. However, San Francisco Bay has lost 90% of its       tidal wetlands and more than 50% of its eelgrass and mudflat       habitat. Climate change exacerbates these conditions through       drought that alters the salinity balance, ocean acidification       that reduces species abundance and diversity, increasing       water temperatures, and rising seas causing flooding that       eliminates living shorelines and puts communities at risk.       Many species of waterbirds forage in the San Francisco Bay,       including Brant Geese and Surf Scoters, underscoring the       value of this ecosystem.        HR 1132 would authorize a San Francisco Bay Restoration       Grant Program in EPA and funding of up to $25m per year to       support the restoration of this estuary.             HR 1620--Chesapeake Bay Program Reauthorization Act         Salt marshes are special places to birds and other       wildlife, but sea level rise has elevated the waters in the       Chesapeake Bay by one foot during the 20th century and is       accelerating due to climate change. Salt marshes provide       valuable ``ecosystem services'', including nurseries for the       Chesapeake Bay's commercially important fish, a buffer       protecting coastal communities against storm surge, a filter       that stops nutrient and sediment pollution from entering the       Bay, and a recreational resource attracting visitors who       contribute millions of dollars to local economies. Chesapeake       Bay's salt marshes host globally significant populations of       both Saltmarsh Sparrow and Black Rail.        HR 1620 would increase the authorization of appropriations       for the Chesapeake Bay Program to more than $90m per year.      HR 2247--Promoting United Government Efforts to Save Our Sound Act         Despite significant investments in Puget Sound ecosystem       health by state, federal, tribal and local governments,       concerned members of the public, and conservation       organizations, progress towards ecosystem recovery targets       remains slow. The number of marine birds wintering in Puget       Sound has declined significantly in the last 30 years and       migratory, fisheating birds appear to be at the greatest       risk.        HR 2247 would authorize up to $50 million in funding for       Puget Sound recovery. The PUGET SOS Act also aligns federal       agency expertise and resources, ensuring that federal       agencies are coordinated, setting goals, and holding each       other accountable will help increase their effectiveness and       provide a boost to Puget Sound recovery.             HR 3779--Resilience Revolving Loan Fund Act of 2019         Pre-disaster planning can help communities adapt to the       changing flood patterns that threaten people and birds       species dependent on shoreline and riverine areas. These       changes have led to more frequent instances of ``nuisance       flooding,'' as well as catastrophic events. NOAA has found       that ``nuisance'' or ``sunny day'' flooding is up 300% to       900% than it was 50 years ago. In addition, catastrophic       flooding events have increased in both frequency and       intensity. These trends have been particularly pronounced in       the Northeast, Midwest and upper Great Plains, where the       amount of precipitation in large rainfall events has       increased more than 30 percent above the average observed       from 1901-1960. As sea level rise accelerates, it only       exacerbates these impacts, which further compounds       vulnerability in flood-prone communities.        HR 3779 would amend the 1988 Stafford Act to offer low-      interest loans to states for ``disaster mitigation       projects'', including investments in natural infrastructure       projects, which would help communities prepare and recover       from natural disasters.        We urge you to support and advance the bills listed above.       Please feel free to contact us with any questions.            Sincerely,                                             Julie Hill-Gabriel,                                 Vice President, Water Conservation,      National Audubon Society.                                   ____                                                     Save the Bay,                                                   February 3, 2020.      Hon. Jackie Speier,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.                              HR 1132: Support         Dear Representative Speier: Save The Bay applauds your       introduction of HR 1132, the San Francisco Bay Restoration       Act, and encourages all Members of Congress to vote for its       passage on the House Floor this week. This initiative will       enhance the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's efforts       capacity to improve the health of San Francisco Bay, with       resources that are desperately needed at a time of       accelerating climate change.        Save The Bay is the oldest and largest membership       organization working exclusively to protect and restore San       Francisco Bay, with 50,000 members and supporters. As the       Bay's leading champion since 1961, Save The Bay is committed       to making the Bay cleaner and healthier for people and       wildlife, and HR 1132 would significantly advance that goal.        Over the last 150 years, the water quality and health of       the San Francisco Bay estuary have been diminished by       pollution, invasive species, loss of wetland habitat and       other factors. Improving bay water quality, restoring       critical habitat, and adapting to climate change in San       Francisco Bay, are urgent federal, state and regional       priorities that require additional funding. The Bay region is       fortunate to have in place well-developed science-based       plans, agencies, and collaborative structures to improve the       Bay's health, but more resources for implementation are       essential in the crucial decade ahead. The San Francisco Bay       Restoration Act would provide significant additional capacity       to improve the Bay, building efficiently on elements already       in place to improve our economy and the region's quality of       life.        In 2016, San Francisco Bay Area voters agreed to make an       unprecedented investment in San Francisco Bay Restoration,       approving a nine-county parcel tax specifically to accelerate       Bay tidal marsh restoration. Measure AA was approved by more       than 70 percent of the region's voters, and is raising $500       million over 20 years for grants to restoration projects,       most of which are occurring on federal property with the San       Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge. Matching federal       investment for this and other restoration work is overdue,       and HR 1132 would begin to address that need by authorizing       $25 million annually for those purposes.        HR 1132 also would address the inequity in funding for U.S.       EPA Geographic Programs, which are annually providing orders       of magnitude higher funding to other national estuaries under       strong statutory authority within the Clean Water Act. San       Francisco Bay deserves similar support and commitment as the       federal government currently provides to Chesapeake Bay,       Puget Sound and other locations, and HR 1132 begins to       rectify that disparity.        Each month provides evidence of added urgency and need for       the San Francisco Bay Program and resources that HR 1132       creates. Tidal marsh restoration is essential to protect Bay       wildlife habitat, and adjacent shoreline communities and       infrastructure from sea level rise. The recent Baylands       Habitat Goals Update underscored that tidal marsh       revegetation must be initiated wherever possible within the       next decade to stay ahead of rising seas, and the recent       California Legislative Analyst's Office report further       underscores the urgency of adaptation and resilience actions.       And as California Governor Gavin Newsom stated in January,       ``We are experiencing a global climate crisis. One that has       irreversible impacts and is happening right now. This is not       something to deal with 10 years from now. Or 5 years from       now. Or 2 years from now. we need action. Now.''        We deeply appreciate the strong support from Speaker Pelosi       and the entire San Francisco Bay delegation for HR 1132. We       encourage the House of Representatives pass this bill       swiftly, and we pledge our continued assistance toward its       enactment. Thank you again for your leadership!            Sincerely,                                                       David Lewis,                                                Executive Director.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I do urge all my colleagues to support  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 2247) to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act  to provide assistance for programs and activities to protect the water  quality of Puget Sound, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2247         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 2247, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2247 would establish a new program office within  EPA to enhance rehabilitation efforts for Puget Sound in Washington  State. Introduced by the gentlemen from Washington, Mr. Heck and Mr.  Kilmer, H.R. 2247 builds off an existing program for the Sound under  EPA's National Estuary Program.   The bill authorizes $50 million annually over 5 years to establish a  Puget Sound Federal Leadership Task Force that will be responsible for  coordinating the wide-ranging priorities for recovery of the region.   We heard in our subcommittee hearing in June that human development  has degraded the water quality and habitat of the Sound. We need to do  more to protect our iconic waters, like Puget Sound, on which 4.5  million people rely for food, clean water, and other ecosystem  services.   We also know that the health of these waterways impacts critical  species, such as salmon and the orca whales and a variety of other  wildlife across the State. The Sound has been a member of the National  Estuary Program since 1988, engaging in a wide range of habitat  protection, water quality improvement and monitoring, but a recent GAO  study found that the threat the Sound faces outpace efforts to combat  them. In short, we must support a more directed approach to helping the  entire Puget Sound recover.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2247, and I include  in the Record letters of support from Northwest Indian Fisheries  Commission, Puget Sound Partnership, and the National Audubon Society.                                                   Northwest Indian                                            Fisheries Commission,                               Olympia, Washington, August 22, 2019.      Re NWIFC Support for H.R. 2247--Promoting United Government           Efforts to Save Our Sound Act.       Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Sam Graves,      Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and Honorable       Members of the Committee: The Northwest Indian Fisheries       Commission wishes to express our support for H.R. 2247 and       respectfully requests passage of this important bill referred       to your committee. The Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission       is comprised of the 20 treaty Indian tribes in western       Washington, who have constitutionally protected, federally       adjudicated, treaty-reserved rights to harvest, manage, and       consume salmon and shellfish in their usual and accustomed       areas. These treaty-reserved resources are inextricably       linked to the health of Puget Sound. If we cannot recover       Puget Sound, we will not recover salmon, we will not maintain       our culturally and economically significant shellfish       fishery, and we will not protect our treaty-reserved rights.        We support H.R. 2247 because it recognizes the role of       tribes as sovereign governments working collaboratively to       restore our shared waters. The bill also provides a logical       approach to Puget Sound recovery, by encouraging a more       efficient use of government through improved federal agency       coordination on Puget Sound actions. It is only logical that       government agencies would align their related activities to       compliment the significant contribution of federal funding       directed toward restoration and not undermine those       investments or our treaty-reserved rights.        We also support H.R. 2247 because it authorizes much needed       increases to Puget Sound funding. We greatly appreciate the       Geographic Program-Puget Sound appropriations Congress       continues to provide. However, funding for Puget Sound       recovery needs to be significantly increased to address the       numerous threats that the Sound and our reserved-rights face.        For these reasons, we respectfully request you support       passage of H.R. 2247 and thank you for taking the time to       consider the bill and the important issues it addresses. We       also extend our gratitude to Representative Heck for his       leadership in introducing H.R. 2247, recognizing the       important role of tribes and treaty rights in Puget Sound       recovery, and taking the initiative to advance Puget Sound       recovery as a national priority.            Sincerely,                                                   Lorraine Loomis,                                                       Chairperson.  [[Page H792]]                                          ____                                                   August 13, 2019.      Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Sam Graves,      Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves: We, the       undersigned, are writing to urge your support to pass H.R.       2247, the ``Promoting United Government Efforts To Save Our       Sound'' (PUGET SOS) Act, introduced earlier this year by       Congressman Denny Heck and Congressman Derek Kilmer to       strengthen federal support for actions that are essential to       Puget Sound recovery.        Puget Sound is a complex ecosystem encompassing mountains,       farmlands, cities, rivers, forests, and wetlands. Sixteen       major rivers flow to Puget Sound and 20 treaty tribes call       the region home.        Currently, 4.5 million people live in the Puget Sound area,       with another 1.3 million expected to live here by 2040. In       May, the Seattle Times reported that Seattle was the second       fastest growing city in the nation in 2018, and the fastest       in 2017. We are a region of innovators and entrepreneurs: 11       Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in the Puget Sound       area, many of which have shaped 21st century life. Our       economy is roaring, and the region's natural beauty and       recreational opportunities help businesses and companies       attract top talent.        On the surface, Puget Sound looks healthy and inviting,       but, in fact, Puget Sound is in grave trouble. Southern       Resident orcas, Chinook salmon, and steelhead are all listed       under the Endangered Species Act. Toxic chemicals and       pharmaceuticals continue to pollute our waterways, and       shellfish beds are routinely closed to commercial and       recreational harvest due to fecal contamination. Despite a       significant investment of energy and resources from federal,       tribal, state, and local governments, habitat degradation       continues to outpace restoration.        While this situation at times seems impossibly gloomy, the       hundreds of passionate people who are devoted to seeing the       return of a healthy and resilient Puget Sound give us hope.        Scientists say that we can still recover Puget Sound, but       only if we act boldly now. We know what we need to do. The       primary barriers between us and more food for orcas, clean       and sufficient water for people and fish, sustainable working       lands, and harvestable shellfish are funding and political       fortitude.        The single greatest step we could take to ensure a durable,       systematic, and science-based effort for Puget Sound recovery       is to fully fund the implementation of habitat protection and       restoration, water quality protection, and salmon recovery       programs.        The PUGET SOS Act (H.R. 2247) would authorize up to $50       million in funding for Puget Sound recovery, a significant       and very welcome jump from the $28 million per year that       Congress has appropriated for the last several fiscal years.        The PUGET SOS Act also aligns federal agency expertise and       resources. These are tremendous assets. Ensuring that federal       agencies are coordinated, setting goals, and holding each       other accountable will help increase their effectiveness and       provide yet another boost to Puget Sound recovery.       Establishing the Puget Sound Program Office at the EPA and       codifying a Federal Task Force promises that these goals will       be met.        Passage of the PUGET SOS Act would demonstrate to the       nation that Puget Sound is vital to the economic, cultural,       and environmental security of the United States. By investing       significantly in the health and wellbeing of Puget Sound,       federal decision-makers demonstrate to the nation that Puget       Sound is worth saving.        Thank you for your past support of Puget Sound recovery. We       urge you to support H.R. 2247, the PUGET SOS Act, to ensure       that the federal government is a viable, willing partner in       this race against time.            Sincerely,                                             Laura L. Blackmore,                                                 Executive Director,                                           Puget Sound Partnership.

Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Sam Graves,      Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, Washington, DC.      Hon. Grace Napolitano,      Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Bruce Westerman,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Water Resources and           Environment, Washington, DC.        On behalf of the National Audubon Society's more than 1       million members, our mission is to protect birds and the       places they need for today and tomorrow. We write to offer       our support for the following bills related to important       coastal and water conservation issues that will be the       subject of the September 19, 2019 Markup before the Committee       on Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.           HR 4031--Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2019         The Great Lakes are home to 30 million people and 350       species of birds, but increasing challenges are on the       horizon for the world's largest body of freshwater.       Fluctuating water levels exacerbated by climate change,       invasive exotic species and excess nutrients are putting even       more stress on this ecosystem that is so important for birds       and people. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has helped       clean up toxic pollutants, protect wildlife by restoring       critical habitat, and help combat devastating invasive       species.        HR 4031 would increase funding for conservation projects to       $475 million over five years, by increasing the Great Lakes       Restoration Initiative's authorization incrementally from       $300 million per year to $475 million per year.                  HR 1132--San Francisco Bay Restoration Act         The San Francisco Bay Area, home to the Pacific Coast's       largest estuary, is also home to a rapidly growing population       of 8 million people, and provides for a host of social and       economic values through ports and industry, agriculture,       fisheries, archaeological and cultural sites, recreation, and       research. However, San Francisco Bay has lost 90% of its       tidal wetlands and more than 50% of its eelgrass and mudflat       habitat. Climate change exacerbates these conditions through       drought that alters the salinity balance, ocean acidification       that reduces species abundance and diversity, increasing       water temperatures, and rising seas causing flooding that       eliminates living shorelines and puts communities at risk.       Many species of waterbirds forage in the San Francisco Bay,       including Brant Geese and Surf Scoters, underscoring the       value of this ecosystem.        HR 1132 would authorize a San Francisco Bay Restoration       Grant Program in EPA and funding of up to $25m per year to       support the restoration of this estuary.             HR 1620--Chesapeake Bay Program Reauthorization Act         Salt marshes are special places to birds and other       wildlife, but sea level rise has elevated the waters in the       Chesapeake Bay by one foot during the 20th century and is       accelerating due to climate change. Salt marshes provide       valuable ``ecosystem services'', including nurseries for the       Chesapeake Bay's commercially important fish, a buffer       protecting coastal communities against storm surge, a filter       that stops nutrient and sediment pollution from entering the       Bay, and a recreational resource attracting visitors who       contribute millions of dollars to local economies. Chesapeake       Bay's salt marshes host globally significant populations of       both Saltmarsh Sparrow and Black Rail.        HR 1620 would increase the authorization of appropriations       for the Chesapeake Bay Program to more than $90m per year.      HR 2247--Promoting United Government Efforts to Save Our Sound Act         Despite significant investments in Puget Sound ecosystem       health by state, federal, tribal and local governments,       concerned members of the public, and conservation       organizations, progress towards ecosystem recovery targets       remains slow. The number of marine birds wintering in Puget       Sound has declined significantly in the last 30 years and       migratory, fish-eating birds appear to be at the greatest       risk.        HR 2247 would authorize up to $50 million in funding for       Puget Sound recovery. The PUGET SOS Act also aligns federal       agency expertise and resources, ensuring that federal       agencies are coordinated, setting goals, and holding each       other accountable will help increase their effectiveness and       provide a boost to Puget Sound recovery.             HR 3779--Resilience Revolving Loan Fund Act of 2019         Pre-disaster planning can help communities adapt to the       changing flood patterns that threaten people and birds       species dependent on shoreline and riverine areas. These       changes have led to more frequent instances of ``nuisance       flooding,'' as well as catastrophic events. NOAA has found       that ``nuisance'' or ``sunny day'' flooding is up 300% to       900% than it was 50 years ago. In addition, catastrophic       flooding events have increased in both frequency and       intensity. These trends have been particularly pronounced in       the Northeast, Midwest and upper Great Plains, where the       amount of precipitation in large rainfall events has       increased more than 30 percent above the average observed       from 1901-1960. As sea level rise accelerates, it only       exacerbates these impacts, which further compounds       vulnerability in flood-prone communities.  [[Page H794]]         HR 3779 would amend the 1988 Stafford Act to offer low-      interest loans to states for ``disaster mitigation       projects'', including investments in natural infrastructure       projects, which would help communities prepare and recover       from natural disasters.        We urge you to support and advance the bills listed above.       Please feel free to contact us with any questions.            Sincerely,                                             Julie Hill-Gabriel,                                 Vice President, Water Conservation,                                          National Audubon Society.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 7 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Heck).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Kilmer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Washington (Ms. Schrier).    Mr. Speaker, with all of the support from the  Washington delegation, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 1620) to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act  to reauthorize the Chesapeake Bay Program, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1620         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Chesapeake Bay Program       Reauthorization Act''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF CHESAPEAKE BAY PROGRAM.         Section 117(j) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act       (33 U.S.C. 1267(j)) is amended by striking ``$40,000,000 for       each of fiscal years 2001 through 2005'' and inserting       ``$90,000,000 for fiscal year 2021, $90,500,000 for fiscal       year 2022, $91,000,000 for fiscal year 2023, $91,500,000 for       fiscal year 2024, and $92,000,000 for fiscal year 2025''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1620, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1620. Introduced by the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Luria), H.R. 1620 authorizes the  funding for the program for the next five fiscal years, with increased  funding levels to better advance Bay restoration protection efforts.  This includes $90 million for the  [[Page H797]]  upcoming fiscal year, incrementally rising to $92 million for fiscal  year 2025.   Since its funding in 1983, EPA's Chesapeake Bay Program has been  working toward improving the water quality and ecosystem health of the  single largest estuary in the U.S. Reaching to six States, and the  District of Columbia, I might add, the Bay is a cherished water and the  number of people and local economies impacted by its health make a  program like this very essential.   However, as stakeholders noted in our June 2019 hearing, the  ecosystem remains under major stress. The Bay is threatened by nutrient  and sediment loads from sources like agricultural runoff, wastewater  treatment facilities, land-use changes, urban stormwater runoff and  atmospheric deposition. We must continue to prioritize programs like  the Chesapeake Bay Program and the protection of our Nation's water.  This bill will support the continued cooperative efforts of all  involved to achieve the protection of the Chesapeake Bay.   I would like to recognize several of the bipartisan committee members  cosponsoring the bill, including the gentlewoman from the District of  Columbia (Ms. Norton), the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Brown), and the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), and also a former Member  of Congress, God rest his soul, Mr. Cummings.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support of H.R. 1620  from: Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, the National Audubon  Society, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, and the Chesapeake Bay  Foundation.                                                 September 17, 2019.      Hon. Grace F. Napolitano,      Chairman, House Transportation and Infrastructure           Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Bruce Westerman,      Ranking Member, House Transportation and Infrastructure           Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Napolitano and Ranking Member Westerman: The       Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership (TRCP) is a       national coalition of sportsmen, conservation, and outdoor       industry organizations that seeks to ensure all Americans       have access to quality places to hunt and fish. We partner       with 60 hunting, fishing, and conservation organizations to       unite and amplify the voices of America's more-than 40       million sportsmen and women whose activities help sustain the       $887-billion outdoor recreation economy.        Today, we write in support of the Chesapeake Bay Program       Reauthorization Act (H.R. 1620). The legislation would       reauthorize the Chesapeake Bay Program and increase its       authorized funding level to $90,000,000 for fiscal year 2020       and then increase its authorized funding level by half a       million dollars each year through fiscal year 2024. The       Chesapeake Bay Program provides critical federal investment,       which is then leveraged several-fold by state and local       dollars, to improve the quality of water and wetlands habitat       in the Bay watershed.        The Chesapeake Bay Program is important to the continued       conservation and restoration of the Chesapeake Bay. While the       health of the Bay had been consistently improved over the       last decade, the 2018 State of the Bay Report showed that the       health of the Bay declined over the past year due to an       incredible amount of rainfall that greatly increased the       amount of nitrogen, phosphorous, sediment, and debris that       flowed into the Bay. Without a significant increase in       funding for federal programs that help to restore the Bay,       such as the EPA's Chesapeake Bay Program, this iconic       waterbody will not be able to recover.        Thank you for your consideration and we look forward to       working with your subcommittee to help increase funding in       order to conserve and restore our iconic waterbodies.            Respectfully,                                                 Theodore Roosevelt      Conservation Partnership.                                   ____                                             Audubon, National and                                         International Programs,                                                 September 18, 2019.

Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Chairman, House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Sam Graves,      Ranking Member, House Transportation & Infrastructure           Committee, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves: On behalf       of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers (BHA), the fastest growing       organization that represents sportsmen and women in North       America, I encourage you to support House Transportation &       Infrastructure Committee and floor passage of Rep. Elaine       Luria's (D-VA) Chesapeake Bay Program Reauthorization Act       (H.R. 1620) and Rep. David Joyce's (R-OH) Great Lakes       Restoration Initiative Act (H.R. 4031).        Over the last decade the health of the Bay's ecosystem has       improved. However, with increased rainfall in the region and       the amount of sediment, phosphorous, debris and nitrogen       eroding into the Chesapeake watershed, the water quality is       on the decline.        H.R. 1620 reauthorizes an important conservation and       restoration program that safeguards the Chesapeake Bay       watershed and increases the funding level to $90 million for       fiscal year 2020 and grows by $500,000 each year until fiscal       year 2024. Lawmakers funded the Chesapeake Bay Program at $73       million annually for the past few years. The additional funds       will restore the health of the Bay and boost the regional       economy that depends on it for agricultural and outdoor       recreation opportunities.        The second bill, H.R. 4031 reauthorizes funding to conserve       and restore the Great Lakes, the largest bodies of fresh       water in the world by incremental increases of $25 million       annually until fiscal year 2026. The Great Lakes Restoration       Initiative is a successful program that strategically targets       critical areas through multiple action plans and public       input. Increasing funds will furthermore expand fish and       habitat rehabilitation and implement collaborative projects       between federal, state and local stakeholders.        The Chesapeake Bay and Great Lakes programs provide       necessary federal investments that leverage state and local       dollars to improve water quality and fish and wildlife       habitat for Canada geese, speckled trout and other game       species. BHA believes H.R. 1620 and H.R. 4031 are essential       to the health of fish and wildlife and the general public who       depend on clean water for agriculture and municipal needs at       home.        Thank you for the opportunity to express our support for       the Chesapeake Bay Program Reauthorization Act and the Great       Lakes Restoration Initiative Act. We look forward to working       with you to advance the legislation through the House.            Sincerely,                                                   John W. Gale,                                              Conservation Director,      Backcountry Hunters & Anglers.                                   ____                                        Chesapeake Bay Foundation,                                    Annapolis, MD, November 5, 2019.      Hon. Elaine Luria,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Luria: Thank you for sponsoring H.R.       1620, the Chesapeake Bay Program Reauthorization Act. As the       preeminent organization dedicated to Saving the Bay, we're       proud to support this legislation. As you know, the       Chesapeake Bay Program is the glue that holds the Chesapeake       Bay Clean Water Blueprint together and provides essential       oversight to ensure that all are doing their part.        H.R. 1620 reauthorizes this program and provides a steady       annual increase in funding over the next five years. This       demonstrates Congress's continued bipartisan commitment to       restoring the Bay and acknowledges the accelerated efforts       that are needed to ensure that the requirements of the       Blueprint are met by 2025.        This is essential at this critical juncture. The       partnership has proven to be effective: dead zones are       getting smaller; bay grasses are rebounding; oyster       restoration is underway; and local economies are improving.       However, the Bay is facing new challenges due to threats from       the impacts of climate change, increased loads from the       Conowingo Dam, regulatory rollbacks, and shortfalls in       funding (including the over $320 Million annual shortfall       identified by Pennsylvania in its latest Watershed       Implementation Plan). Simply stated, there is still       significant work to be done and the leadership role of the       federal government and the Executive Council at this stage is       paramount. Passing H.R. 1620, and its companion bill, S. 701,       will be an important piece to ensure that the Bay       jurisdictions fulfill their obligations under the Blueprint.        We look forward to working with you and your fellow       cosponsors to pass this vital bipartisan legislation. Again,       thank you for your leadership on this issue.            Sincerely,                                                        Will Baker,                                                   President & CEO.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Virginia (Mrs. Luria), the lead sponsor.    Mr. Speaker, I wish to inquire if my colleague is  ready to close.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I am glad that this bill gets bipartisan support from Members of  Congress and I intend to support the bill. I urge all my colleagues to  support it.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 4031) to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act  to reauthorize the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4031         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Great Lakes Restoration       Initiative Act of 2019'' or the ``GLRI Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. GREAT LAKES RESTORATION INITIATIVE REAUTHORIZATION.         Section 118(c)(7)(J)(i) of the Federal Water Pollution       Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1268(c)(7)(J)(i)) is amended--        (1) by striking ``is authorized'' and inserting ``are       authorized'';        (2) by striking the period at the end and inserting a       semicolon;        (3) by striking ``this paragraph $300,000,000'' and       inserting the following: ``this paragraph--         ``(I) $300,000,000''; and         (4) by adding at the end the following:         ``(II) $375,000,000 for fiscal year 2022;        ``(III) $400,000,000 for fiscal year 2023;        ``(IV) $425,000,000 for fiscal year 2024;        ``(V) $450,000,000 for fiscal year 2025; and        ``(VI) $475,000,000 for fiscal year 2026.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4031.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 4031 would reauthorize Federal appropriations for EPA's Great  Lakes Restoration Initiative.   Introduced by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Joyce), H.R. 4031  authorizes total appropriations of approximately $2.5 billion over the  next 5 years for restoration efforts under EPA's GLRI program. The wide  support for this bipartisan program is evidenced by the diversity of  cosponsors of the bill, including many of the committee members, such  as Mr. Gibbs, Mr. Carson, Mr. Katko, Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Gallagher, and  Mr. Stauber.   The Great Lakes region encompasses eight different States and is home  to more than 30 million people. These  [[Page H800]]  waters are a national treasure and contain 84 percent of the fresh  water of all North America.   As a Representative of a State where the availability of water is  always, always an issue, I recognize why the Great Lakes Members are so  devoted to protecting the water supply. So are we. Congress needs to  renew its commitment to these types of programs which protect and  restore our Nation's water.   We all know the current challenges facing our States to protect our  water resource, including harmful effects of algal blooms. Many of our  States are dealing with these challenges as we speak, and the Great  Lakes are no exception. One such bloom in 2014 forced a drinking water  ban that affected half a million people.   The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has been a critical tool for  EPA and Great Lakes States to address ongoing challenges on local water  quality, including algal blooms. So H.R. 4031 is necessary to support  these efforts.   I urge all Members to support this very bipartisan bill to continue  efforts for rehab on our precious Great Lakes.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from:  Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, the National Audubon Society, and  Healing Our Waters Great Lakes Coalition.                                  Backcountry Hunters & Anglers,                                   Missoula, MT, September 18, 2019.      Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Chairman, House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Sam Graves,      Ranking Member, House Transportation & Infrastructure           Committee, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves: On behalf       of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers (BHA), the fastest growing       organization that represents sportsmen and women in North       America, I encourage you to support House Transportation &       Infrastructure Committee and floor passage of Rep. Elaine       Luria's (D-VA) Chesapeake Bay Program Reauthorization Act       (H.R. 1620) and Rep. David Joyce's (R-OH) Great Lakes       Restoration Initiative Act (H.R. 4031).        Over the last decade the health of the Bay's ecosystem has       improved. However, with increased rainfall in the region and       the amount of sediment, phosphorous, debris and nitrogen       eroding into the Chesapeake watershed, the water quality is       on the decline.        H.R. 1620 reauthorizes an important conservation and       restoration program that safeguards the Chesapeake Bay       watershed and increases the funding level to $90 million for       fiscal year 2020 and grows by $500,000 each year until fiscal       year 2024. Lawmakers funded the Chesapeake Bay Program at $73       million annually for the past few years. The additional funds       will restore the health of the Bay and boost the regional       economy that depends on it for agricultural and outdoor       recreation opportunities.        The second bill, H.R. 4031 reauthorizes funding to conserve       and restore the Great Lakes, the largest bodies of fresh       water in the world by incremental increases of $25 million       annually until fiscal year 2026. The Great Lakes Restoration       Initiative is a successful program that strategically targets       critical areas through multiple action plans and public       input. Increasing funds will furthermore expand fish and       habitat rehabilitation and implement collaborative projects       between federal, state and local stakeholders.        The Chesapeake Bay and Great Lakes programs provide       necessary federal investments that leverage state and local       dollars to improve water quality and fish and wildlife       habitat for Canada geese, speckled trout and other game       species. BHA believes H.R. 1620 and H.R. 4031 are essential       to the health of fish and wildlife and the general public who       depend on clean water for agriculture and municipal needs at       home.        Thank you for the opportunity to express our support for       the Chesapeake Bay Program Reauthorization Act and the Great       Lakes Restoration Initiative Act. We look forward to working       with you to advance the legislation through the House.            Sincerely,                                                   John W. Gale,                                              Conservation Director,      Backcountry Hunters & Anglers.                                   ____                                             Audubon, National and                                         International Programs,                                                 September 18, 2019.      Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Sam Graves,      Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, Washington, DC.      Hon. Grace Napolitano,      Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Bruce Westerman,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Water Resources and           Environment, Washington, DC.        On behalf of the National Audubon Society's more than 1       million members, our mission is to protect birds and the       places they need for today and tomorrow. We write to offer       our support for the following bills related to important       coastal and water conservation issues that will be the       subject of the September 19, 2019 Markup before the Committee       on Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.           HR 4031--Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2019         The Great Lakes are home to 30 million people and 350       species of birds, but increasing challenges are on the       horizon for the world's largest body of freshwater.       Fluctuating water levels exacerbated by climate change,       invasive exotic species and excess nutrients are putting even       more stress on this ecosystem that is so important for birds       and people. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has helped       clean up toxic pollutants, protect wildlife by restoring       critical habitat, and help combat devastating invasive       species.        HR 4031 would increase funding for conservation projects to       $475 million over five years, by increasing the Great Lakes       Restoration Initiative's authorization incrementally from       $300 million per year to $475 million per year.                  HR 1132--San Francisco Bay Restoration Act         The San Francisco Bay Area, home to the Pacific Coast's       largest estuary, is also home to a rapidly growing population       of 8 million people, and provides for a host of social and       economic values through ports and industry, agriculture,       fisheries, archaeological and cultural sites, recreation, and       research. However, San Francisco Bay has lost 90% of its       tidal wetlands and more than 50% of its eelgrass and mudflat       habitat. Climate change exacerbates these conditions through       drought that alters the salinity balance, ocean acidification       that reduces species abundance and diversity, increasing       water temperatures, and rising seas causing flooding that       eliminates living shorelines and puts communities at risk.       Many species of waterbirds forage in the San Francisco Bay,       including Brant Geese and Surf Scoters, underscoring the       value of this ecosystem.        HR 1132 would authorize a San Francisco Bay Restoration       Grant Program in EPA and funding of up to $25m per year to       support the restoration of this estuary.             HR 1620--Chesapeake Bay Program Reauthorization Act         Salt marshes are special places to birds and other       wildlife, but sea level rise has elevated the waters in the       Chesapeake Bay by one foot during the 20th century and is       accelerating due to climate change. Salt marshes provide       valuable ``ecosystem services'', including nurseries for the       Chesapeake Bay's commercially important fish, a buffer       protecting coastal communities against storm surge, a filter       that stops nutrient and sediment pollution from entering the       Bay, and a recreational resource attracting visitors who       contribute millions of dollars to local economies. Chesapeake       Bay's salt marshes host globally significant populations of       both Saltmarsh Sparrow and Black Rail.        HR 1620 would increase the authorization of appropriations       for the Chesapeake Bay Program to more than $90m per year.      HR 2247--Promoting United Government Efforts to Save Our Sound Act         Despite significant investments in Puget Sound ecosystem       health by state, federal, tribal and local governments,       concerned members of the public, and conservation       organizations, progress towards ecosystem recovery targets       remains slow. The number of marine birds wintering in Puget       Sound has declined significantly in the last 30 years and       migratory, fisheating birds appear to be at the greatest       risk.        HR 2247 would authorize up to $50 million in funding for       Puget Sound recovery. The PUGET SOS Act also aligns federal       agency expertise and resources, ensuring that federal       agencies are coordinated, setting goals, and holding each       other accountable will help increase their effectiveness and       provide a boost to Puget Sound recovery.             HR 3779--Resilience Revolving Loan Fund Act of 2019         Pre-disaster planning can help communities adapt to the       changing flood patterns that threaten people and birds       species dependent on shoreline and riverine areas. These       changes have led to more frequent instances of ``nuisance       flooding,'' as well as catastrophic events. NOAA has found       that ``nuisance'' or ``sunny day'' flooding is up 300% to       900% than it was 50 years ago. In addition, catastrophic       flooding events have increased in both frequency and       intensity. These trends have been particularly pronounced in       the Northeast, Midwest and upper Great Plains, where the       amount of precipitation in large rainfall events has       increased more than 30 percent above the average observed       from 1901-1960. As sea level rise accelerates, it only       exacerbates these impacts, which further compounds       vulnerability in flood-prone communities.        HR 3779 would amend the 1988 Stafford Act to offer low-      interest loans to states for ``disaster mitigation       projects'', including investments in natural infrastructure       projects, which would help communities prepare and recover       from natural disasters.        We urge you to support and advance the bills listed above.       Please feel free to contact us with any questions.            Sincerely,                                             Julie Hill-Gabriel,                                 Vice President, Water Conservation,                                          National Audubon Society.  [[Page H801]]                                          ____                     Healing Our Waters, Great Lakes Coalition,                                                   December 3, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi: On behalf of the Healing Our Waters-      Great Lakes Coalition, I write to urge the House of       Representatives to bring to the floor for consideration H.R.       4031, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2019,       before the end of the year. The bill, which is led by Reps.       David Joyce and Marcy Kaptur, has broad bipartisan support       with 50 cosponsors almost evenly divided and was unanimously       supported in the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee in       September. The Great Lakes define our region's way of life,       provide drinking water for over 30 million Americans, and is       at the heart of a binational economy that is the 3rd largest       in the world. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has been       restoring these waters and protecting the health and well-      being of those that rely on them.        H.R. 4031 reauthorizes the successful Great Lakes       Restoration Initiative and helps meet the on-the-ground needs       of communities by increasing the annual authorization over       five years to $475 million. Over the past decade the GLRI has       improved lives across Great Lakes communities after decades       of environmental damage threatened public health, the       regional economy, and drinking water. The GLRI has allowed       the 8-state region to undertake one of the world's largest       freshwater ecosystem restoration projects. Since its       inception, the initiative has resulted in economic returns of       more than 3 to 1 across the region and made tremendous       progress. For example, the GLRI has:        Tripled the delisting of areas with extreme degradation       (Areas of Concern or AOCs)        Increased the remediation of environmental and public       health impairments nearly sevenfold        Doubled farmland acres under conservation, reducing       nutrient and sediment runoff        Invested in critical research and forecasting of toxic       algal blooms        Controlled and stopped the advance of invasive species        Restored habitat connectivity to over 5,250 river miles        Even with these results, there is still much work to be       done. Two-thirds of beneficial use impairments remain       untreated across 19 AOCs, placing the health of communities       at risk. Drinking water and coastal economies remain under       threat from toxic algal blooms that have shut down entire       water systems, as was seen in Toledo, Ohio in 2014. Invasive       species, like Asian Carp, are knocking at the door of the       lakes and threaten its $7 billion fishery. Moreover, emerging       contaminants and a changing climate continue to exacerbate       the challenges we face, many of which disproportionately       impact people that have historically borne the brunt of       environmental injustice. This underscores the urgency for the       GLRI to address these growing threats by working to ensure       restoration investments lead to equitable outcomes for       everyone in the region.        The GLRI has been an environmental and economic success,       but much work remains. The region stands ready to continue       this important federal partnership and ensure that all       benefit from and enjoy these investments in restoration and       protection.        Since 2004, the Healing Our Waters-Great Lakes Coalition       has been harnessing the collective power of more than 160       non-governmental organizations representing millions of       people, whose common goal is to restore and protect the Great       Lakes. We are pleased to offer our support for this much-      needed bill and urge House leadership to bring the bill to       the floor for a vote.            Sincerely,                                                       Laura Rubin,                                                          Director.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1400     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Higgins).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to Ms.  Moore.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am glad to hear that this has such  great bipartisan support. It truly is an amazing bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 4275) to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act  to reauthorize the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4275         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN BASIN RESTORATION PROGRAM                     REAUTHORIZATION.         (a) Review of Comprehensive Management Plan.--Section 121       of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1273)       is amended--        (1) in subsection (c)--        (A) in paragraph (5), by striking ``; and'' and inserting a       semicolon;        (B) in paragraph (6), by striking the period and inserting       ``; and''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following:        ``(7) ensure that the comprehensive conservation and       management plan approved for the Basin under section 320 is       reviewed and revised in accordance with section 320 not less       often than once every five years, beginning on the date of       enactment of this paragraph.''; and        (2) in subsection (d), by striking ``recommended by a       management conference convened for the Basin under section       320'' and inserting ``identified in the comprehensive       conservation and management plan approved for the Basin under       section 320''.        (b) Definitions.--Section 121(e)(1) of the Federal Water       Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1273(e)(1)) is amended by       striking ``, a 5,000 square mile''.        (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 121(f) of the       Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1273(f)) is       amended--        (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``2001 through 2012 and       the amount appropriated for fiscal year 2009 for each of       fiscal years 2013 through 2017'' and inserting ``2021 through       2025''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(3) Administrative expenses.--The Administrator may use       for administrative expenses not more than 5 percent of the       amounts appropriated to carry out this section.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4275, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter in support of H.R. 4275  to reauthorize the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program from  the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation.                                                  Lake Pontchartrain                                                Basin Foundation,                                                   February 4, 2020.      Re H.R. 4275: Support to amend the Federal Water Pollution           Control Act to reauthorize the Lake Pontchartrain Basin           Restoration Program.       Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi & Minority Leader McCarthy: I would       like to express our support for H.R. 4275--the       reauthorization of the Pontchartrain Basin Restoration       Program within the Environmental Protection Agency. This       program provides resources vital to the restoration of the       ecological health of the Basin, as well as public education       projects.        Although Lake Pontchartrain and its surrounding area       continue to face environmental challenges, the Lake and its       resources have made a tremendous comeback. Much of this       success is due to interested and concerned citizens who want       a clean, healthy Lake and Basin for this and future       generations, all of which would not be possible without your       support of this PRP funding.            Sincerely,                                             Kristi L. Trail, P.E.,                                                Executive Director.     Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4275 will reauthorize EPA's Lake  Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program for the next 5 years.   Introduced by the gentlemen from Louisiana, Mr. Graves and Mr.  Richmond, it reauthorizes the program for the next 5 years with  continued funding of $20 million annually over 5 years. It also caps  EPA's administrative expenses at 5 percent.   At our June subcommittee hearing, we received testimony on current  threats to the Lake Pontchartrain region and its watershed. Covering a  10,000-square-mile area, the basin faces  [[Page H806]]  impacts from logging, urban, and agriculture runoff, sewage overflows  and nonpoint source pollution.   This is an example of human development having an extreme impact on  the entire watershed, capable of causing entire dead zones as we are  now seeing. With impaired wetlands prevented from acting as natural  filters for these pollutants, the entire lake is at risk.   This program represents a collaborative effort for Federal, State,  and local entities to restore the ecological health of the basin.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4275, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    I am prepared to close, Mr. Speaker, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume to close.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank both sides' staff. They have been doing  a marvelous job. Of course, I thank the chairmen and the ranking  members of both committees for all the support they have gotten on all  these important bills on water.   Water is the economy, and we realize that we have to clean it up and  help the communities work with the States and other entities. We will  get it done.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
