 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 7072) to amend title 18, United States Code, to modify  delayed notice requirements, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7072         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 3. PRECLUSION OF NOTICE.         Section 2705(b) of title 18, United States Code, is amended       to read as follows:        ``(b) Preclusion of Notice.--        ``(1) Application.--A governmental entity that is seeking a       warrant, order, or subpoena under section 2703, when it is       not required to notify the customer or subscriber, or to the       extent that it may delay such notice pursuant to subsection       (a), may apply to a court for an order, subject to paragraph       (6), directing a provider of electronic communications       service or remote computing service to which a warrant,       order, or subpoena under section 2703 is directed not to       notify any other person of the existence of the warrant,       order, or subpoena for a period of not more than either 60       days or the period of delay of notice provided under       subsection (a), if any.        ``(2) Determination.--The court may not grant a request for       an order made under paragraph (1), or an extension of such       order requested by the governmental entity pursuant to       paragraph (3), unless--        ``(A) the court issues a written determination, based on       specific and articulable facts, and including written       findings of fact and conclusions of law, that it is       substantially likely that not granting the request will       result in--        ``(i) endangering the life or physical safety of an       individual;        ``(ii) flight from prosecution;        ``(iii) destruction of or tampering with evidence;        ``(iv) intimidation of potential witnesses; or        ``(v) otherwise seriously jeopardizing an investigation or       unduly delaying a trial; and        ``(B) the order is narrowly tailored and there is no less       restrictive alternative, including notification to an       individual or organization within or providing legal       representation to the customer or subscriber, to avoid an       adverse result as described in clause (i) through (v) of       subparagraph (A).

SEC. 4. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS REGARDING DELAYED NOTICE.         Section 2705 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(c) Annual Report.--On an annual basis, the Attorney       General shall provide to the Committees on the Judiciary of       the House of Representatives and the Senate, in a manner       consistent with protection of national security, a report       setting forth with respect to the preceding calendar year,       for each Federal judicial district--        ``(1) the number of customers or subscribers with respect       to whom, in that calendar year, a warrant, subpoena, or court       order was issued pursuant to section 2703;        ``(2) the aggregate number of applications requesting delay       of notification pursuant to subsections (a)(1) and (b)(1);        ``(3) the aggregate number of orders under this section       either granting, extending, or denying a request for delay of       notification;        ``(4) the aggregate number of orders under this section       affecting a member of the news media, including any conduct       related to activities protected under the First Amendment;       and        ``(5) the aggregate number of arrests, trials, and       convictions, resulting from investigations in which orders       under this section were obtained, including the offenses for       which individuals were arrested, tried, or convicted.      The Attorney General shall include in the report under this       subsection a description of the process and the information       used to determine the numbers for each of paragraphs (1)       through (5).''.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 7072.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, as a proud cosponsor, I rise in strong support of H.R.  7072, the NDO Fairness Act, crucial bipartisan surveillance reform  legislation that recently passed out of the Judiciary Committee on a  voice vote.   This legislation would establish important guardrails for when the  government seeks to access someone's electronic communications without  that person's knowledge. Under current law, after the government  obtains a court's permission to search the contents of a person's  electronic communications, prosecutors must then compel the email  service provider to produce the relevant data. To avoid having the  service provider turn around and tell its customer about the search,  the government can also ask the court to grant a nondisclosure order,  colloquially referred to as a secrecy or gag order.   Right now, there is no time limit to these orders. There is no  standard to meet. All the government needs to do is cite one of five  potential adverse results, with no showing that it is necessary, and  the court may grant the request.   This bill requires the government to show and the courts to be  convinced that the secrecy order is actually needed, rather than  allowing both to treat this as a check-the-box activity. Gag orders  would be granted for a much shorter period of time, with the  opportunity for extensions only as necessary. When the orders expire or  are no longer necessary, the government would need to provide to the  customer the warrant, details regarding the search, and a copy of any  information disclosed.   Prosecutors frequently seek secrecy orders in cases where there is  clearly no need and in situations where the government alone benefits.  Unlike when a physical search occurs and a person has the right to go  to court to dispute the warrant, NDOs can keep the subject of the  search in the dark until a court reverses the order. In the 21st  century, Federal prosecutors no longer need to show up to your office.  They just need to raid your virtual office secretly.  [[Page H5700]]    The NDO Fairness Act would do away with that rubber stamp by ensuring  that courts apply a strict scrutiny standard to government requests  with a written determination explaining their reasoning. By time- limiting nondisclosure orders, raising the standard of review, and  ensuring that service providers have standing when they object, H.R.  7072 inserts transparency, reason, and balance into a system that for  too long has been a free-for-all for government prosecutors simply by  virtue of it being too easy to overuse.   If history and recent reporting has taught us anything, it is that we  cannot trust the Department of Justice--under any administration--to  police itself. It is imperative that the House of Representatives  fulfill its role and ensure our laws are keeping pace with rapidly  changing technology.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler and Congressman Fitzgerald for  their leadership on this bill and our friends, Senator Leahy and  Senator Lee, for their leadership in the Senate.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   H.R. 7072 will insert due process protections into a system too often  abused by Federal prosecutors.   Under the Stored Communications Act, the government often has no  obligation to tell you that they have requested access to your email  records. It can prohibit your service provider from informing you of  the search, even if your contract with the provider requires such  notice.   The NDO Fairness Act will require that the government show a need for  a gag order. It installs commonsense protections to ensure that any  such orders are time-limited and subject to scrutiny for renewal.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and pass  this important legislation today, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 3285) to amend gendered terms in Federal law relating to  the President and the President's spouse.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3285         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``21st Century President       Act''.       SEC. 2. MODERNIZATION OF TERMS RELATING TO THE PRESIDENT AND                     THE SPOUSE OF A PRESIDENT.         Section 879(b)(1)(A) of title 18, United States Code, is       amended by striking ``the wife of a former President during       his lifetime, the widow of a former President until her death       or remarriage'' and inserting ``the spouse of a former       President during a former President's lifetime, the surviving       spouse of a former President until the surviving spouse's       death or remarriage''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 3285.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3285, the 21st  Century President Act.   A century ago, women in this country had only barely won the right to  vote. Today, we have the first female Vice President, a female Speaker  of the House, and record numbers of women running for Federal office.  Although we still have a long way to go both in equality and  representation, our country's government is growing closer to finally  representing our Nation's brilliant diversity.   Our laws must reflect the fact that a President and their spouse can  be of any gender. That concept may have seemed impossible a few decades  ago, but today it is, thankfully, a true and real possibility.   Currently, our criminal code defines a spouse in the ``immediate  family'' of a President as ``the wife of a former President during his  lifetime'' and ``the widow of a former President until her death,''  implying that the spouse must be female and the President must be male  in order for a threat against a former President's family to be treated  as a crime.   This completely disregards the fact that a President may be female  and the President's spouse may not be. This does not reflect the  progress we have made in this country.   I am proud to vote ``yes'' for this bill, which passed out of this  Chamber by a voice vote last Congress, and I encourage all of my  colleagues to vote for its passage to support equality in our highest  branch.   Madam Speaker, I again thank my colleague and friend, Congressman  Pocan, for introducing this bill and being such a strong advocate for  it. I look forward to seeing it made law.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan), the author of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, H.R. 3285, the 21st Century President  Act, does indeed take our criminal code into the 21st century by  removing gender terms and assumptions about who can be President from  our criminal code.   It passed, as I said, on a voice vote last Congress. I ask my  colleagues to again stand with me in supporting this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 6538) to create an Active Shooter Alert Communications  Network, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6538         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 6538.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bill, H.R.  6538, the Active Shooter Alert Act, bipartisan legislation which I  introduced with Congressman Upton and 16 other original Republican and  Democratic cosponsors to help keep our communities safer in the event  of an active shooter.   Between 2000 and 2020, there were close to 400 active shooter events,  including 40 active shooter incidents in 2020 and 61 such incidents in  2021 alone.   In 2016, in Congressman Upton's backyard, we saw a Michigan Uber  driver go on a shooting rampage and then continue picking up  passengers.   In 2019, a shooter drove around a community in Texas, killing 7 and  wounding 25 people.   In 2021, a shooter traveled 30 miles, murdering eight people at  various Atlanta-area spas.   Just this past April, a shooter attacked a subway station full of  people in Brooklyn and was then on the run for 24 hours before police  finally detained him.   Such active shooters have become ubiquitous, so frequent that some of  these horrific events barely make headlines. This is not normal, and we  cannot let it become normalized. We cannot become numb to these events  or settle for the status quo. We need to act now to make our  communities safer, and that includes providing law enforcement with  every tool they need to do so.   Law enforcement has asked for ways to better alert their communities  when active shooter incidents arise. This legislation answers that  call.   The Active Shooter Alert Act creates an AMBER Alert-like program for  active shooter events. This bill will provide law enforcement with  cutting-edge technology to send notifications  [[Page H5703]]  to our smartphones and let communities know if there is an active  shooter in a certain area so they know to stay away.   The bill also instructs the Department of Justice to consult with  police safety experts, including officers who have responded to these  incidents, to develop best practices and protocols for sending out  these alerts. This will allow law enforcement to learn from each other  as they adapt this alert system to the needs of the communities, if  they so choose.   Developing this kind of technology and infrastructure, and  identifying best practices, would be a massive undertaking for many  local police departments. Some communities simply don't have the  resources to do it on their own. However, we already have these  resources at the Federal level.   This legislation simply gives every law enforcement agency across the  country the option to access the Federal alert system so they can send  alerts in their area.   Nothing in this bill is mandatory for law enforcement agencies to  adopt, but it will provide access to an important tool for law  enforcement departments across the country, regardless of their size or  location.   It is, sadly, becoming more and more necessary to have these  protocols in place. As we have seen time and time again, when there is  an active shooter situation, law enforcement does all they can to keep  people in the surrounding area safe, including going door to door to  either evacuate or tell people to shelter in place. But that takes  time, time that could cost lives.   More than anyone, law enforcement understands the strain an active  shooter puts on a community in an ongoing crisis. In these stressful,  life-or-death situations, law enforcement is too often, in many cases,  relying on social media to communicate with the surrounding community  so that no one accidentally walks into the line of fire, including  other members of law enforcement.   Law enforcement deserves the best tools available, certainly better  than Twitter, to communicate with their communities.   Now, if you look at the after-action reports in so many of these  active shooter incidents, they all recognize that it would have been so  helpful to have a way to quickly and safely communicate with other  members of law enforcement or the local community about an active  shooter.   I am proud that this bill has the endorsement of law enforcement  organizations across the country at the national, State, and local  levels and that it is a resoundingly bipartisan effort.   I thank all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have  supported this commonsense measure and Mr. Upton for leading this  effort with me. I encourage a ``yes'' vote.   Just to be clear, this is legislation endorsed by the National  Sheriffs' Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National  Police Foundation, the National Association of Police Organizations,  Major Cities Chiefs Association, National District Attorneys  Association, and many other local law enforcement agencies.   The men and women who are protecting our communities are saying they  need this. It is bipartisan. I urge everyone to vote for it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  distinguished gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean), an important  member of the House Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I will make a couple of points quickly. This legislation has nothing  to do with limitations on the Second Amendment. It has nothing to do  with red flag laws. It has nothing to do with this claim of defunding  the police.   I have lots of material for the Record that shows police departments  have been cut in other communities led by Republican mayors and  Republican Governors. Let's not have that debate. This is about a  simple provision that will save lives.   With all due respect to my colleagues who claim they understand what  this legislation is about, I trust the judgment of the men and women  who are actually going into active shooter situations. I don't think  there is a single Member who has spoken who has been responsible for  responding to an active shooting incident. I think it is time we  respect the men and women who actually do that every day.   The men and women of law enforcement are pleading for this  legislation to help keep them safe, as well as the communities they  serve. I won't be so presumptuous, Madam Speaker, to think I have  better judgment on that question than they do. That is why they have  all endorsed this bill.   The third thing I will say: Mr. Massie said, Madam Speaker, that this  question wasn't answered. I will answer it again, the same way I  answered it in committee.   The standards are established by law enforcement. Active shooter  alerts already exist in some States and in some local communities.  There are a set of protocols.   Obviously, they don't wait until the shooting has concluded to notify  people. They use common sense, their own standards about when they see  a danger; someone with a gun that is expressing some intention to use  it or whatever standard they consider appropriate as members of law  enforcement to alert the community. This is common sense.   The problem is, there are a lot of small departments that don't have  the ability to access this system or to understand best practices or to  see the research about how it is used most effectively. This would  allow them to have access to that.   Not a single jurisdiction that doesn't want to use it is required to.  There is no Federal Government power here. It is making it available.  If you decide as a local law enforcement agency or State you don't want  to use it, you don't have to, but it is making it available. This will  save lives.  [[Page H5705]]    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for  his thoughtful words.   I also want to mention that some of my colleagues earlier in the  debate said creating this is going to create a fear of shooting. That  is what Democrats are really up to, and the 15 or 16 Republicans that  are the original co-sponsors of this bill.   Well, I would ask one question: When we created the AMBER Alert to  help families find a child who is lost, or the Silver Alert, it didn't  create any great fear. It effectively made sure when seniors were lost,  they were found. When children were lost, they were found. So that is a  specious argument.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I will respond briefly to the last speaker suggesting  that somehow this isn't going to solve all the problems of gun  violence. No one suggested it is.  [[Page H5706]]    This is a simple bill that is introduced to protect law enforcement  and members of the community when an active shooter happens. We can  continue to fight about how we should reduce gun violence, but when it  occurs, this will save lives. It is not intended to be the solution,  the big answer to everything. It is intended to save lives.   I will repeat again--with all due respect to my Republican colleagues  who think they are experts in policing, who think they know better than  law enforcement what they need when they run into danger--it is easy to  say that in the comfort of the House Chamber, where you are protected  by Capitol Police and you get alerts.   These are men and women who are running into bullets and communities  that are threatened. You raised what happened on 14th Street. A young  man who works for me received a notice 35 minutes after the scene was  cleared through his Ring security system in his building that there was  an active shooter. Had there been one in place, he would have been  notified and not walked into danger.   You have the National Sheriffs' Association, the FOP, and others  saying this will be very helpful. These are people who, admittedly,  actually are responsible for keeping communities safe, unlike anyone  who just spoke on the Republican side. They say it will help us keep  communities safe.   The CEO of the National Sheriffs' Association said: ``This alert  system will be another excellent tool for law enforcement to do its  job.''   Bryan Porter from the National District Attorneys Association: ``This  bipartisan legislation creates a new alert system for law enforcement  to alert the public when there are active shooters while also providing  resources as our members work to keep our communities safe.''   Jeri Williams, president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association: `` .  . . which will undoubtedly be a valuable tool and resource for law  enforcement agencies.''   Bill Johnson, the National Association of Police Organizations: ``The  Active Shooter Alert Act will assist law enforcement in alerting  citizens of an active shooter situation in their vicinity, keeping them  away from the incident and maintaining their safety.''   Finally, Patrick Yoes, the national president of the Fraternal Order  of Police: This bill will help ``improve the ways officers and agencies  communicate with the public about active threats.''   I could read 10 more quotes from people who actually do this work.   The North Carolina Association of Chiefs of Police has also endorsed  this bill, which I think should be important to Mr. Bishop, who just  spoke.   Look, these are men and women who do the job every day, and they are  saying they need this, that it will be useful. It doesn't solve all the  problems, but it works, and the notion that, ``Well, you can just do  it. It is redundant,'' it is just not true.   This bill has in it provisions that will provide for the development  of protocols, the sharing of best practices, a law enforcement advisory  group, things that will make sure the active shooter alert works even  better. It is made available to communities that may not have all those  resources to support the implementation of this system.   Can anyone say that every single American doesn't deserve to get this  information, and every member of law enforcement doesn't deserve to get  this information, so they don't go into a dangerous situation?   I know it is difficult because you somehow have it in your head that  Democrats are up to something. Fred Upton, Victoria Spartz, Peter  Meijer, Nancy Mace,   Don Bacon,  Andrew Garbarino, Jay Obernolte,  Jefferson Van Drew, Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, Brian Fitzpatrick,   John  Carter,   Tom Rice,   Michael McCaul, Kelly Armstrong,   David  McKinley, and Julia Letlow are all Republican original cosponsors. Do  you think they are up to something, too? They are just trying to keep  their communities safe and give law enforcement the tools they need.   We can argue about the underlying cause of crime. I am happy to have  that debate. This bill is not about that. It is about protecting people  when an active shooter incident happens.   The final thing I would say is, if you look at the after-action  reports that are done after active shootings, almost without exception,  they all reference that it would have made a real difference if we had  a good communication system.   In the situation Mr. Upton talked about in Kalamazoo, in their after- action report, they said neither the Kalamazoo Department of Public  Safety nor the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office ``had a strong social  media presence at the time of the shooting,'' which ``hampered the  departments' ability to update the community on the progression of the  incident, notify them when the arrest was made, and reassure them that  they were indeed safe from further violence.''   In the Columbine shooting, in the after-action report, they say: Our  schools' greatest vulnerabilities exist because of voids in basic  security policies and strategies, such as effective communications and  notification systems.   In the Broward County incident at the Hollywood airport in 2017, they  write in their after-action report: ``Review and budget for  improvements to public notification systems, including visual paging,  overhead announcements, and mass notification systems'' would be  helpful. It was noted during the event that airport patrons lost  personal items except one, their cellular phones. The ability to reach  every cell phone with messages enables law enforcement to provide  instant information directly to victims. It goes on and on and on.   Again, police are asking for this. The after-action reports  underscore the need for it.   Set aside the fact that the lead sponsor or the author is me. There  are 15 other Democrats, 15 other Republicans, very bipartisan, and I  haven't heard any argument why we shouldn't give law enforcement what  was identified as one of their top priorities during National Police  Week.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, if I were a classroom teacher right now, I would say to  the gentleman from Ohio: Focus. Focus. Pay attention to what we are  talking about.   What we are talking about is an active shooter alert. We are not  talking about a red flag bill. We are not talking about any effort to  undermine the Second Amendment. We are not talking about education  policy. We are talking about one thing: Can we help keep people safe?   This is not redundant because while it is being used by 1,400 cities  and towns around the country, there are thousands and thousands who  have not used it because they can't access it because they don't have  the resources, the protocols, the best practices. This will allow them.   If we save one life, if because of the active shooter alert we save  one child, one police officer, it will have been worth it.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 6538. Give our brave law  enforcement men and women who keep our communities safe every tool they  need to keep themselves safe and keep the communities they serve safe.  Don't take my word for it; take theirs. They have all endorsed it. They  are asking for a ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
