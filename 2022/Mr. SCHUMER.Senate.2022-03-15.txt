 Mr. President, so the Senate this week will continue  fulfilling its constitutional duty to confirm more of the President's  judicial and administrative nominees. Yesterday, I filed cloture on 12  additional nominees, setting up a busy rest of the week here on the  floor. Absent an agreement to expedite the process--and, unfortunately,  we have seen all too few of those coming from our Republican  colleagues--Members can expect to begin voting tomorrow morning, and we  will work through all 12 nominees until we have a path to getting them  confirmed.   Due to the months of obstructive holds by a few--just a handful of  Republicans--in addition to judicial nominees, we also must use up  floor time to confirm U.S. attorneys, something practically unheard of  in the Senate. These Republicans who have delayed our U.S. attorneys  are actively making our communities less safe, and it is regrettable  they have chosen to obstruct the Senate for their own personal  political interests. So my colleagues ought to be prepared for a busy  few days here on the floor.   Now, among the nominees we will consider are two great nominees from  New York, I am proud to say. One, we will consider Judge Ali Nathan,  nominated to serve as judge for the Second Circuit. She is a brilliant  jurist with a decade of experience as a district judge, and I was proud  to recommend her to sit on one of the most important courts in the  Nation.   I am also pleased that the Senate will also vote on Hector Gonzalez  to serve as district judge for the Eastern District of New York. Born  in Cuba, raised in Queens, and a Fulbright scholar who became one of  New York's top attorneys, Mr. Gonzalez is the very embodiment of the  American dream; and, like Judge Nathan, I am glad to have recommended  him to President Biden.   I am also glad to note, under Senator Durbin's leadership, Judge  Nathan and Mr. Gonzalez received bipartisan support in committee, so I  look forward to the Senate confirming them in short order.   But first, the Senate will look to make history, once again, later  today by confirming Shalanda Young to serve as President Biden's  Director of the Office of Management and Budget, a Cabinet-level  position. She would be the first Black woman ever confirmed by the  Senate to lead the OMB.  [[Page S1158]]    It shouldn't have taken this long to confirm someone as obviously  qualified as Shalanda Young. She has been leading the OMB for nearly a  year. She knows the budget and appropriations processes like the back  of her hand. She has proven capable of working with Republicans and  Democrats alike, and it was through her guidance that the  administration notched some of its biggest victories, including the  passage of the bipartisan infrastructure law.   Shalanda Young is one of the most effective Cabinet leaders to have  the label of ``Acting'' in a very long time, but it is long past time  for that word to drop from her job title. I look forward to the Senate  officially confirming Ms. Young as OMB Director later today.    Madam President, I want to thank my friend and colleague  from Mississippi, as well as my friend and colleague from Ohio and from  Connecticut.   We have one very important unanimous consent request that I will  mention now and ask that unanimous consent request and then do the  other ones as well. It will take a few minutes, and I appreciate that.                            ____________________     Madam President, in a few minutes, we will pass a  resolution, S. Res. 546, condemning the Russian Federation, condemning  Vladimir Putin, and expressing the sense of the Senate condemning the  Russian Federation, Putin, and members of Russian security council,  Russian Armed Forces, and Russian military commanders for committing  atrocities, alleged war crimes against the people of Ukraine.   It has been 19 days--19 long, bloody days since the war erupted on  the European continent. Today, all of us in this Chamber join together  as Democrats and Republicans to say that Vladimir Putin cannot escape  accountability for the atrocities committed against the Ukrainian  people. The legislation passing today, championed by Senator Graham,  sends an unmistakable message that the United States stands with  Ukraine, stands against Putin, and stands with all efforts to hold  Putin accountable for the atrocities levied upon the Ukrainian people.   Putin is not winning militarily, so now, this evil man is trying to  win by massacring civilians, massacring babies, parents, the elderly,  pregnant women, shooting at hospitals, sending missiles to hospitals,  apartment buildings, et cetera--just as he did in Syria, just as he did  in Chechnya--wiping out the civilian population in hopes of winning.   But in his monomaniacal hubris, Putin has severely underestimated the  Ukrainian people. Every time an innocent Ukrainian is killed, the  resolve of the Ukrainian people grows stronger. And we stand with them.   We have all seen the images, heard the stories, and watched the  videos of the reality of this awful war. Hundreds--maybe even  thousands--of civilians have been killed, as I said, from the elderly  all the way down to babies not even a month old. These atrocities  deserve to be investigated for war crimes.   Entire cities with hundreds of thousands of people have been left  with no water, no power, no connection to the outside world. Unable to  overtake Ukraine in a quick strike, Russian forces seem to be openly  targeting sites that have little military significance.   Today, I am proud to ask unanimous consent and ask all of my  colleagues to support today's legislation condemning Putin's atrocities  and supporting efforts to hold him accountable before the eyes of the  entire world.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  the consideration of S. Res 546, submitted earlier today.    I know of no further debate on the resolution.  [[Page S1186]]     I ask unanimous consent that the preamble be agreed to,  and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I have several more wrap-ups.   Would the Senator from Mississippi indulge me?    Madam President, I thank the Senator once again. He is  always courteous. Even when we disagree, he is very courteous.    Which--I hasten to add for his sake--is often.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations en  bloc: Calendar Nos. 420, 421, 423, 425, 730, 472, and 784; that the  Senate vote on the nominations en bloc without intervening action or  debate; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate; that any statements  related to the nominations be printed in the Record; that the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's actions, and the Senate resume  legislative session.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, tomorrow, March 16, at 11:45 a.m., the  Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No.  656, the nomination of Jacqueline Corley, and on the motion to invoke  cloture on Executive Calendar No. 738, the nomination of Fred  Slaughter; further, at 3 p.m., the Senate vote on the motion to invoke  cloture on Calendar No. 682, the nomination of Ruth Montenegro, and the  motion to invoke cloture on Calendar No. 678, the nomination of  Victoria Calvert; that if cloture is invoked on any of these  nominations, the Senate vote on confirmation at a time to be determined  by the majority leader or designee following consultation with the  Republican leader; finally, that the remaining cloture motions ripen at  a time to be determined by the majority leader or designee following  consultation with the Republican leader.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate  completes its business today, it adjourn until 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday,  March 16; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning  business, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Corley nomination; finally, that if any  nominations are confirmed during Wednesday's session, the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and President be  immediately notified of the Senate's actions.    For the information of Senators, the first rollcall  votes of the day will begin at 11:45 a.m.                            ____________________     Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senators Portman,  Wicker, and Blumenthal.    I yield the floor.
