Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which would name a post  office in Vergas, Minnesota, for Mr. Jon Glawe.   Growing up in Vergas, Minnesota, Mr. Glawe would ride along with his  father, who was the rural mail carrier in Vergas. After serving in the  U.S. Army during Vietnam, Mr. Glawe moved to Minneapolis and officially  began his career with the U.S. Post Office in 1975.   He later moved back to Vergas and resumed work on his family's dairy  farm. After his father's death in 1928, Mr. Glawe added a second full- time job and took over the rural mail route, delivering mail to the  town of Vergas and the surrounding area for 36 years.   He was well-known on his route and served as a lifeline for many in  the community. Even during the harshest of Minnesota winters, he would  deliver mail, medicine, and food to those in need.   There is no better way to honor Jon Glawe's decades of service to the  Postal Service than by naming a post office after him.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs. Fischbach).    SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers, and I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Scott Franklin) each will control 20 minutes.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which would name an  Arizona post office building for Dr. C.T. Wright.   Dr. Wright was a Georgia native and dedicated public servant who  devoted his life to education and community service.   He went to school in Georgia, graduating with a bachelor's degree  from Fort Valley State University and a master's degree from Clark  Atlanta University.   After obtaining his Ph.D from Boston University, he served as a  teacher and school administrator. Over the course of his career, he  worked for many of the country's historically Black colleges and  universities.   He also emphasized the importance of community service and  established the Light of Hope Institute, which promotes human rights  around the world.   For the last two decades of his life, he moved to Arizona and lived  in Fountain Hills, outside of Phoenix. There, he remained involved in  the community, serving as the president of the Fountain Hills Kiwanis  Club and president of the Arizona African society.   Dr. Wright was a devoted public servant, and I encourage my  colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which honors Mayor  Leonard Scarcella.   In 1969, Mayor Scarcella was first elected as the mayor of Stafford,  Texas, a suburb of Houston. He continued to serve as mayor until his  death in 2020, making him the longest continuous-serving mayor in the  United States.   During his time as mayor, he helped the town develop a strong  economy. Specifically, in 1995, he worked to eliminate the city  property tax for all taxpayers and eliminated the town's general  obligation debt in 2014. Mayor Scarcella was a true public servant.
