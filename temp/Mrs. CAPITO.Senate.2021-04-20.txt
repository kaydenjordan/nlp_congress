 Madam President, I rise today to honor John Shepler, an  outstanding public servant who has served both my office and the  citizens of West Virginia well in his 21-year career with the Internal  Revenue Service. John is retiring from his position as taxpayer  advocate in order to spend more time with his family and enjoy the next  stage of his life.   During his 10 years as taxpayer advocate, John was a valuable  resource to my office and West Virginia's citizens. He was well  informed, quick to respond, and straightforward in his dealings as he  advocated on behalf of his clients. He was a dedicated employee, fully  committed to his many responsibilities. He was a pleasure to work with,  and my staff were always confident that John was providing top-level  service, regardless of the issue.   John also served his country through his military service with the  U.S. Air Force, serving 6 years as a missile facilities specialist. A  dedicated public servant, John has served his country and his community  continually throughout his adult life.   John is the proud parent of daughter and a son, living in Little  Hocking, OH, and Houston, TX, respectively. I am sure he is looking  forward to spending more time with his five grandchildren, as well as  with his favorite pastimes: hunting deer and turkey, fishing, and  camping.   I would like to thank John for his service and wish him well in his  next phase of life. My staff will miss working with him at the IRS, but  we are all happy that we had him as long as we did to provide excellent  service to the citizens of West Virginia. Good Luck, John. Thank you  again for your commitment to our State.                            ____________________
