 Madam Speaker, we have reached a crisis in our healthcare  system across our country. Over 180 hospitals, many of them rural  hospitals, have closed nationwide since 2005.   Last month, the only hospital serving adults in Madera County was  closed. Hospitals like Kaweah Health in Visalia, California, are  sounding the alarm about higher costs and low Medicare reimbursement  rates.   What are we talking about here?   We are talking about access to critical healthcare, emergency room  services, critical care beds, elective surgery options, and women being  able to have a place to give birth safely. We are talking about having  access to healthcare in rural areas and throughout the country.   Congress must act now before more hospitals close. We must improve  reimbursement rates and address staffing  [[Page H1255]]  shortages, nursing shortages, physician shortages.   Hospitals have hit a crisis point. If we do not act now, a nationwide  healthcare crisis will be upon us.   My mother once said: ``Jim, if you don't have good health, you don't  have anything.'' Every American deserves access to healthcare.                            ____________________
