 Madam Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the 100th  anniversary of the founding of Estes Park, Colorado--the gateway to  Rocky Mountain National Park and one of the many treasured mountain  towns in our beautiful Second Congressional District of Colorado.   Over 150 years ago, pioneers of the mountain west settled in Estes  Park. Homesteaders came from all walks of life.   In April of 1917, the formal incorporation of the town of Estes Park  took place, ensuring our community could continue to serve the growing  needs of those living in and visiting the beautiful valley.   Since its incorporation, Estes Park has been a vital community  partner in growing the outdoor recreation economy, playing host to 4.5  million visitors to Rocky Mountain National Park, making it the single  most popular tourist attraction in our entire State. The iconic Stanley  Hotel and the Historic Park Theatre are just a few of the iconic  landmarks in Estes Park.   Estes Park's ZIP Code is 80517, and on August 5, 2017--8/5/17--Estes  Park will have its official centennial celebration--80517. I am  incredibly proud to represent the community of Estes Park and its  citizens in Congress, and I am thrilled to celebrate the 100th  anniversary of Estes Park.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying legislation,  H.J. Res. 111, disapproval of the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau's arbitration rule.   Before turning to the underlying legislation, I want to raise  concerns about the bulk of the work this week, which is the so-called  minibus appropriations bill, in which this body will seek to spend over  $700 billion of deficit expenditures. That funding bill combines four  major appropriations bills and represents more than half of  discretionary spending. It includes our spending for the legislative  branch, veterans, energy and water, and the Department of Defense.   Unfortunately, there is additional deficit spending that my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle have decided to put in the  bill, providing $1.6 billion to build a border wall, directly contrary  to the promises President Trump made on the campaign trail that another  country would pay for the wall. Republicans are seeking to pass the  bill to you, Madam Speaker, and our fellow taxpayers to pay for this  wall, in direct violation of President Trump's promise.    They also stripped out a bipartisan amendment by Representative Lee  that would end the 2001 AUMF and require Congress to come up with a new  Authorization for Use of Military Force within 8 months that was placed  into this bill in committee. Representative Lee's amendment was  stripped out by the Rules Committee despite it being in the committee  mark and despite bipartisan support to require an Authorization for Use  of Military Force. We really need to start making some decisions about  the direction of our military. Representative Lee's amendment would  have forced Congress to have that discussion.   Congress, unfortunately, seems to only work--or works best--when we  are on the clock, the day or two before the expiration of funding, the  day or two before an arbitrary time limit. This would apply a similar  test to force Congress to have a discussion around the Authorization  for Use of Military Force.   I have full confidence that, had that time not been met, Democrats  and Republicans could have provided additional short-term extensions  for the Authorization for Use of Military Force until such time  Congress could come together to pass a new one, agree with the Senate,  and send it to the President's desk.   Now on to the matters at hand.   This underlying resolution of disapproval weakens consumer  protections while protecting big banks rather than consumers. This rule  was crafted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to help restore  consumer rights and give consumers the ability to join together when  they are taken advantage of by big banks.   Instead of debating ways to improve consumer protections or increase  access to financial services, my colleagues instead have brought a  Congressional Review Act resolution that would stop our own financial  safety mechanisms from taking any future action on arbitration clauses  in consumer financial products.   Now, we have all seen these arbitration clauses. You might need a  magnifying glass because the font is small, the contract is large. Even  sophisticated consumers often don't know that by unilaterally signing  those rights away, they are removing their ability to address their  grievances in court. In many cases, removing the ability to have any  justice because when you have a large class, each of whom suffers a  small amount of damage, even the cost of administering an arbitration  claim can be prohibitive if the claim per affected individual is $50,  $75, or $100. Absent these kinds of protections, you give broad license  for big banks to rip off large numbers of consumers and take a small  amount of money from each of them. That is what this rule is intended  to prevent.   The House Financial Services Committee did not hold any hearings on  this rule. It didn't go through committee. It appeared just a few days  ago when it was introduced. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  didn't have the opportunity to testify about their studies or their  findings, or the process they went through to finalize the rule,  including input from the general public.   Congress has authorized the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to  examine the use of arbitration agreements by financial institutions and  [[Page H6227]]  consumer contracts; and, if necessary, to take appropriate steps to  limit the use of them, to prevent arbitration agreements from being  forced on consumers. In any particular case, both sides can certainly  agree to arbitration. Given the choice, many consumers will choose  arbitration. This is about forcing consumers and giving them no  alternative but to give away their rights to sue in a court of law in  favor of an arbitration process.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that 90 percent of  arbitration agreements built into the fine point of financial consumer  products actually do prohibit class action lawsuits. In cases involving  credit card issuers, companies being sued used the arbitration clauses  buried in the fine print contract to block class action lawsuits 65  percent of the time.   Again, even with the lower costs of administering an arbitration  case, it is prohibitive if the claim per person is relatively small. So  we are talking about situations where people are illegally ripped off  of $20, of $100, of their annual credit card processing fee illegally  charged. Their redress, absent a class action, is essentially  nonexistent because even though the cost of pursuing an arbitration  case is significantly less than the courts, they still can either take  up an enormous amount of time or, if you hire outside counsel,  thousands of dollars. Thank goodness, not the hundreds of thousands of  dollars that a full court case can entail, but certainly thousands of  dollars.   And if you were deprived of $30 or $50, are you just supposed to  accept it? Or can hundreds or thousands of people who were ripped off  band together and seek justice, as this rule would allow for?   Long before the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took any action,  the Department of Defense already recognized that forced arbitration  clauses in consumer loans to servicemembers stripped away the rights of  servicemembers and ultimately banned forced arbitration clauses in  consumer loan products made to servicemembers. We don't want people  taking advantage of members of our military. So, too, we don't want  anybody taking advantage of members of the American public.   But we know that big banks don't want consumers to have more power  when it comes to financial products. They prefer the deck remained  stacked against consumers, even when a bank or a credit card company  breaks the law.   When it comes to financial service products, most consumers are  entirely at the mercy of our financial institutions. These arbitration  clauses are buried in pages and pages of small print and disclosures  that are very technical for people with a college degree, no less a  high school degree, no less not even graduating from high school. The  consumer doesn't have the ability to modify the contract before they  sign it--take it or leave it--or negotiate on any type of footing  equally with the bank. They are left with a take-it-or-leave-it choice.  According to the Bureau study, more than 75 percent of consumers  surveyed did not know whether they were subject to an arbitration  clause in their agreements, and less than 7 percent knew that those  clauses limit their ability to bring a claim to court. That means 93  percent of the people who sign these agreements don't even realize they  are signing their right to sue away, and that is because they are  buried in fine print, are unclear, and run contrary to the fundamental  American principle of the ability to seek justice when you are wronged.    This final rule restores consumer rights to band together when there  is a systemic and widespread form of misconduct by a bank. This  resolution of disapproval would stop consumers from even knowing if  others were harmed in a similar manner by the same bank or lender so  they could potentially band together.   I am glad that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau final rule  actually gave some power back to consumers. And now here we have the  Republicans trying to take that power right away and give it back to  the big banks.   Madam Speaker, I would like to include in the Record a letter signed  by 310 organizations that include civil rights, faith-based, and  consumer advocacy groups that support the arbitration rule.                                                     July 12, 2017.      Re Final Rule on Arbitration Agreements.       Monica Jackson,      Office of the Executive Secretary, Consumer Financial           Protection Bureau, Washington DC.        The 310 undersigned consumer, civil rights, labor,       community, and non-profit organizations write to state our       strong support for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau       (CFPB)'s final rule to limit pre-dispute binding mandatory       (or forced) arbitration clauses in consumer finance       contracts. The rule, which will restore consumers' ability to       band together in court to pursue claims, is a significant       step forward in the ongoing fight to curb predatory practices       in consumer financial products and services and to make these       markets fairer and safer.        Lenders and other financial services companies use forced       arbitration to push consumers out of court and into a private       arbitration system that is tilted against them. Forced       arbitration eliminates the right to a civil jury trial,       limits discovery, restricts or prohibits public disclosure of       proceedings and outcomes, and makes meaningful appeals       virtually impossible. It also often prohibits consumers from       banding together in a class action to hold the company       responsible.        Recent scandals again demonstrate the very real harm forced       arbitration causes consumers. Reports show that customers had       been trying to sue financial services institutions over       fraudulent accounts going back a number of years. However,       some banks forced those customers into secret, binding       arbitration by invoking fine print in consumers' legitimate       account agreements to block them from suing over reasons as       outrageous as fake accounts, also helping to keep the scandal       out of the public eye. Even in cases where widespread fraud       has been exposed, banks continue to invoke these fine-print       clauses to kill lawsuits stemming from their illegal acts and       block consumer recovery.        The CFPB's thorough arbitration study further documents how       forced arbitration blocks consumer access to courts,       shielding banks and lenders from meaningful accountability       for their unlawful behavior. Finalizing the proposed rule       will restore crucial class action rights that deter systemic       abuses and bring much-needed transparency to consumer       financial arbitration.    The CFPB Study Data Shows That Forced Arbitration Eliminates Consumer              Claims and Shields Companies from Accountability         The CFPB's study verified the prevalence of forced       arbitration clauses--including class action bans--in consumer       financial contracts and found that this practice impacts tens       of millions of consumers. Yet it also revealed that consumers       typically have no idea they are signing away their right to       sue in court when they participate in the financial       marketplace.        The most obvious impact of forced arbitration clauses is       that they block most consumer claims from going forward at       all. Class action bans prevent consumers from bringing       complaints of fraud or other abusive or deceptive practices       in financial services because the individual value of these       claims is often too small for a single consumer to afford to       bring alone. Without the option to join together in a class       action, just 25 consumers with claims of under $1,000 pursued       arbitration each year. In a county of over 320 million, these       numbers leave no doubt that class action bans effectively       wipe out consumer claims and thus shield corporate wrongdoers       from liability. In the few claims that went to arbitration,       the study also confirmed that forced arbitration       overwhelmingly favors industry over consumers.    Class Actions Provide Great Benefit for Consumers Cheated by Systemic               Wrongdoing and Deter Risky or Illegal Conduct         The data makes clear that class actions provide a practical       way for groups of consumers who have suffered the same kind       of abuse from the same corporate wrongdoer to join together       to attempt to hold the financial institution accountable. The       CFPB study found that 34 million consumers received a total       of $2.2 billion in cash payments, debt forbearance, and other       in-kind relief from 2008-2012--not including any attorneys'       fees or court costs.        These findings were echoed in an empirical study by       disinterested academics, which found consumer class actions       against illegal overdraft fees ``deliver[ed] fair       compensation to a significant portion of class members.''       Several major banks settled class actions that claimed the       banks had purposely reordered consumer transactions to       maximize the amount of overdraft fees charged to the       consumer. This study found that plaintiffs in these cases       recovered up to ``65% of damages, with the variation based       largely on the strength of the class's claims and the       likelihood of winning certification of the class.'' Yet       unknown thousands of other consumers subject to similarly       unlawful overdraft fee practices likely got little or no       relief when class actions against their banks were dismissed       due to arbitration clauses.        Even assuming that their claims would be fairly resolved in       arbitration, leaving 34 million consumers to find their own       attorney, establish the individual facts of their case, and       take time off work to attend an arbitration will never be       more efficient than pooling time and resources between       millions of  [[Page H6228]]       consumers harmed in the same way by the same bank or lender       to challenge abusive practices. Indeed, additional empirical       scholarship demonstrates that most consumers are unaware when       they have been harmed, unaware that the harm violates a law,       or have decided that filing individual claims is not worth       their time and expense.        Collective action is critically important, not only for       enabling those already victimized to obtain justice, but also       for deterring bad behavior and preventing harm to other       victims. While each individual consumer may only lose $25 or       $50 to a fraudulent charge or illegal fee, for example,       unlawful practices implemented at a systemic level can add up       to millions or more in ill-gotten gains for banks and lenders       who violate the law. Government enforcers have limited       resources, and the prospect of class actions helps ensure       that banks and lenders obey legal requirements that protect       consumers.        The Rule's Reporting Requirements Add Crucial Transparency to                                Arbitration         Our organizations strongly support the proposed provision       to begin shining a light on individual arbitrations through       reporting requirements. Unlike our legal system, which is       built upon hundreds of years of precedent, common law       principles, and statutory standards of fairness and ethics,       arbitration firms have few constraints on their practices and       scant record of their proceedings. The substantially shorter       history of consumer arbitration has nonetheless produced both       anecdotal claims of unethical behavior and documented       systemic abuses by unregulated arbitration films.        The rule's reporting requirements will lend crucial       transparency and accountability to a previously opaque       system. Increased transparency can help consumers make       informed decisions when choosing how to pursue their claim,       in line with well-established principles of the free market.       Data collected by the CFPB will also help other government       entities, as well as the general public, ensure that       arbitrators operate within the law and treat all parties       fairly.    The Rule is in the Public Interest and for the Protection of Consumers         Because forced arbitration undermines compliance with laws       and creates an uneven playing field between corporations that       use forced arbitration and those that allow for greater       consumer choice in dispute resolution, it is in the public       interest and in the interest of consumer protection to       prohibit or strictly curtail the use of forced arbitration       clauses in consumer financial contracts.        We commend the CFPB for finalizing its rule to restore       consumers' right to choose how to resolve disputes with       financial institutions and address the public harm caused by       forced arbitration, as thoroughly documented in its three-      year, comprehensive study.

Madam Speaker, this letter, which I think my colleagues  will find convincing, has 310 groups that have signed on in support of  this rule, including groups from across the ideological spectrum,  across the States, many faith-based groups, and many others, including  from my friend from Colorado's and my home State, the Interfaith  Alliance of Colorado; the National Council of Jewish Women, Colorado  Section; the NAACP State Conference of Colorado; the Colorado Fiscal  Institute; the Colorado Council of Churches; the Colorado Alliance of  Retired Americans, and many others.                                time  1245    So I am glad that this will appear in the Record for all of Congress  to see. I will encourage my colleagues to read this letter and see who  signed it before casting your vote on the repeal of this rule, the  Congressional disapproval resolution. So this will appear in the  Record, and I know that my colleagues will study that Record before  making their decision.   Prior to the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,  Federal consumer protection laws were enforced by a number of different  regulators and different agencies. This was uneven and, after the 2008  financial crisis, I was personally glad that we were able to pull  together the efforts to protect consumers in the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau.   But despite their success, Republicans have been going after the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ever since. Despite record profits  by banks and Wall Street, here we are trying to go back to a time when  there was nobody to keep them in check. Despite the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau returning nearly $12 billion to harmed consumers, the  Republicans continue to attack the agency.   This is entirely the purpose that the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau was created, this type of rule. Congress specifically authorized  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to study forced arbitration  agreements, and determine what steps were necessary.   The Bureau undertook an extensive rulemaking process that had public  comments. I hope my colleagues across the aisle who support this repeal  were active in that public comment process because that was an  important time to be heard. The banks participated in that, consumer  groups, and so many other stakeholders before the final rule was  issued.   My colleagues across the aisle have not offered any evidence in  support of this resolution of disapproval. Why are you seeking to strip  rights away from consumers in this fashion?   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that just 400  consumers per year pursue claims in arbitration, with only 16 receiving  any cash relief. Again, when you are ripped off of a relatively small  amount of money, you don't have redress in the courts as a sole  plaintiff. You don't have redress--I shouldn't say you don't; you  technically do--you don't have an economic form of redress in the  courts, and you don't have an economically viable form of redress  through arbitration.   So the only true mechanism, if you have a million people, each of  whom are deprived of $20 or $50, the only realistic legal mechanism is  a class action lawsuit, which this rule would protect.   There is also no evidence to show, no studies--I would challenge my  colleagues to cite them if there are--to show that removing this type  of clause can somehow increase costs to consumers.   Frankly, this resolution of disapproval is just a giveaway to big  banks at the expense of you, me, everybody who has a credit card,  everybody who has a loan--the wrong direction for the country.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    It is wonderful to have so many Coloradans here, isn't it,  Madam Speaker?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Absolutely.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett), another great State that borders the State of  Colorado.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, for months now we have been debating bills that hurt  hardworking Americans--bills that kick millions, tens of millions, of  people off health insurance; bills that gut safety and environmental  protections that would keep our air clean; bills that prioritize the  interests of Wall Street over Main Street.   This is not what my constituents want. It is also not what the  constituents of many of us want. Madam Speaker, for this reason,  Democrats have unveiled an agenda to increase wages, reduce costs for  everyday expenses, and give workers the training they need to compete  in 21st century jobs.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Pocan's Leveraging  Effective Apprenticeships to Rebuild National Skills Act, H.R. 2933,  which would promote effective apprenticeships that would give students  and workers more opportunities to find good-paying jobs.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote of the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, we have less than 4 days left before the  scheduled August recess. I hope in that time we can focus on  strengthening the economy and empowering consumers rather than taking  away consumers' rights, like this bill does.   We should focus on fixing our broken immigration system to create  more economic growth and reduce our deficit, and we should create jobs  and make sure that more people are covered by healthcare, not less.   Instead, here we are, spending time on the floor of the House  stripping away consumer protections and spending American taxpayer  money on an unwanted border wall, in direct violation of President  Trump's promise.   Madam Speaker, I oppose this rule, and I oppose the underlying  legislation. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on both, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair  will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on  the question of adoption of the resolution.
