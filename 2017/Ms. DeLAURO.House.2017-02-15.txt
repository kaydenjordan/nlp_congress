 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule,  which would enable States to discriminate against healthcare providers  and deny women access to critical healthcare services.   This rule would put the only Federal program exclusively dedicated to  family planning and reproductive health services in jeopardy. It  reverses the Health and Human Services title X rule prohibiting  discrimination against title X healthcare providers. It would have  devastating healthcare consequences.   In 2015, 88 percent of patients at title X clinics received  subsidized or no-charge care, and many of these clinics provide primary  health care in addition to family planning services. This could upend  public health networks in communities across the country.    Supporters of this amendment claim that other health providers can  absorb the clients who would lose access to their title X clinics. This  is false. Community healthcare centers have said that they do not have  the capacity, and they are often not located near these patients.   We need to protect these healthcare providers. We need to uphold our  responsibility to the American people to provide critical services to  those who need them. I cannot and will not support this rule or this  resolution. It is detrimental to women's health in this country.
