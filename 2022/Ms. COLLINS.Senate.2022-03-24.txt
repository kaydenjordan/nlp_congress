 Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from  New Mexico, Senator Heinrich, in introducing the Two-Generation  Economic Empowerment Act. Our bipartisan bill would support an  innovative approach to fighting poverty, one that focuses on addressing  the needs of children and their parents or other primary caregiver-- two-generations together--in order to help break the cycle of  intergenerational poverty.   Far too many American families are living below the poverty line, and  the prolonged public health and economic crisis has exacerbated this  problem. In 2020, when COVID-19 shut down our communities and economy,  we unfortunately saw the first increase in poverty after 5 consecutive  years of decline. Nearly 38 million people, or about 1 in 10 Americans,  lived below the poverty line in 2020. Sadly, this includes nearly 11  million children, 35,000 of whom live in Maine. Despite recent  progress, Maine's child poverty rate is still higher than all of the  other New England States except Rhode Island.   While Federal programs have helped many of those living in poverty  manage day-to-day hardships, they are falling short of breaking the  cycle of poverty that has trapped too many families. As Tomas  Philipson, an economist who served previously as the Acting Chairman of  the Council of Economic Advisers, recently wrote in the Wall Street  Journal, ``you don't cut poverty by increasing reliance on government.  You do it by making them self-reliant.''   Our legislation marks an important first step toward reevaluating our  approach to poverty-reducing programs and encouraging innovative, more  effective uses of taxpayer dollars. We support an approach aimed at  equipping both parents and their children with the tools they need to  have opportunities to succeed and become self-sufficient. Oftentimes,  Federal programs intended to help low-income individuals address  challenges in silos, over looking the fact that the needs of family  members are usually interconnected. Our bill seeks to change that. For  example, helping a mother secure safe, high-quality childcare can have  a positive impact on her ability to succeed in the workforce, as well  as improving her child's ability to be ready for school. While that  child receives care and an education, her mother can connect with  skills training that could lead to a better paying job. Connecting  various Federal programs that target both parents and children with  supports aimed at increasing economic security, educational success,  social capital, and health and well-being has the potential to lift  whole families out of poverty.   Listen to the story of Kaytlyn Robbins, a mother of four who recently  relocated to Windham, ME, from Aroostook County, where a two- generation, or whole family, approach to economic mobility helped her  turn her life around. I had the privilege of meeting Kaytlyn in August  2020 at a roundtable hosted by the Aroostook County Community Action  Program, ACAP.   When Kaytlyn first connected with ACAP, she was living in a homeless  shelter, battling with substance use, and had just lost custody of her  young daughter. With the assistance of ACAP's Whole Family Program, she  worked with a career counselor to set new goals for herself and created  a customized plan to refocus and transform her life.   ACAP established a work experience for Kaytlyn at a local recovery  center in Caribou, which later became a full-time job. She was able to  secure safe housing and was reunited with her daughter, whom the team  assisted with childcare placement. Kaytlyn is now thriving and told me  she is ``healing as a family unit.'' She is married and has a new baby  who just turned 1. Professionally, she is now a registered recovery  coach and recently started up a nonprofit dedicated to substance use  disorder recovery coaching, peer groups, and community education.  Kaytlyn and her family are just one example of how the two-generation  approach can truly transform a family and put them on a path towards  economic independence. With legislation like the Two-Generation  Economic Empowerment Act, I am confident we can recreate thousands of  success stories like Kaytlyn's and expand upon successful programming  like that offered by ACAP.   Specifically, the bill we are introducing would codify an Interagency  Council on Economic Mobility to better coordinate Federal efforts that  are aimed at supporting vulnerable families and moving them out of  poverty. The council would also make recommendations to Congress about  ways to improve coordination of anti-poverty programs and to identify  best practices. While I applaud ongoing efforts across the Federal  Government to implement two-generation strategies, this council is  needed to tackle logistical challenges, such as lack of coordination  and communication across Agencies--and in some cases different entities  within a single Department--and to improve the dissemination of  information and best practices. In fact, a recent nonpartisan  Government Accountability Office, GAO, report that Senator Heinrich and  I requested confirmed that more coordination at the Federal level would  provide the critical assistance and flexibility States and localities  need to develop and implement two-gen policies to improve family well- being. This report from 2020 underscores why adoption of our  legislation, particularly its emphasis on increasing the coordination  of services, is critical to a robust two-gen approach.   Our bill would also authorize a performance pilot program that would  provide additional flexibility for States and local governments to  improve the administration of poverty-reducing programs. To-Generation  Performance Partnerships would be piloted in five States, which would  be able to blend similarly purposed funds across multiple Federal  programs. Two-generation approaches are often created ``from the bottom  up,'' meaning local organizations and States are at the forefront of  responding to local or regional needs. The Federal Government should be  empowering States and local organizations with the flexibility to be  creative problem solvers. For this reason, our legislation would reduce  duplicative reporting and application requirements that may deter local  agencies and organizations from making the most effective use of  taxpayer dollars. To ensure accountability, the bill would require that  these pilot programs be targeted at specific, poverty-reducing  outcomes.  [[Page S1777]]    With the Two-Generation Economic Empowerment Act, we have the chance  to make a permanent difference in the lives of families and to break  the multigenerational cycle of poverty. Just as a child's ZIP Code  should not determine his or her future success, the current  bureaucratic, siloed approach to aid should not stand in the way of  helping families escape poverty. As Ascend at the Aspen Institute--a  key partner on this legislation--recently observed, ``Today's economic  and public health crisis demands the innovation, inclusiveness,  collaboration, coordination, and flexibility that the 2Gen approach  provides.''   In addition to strong support from national organizations like Ascend  at the Aspen Institute and National Community Action Partnership, the  Maine Community Action Partnership and the Maine Head Start Directors'  Association have endorsed this important legislation. I very much  appreciate their support.   I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this innovative approach  to moving families out of poverty by giving them the tools they need to  succeed.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Mr. Menendez, and Mr. Warnock):   S. 3929.
