 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  H.R. 3237, the Emergency Security Supplemental to Respond to January  6th Appropriations Act.   There is broad bipartisan, bicameral agreement that a security  supplemental is necessary. I believe that.   The committee was actively negotiating towards legislation that could  have come to the floor in that spirit. However, the majority jumped to  the gate early, which leaves us with a nearly $2 billion bill with too  many unresolved issues.   Agencies across six subcommittees need to be reimbursed for the  events that occurred in responding to the Capitol on January 6. We  agree. Repairs have to be done. Support for the Capitol Police must be  provided.   But we do not need to make premature decisions before the ongoing  security assessments are complete, to commit funding that goes well  beyond the scope of January 6, or authorize programs without any  debate.   The assessment that was done by General Honore only looked at the  House side of the Capitol. That is part of the challenge, is we are  funding something that is incomplete.    Madam Speaker, we would be better served by  holding this until the Architect of the Capitol completes their  comprehensive assessment on both sides of the Capitol complex and the  entire grounds before allocating significant sums of money. This  amounts to the kind of slush fund creation that heightens Americans'  distrust of Congress, and we certainly do not need to militarize the  Capitol to keep our Members and staff safe. We can do better.   The unilateral move by the majority will only delay much-needed  reimbursements for the agencies that protect the Capitol. We need to  reignite the bipartisan discussions, and we need to do it soon.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge a ``no'' vote.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I have the upmost respect both for the chair of the  full committee and the subcommittee, and I have really enjoyed working  with him on this.   I couldn't agree more with a lot of what was said, that we need to  act, and we need to do it. I have demonstrated with my actions that I  am willing to support a bipartisan commission. I have been willing to  hold accountable people who I see in positions of leadership.   I think my biggest challenge is that General Honore did a one-sided  review of the Capitol. If you read his review, his number one  requirement for all of this to work was the Capitol Police Board needs  to be completely rejiggered. I don't know if he said ``wiped out.'' I  am using my own term here. But it doesn't work.   In order for the gear that the Capitol Police need to work, they need  to have training. In order for them to have training, they need to have  leadership. In order for them to have leadership, they need to have a  board that gives their chief some authority. We all know that is a  problem.   Can I ask the chair of the full committee, does this bill, in any  way, reform the Capitol Police Board?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut.    Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the  gentlewoman for her response. I would just add that we are stepping  ahead of that reform by fully funding those requests, and I think that  is where I am having some challenges. I am there. We are going to do  this. I just think that putting funds in place to this tune of close to  $2 billion, we need to know what we are going to spend that money on.  We need to know that we got those reforms in place. I don't want to  throw money at a situation unless we are going to reform it.   Part of the problem we saw on January 6 was the communications  infrastructure. Certainly the gear. We have to deal with that. But it  was so much more than that. It was the leadership. It was the  leadership here. Certainly there was political leadership involved. I  have spoken to that personally. That is part of the problem here. That  is part of the problem with this bill, is we are putting the money  there, but we are not reforming the system.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Womack).  [[Page H2624]]         I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman  from Arkansas.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), the ranking member of the  Committee on House Administration.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Gooden).     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I agree with a lot of the gentlewoman's sentiment that there is no  question we must support the men and women of the Capitol Police. We  must provide them the equipment, the training, and, most importantly,  the leadership that supports their efforts.   Can I ask why you have not put together legislation to reform the  police board if it is so all-important that we do so? It has been 5  months since January 6.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Lofgren), the chair of the Committee on House Administration, for the  purpose of answering a question.    Reclaiming my time, Madam Speaker, I think one  of my challenges is it has been 5 months, and I myself have sat in  meetings with the Senate Acting Sergeant of Arms, with police officers,  with the police union. I have talked with the police union president. I  have talked with individuals who were there on January 6. I have put  together my own timeline of these events. And to say that, 5 months  later, we are going to put the money before the actual reform to me  says there is a dereliction of duty from the House Administration  Committee.   I mean, how many hearings have taken place on January 6 in House  Administration before today? You are telling me there was a meeting  yesterday?   That is absolutely unacceptable that we are going to stand here today  and say that we have to do this, Madam Speaker.    Reclaiming my time, Madam Speaker, I am 100  percent in agreement that we must put the funding behind the men and  women who stand between us and violence, not a question. I am there.   What frustrates me is that I am being told that if I don't vote for  this today, somehow I am not standing behind our men and women in blue  when the House Administration Committee should have led the way with  the Honore report. It was put out months ago. They could have put these  reforms in place, could have told us how this money would be spent. But  they didn't. Why?    And then they say it is not bipartisan unless we do what they want? I  am sorry, but this isn't my money. These are taxpayer dollars, and I  want to make sure that we are not just saying we spent the money and we  are not reforming the system.   For this to never happen again, those reforms need to be in place.   To me, it is a missed opportunity, and I will not stand here, Madam  Speaker, to have it laid at our feet to say somehow we are not  supporting the men and women in blue. I will not abide by that charge.   I believe if that is the truth, then we need to make sure that we are  all doing our work in getting the reforms in place so that the money  can follow. That is how this whole place is designed to work. It is in  the Constitution. That is what we are supposed to do.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I agree with the Speaker of the House that we do need  to trust; and we, at some point, need to rely on one another's better  nature, honestly. I have been walking through that this year ad  nauseam, and will continue to do so. And it is in that same spirit of  comity that is part of the reason I raised this challenge. I have not  been afraid to challenge my own team at all, but that is part of why I  am also not afraid to challenge the other team.   If I refer back to General Honore's report, which is the basis for  what we are being asked to vote on this for, under his piece, the  Capitol Police Board Decision-making During Emergencies, he said: ``The  Capitol Police Board's deliberate decision-making process proved too  slow and cumbersome to respond to the crisis in January, delaying  requests for critical supplemental resources. We recommend revisions to  2 U.S. Code 1970 and 1974 to give the USCP Chief the authority to  request external law enforcement and National Guard support without CPB  preapproval in extraordinary emergency circumstances. . . . `'   And he goes on to explain that.   So it is not like we have to do a lot of research to figure out what  laws need to change in order to be compliant with General Honore's  report. And that would give me a whole lot more--it would allow me to  trust and verify that we are spending this money in the way that we  should. But they are not doing it, Madam Speaker. That is what really  bugs me.   We were in good negotiations trying to work this out, and all of a  sudden last week, it is just done, we are not going to negotiate  anymore. That is my problem.   What other pieces in this bill are not fully fleshed out?   I think it was a very important point to make that, look, I am for  protecting this Capitol and the staff that serve here, and the men and  women that serve here, and I will back up our police officers any day  of the week and twice on Sunday, but it really bothers me that it is a  priority when our security is threatened. We have got all these other  emergencies around this country, things like the southern border, and  we are just going to sit on it.   Madam Speaker, I am not saying hold everything back, as is being  promoted. They are saying hold everything back just because we don't  have everything else figured out.    Well, why don't we take the steps that we know that need to be  addressed?   I mentioned the southern border. That is a crisis we know. But at  least take General Honore's report and implement it, and then I  wouldn't be as opposed to funding it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gonzales).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I just want to say that I appreciate the debate that  we have had today. I don't think any of us disagree on what we want. We  want a safe and secure Capitol. We want to make sure that the people  who work here are taken care of. We want to make sure that we are  backfilling everything from overtime pay to mental health needs. And we  want to make sure that that is all done to fix or to address some of  the challenges we have had this year.   But, in addition, because we are talking about such a great sum of  money and resources, I want to make sure it never happens again. There  are other things that are happening alongside this. We have talked  about the commission today, and we have talked about other things.    But our responsibility with this is to make sure, as appropriators,  that we are spending money and we are verifying that it is being used  to the best end. That is, right now, ultimately what I think we can do  better with. It is true right now that the Senate, both Republicans and  Democrats, are not in line with what this legislation is.   So if we take a little bit more time and we do this right, we can  come out with something that we can all be proud of, that will do the  job that it is intended to do.   I am very disappointed to recommend a ``no'' vote on the underlying  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
