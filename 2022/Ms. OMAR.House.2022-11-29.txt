 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 8025,  which designates a U.S. Post Office facility in Minneapolis as the  Martin Olav Sabo Post Office.   I am proud to have the opportunity to honor the late Representative  Martin Olav Sabo, a man who dedicated his life to public service and  represented my district, the Fifth District of Minnesota, for nearly  three decades.   Representative Sabo graduated from the University of Minnesota in  1960 and served in the Minnesota House of Representatives from 1960  until 1978, the year he was elected to the U.S. House of  Representatives from the great State of Minnesota and represented the  people of the Fifth District.   Representative Sabo served 28 years in the House rising to chair of  the House Budget Committee. He built a career standing up for low- income families and the middle class and invested in critical  infrastructure and cared for our veterans.   He also delivered millions of dollars in housing and transportation  projects to our district, including the Hiawatha Avenue light rail line  and the Minneapolis Veterans Medical Center. After a long successful  career, the Minneapolis Democrat announced his retirement in 2006 and  was succeeded by my predecessor, Keith Ellison.   Sadly, Representative Sabo passed away in 2016 in his beloved home  State after a lifetime of public service. I am honored to follow in the  footsteps of Minnesotans like Martin Sabo who represented our State  with honor and distinction.   This bill is supported by the whole Minnesota delegation and has  bipartisan support, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
