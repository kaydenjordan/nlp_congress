 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  Georgia, my friend Mr. Woodall, for yielding me the customary 30  minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong opposition to this rule. Today,  House Republicans are pushing a job-killing budget so they can use  fast-track reconciliation procedures to steamroll through their  billionaires-first tax plan.   Mr. Speaker, we are supposed to be the people's House. We ought to  have the people's budget, a budget that helps the millions of Americans  who sent us here to Congress, not a budget that helps only a few, the  well-connected and the well-off.   I disagree with Mr. Woodall. This is not a time to celebrate. This is  a terrible budget. This budget will devastate America's investments in  good  [[Page H8158]]  paying jobs, it threatens growing wages and the bedrock promise of  a secure and healthy retirement. It makes cuts across the board that  would hurt seniors, children, veterans, and the hardworking people  across this country who are already struggling to get by.    Why are Republicans doing this?   Well, it is all in the name of fast-tracking the Ryan-McConnell tax  plan, which explodes the deficit by $1.5 trillion, and then provides  multitrillion-dollar tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. We  Democrats think this is a horrible idea.   What is particularly astonishing is the blatant hypocrisy of  Republican leaders pushing this deficit-busting budget. Republicans are  always telling us how much they care about the deficit, but when it  comes to giving their beloved tax cuts to their billionaire friends,  they suddenly develop a convenient case of amnesia. They say: What  deficit? Don't worry. These tax breaks will pay for themselves.   Mr. Speaker, this is absurd. In this Republican-controlled Congress,  we can now say with certainty that the deficit and debt no longer  matter. All of the talk by Republicans, well, they didn't really mean  it.   If Republicans really cared about the deficit, they would in no way  imaginable bring up a bill, a budget that is as reckless as this to the  floor. This kind of shows what they truly believe, where their values  are, where their priorities are.   How many times have Republicans talked about the importance of a  balanced budget?   The Speaker called for a deficit-neutral tax plan in his Better Way  agenda. Well, I guess this debt-creating budget is the ``Somewhat Less  Better Way'' plan.   Your budget chair took to Twitter just 2 weeks ago to chastise Senate  Republicans for not pursuing a balanced budget, yet now she is fully in  support of their budget, which adds $1.5 trillion to the deficit with  no way to pay for it.   Now, let me spell this out for my Republican friends. This is not a  balanced budget. Clearly, Republicans desperately need a refresher on  basic arithmetic.   Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely nothing balanced about hitting  middle class families and millions of hardworking Americans with cuts  while giving billionaires and corporations tax cuts they simply do not  need. Billionaires aren't knocking down our door asking for more tax  breaks. This is disgusting. This is shameful.   The Republican budget destroys middle class jobs by stealing hundreds  of billions of dollars from investments in infrastructure, job  training, advanced energy, and research and development. It devastates  Medicare and Medicaid. It demands deep cuts to safety net programs like  SNAP. I am talking about food for hungry children and hardworking  families. It goes after college affordability. It makes college more  expensive for working families. It undercuts key supports for veterans  and their families.   What is particularly offensive is that Republicans are using this  terrible budget as a means of passing tax cuts for the wealthy as  quickly as possible regardless of the consequences and without  bipartisan support.   The tax reform framework supported by Republicans in Congress will  raise taxes on the middle class and cut taxes for the wealthy. Under  the Republican plan, the top 1 percent would receive 80 percent of all  tax benefits. Let me repeat that. The top 1 percent would receive 80  percent of all tax benefits. Give me a break.   Those making more than $900,000 a year would receive an average tax  cut of more than $200,000. Think about that. A person working full time  in minimum wage makes $290 a week before taxes. And under this plan,  people who make over $432 an hour, $900,000 a year, would get a massive  tax break. Corporations will receive a tax cut totaling $2 trillion.   Who loses in this plan, Mr. Speaker?   According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, one in three middle  class taxpayers earning between $50,000 and $150,000 would actually  receive a tax increase, and nearly half of middle class families with  kids will see their taxes go up.   Can you believe that: raising taxes on the middle class to pay for  tax cuts for billionaires and corporations?   This is insane.   To make matters worse, Republicans are planning to steamroll their  tax plan through Congress. We are reading in the press that we might  see actual text of their plan next week and maybe a markup and floor  consideration a week or two after that.   Really? Don't you think we owe it to our constituents to have  thoughtful, open debate on this legislation which will impact every  single one of them?   I guess not.   Democrats agree that our tax system needs to be updated, to be more  fair, and especially to be more fair to the middle class and to working  families. We have always been willing to engage in real bipartisan tax  reform, but the Republican tax framework is not tax reform. It is just  one more GOP multitrillion-dollar giveaway to the wealthiest at the  expense of the middle class and working Americans.   In all my time in Congress, I have never seen a budget and a tax plan  that harms so many just to benefit so few. I urge my colleagues to vote  against this rule, to vote against this cruel Republican budget, and to  oppose a tax plan that puts wealthy corporations and the top 1 percent  ahead of hardworking middle class families.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, boy, I don't even know where to begin after that.   My good friend, the gentleman from Georgia, made reference to the Tax  Policy Center, and I have the report from the Tax Policy Center here.  In fact, it is their analysis that was the basis for that chart that I  held during my opening remarks, which said that the top 1 percent would  receive 80 percent of the tax breaks based on the Republican framework.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record excerpts from the Tax Policy  Center report.    [From the Urban Institute & Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center                           Staff, Sept. 29, 2017]              A Preliminary Analysis of the Unified Framework                                   Abstract         The Tax Policy Center has produced preliminary estimates of       the potential impact of proposals included in the ``Unified       Framework for Fixing Our Broken Tax Code.'' We find they       would reduce federal revenue by $2.4 trillion over ten years       and $3.2 trillion over the second decade (not including any       dynamic feedback). In 2018, all income groups would see their       average taxes fall, but some taxpayers in each group would       face tax increases. Those with the very highest incomes would       receive the biggest tax cuts. The tax cuts are smaller as a       percentage of income in 2027, and taxpayers in the 80th to       95th income percentiles would, on average, experience a tax       increase.

Did I just make that up?   I will tell the gentleman where I got it from. It is basically the  Republican report in the Senate on the budget. Let me read from their  report here.   It says: ``This title includes two reconciliation instructions to the  Senate committees. The first would allow the Finance Committee to  reduce revenues and change outlays to increase the deficit by not more  than $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years.''   These are the words of Republicans in the Senate.   The gentleman wants to know why we are talking about the tax plan. It  is because we are presented here with a budget that essentially fast  tracks a tax plan. He is right, we don't have all the details yet  because it is being negotiated and written in some back room somewhere  in this building. I wish I knew where it was so we could maybe try to  find out some more details. But what we do know is the framework that  the Republicans have put forward, and that is the basis for the  analysis that economist after economist have stated that this budget  basically is a giveaway to the wealthiest individuals in this country,  and it is not somehow a break for the middle class. It is the exact  opposite.   This is a gift for billionaires and millionaires, and it does nothing  for working families. That is why this is all relevant. This budget  puts in place procedures for the Republicans to fast track a tax bill  that they are now writing in some back room somewhere that nobody will  see probably until the last minute, and basically it will be rushed  through here, and it is a big giveaway to the wealthiest individuals in  this country. I just wanted to clarify that for the Record.   Mr. Speaker, let me say that Republican plans for tax reform would  also eliminate the State and local tax deduction, called SALT. This  deduction prevents millions of middle class families from being taxed  twice on the same income by deducting already-paid State and local  taxes from their Federal income tax.   Half the people hit by this tax hike would be middle class families  earning a household income of less than $100,000, and local communities  will also feel that pain.  [[Page H8160]]    Repealing the SALT deduction, which would effectively make State and  local taxes more costly for taxpayers, would put pressure on local  governments to lower taxes.   The bipartisan National Governors Association said in a September 22  letter that the SALT deduction, ``has contributed to the stability of  State revenues that are essential for providing public services.''  These services include healthcare, police and fire departments, and  schools.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the letter from the National  Governors Association.                                 National Governors Association,                                 Washington, DC, September 22, 2017.      Re Tax Reform (State and Local Tax Deduction and Municipal           Bonds).       Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Orrin Hatch,      Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways & Means, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Ranking Member, Committee on Ways & Means, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Schumer,       Speaker Ryan, Minority Leader Pelosi, Chairman Hatch, Ranking       Member Wyden, Chairman Brady, and Ranking Member Neal: The       nation's governors appreciate congressional efforts to reform       and improve federal tax policy. Federal and state tax systems       are complex and often interconnected. Therefore, as Congress       considers reforms, we urge you to maintain the balance       between state and federal tax systems by preserving the       income exclusion for municipal bond interest and the       deductibility for state and local taxes.        The financing engine that drives U.S. infrastructure is the       $3.8 trillion municipal bond market. Changes to federal laws       and regulations should not increase issuance costs to states       for municipal bonds or diminish investor demand for them. If       federal changes make issuing municipal bonds cost-prohibitive       for states and local governments, then fewer projects could       be funded, taxes could rise, fewer jobs created, and economic       growth will suffer.        Governors also believe that no federal law or regulation       should preempt, limit, or interfere with the sovereign rights       of states. A mark of sovereignty includes the ability to       develop and operate revenue and tax systems. Deductibility of       state and local taxes has contributed to the stability of       state revenues that are essential for providing public       services. We encourage you to avoid changes to the tax code       that would undermine the ability of state and local       governments to meet the needs of the citizens whom we all       serve.        Eliminating state and local tax deductibility, moreover,       exposes a higher share of an itemizing taxpayer's income to       federal taxation because it adds back mandatory payments of       state and local taxes already paid, as taxable income.        Federal tax reform requires an intergovernmental       partnership because decisions at the federal level will       affect state and local governments profoundly. We look       forward to working with Congress on bipartisan tax reform to       maintain balance between our systems and modernize the       federal tax system to meet the needs of our citizens.            Sincerely,      Gov. Brian Sandoval,        NGA Chair.      Gov. Steve Bullock,        NGA Vice Chair.     Mr. Speaker, I want to ask Members to vote to defeat  the previous question; and if we do, I will offer an amendment proposed  by Representative Schneider that would prohibit any legislation from  limiting or repealing the State and local tax deduction.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, to discuss this proposal and to discuss  the importance of the State and local tax deduction, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), who has been outspoken  on this issue on behalf of States and communities and middle class  taxpayers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) to respond.    I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds, and  this will probably have to be it because, unfortunately, we have so  many speakers over here. I wish I could enjoy the loneliness that my  colleague from Georgia enjoys that nobody wants to speak to defend this  budget.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett), the ranking member on the Tax Policy Subcommittee  of the Ways and Means Committee.    I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would just say to the gentleman from Georgia, we don't need  lectures on cooperation and bipartisanship. We have offered to work  with Republicans on tax reform. We have offered to work with  Republicans on improving the Affordable Care Act. Every time the  Republicans talk about rolling up their sleeves, we are not there. We  are not invited.   So if you want bipartisanship, open up this process. Go back to  regular order. Hold hearings. Listen to our ideas. Don't write bills in  the back room and rush them to the floor and force the Members up here  to vote up or down on them. Yes, we want cooperation. We want  bipartisanship, but we don't need any lectures from anybody on the  other side of the aisle.   This has been the most closed Congress in history. We don't need any  lectures on the importance of cooperation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Kind).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Doggett), the distinguished ranking member of the Ways  and Means Subcommittee on Tax Policy.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, today we are considering a budget that will basically  pave the way so we can bring up a massive tax cut for billionaires.  Again, the gentleman from Georgia mentioned the nonpartisan Tax Policy  Center in his opening remarks, and this chart is based on their  analysis. Basically, let me repeat, the top 1 percent get 80 percent of  all the benefits.   If you think that that is fair, if you think that that is  representing your constituents, then go ahead and vote for this budget,  because it is paving the way for a tax cut that will do just this.   I don't think it is fair. I don't think anybody on the Democratic  side of the aisle thinks it is fair, and I am hoping that there are  some on the Republican side of the aisle who think that that is not  fair as well.   The gentleman from Georgia talks about cooperation and about we need  to get along. I mean, who disagrees with that? But actions speak louder  than words. You can't talk about open, transparent processes and then,  as we just heard from the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett), have the  Ways and Means Committee which is writing this tax bill behind closed  doors without any help from the Democrats, but having no hearings--not  allowing any administration official to come up and testify.   How is that an open and transparent process? How does that encourage  the spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship? I mean, I thought my  friends would have learned from their terrible experience with their  repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act what happens when you  write bills behind closed doors without bipartisan input, without even  the committees of jurisdiction, by the way, in that case, deliberating  on what the final product should be.   I thought you would have learned from that process, and you ended up  failing at the end of the day. I hope that this effort that my  Republican friends are now undertaking for tax cuts for wealthy people  in this country, I hope that that fails as well.   A lousy process usually leads to a lousy product. My friends on the  other side of the aisle have mastered the art of lousy processes. In  the Rules Committee, almost virtually everything is closed. Everything  is shut down. Germane amendments routinely deny the ability for Members  to offer them on the House floor because the Republicans don't want to  deal with them. They are afraid they might lose. They don't want to  have the debate.   If you want cooperation, if you want a bipartisan tax reform bill,  then you just can't say it; you have to do something. In 1986, the last  time Congress did a comprehensive tax reform, we had 30 days of full  committee hearings spanning over a year. There were 26 days of markup  between September and December. This time, the timelines being reported  in the press are maybe just a week, or a little bit more, if that.                                time  1330    Again, if recent history is any indication, we might not even get  that. A bill might just miraculously appear one day and be rushed to  the floor so that no one has time to read it or analyze it and so that  none of our constituents have time to understand what is really  happening here.   So I go back to that chart. One percent--1 percent--of the wealthiest  interests in this country get 80 percent of the tax breaks.   If you think that that is fair, then vote for this budget, because  this budget paves the way for that tax bill to move forward.   If you care about a balanced budget and if you care about deficits  and debt, please vote ``no'' on this budget, because this allows us to  increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion.   Whatever happened to deficits matter? I guess it is inconvenient  because tax cuts for billionaires matter more than deficits and passing  on that debt to our kids.   So I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question, to  vote ``no'' on the rule, to vote ``no'' on this budget, and to fight  like hell against this horrendous tax cut plan that my friends on the  Republican side are pushing. This is bad policy. This is bad for our  country. This is bad for middle class families. This is bad for not  only my constituents, I would argue it is bad for your constituents.   It is about time that the people's House starts enacting legislation  that benefits the people of this country, not just a few who are well  off and well connected.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
