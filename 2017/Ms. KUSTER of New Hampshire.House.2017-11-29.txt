 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Brady  and the chair. I want to thank especially Congresswoman Speier and  Congresswoman Comstock for their good work on this issue.   Almost 40 years ago, I worked here in the United States Congress as a  member of the staff. I was 23 years old and I was sexually assaulted by  a distinguished guest of the United States Congress. Neither I nor  anyone in my office had received any type of sexual harassment  training. I had no place to turn; I had no one to tell; and I could do  nothing about it.   But today is a historic day. This is a watershed moment. Times have  changed and people do make changes. This is one that we are all  standing together--Republicans, Democrats, men, women, across the  board--to say ``enough is enough.''   I support this resolution as an important first step so that every  Member of Congress and every member of the staff on Capitol Hill  understand that we are drawing the line. We have had enough. We need to  address sexual harassment and assault in the workplaces, on college  campuses, in our military, and communities. The Halls of Congress can  be no exception.
