 Mr. Speaker, outside this building, more and more  Republicans bemoan the effect of Trumpism on their party. We should  take a moment to define this new phenomenon.   Trumpism is when the whims of our authoritarian President ``trump''  the values Republicans once stood for. It is when evangelicals say  character doesn't matter. It is when ``rule of law'' constitutionalists  shield Trump by attacking the institutions that guarantee the rule of  law.   It is when First Amendment champions join Trump in attacking our free  press. It is when Russia hawks bow and scrape before a President who  chooses to believe his pal Vladimir over our own intelligence agencies.   Trumpism is when this House, which is supposed to conduct serious  oversight, acts like Trump's lapdog, ignoring or abetting corruption  and obstruction of justice.   Because Trumpism threatens democracy, many Republicans are leaving  their party or, like George Bush's speechwriter, Michael Gerson, are  calling on voters to deliver a message this fall. Without that  political jolt, Gerson writes, ``elected Republicans will just keep  clinging to the USS Trump as it sinks further into the swamp.''   Now that we have defined Trumpism, let's work together to save this  country from it.
