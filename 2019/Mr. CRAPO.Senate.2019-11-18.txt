 Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator  James E. Risch and Representative  Mike Simpson, I congratulate Mike  Dettori, Fairfield District Ranger on the Sawtooth National Forest, who  is retiring after 40 years of service in the U.S. Department of  Agriculture's Forest Service.   Mike began as District Ranger for the Fairfield Ranger District in  2004 after considerable experience in many areas for the Forest  Service. In 1980, he started as a Range Management Specialist on the  Kamas Ranger District of the Wasatch-Cache National Forest in Kamas,  UT. He then went on to serve as a Rangeland Management Specialist on  the Lost River Ranger District of the Challis National Forest in  Mackay, ID, after graduating with a bachelor of science degree in  rangeland science from the University of Nevada in 1982. He then served  as an interdisciplinary rangeland management specialist for the Yankee  Fork Ranger District in Clayton, ID, and rangeland management  specialist for the Big Summit Ranger District in Prineville, OR, before  serving as acting district ranger on both the Livingston and Big Timber  Ranger Districts in Montana. He also served as forest range staff on  the Gallatin National Forest and on an incident management team.   Throughout his decades of Federal service, Mike has been a steady  leader and sensible voice contributing to the science and management of  the districts and the well-being of the staff. He has not only been an  integral part of the agency, but also an important community member, as  he has also given his time to serve in many community organizations.   Thank you, Mike, for your service and leadership and for your  contributions to the management of wonderful parts of our great State  and country all these years. We wish you much happiness in your well- earned retirement.                            ____________________
