 Madam President, I want to first briefly address what is  happening in Ukraine. The Ukrainian people are being plunged into a  deadly and devastating war. We are already seeing hundreds of thousands  of refugees fleeing the destruction and leaving their lives behind. We  have seen heartbreaking images of children huddled in basements--all of  this tragedy for no other reason than the cruel ambition of one  dictator.   Make no mistake, every life lost, every community torn apart, the  fault for this conflict lies solely at the feet of Vladimir Putin.   I strongly support continued efforts to inflict severe sanctions on  Russia for this unjustified war of aggression. Russia must pay a  crushing price for invading a sovereign democracy unprovoked. This is a  time for our country and the world to remain united in strong support  of Ukraine and firmly against Putin.   So today I am thinking of my constituents with friends and family and  loved ones in Ukraine, and my heart is with the Ukrainian people who  only want peace. I want them to know I will continue to do everything  in my power to make sure the United States is doing its utmost to  support the Ukrainian people.                                  H.R. 3755    Now, Madam President, I want to address the vote we are about to  take. And I will start with a few simple questions for my colleagues:  Do you trust women? Do you trust patients? Do you trust doctors? Do you  believe every American should be able to make deeply personal decisions  about pregnancy and parenting according to their own beliefs without  the government interfering?   Well, if you answer yes to those questions, then your job tonight is  pretty easy, vote for the Women's Health Protection Act. What this bill  does is simple. It follows the Constitution in nearly a half a century  of precedent and gives patients the right to get an abortion and  doctors the right to provide abortion care no matter where in America  that patient or that doctor lives.   We might ask: Well, why do you need a bill like this if the right is  already in the Constitution? Sadly, we need this bill because too many  extreme rightwing politicians, too many well-funded conservative  interest groups, and too many conservative lawyers jammed into our  judicial system at every level clearly do not trust women or patients  or doctors.   Now, you might say that assertion is unfair. But I am looking at  actions not words, and here is what I see. In 2021 alone, Republican  legislators across the country passed more than 100 abortion  restrictions. In Texas, there is a law that has been in effect for  nearly 6 months that bans abortion before women even know they are  pregnant. And not only that, Texas has empowered citizens to sue one  another personally for the ``crime'' of helping someone get an abortion  or providing abortion care.   The Supreme Court has already rubberstamped this appalling divisive  law, and there is a very real threat that in a matter of months, they  will end the constitutional right to abortion in Roe v. Wade.   What Republicans like to say, if Roe v. Wade is gone, that abortions  will end. That is not true. Abortions will still happen. People will  find a way, but many won't have safe options, and their health and even  their lives will be at risk. Even more so than today, women who don't  have the money or the time off or some other way--don't have the  means--won't be able to get them.   And this cruelty will fall hardest on women of color, women who have  low incomes, women in rural parts of the country, and the LGBTQ  community. To me and to many Democrats here today, that is just so  wrong. A person's ability to make the right decision for themself about  pregnancy and parenting shouldn't only be available to the rich or  depend on what ZIP Code you live in.   Unfortunately, that is the future the Republican Party wants for  America, but it is not what Democrats want, and it is certainly not  what my constituents in Washington State want. And it is actually not  what the vast majority of Americans across the country want either.   Sometime in the next few months, we will very likely see a historic  reversal of a fundamental right Americans have known for nearly 50  years regarding one of the most personal decisions any individual can  make--a right generations of women and Americans have grown up  depending on and want to see it protected.   That means that this vote tonight is historic as well. This is each  Senator's chance to stand up for an individual's right to decide what  to do with their own body and their own future. Tonight the Democratic  position is clear: We trust women and patients, and we believe that Roe  should be the law of the land.   I hope Senate Republicans vote with us. But if they don't, make no  mistake, 72 million Americans of reproductive age today may soon lose a  constitutional right every generation has known since Roe was decided  in 1973. And if they do, they are going to know exactly who is  responsible--the Republican Party.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
