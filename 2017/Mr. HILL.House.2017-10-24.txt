 Mr. Speaker, I thank our distinguished subcommittee  chairman for yielding. I am proud to support my colleague from Kentucky  on his bill, H.R. 3898, the Otto Warmbier North Korea Nuclear Sanctions  Act.   I think it is important for all of us in this Chamber to know, as  well as the people across this country, that there is no daylight  between the two political parties in this capital, and there is no  daylight between the United States Government and our Allied  Governments around the world in working together to develop sanction  regimes both bilaterally here in the United States and multilaterally  across the world to end this nuclear threat.   For 24 years, Mr. Speaker, we have had three Presidencies--we are in  our  [[Page H8104]]  fourth Presidency--dealing with this issue. This issue has not been  handled. We have not sanctioned this regime. We have not enforced those  sanctions. We have not obtained multilateral sanctions. We have not  ever given the Kim dictatorship one reason to think that our government  and our allied friends around the world are serious about ending the  nuclear threat from North Korea.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Kentucky for standing up in the  Financial Services Committee and leading the way for secondary  sanctions. I thank my friends, Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel  in the Foreign Affairs Committee, for their work with this  administration to end this threat to not only north Asia, our economic  allies, our national security allies, but also our friends around the  world.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this important  legislation.
