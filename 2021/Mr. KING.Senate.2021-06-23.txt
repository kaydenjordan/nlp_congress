 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a Maine legend  who will soon be leaving his post after nearly a half century of  diligent, inquisitive journalism that has kept our State's citizens  better informed. At the beginning of July, Mal Leary will sign off for  the final time from Maine Public Broadcasting, concluding a 45-year  career during which he became one of the most trusted voices in Maine  media.   When listeners heard Mal's distinctive Maine rasp come across the  airwaves, they knew they were getting the straight news from a model  journalist. His integrity and intelligence came through in every story,  diving into the policy details in a measured, well-reasoned way that  did not betray a bias toward any ideology, political party, or elected  officials. Most importantly, every time you finished listening to a Mal  story, you knew more about your community and your State than you did  just a few moments before.   Mal wasn't only held in high esteem by listeners. I can tell you from  personal experience that when Mal is in a room, elected officials  notice his presence. He loomed large among the Maine press corps, and  his ability to unravel and explain a complicated policy question was  only matched by his political instincts. While others, including  legislators, were focused on the questions of the day, Mal would look  two or three steps down the road to anticipate the pitfalls facing any  given proposal. I learned quickly that I always needed to have my facts  straight before I talked to Mal Leary.   His innate understanding of both policy and policymakers made Mal's  interviews one-of-a-kind. I would often start a conversation with him,  expecting to discuss the issues of the day, only to be questioned on an  issue that wouldn't come up for another few months or review a  legislative hearing from 3 weeks prior. Refusing to be a prisoner of  the moment, he always looked at the big picture, and, critically, he  made sure that the elected officials he covered did the same.   Maine will be poorer without Mal Leary roaming the State capitol, but  he is leaving the Maine press corps in good hands that he had a part in  training. A fountain of institutional knowledge, Mal was always  generous with his time and his experience, filling in young reporters  on the historical context behind long-gestating problems or making sure  folks were up to speed on legislative procedures. This next generation  of reporters have each grown by absorbing Mal's wisdom, working to  compete with him, or a combination of the two, so although he may be  leaving for greener pastures, his lessons and influence will remain.   I find a bit of irony in these remarks because even as I attempt to  honor Mal, I sense that he will have some discomfort taking the  compliment. The definition of a model reporter, Mal wasn't focused on  befriending his subjects or accumulating personal accolades; he was  always dead set on getting to the truth and bringing that  [[Page S4727]]  truth back to the people of Maine. That is why he is so beloved by  all--OK, by most--even when he was asking hard questions; at the end of  the day, Mal always told the story straight. He was always fair.   I have long believed that journalists are people we, the public, hire  to tell us about priorities that we don't have time to attend to  ourselves; instead, we rely on friends to give us the scoop. That is  exactly who Mal was for thousands across Maine--a friend, who filled  them in on the latest goings-on in Augusta, Washington, and everywhere  in between. As our friend rides off into the beautiful sunsets of  Maine, I want to express to him my best wishes and Maine's enormous  gratitude for his work to make our State better.                            ____________________
