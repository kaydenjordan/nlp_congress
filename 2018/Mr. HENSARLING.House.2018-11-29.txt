 I came here this morning, Mr. Speaker, and I picked  up a copy of this morning's edition of The Wall Street Journal. Many  Americans would consider it to be the most influential newspaper in  America, but certainly, at least on economic matters, I think most  would agree.   I just happened to read the lead editorial today, Mr. Speaker, and it  says the House, this body, has ``done yeoman's work shepherding a  compendium of bipartisan bills to expand access to capital.''   This is in the most influential newspaper in America.   There is a lot in between, but let me go to the last sentence, where  it says: ``Senate Republicans shouldn't scuttle what could be one of  this Congress's better achievements.''   That is in today's Wall Street Journal, Mr. Speaker.   The Journal is talking about JOBS 3.0. It is a bill that came out of  this body, 406-4. Its purpose, Mr. Speaker, is to promote small  business, to promote entrepreneurial capitalism, and to promote venture  capital.   Again, Mr. Speaker, it came out of this body, 406-4--we couldn't get  a 406-4 vote on a Mother's Day resolution--and yet it languishes on  that side of the Capitol.   So I have been in this body for 16 years, Mr. Speaker, and I have  learned a few things. One of the things I have learned is never  underestimate the Senate's capacity to do nothing. Unfortunately, so  far, the United States Senate has done nothing on a bill that passed,  406-4.   Now, Mr. Speaker, thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump,  thanks to the leadership of Speaker  [[Page H9696]]  Paul Ryan, and thanks to the leadership of Chairman Kevin Brady, we  have what, for most Americans--not all, but for most Americans--is  simply the greatest economy they have had in their entire lifetimes:   Unemployment is at a 50-year low, cutting across all socioeconomic  groups;   Small business optimism and consumer optimism is off the charts;   We are seeing more people come back into the labor force.   This is all great news, but we cannot be blinded by the fact that, as  good as the economy is today, we still have to concentrate on the  economy of tomorrow. We need to know:    Can we ensure that the seed capital is there?   Can we make sure that our public policy nourishes the drivers of  tomorrow's economy?   The next Amazons, the next Googles, and the next Ubers, where are  they going to come from?   So, unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, what we have seen is that, as  recently as 2016, startups in America have been cut in half.   And, oh, incidentally, the regulatory burden--more securities  regulatory burden--has increased by over 50 percent in the last 10  years, and by over 80 percent. It now costs, Mr. Speaker, twice as much  to go public today as it did 10 years ago.   What do we see? We see half the number of companies going public.   They don't seem to have that problem in China, Mr. Speaker, because  China has over one-third of the world's IPOs, or initial public  offerings; yet, in the United States, our IPOs have been cut in half.   That is why it is so important that every Congress go back and we  ensure that our securities laws are written in such a way that we make  sure that entrepreneurial capitalism can't just survive in America but  absolutely thrive.   So I come to this floor again to ask that our colleagues on the other  side of the Capitol--and I have many friends in that body, but I am  often confused why they cannot act on something that has received  incredible support in the House.   Mr. Speaker, November is National Entrepreneurship Month. There are  only 2 days left in the month. I hope that my voice can be heard on the  other side of the Capitol, and I would ask the United States Senate to  immediately take up the JOBS 3.0 Act and make sure that the economy of  tomorrow for our children and grandchildren is as healthy and thriving  as the economy of today.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7187) to extend the National Flood Insurance Program until  December 7, 2018.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7187         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Flood Insurance       Program Further Extension Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. PROGRAM EXTENSION.         (a) Financing.--Section 1309(a) of the National Flood       Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4016(a)) is amended by       striking ``November 30, 2018'' and inserting ``December 7,       2018''.        (b) Program Expiration.--Section 1319 of the National Flood       Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4026) is amended by striking       ``November 30, 2018'' and inserting ``December 7, 2018''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), the chairman of the Housing and Insurance  Subcommittee. He is also the author of the 21st Century Flood Reform  Act, which was passed by this body over a year ago, and we still await  the Senate to take up this version.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the chairwoman of the Oversight and  Investigations Subcommittee of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  [[Page H9712]]  Florida (Mr. Ross), the vice chairman of the Housing and Insurance  Subcommittee of the Financial Services Committee and the true author of  competitive flood insurance.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to another gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Williams), the vice chairman on the Monetary Policy and  Trade Subcommittee of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), the Financial Services Committee majority whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Budd), a hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have left?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, first, I return the kind words of the ranking member.  One, she very much negotiated in good faith on the flood program,  something she has a lot of passion and expertise on. We didn't get  quite there as we did on a few other items, but, again, she negotiated  in good faith. She has a lot of  [[Page H9714]]  expertise on the matter. If we don't get it in this Congress, I have no  doubt that she will play a key leadership role in the next in order to  effectuate long-term flood reform.   And I appreciate the kind words. Although, I must admit, I have  learned many things in the 16 years I have served in Congress, and one  is, the best way to get people to say kind words about you is to  announce your retirement. I have never had kinder words spoken, but I  know they were sincere, of the ranking member.   Mr. Speaker, November 14, 2017, was a proud day for the United States  House of Representatives, because that is the day, on a bipartisan  basis, we passed the 21st Century Flood Reform Act, and I negotiated  with the House majority whip, Mr. Scalise, this bill, among others.   And here we are, over a year later, and no action from the Senate.  And, today, November 29, 2018, is a sad and embarrassing day for the  United States House of Representatives. And I must say, as a  Republican, it is a sad and embarrassing day for something we call  regular order, something that my party ran on.   And now we have a bill coming to the floor, within the jurisdiction  of the House Financial Services Committee; regular order says the  committee of jurisdiction first works their will before the House works  their will. The committee didn't work its will on this bill. And, in  fact, I have yet to find anybody in the Republican leadership who will  own up to how this came to the floor in the first place.   So, unfortunately, because my party lost at the ballot box, we are  going to soon be out of the regular order business and apparently we  have forgotten how to do it. So it is a sad day in that regard. It is  also a sad day because what we see here with this bill is a  perpetuation of the status quo.   Now, let me tell you what the status quo is, Mr. Speaker. The status  quo is 100 different people are dying in America every year from  floods. At least a part of that tragedy--a part of that tragedy is a  failure to reform the National Flood Insurance Program.   Status quo is that we continue to pay people to build the same homes  in the same fashion in the same places that flood over and over and  over and somehow expect a different result. We are not helping them. We  are not helping them at all. We are helping put them in harm's way.  That is what the status quo is, and if you vote for this extension, you  are voting for the status quo.   Status quo is a government monopoly--a government monopoly with no  competition, no innovation, and, by the way, it is subsidized, and it  is still not affordable. We are seeing average premium increases of 7  percent a year. You know, on the Republican side of the aisle, why  don't we give free enterprise a chance? Why don't we allow competition  to bring in innovation, to bring down rates as opposed to, again,  making taxpayers subsidize it and still have unaffordability? Only  government can bring about that insane result.   What else is the status quo? The status quo is $35 billion of debt-- $35 billion of debt with $1\1/2\ billion actual actuarial annual  deficit a year. Totally unsustainable. Totally unsustainable   The status quo is that taxpayers, hardworking factory workers in  Mesquite, Texas, are having to subsidize millionaires' beach condos.  That is the status quo. That is the bill that is on the floor right  now.   The last several tragic hurricanes we have seen, 80 to 90 percent of  the affected flooded homes didn't even have flood insurance. Why?  Because it is not part of the homeowner's insurance policy due to the  government monopoly. That is the status quo. And we are paying on the  back end because we are not allowing market competition on the front  end. That is the status quo.   The status quo is, we are taking environmentally sensitive areas, and  they are getting paved. They are getting paved in flood-prone areas.                                time  1715    That is the status quo, and so that is really the debate that is  before us today.   We know what the classic definition of insanity is: doing the same  thing over and over and over and expecting a different result. Eight  times--this will be the eighth time since the House passed the 21st  Century Flood Reform Act on a bipartisan basis that there will be yet  another vote for status quo.   Here is a radical idea. Why don't we do something different? Why  don't we tell the Senate it is time, after a year, that they do their  business?   I have got to tell you, once again, Mr. Speaker, I have learned a  number of things in my 16 years of service in this body. One is never  underestimate the Senate's capacity to do nothing.   Why do we allow them to do nothing? Let them bring a bill.   I don't believe we are through negotiating, Mr. Speaker, but the  House shouldn't negotiate with itself after we have made a House  position on a bipartisan basis known. There is no reason to do this.   There can be a better day. There is hope. I imagine a day when we  have a flood insurance program with affordable premiums that is brought  about by competition, that is brought about by innovation. I can  imagine a day where every American remotely placed in a flood-prone  area has flood as part of their homeowners insurance so that when one  of these great tragedies occurs, at least they had insurance on the  front end. So I dream about and I imagine greater take-up rates.   I also imagine a day where, for the people in flood-prone areas, we  either help move them up or we help move them out so that they don't  continue to be in harm's way.   I went to Hurricane Harvey. I met with the survivors. I heard the  tragic stories. I saw the tragedy of the lost homes. And yet here we  are, voting on status quo to put them right back where they were again.   This is a sad and embarrassing day for the House. We need to vote  ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight on behalf of the  Financial Services Committee.   Mr. Speaker, it has been my great privilege to have the  responsibility to chair this committee for the last 6 years. I take no  pride on behalf of myself, but I take a lot of pride in the work that  has been done on this committee.   A lot of that work, Mr. Speaker, has been bipartisan. And I believe,  indeed, that the Financial Services Committee is the hardest-working,  most productive committee in the United States House. We have produced  more bills; we have had more bills passed on the floor; we have had  more bills signed into law than any other committee.   I am especially proud of the work that we have done to create more  pro-growth economic policy throughout banking and finance, and the  passage of S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer  Protection Act, has meant so much to helping create more capital to  help save our credit unions and community banks, and to really play a  part in the unparalleled economic growth that we see in our Nation  today. I take great pride in that work on behalf of all our members.                                time  1930    I also take great pride on behalf of our Members for a piece of  legislation  [[Page H9733]]  that modernized the foreign investment in the U.S. The bill is  technically known by its acronym, FIRRMA, and it modernizes a regime  that had not been modernized in quite some time.   Mr. Speaker, so many of us know we have challenges in America today  with foreign interests that come in and essentially take our  intellectual property, that take our technology, and regrettably China  is one of the prime perpetrators of this. I have had the occasion to go  to China and meet with their leadership. And I want China to rise, I  want them to have economic growth, but not at the expense of the United  States of America and not by violating either the letter or the spirit  of the WTO, of the World Trade Organization, which we helped them enter  a couple of decades ago.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the work, especially, done by the  gentleman from North Carolina, who is the vice chairman of our  Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee. He was the House leader on  this legislation and worked with the senior senator from Texas, John  Cornyn, my friend, to bring this onto the President's desk that  ultimately got signed into law.   This was really a revolutionary law dealing with both export  controls, foreign investment in the U.S., and the gentleman from North  Carolina, Mr. Pittenger, was an early leader. He saw the threat before  others saw it.   I have had a number of great privileges serving as chairman, but one  of the greatest privileges is serving with men and women who have  vision, who have commitment, who have principle, and that certainly  describes the gentleman from North Carolina.   Regrettably, he and I are both departing after this Congress, and  that is a bittersweet feeling. I think we both look forward to the next  opportunity that we have.   Mr. Speaker, I want to yield him some time, because it is important  for us to hear from him about the significance of this legislation and  how important it is. I was happy to be in the White House not too long  ago to have the President extoll the virtues of this law as well.   Mr. Speaker, I will miss his company, I will miss his leadership, and  there is no one that I know of who is a greater authority on terrorist  finance who is serving in the U.S. Congress today than  Robert  Pittenger of North Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Pittenger), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank the gentleman for his  comments tonight.   I hope that there are a fair amount of Americans who are watching  this this evening, because they need to know that they owe this  gentleman, Mr. Pittenger of North Carolina, a great debt of gratitude.  And indeed America is going to be a safer, more secure Nation because  of his leadership.   In his three terms, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Pittenger achieved more in three  terms than many Members achieve in ten terms.   Many people, unfortunately, come to the People's House to be  somebody. Mr. Pittenger of North Carolina came to do something.   And, indeed, don't just take my word for it, but the President of the  United States thinks this is one of the most significant pieces of  legislation when it comes to dealing with the threats of those who  would take our intellectual property, who would take our technology by  hook or crook, or however they might do it.   So, Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Mr. Pittenger for his leadership.   I must admit, this was kind of faint on my radar screen, this issue,  but among Mr. Pittenger's other endearing qualities, he is persistent.  He is a very persistent individual. And I am glad he was persistent,  because it became a major piece of legislation.   Part of my job as chairman and one of my great privileges is I get to  take credit for a lot of other people's good work. I shouldn't, I  shouldn't be accorded this. And so I get many thanks, but this was a  team effort and it was led by Mr. Pittenger.                                time  1945    Other countries are now put on notice. We are watching. These rules,  as Mr. Pittenger, the gentleman from North Carolina, has said, will be  unveiled in the weeks and months to come. But a new day has dawned for  those who think that they are going to take, by hook or crook, our  technology.   We want our global neighbors to succeed, but, again, not to succeed  at our expense. Those applications of technology and intellectual  property that have any type of national defense implications, that is  going to stop, and it is going to stop because of the leadership of   Robert Pittenger, the gentleman from North Carolina.   It has been a great, great source of pride and joy to be associated  with him. I will count him as a friend for life. I appreciate the fact  that he would come and spend time here.   I have no doubt, Mr. Speaker, that his leadership is not done. His  leadership may be done in this body, but his leadership in fighting  global terrorism from illicit finance and global terrorist finance,  that leadership is not done. In many respects, it is just starting. I  look forward to continuing to follow his career and his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, we are also joined tonight by another real authority on  global terrorist finance, a gentleman who has been incredibly active on  the Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee of the Financial  Services Committee. I have come to really appreciate his intellect, his  knowledge, and his work ethic. He is clearly one of the hardest working  members of the Financial Services Committee.   As, regrettably, the gentleman from North Carolina departs, and I am  saddened by that, we are both heartened to know that the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Davidson) will remain, and he will be one of the key leaders  in the entire United States House of Representatives in combating  terrorist finance. He has been such a workhorse in helping some of our  economic growth measures that have helped save community banking and  credit unions.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Davidson).    Mr. Speaker, well, after hearing those kind comments,  I would be happy to yield the gentleman even more time. I say that  tongue-in-cheek.   Mr. Speaker, I have learned that if you want kind things said about  you, announce your retirement. So, I must admit, I am humbled by this  experience, and I thank the kind words of the gentleman.   I must admit that it is a real mixed blessing that I get ready to  leave Congress, but I take a lot of solace knowing that there is a new  generation of conservative leaders who are coming to this body, who  know how important faith is in the life of a great Nation, because you  cannot have a free Nation that is not a virtuous Nation and a godly  Nation.   I know that there is a new generation of conservative leaders who are  coming up who know how important our families are, our families who  care for our elderly and nurture our youth and perpetuate our values.  They know how important free enterprise is, not just because it allows  people to sleep at night knowing the bills are paid, but how empowering  it is to finally leave the assembly line and to start your own  business; how empowering it is to send that first kid to college; but,  ultimately, how important it is to pursue happiness, to use your God- given talents in any way that can help you and your family prosper.   I know I take great solace to know there is a new generation of  conservative leaders who know that, ultimately, liberty is an  inalienable right given to us by our creator, the Almighty, and how  precious it is and how few people on the face of the planet really  enjoy the full fruits of liberty.   I count Mr. Davidson among those people, and I will always count him  as my friend. But it makes it much easier, after 16 years, to leave  this body knowing that there is a Warren Davidson in Congress and  knowing that there is a Ted Budd from North Carolina who will remain in  Congress as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Budd).  He also has become a fast friend of mine. More importantly, I count his  wife as a friend of my wife, and me as well. Not unlike Mr. Davidson,  he is one of the hardest working members of our committee, and he  never, never gives up.   Again, a significant portion of the economic growth packages that we  have passed out of the House Financial Services Committee, two or three  of them I know contain Mr. Budd's name. That is unusual for somebody  who has been a freshman member of our committee, to have so many bills  passed. It is a testament to the great citizens of his congressional  district that they would return him to office. I hope, next time, maybe  a few more will join in and make it a little less interesting. But I am  also proud to call him colleague; I am proud to call him friend; and I,  again, take great solace to know that this body will see his  conservative leadership for quite some time.                                time  2000     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his kind  words, and far more importantly, I thank him for his leadership. He is  truly one of the workhorses for economic growth in the United States  Congress.   Again, I take great solace, as I will soon leave this august body, in  knowing that somebody like Mr. Budd will be here. He has such  principle, character, is a hard worker, and has success in actually  getting bills done that make a difference in the lives of working  people. Mr. Speaker, it is such a pleasure to serve with the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Budd).   Mr. Speaker, several of our Members have spoken tonight about what we  call the JOBS 3.0 Act, Jumpstart Our Business Startups. Thanks to the  leadership of President Trump, thanks to the leadership of Speaker  Ryan, and thanks to the leadership of Chairman Kevin Brady, we have a  great economy. We have, perhaps, the greatest economy in most  Americans' lifetimes. Unemployment is at about a 50-year low. For the  first time in a decade, we are seeing paychecks rise. We are seeing  that take-home pay increase.   Small business optimism, consumer optimism, is off the charts. It is  amazing what can happen with some tax reform and regulatory reform.  And, yes, I take pride--not on my behalf, but on behalf of the  Financial Services Committee--in what we have done to help take some of  the shackles off of our community banks and our credit unions. But  there is so much more work to be done.   Mr. Speaker, as you probably know, the whole idea of capital  formation for our entrepreneurs, for our small businesses,  traditionally, that has been a bipartisan effort. And, in fact, the  very first, what we call JOBS 1.0, was signed into law by President  Barack Obama. I don't quite have the quote at my fingertips, but at the  time, he said something along the lines that we have to, from time to  time, remove the regulatory burdens to capital formation that are  preventing our entrepreneurs from accessing capital.   So the first point I would like to make, Mr. Speaker, is the economy  of today is in great shape. But can we count on it for the economy of  tomorrow? Particularly, Mr. Speaker, when I look at public companies,  what I see is that our public companies are fewer, they are older, and  they are bigger. Today, in America, we still have far too many old cars  and not enough startups in our garages.   I sometimes think--and I am the father of a 16-year-old daughter, a  15-  [[Page H9737]]  year-old son--the companies that will drive the economy when they are  in their peak earning years, they probably haven't even been founded  yet. Where are the next Amazons coming from? Where are the next Googles  coming from? Where are the next Apples coming from?   But what we see as recently as 2016, just a couple of years ago, is  that new startups' entrepreneurial capitalism was at a 40-year low.  Now, fortunately, under this administration, it is taking a turn  upwards, but we have got a lot of ground to make up.   Our public companies have been cut in half, a 20-year low, as  recently as 2016. Half of the number of companies are going public. And  so not only is that bad for America's economy, but it is bad for the  family economy because they lose out on investment opportunities.   Had you invested early in Apple, you would have made a gazillion  percentage rate of return. It would have been an incredible investment  opportunity. At the time, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts wouldn't  even allow Apple to sell their securities because they were fearful it  was too speculative.   We want to make sure that every American family has the opportunity  to invest in the next Apple. But, unfortunately, what we see is a  regulatory burden that is absolutely strangling a lot of these startup  companies.   Over the past 2\1/2\ decades, Mr. Speaker, the U.S. share of global  venture investment has steadily declined. And when we see it decline,  what we also see is that regulatory restrictions on securities and  investment have increased 54 percent in 10 years--in just 10 years, a  54 percent increase in regulatory restrictions on securities, and an 80  percent increase over 20 years.   We are wondering why there is so little entrepreneurial activity, and  we are wondering why so few companies have gone public.   Part of what we have to do is simply modernize antiquated statutes.  And so with the exceptions of Sarbanes-Oxley, and with the exception  of, frankly, the first version of the JOBS Act and the second version  of the JOBS Act, almost all of our other significant Federal securities  laws date back to the 1930s.   Mr. Speaker, a couple of these, the Securities and Exchange Act, the  Securities Act, they are foundational. But so many of these other laws  that we still labor under, I mean, there was a time that the telephone  was the cutting-edge technology. That is when the SEC was created, in  1934, and the telephone was the cutting-edge technology of the time.   So many of the security laws we have date back to that particular  era. At that time, stock offerings were part of the daily newspaper.  Well, we don't see that anymore. Pneumatic tubes and ticker tape  transmitted the news of a stock sale.   If we are going to be able to fuel the economy of tomorrow, we are  going to have to modernize these securities laws. And, again,  traditionally, this has been a bipartisan effort.                                time  2015    The United States House of Representatives has passed JOBS 3.0 by a  vote of 406-4. Months later, the United States Senate has done nothing  on this piece of legislation. This cannot hold. This cannot be. There  is no excuse for the United States Senate back there behind my shoulder  to do nothing while, for example, we see more companies go public in  China.   We had a discussion a little earlier, Mr. Speaker, how China,  unfortunately, too often has taken our technology--our intellectual  property--by hook and crook. But a lot of it is companies are choosing  to confine their capital in China because they find it easier, and now  we are looking at over one-third of public companies are going public  in China, and we are down to 11 percent. They have an ascending curve;  we have a descending curve.   In order to successfully compete with China in a global economy, we  have to make it easier throughout the ecosystem of our small  entrepreneurial ventures to make it easier, and so that is what the  whole thrust of the JOBS 3.0 Act is all about.   Again, it is a very, very strong bipartisan measure. So often the  lead Democrat in this institution, known as ranking member, the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters) and I don't see eye to  eye on much. We see eye to eye on very little. But we are joined at the  hip in wanting to see the JOBS 3.0 Act. She has been stalwart, and she  has been a good negotiating partner to get this done.   So you have one of the most liberal Members of Congress and one of  the most conservative Members of Congress come together to advocate for  our small businesses, for our entrepreneurs, to help us compete with  China in the JOBS 3.0 Act, but somehow they are still not hearing this  in the United States Senate.   Please, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters), gives  every liberal permission to vote for the JOBS 3.0 Act. As chairman of  the House Financial Services Committee and one who used to chair the  conservative caucus in the House, I give every conservative permission  in the United States Senate to vote for JOBS 3.0.   Please, we need a message for all Americans who care about small  businesses. We want to make it easier. We want to make it easier for  these businesses to get funding.   The bottom line is, Mr. Speaker, you cannot have capitalism without  capital, and we want to make it easier to access this capital.   So I was very heartened by the fact that, although maybe our  Senators--and I have many friends who are United States Senators. I  still cannot understand why they haven't taken up a piece of  legislation that came out of the House 406-4, a piece of legislation  strongly supported by the administration, and a piece of legislation,  again, that is going to help our small businesses and entrepreneurs.  Why haven't they taken it up?   Perhaps the single most influential newspaper in America is The Wall  Street Journal. It is certainly the most influential economic  publication in America, and probably the world. Fortunately, their lead  editorial today was to encourage the Senate to take up JOBS 3.0. In  fact--I am kind of paraphrasing here because I don't have the newspaper  at my fingertips--they said that Congress has done yeoman's work  shepherding a compendium of bipartisan bills to access capital. They  were referring to JOBS 3.0.   Again, go online. It is their lead editorial.   They said that the Senate shouldn't scuttle what could be one of  Congress' better achievements. I agree. This will be one of Congress'  better achievements to be able to capitalize our small businesses to  make sure, again, they can access capital, they can go public, and that  they are not treated like a Fortune 500 company on day one.   Mr. Speaker, many of our biotech companies that provide lifesaving  pharmaceuticals, some of them don't even cash flow positive for a  decade. They can't be treated with the same regulatory burden on their  capital as a Fortune 500 company. If you do, again, they are going to  go to China. They are not going to stay in the USA. They are going to  go to China. As we continue to compete with them, we cannot allow this  to happen.   So we have had such great support. I alluded to the ranking member,  the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters). She said that this  bill is ``a carefully crafted bipartisan compromise.'' Those are her  words. She said that it is ``an example of Members on both sides of the  aisle working together to support our Nation's small businesses and  investors.''   Again, she is one of the most liberal Members of the United States  House of Representatives and most likely the next chairman of the House  Financial Services Committee. She said that this bill will help  entrepreneurs, small businesses, investors, and our economy to thrive.   In the 6 years I have been chairman, it has kind of been rare for us  to agree on the time of day, but we definitely agree that the JOBS 3.0  Act is important. It is important to America's economy not only today,  but more importantly, it is important for the economy of tomorrow.   If there is one aspect of America's economy that is somewhat unique  in the world, it is how we have ensured that entrepreneurial capitalism  can't just survive in America, but thrive. So those seeds have to be  planted today. There is so much competition worldwide, and that is why  it is important that we get this done.  [[Page H9738]]    The U.S. Chamber of Commerce weighed in, and they said that the House  amendment to S. 488--I am talking about the JOBS 3.0 bill--would remove  barriers for raising capital for America's businesses. Approximately  three-fourths of financing for businesses in the United States comes  from capital markets, but regulations have failed to keep up with the  demands of the 21st century.   The Angel Capital Association has written: ``Thank you again for your  leadership in promoting American startups, capital formation, and job  creation. The JOBS and Investor Confidence Act will help foster  innovation and job growth.''    The Biotechnology Industry Organization, known as BIO, said: ``The  JOBS and Investor Confidence Act of 2018, or JOBS Act 3.0, will  significantly improve the ability of emerging biotech companies to  access capital and invest in their potentially lifesaving research  rather than unnecessary compliance costs that do not add value to  investors.''   There is widespread support. I am almost baffled, Mr. Speaker, why  the United States Senate won't take this up. Again, this is a strongly  bipartisan package. It doesn't get much stronger than 406-4.   Again, our business startups have neared a 40-year low in 2016. Our  IPOs, our initial public offerings that allow our working families to  invest in the American economy, are half of what they were 20 years  ago.   Why? The average regulatory compliance for initial public offerings  has now doubled. It has doubled in the last 25 years. It costs $2.5  million to go public, with average compliance costs clocking in at $1.5  million.   Sometimes, Mr. Speaker, we have to take a look at regulations that  date back to the 1930s and start to ask the question: How is that going  to impact the economy of the 2030s? The answer is not too well,  particularly in a global economy competing with China.   So I just want to conclude by saying that I have so many friends in  the United States Senate. I respect the United States Senate. I used to  be a staffer of the United States Senate. But there is no excuse why  they can't do what the House did and follow our leadership and work on  a strong, bipartisan basis to make sure that America just doesn't have  the strongest economy of today but has the strongest economy of  tomorrow.   It started with men and women, Democrats and Republicans on the House  Financial Services Committee, to ensure that the economy of tomorrow,  once again, will be strong for all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues and my friends in the United States  Senate to follow our lead, to listen to the administration, and to pass  the JOBS 3.0 Act immediately.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
