 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring  up H.R. 724, which would rescind Donald Trump's refugee ban and help  unify the family of Farah Usa, a refugee who risked her life for United  States forces in Iraq and whose father, mother, and sister are now  barred from entering the United States of America.
