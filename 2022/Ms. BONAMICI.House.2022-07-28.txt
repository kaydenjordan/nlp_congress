 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the CHIPS and  Science Act, and I thank Chairwoman Johnson for her leadership in  bringing this bill to the floor today.   The pandemic has underscored how important our domestic semiconductor  supply chain is to transportation, the energy sector, national  security, and scientific advancement. With this bill, we will make a  vital investment in domestic manufacturing and in workers in Oregon and  across the country.   I am also grateful that this legislation includes two of my  bipartisan bills. I am the co-chair of the House Oceans Caucus, and my  Coastal and Ocean Acidification Research and Innovation Act will help  protect the health of our ocean while supporting coastal resiliency.  Acidification of the ocean and estuaries destabilizes coastal  communities, causing long-term economic harm. This bill will strengthen  investments in research and monitoring, provide resources to mitigate,  and increase our understanding of the socioeconomic consequences of  inaction.   My Building STEAM Education Act will expand resources and grant  opportunities to integrate art and design into STEM education programs,  which will better engage students, prepare an innovative workforce full  of creative and critical thinkers, and enhance the diversity of the  STEM workforce.   Overall, Mr. Speaker, the CHIPS and Science Act will grow U.S.  leadership, strengthen our scientific enterprise, bolster research and  development, grow our domestic semiconductor manufacturing base, and  on-shore critical supply chains. Importantly, it will also support  workers and create many quality jobs in Oregon and across the country.   I thank the tireless committee staff for all of their work to bring  this bill to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all of my colleagues to put American  leadership above politics and support this important bipartisan bill.
