 Madam Speaker, to say I yield myself such time as I may  consume is too short to recap these 2 days of the assault on the Second  Amendment.   I will only say, in closing, that it might seem reasonable in this  bill--these five or six or seven different bills cobbled together--it  might seem reasonable that each of them makes sense.  [[Page H5429]]    I ask you, when we changed the Constitution to give an 18-year-old  the right to vote, if we simply said today that we have changed our  mind, we want to make it 21, don't worry about the Constitution.  Wouldn't there be people saying that is ridiculous? Of course, they  would.   If we said the First Amendment gives you a right that should not be  abridged, and suddenly we say, but we are going to have prior restraint  because you might do or say something wrong, we would say that is  ridiculous.   Madam Speaker, today this affront on the Second Amendment is, in  fact, ridiculous. Each piece may seem reasonable, but not in light of  the significance of something enshrined in our Constitution, which is  being systematically attacked by the other side.   Today, we are defending the Second Amendment in a way we have not had  to in a generation. We stand here not because there aren't some  elements that seem reasonable in this legislation, but because at the  end of the day, our friends on the other side of the aisle who are not  willing to support laws that are on the books being enforced and are  not willing to stand behind the law enforcement community that would  like to enforce those, they are affronting and trying to undo the  Second Amendment without a constitutional change.
