 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for  yielding. A good friend in Congress for years, we are so glad to have  the gentleman back.   I also thank Chairman Nadler for leading this legislation, along with  so many others.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1652, the VOCA Fix to  Sustain the Crime Victims Fund Act. I am proud to co-lead this critical  legislation, which will ensure that victims of serious crimes can  continue to access the services that they need to heal and rebuild  their lives.   The Victims of Crime Act, or VOCA, grants are the primary source of  support for programs dedicated to survivors of domestic abuse, sexual  assault, trafficking, child abuse, and other very traumatic crimes.   These grants are funded by Federal criminal monetary penalties, not  by taxpayers. However, with the Department of Justice increasingly  seeking nonprosecution and deferred-prosecution agreements instead of  prosecuting Federal crimes, VOCA grants are facing catastrophic cuts.   In my own home State of Missouri, we are expecting a 25 percent cut  to VOCA funds in the upcoming year if this bill is not signed into law.  Missouri law enforcement and victim service providers, along with  prosecutors, need Congress to enact this legislation so they can  protect and care for their communities.   If we do not act swiftly to stabilize the VOCA funding, thousands of  Americans will be unable to access lifesaving services. These programs  have never been more important. The pandemic has put women and  children, in particular, at an increased risk of abuse and domestic  violence. We cannot leave victims without support during frightening  and vulnerable times.   This bipartisan and bicameral legislation will help those victims  recover as our justice system prosecutes the criminals responsible,  which is why I am also hopeful that when the Senate passes this, we  will have the opportunity to actually make this law.   I am grateful that the House is taking swift action to secure  services for victims. Again, I urge my colleagues to support the VOCA  Fix to Sustain the Crime Victims Fund Act.    Madam Speaker, I rise in stark opposition to H.J. Res.  17, which would retroactively and unconstitutionally remove the  deadline to ratify the equal rights amendment.   Ratification of the equal rights amendment will expand taxpayer- funded abortions and imperil basic pro-life protections that States  have enacted based on the will of their people through their State  legislatures.   I am a committed defender of rights for women and girls, and I have  led efforts in Congress to end sex trafficking, address the rape kit  backlog, and help women balance staying in the workforce and caring for  their children.   As a mother and as a proud grandma, I want my sweet granddaughter to  feel secure in the knowledge that she is entitled to the same rights  and opportunities as men.                                time  1715    However, I cannot support this attempt to circumvent the amendment  process and enshrine access to taxpayer-funded abortion in the  Constitution by a simple majority vote rather than with the required  support of two-thirds of Congress or the States.   Congress has twice given States time to ratify the equal rights  amendment, but the deadline has long since passed. While some States  ratified the ERA after the deadline, others--up to five--have withdrawn  their ratification.   I strongly agree and associate myself with the late Supreme Court  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's words when she made the point: ``If you  count a latecomer on the plus side, how can you disregard States that  said, `We have changed our minds'?''   If Democrats want to test the longstanding bipartisan agreement on  limiting taxpayer-funded abortions, they should follow Justice  Ginsburg's guidance and start the process over, just as our Founders  intended.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I would also like to set the record straight when it  comes to the Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA. My amendment was  removed, in a partisan fashion, from VAWA this Congress, stripping  vital sex trafficking funding for victims, for children. This has  always been included, and it was stripped out and not allowed in the  amendment process. Also not allowed was my PRENDA amendment that would  have stopped sex selection in the womb taking the lives of young girls.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to this legislation.
