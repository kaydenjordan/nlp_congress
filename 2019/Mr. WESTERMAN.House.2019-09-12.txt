 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Alaska for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle proclaim  that they are concerned about the environment, but that does not mean  that I am not concerned about the environment or that my colleagues on  this side of the aisle are not concerned about the environment.   One of our earliest and most recognized conservationists, Gifford  Pinchot, stated that when conflicting interests must be resolved that  we should strive to do the greatest good for the greatest number for  the long run. Pinchot also wrote that conservation is the application  of common sense to the common problems for the common good.   Mr. Chairman, this bill today lacks common sense. I have been to the  North Slope of Alaska. We can develop clean, safe, low-cost energy in  the world and conserve our public lands and the environment. I would  argue that because of our technology and innovation and using clean  fuels like natural gas that has allowed the United States to decrease  our global greenhouse gas emissions more than any other country in the  world.   As we look at this bill today, and we look at the history of what has  happened, in 1980 a Democratic-held Congress passed the Alaska National  Interest Lands Conservation Act, and President Carter signed it into  law. That act set aside more than 1.5 million acres for responsible oil  and gas development in ANWR itself, nearly 20 million acres in total.   Such a large commitment less than a decade after the Arab oil embargo  made logical sense at the time.                                time  0930    However, it took until 2018 for Congress to uphold its word, finally  approving a limited exploration project on 2,000 acres in ANWR. This  constitutes less than one ten-thousandth of the total acreage and one  one-hundredth of the initial exploration.    Mr. Chair, in the face of increasing belligerence from  Russia and China and an unstable Middle East, Members of this House  have a choice. We can choose dirtier foreign energy over responsibly  developing a tiny parcel of land already set aside for production.   That inaction, Mr. Chair, is one that demands common sense. It is in  the common interest to protect domestic energy. Realistically, 2,000  acres is a small price to pay for our security.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote for the greatest good for the  greatest number and to vote for the long run. I urge my colleagues to  vote for common sense and vote ``no'' on H.R. 1146.
