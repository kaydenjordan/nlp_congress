 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut for  all his great work on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1195.   As chair of the Committee on Education and Labor's Workforce  Protections Subcommittee, I work every day to ensure that all workers  are treated with dignity and respect because workers deserve nothing  less. Our labor laws must be held to that same principle.   Unfortunately, our healthcare and social service workers face  disproportionately high rates of violence on the job. We must do  something to address that, and the Workplace Violence Prevention for  Health Care and Social Service Workers Act does just that.   This critical piece of legislation requires that OSHA issue a  workplace violence protection standard for employers in these sectors  in order to actively prevent, address, and track workplace violence  incidents.   We have always relied heavily on the selflessness of healthcare and  social service workers, and that truth has been even clearer during the  COVID pandemic. We must ensure their well-being just as they work  tirelessly every day to ensure ours.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 1195.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record letters from the  American Society of Safety Professionals, who actively support this  bill.                                                 American Society of                                            Safety Professionals,                                                     March 25, 2021.      To: Contacts, Stakeholders and Participants Workplace           Prevention Legislation [HR 1195]      From: Joseph Weiss, ASSP External Affairs      Comments of the American Society of Safety Professionals           (ASSP)--The Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care           and Social Service Workers Act (HR 1309 & S 851)--          Confirming ASSP's Position on HR 1195.        Greetings: The attached statement and comments were       originally submitted by the American Society of Safety       Professionals (ASSP) in support of The Workplace Violence       Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act (HR       1309 & S 851) in April 2019.        We understand this legislation has been reintroduced as HR       1195. Our comments in the April 2019 statement remain current       and reflect our position on HR 1195.        ASSP stands ready to assist with initiatives and endeavors       to help move occupational safety and health forward. Please       contact us if you have any questions regarding our support of       HR 1195.        Thank you for your attention to this matter.            Cordially,                                                      Joseph Weiss,                                             ASSP External Affairs.  [[Page H1855]]                                          ____                                                American Society of                                            Safety Professionals,                                                     April 22, 2019.      Comments of the American Society of Safety Professionals           (ASSP)--The Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care           and Social Service Workers Act (HR 1309 & S 851).       Hon. Alma Adams,      House of Representatives: Committee on Education and Labor,           Chair, Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, U.S.           Congresswoman for the 12th District, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bradley Byrne,      U.S. Congressman for the 1st District, House of           Representative: Subcommittee on Workforce Protections,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Joe Courtney,      U.S. Congressman for the 2nd District,      Washington, DC.        The American Society of Safety Professionals (ASSP) is       pleased to submit the following comments to the House       Education and Labor Committee and the Senate Health Education       Labor and Pensions Committee in support of HR 1309 and S.       851, legislation to help protect workers in the healthcare       and social service sectors from the threat of workplace       violence.        ASSP notes that this legislation has already secured nearly       60 co-sponsors in the House of Representatives and 8       cosponsors in the U.S. Senate. Because we believe that safety       is a nonpartisan issue and that all of us benefit from the       services the workers in these sectors deliver, we encourage       bipartisan support of the legislation and additional public       hearings on this critical issue.        ASSP is the oldest society of safety professionals in the       world. Founded in 1911, ASSP represents more than 38,000       dedicated occupation safety and health (OSH) professionals.       Our members are experts in managing workplace safety and       health issues in every industry, in every state and across       the globe. ASSP is also the Secretariat for various voluntary       consensus standards related to best practices in occupational       safety and health management and training.        In late October 2018, ASSP hosted the Women's Workplace       Safety Summit, and workplace violence involving women was one       of three focus topics of the event. Workplace violence has a       disproportionate impact on women and is the leading cause of       fatalities for workers who are women. ASSP's Women in Safety       Excellence (WISE) Common Interest Group is also deeply       engaged on the issue of workplace violence prevention.        ASSP commends your committees for addressing this issue       through legislation that directs the Secretary of Labor to       issue an OSH standard that requires covered employers within       the healthcare and social service industries to develop and       implement a comprehensive workplace violence prevention plan.       If enacted, the legislation would ensure that enforceable and       effective workplace violence prevention programs would be       required within two years of enactment.        The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)       commenced a rulemaking by initiating a request for       information (RFI) in December 2016: OSHA Request for       Information Concerning Prevention of Workplace Violence in       Healthcare and Social Assistance, OSHA Docket 2016-0014,       Regulatory Information Number (RIN) 1218-AD 08. The comment       period closed April 6, 2017. No further action has occurred       since that date, despite workplace violence becoming an ever-      more recognized hazard in the U.S.        ASSP submitted comments to OSHA on that RFI (at the time,       the organization's name was American Society of Safety       Engineers), and those comments are attached to this       submission, along with an article from our ``HealthBeat''       publication, Preventing Workplace Violence, A Systematic &       Systemic Approach, which was also submitted to the OSHA       docket. We ask that these materials be formally included in       the record on this legislation.        OSHA's November 2018 regulatory agenda included       ``Prevention of Workplace Violence in Health Care and Social       Assistance'' as a future item with a small business panel       (pursuant to the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement       Fairness Act) slated for March 2019. However, that date is       now past with no action indicated any time in the foreseeable       future. The next regulatory agenda will reveal whether any       further action is anticipated by the agency within the next       12 months to move toward promulgation of a workplace violence       standard.        Barring any movement from the agency in this regard, it is       appropriate for Congress--in its oversight role--to signal to       OSHA that this is a priority rulemaking area, and for your       committees to take the lead on helping to fill the gaps in       protections for the many vulnerable workers in this highrisk       area.        Currently, OSHA can take enforcement actions against       employers under its General Duty Clause (GDC) [Section       5(a)(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970]       and can issue penalties of up to $132,598 per willful or       repeated violation. However, OSHA has the burden of providing       that the cited employer was aware of a recognized hazard,       that employees were actually exposed to the hazard within the       previous six months and that there is a feasible method of       abatement.        GDC citations are often difficult for the agency to       sustain, they cannot trigger criminal prosecution even in the       case of a fatality, and there is no coverage for third-party       workers such as contractors or temporary staffers. This is       one exception to OSHA's multiemployer worksite enforcement       policy. In 2015, OSHA issued ``Guidelines for Preventing       Workplace Violence for Healthcare and Social Service       Workers,'' but the guidance did not go through formal       rulemaking so it is advisory and not enforceable at the       present time.        Another problem with using the GDC as the main enforcement       tool to address workplace violence issues is simply that it       is reactive in virtually every situation. While OSHA       investigates fatalities and cases with severe injuries that       must be reported by law, it is virtually unheard of for OSHA       to investigate an employer concerning workplace violence       prevention before a tragic incident occurs, unless triggered       by a publicized ``near miss'' or due to an employee hazard       complaint.        While the federal Occupational Safety and Health Review       Commission recently affirmed a GDC workplace violence       violation issued against Integra Health Management (March 4,       2019, OSHRC), the action was taken only after the death of a       healthcare worker at the hands of a patient, and the ultimate       OSHA civil penalty was $7,000. The case is still subject to       appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals and amici curiae in the       case include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (opposing the       enforcement action) and the AFL-CIO (in support of the OSHA       citation). ASSP is not a party to this action.        A Government Accountability Office study reported that       there were 730,000 cases of healthcare workplace assaults       over the       5-year span from 2009 through 2013. The Bureau of Labor       Statistics reports that healthcare and social service sector       employees suffered 69 percent of all workplace violence       injuries caused by persons in 2016 and are nearly 5 times as       likely to suffer a workplace violence injury than workers       overall.        The healthcare and social service industries experience the       highest rates, with workplace violence injury rates for this       sector at 8.2 per 10,000 full-time workers, more than four       times higher than the overall private sector incidence rate       for such injuries. This is simply unacceptable when       interventions are available to mitigate risk. As noted in       ASSP's 2016 comments to OSHA, we believe that a workplace       violence prevention standard is feasible and that there are       measures that employers can use to reduce a significant risk       of material harm.        Finally, ASSP observes that many of the at-risk workers in       the healthcare and social service sectors are employed in the       public sector, by state or local government facilities or       agencies. Currently, they have no protections under the       federal Occupational Safety and Health Act. The states that       operate their own OSHA agencies must cover their public       sector workers (and several state governmental agencies in       federal OSHA states also cover the safety of their public       sector workers), but most workers go without OSHA protection.       We urge you to consider including public sector coverage of       healthcare and social service workers in this legislation to       the extent possible.                                  Conclusion         ASSP condemns all forms of violence in the workplace and is       particularly concerned with the rise of injuries associated       with violence in the healthcare and social service industry       sectors, targeted by the pending federal legislation. ASSP       supports congressional efforts to eliminate workplace       violence and encourages OSHA to continue with its rulemaking       to promulgate an enforceable and effective standard,       accompanied by comprehensive education and outreach.        Thank you for consideration of ASSP's comments. We look       forward to working with Congress in a proactive manner to       address the critical issues affecting the health and safety       of all Americans in the workplace.            Respectfully Submitted,                                            Rixio Medina, CSP, CPP,                                            2018-19 ASSP President.
