 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 238.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 238, the Commodity End-User Relief Act.   The Commodity End-User Relief Act is a bipartisan bill to reauthorize  the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to make much-needed  regulatory reforms, and, most importantly, to make statutory changes to  protect end users and give them access to the tools they need to manage  their risks.   Over the past 4 years, the House Committee on Agriculture has held  almost two dozen hearings that have examined the Commission and have  investigated the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act on derivatives markets.  Our witnesses, many of whom were market participants who were  struggling to comply with burdensome rules and ambiguous portions of  the underlying statute, were consistent in their call for relief. To  address their concerns, H.R. 238 makes reforms that fall into three  broad categories: customer protections, Commission reforms, and end- user relief.   Title I of the bill protects customers and the margin funds they  deposit at their Futures Commission Merchants by codifying critical  changes made during the collapse and bankruptcies of MF Global and  Peregrine Financial Group.   Title II makes meaningful reforms to the operations of the Commission  to improve the agency's deliberative process. In doing so, it also  requires the Commission to conduct more thorough and robust cost- benefit analysis to help get future rulemakings right the first time.  While the CFTC is already required to consider costs and benefits of  the rules it proposes, its work has been called into question by the  CFTC's inspector general, who reported the Commission staff seemed to  view the process as more of a legal one than an economic one.   End users are the businesses that provide Americans with food,  clothing, transportation, electricity, heat, and much more. Companies  that produce, consume, and transport the commodities that make modern  life possible use futures and swaps markets to reduce the uncertainty  that their businesses face. Farmers hedge their crops in the spring so  they know what they will get paid in the fall. Utilities hedge the  price of energy so they can charge customers at a steady rate.  Manufacturers hedge the cost of steel, energy, and other inputs to lock  in prices as they work to fill orders.   The fact is that no end user played any part in the financial crisis,  and no end user currently poses a systemic risk to U.S. derivative  markets. Yet, as the Agriculture Committee heard in countless hours of  testimony, today it is more difficult and more expensive for them to  manage their risks than it was for them 5 years ago. Some of these  challenges are the result of ambiguities and oversights in the text of  the Commodity Exchange Act, and some of them result from overzealous  rulemakings by the Commission itself.   Today's legislation fixes statutory problems, like section 304, which  amends the definition of ``financial entity'' to ensure that some end  users don't lose their clearing exemption simply because a hedging  strategy makes up for losses in a physical transaction; or like section  315, which makes small changes to the swaps' core principles to align  them with conventions in the swaps industry, rather than the futures  industry, easing compliance burdens for these newly regulated entities.   It also fixes problems that have grown out of the CFTC's own  rulemakings. For example, section 308 sets aside a Commission rule that  would automatically lower the transaction threshold triggering  registration as a swap dealer. This costly, complex registration  process was intended for large financial institutions, but because this  registration threshold was set arbitrarily, it has swept up some  commodity firms as well.   If the limits fall by 60 percent next year, it could sweep up to 100  more firms into the reach of Dodd-Frank. H.R. 238 would fix the level  at its current $8 billion unless the Commission proposes a new rule  with evidence of a needed reduction. Similarly, section 313 exempts  religious pension plans and university endowments from a new rule that  requires them to register as commodity pool operators simply because  they use standardized hedging products.   What H.R. 238 does not do is roll back a single core tenet of title  VII of Dodd-Frank. It does not change the execution, clearing,  margining, capital, or reporting frameworks set up by that Act.                                time  1245    In fact, not a single witness who appeared before the House Committee  on Agriculture ever asked us to fundamentally upend these principles.  These are concepts that have been part of the swaps markets long before  the financial reform happened. The Committee, the Commission, and the  industry will continue to grapple with the details of these core  tenets, seeking to provide the right mix of flexibility and oversight.   Before I close, I would like to thank members of the Agriculture  Committee who sat through all these hearings and all the markups on  this issue. Chairman Austin Scott and Ranking Member David Scott, two  of my cosponsors on this legislation, have led most of the Committee's  hearings on these issues, and they have done great work.   Together, we have put forward a bipartisan bill that makes narrowly  targeted changes to provide relief from regulatory burdens on American  businesses. The Commodity End-User Relief Act offers meaningful  improvements for market participants without undermining the basic  goals of title VII of Dodd-Frank, and it does so by providing the right  relief to the right people.   I urge support of the Commodity End-User Relief Act with all its  amendments, and I include for the Record letters of support from over  30 groups.

Hon. K. Michael Conaway,      Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Conaway: I write with respect to H.R. 238,       the ``Commodity End-User Relief Act.'' As a result of your       having consulted with us on provisions within H.R. 238 that       fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the       Judiciary, I forego any further consideration of this bill so       that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for       consideration.

Dear Member of the House of Representatives: The       undersigned organizations represent a very broad cross-      section of U.S. production agriculture and agribusiness. We       urge you to cast an affirmative vote on H.R. 238, the       ``Commodity End-User Relief Act,'' when it moves to the floor       for consideration.        This legislation contains a number of important provisions       for agricultural and agribusiness hedgers who use futures and       swaps to manage their business and production risks. Some,       but certainly not all, of the bill's important provisions       include:        Sections 101-103--Codify important customer protections to       help prevent another MF Global situation.        Section 104--Provides a permanent solution to the residual       interest problem that would have put more customer funds at       risk--and potentially driven farmers, ranchers and small       hedgers out of futures markets--by forcing pre-margining of       their hedge accounts.        Section 306--Relief from burdensome and technologically       infeasible recordkeeping requirements in commodity markets.        Section 308--Requires the CFTC to conduct a study and issue       a rule before reducing the de minimis threshold for swap       dealer registration in order to make sure that doing so would       not harm market liquidity and end-user access to markets.        Section 311--Confirms the intent of Dodd-Frank that       anticipatory hedging is considered bona fide hedging       activity.        Thank you in advance for your support of this bill that is       so important to U.S. farmers, ranchers, hedgers and futures       customers.            Sincerely,        American Cotton Shippers Association, American Farm Bureau       Federation, American Feed Industry Association, American       Soybean Association, Grain and Feed Association of Illinois,       Kansas Grain and Feed Association, Michigan Agri-Business       Association, Michigan Bean Shippers, National Association of       Wheat Growers, National Cattlemen's Beef Association,       National Corn Growers Association, National Cotton Council.

Hon. Mike Conaway,      Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Conaway: The American Gas Association (AGA)       supports the Commodity End-User Relief Act (H.R. 238), a bill       to reauthorize the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) that would       improve Commodity Future Trading Commission (CFTC) operations       and provide much-needed marketplace certainty and regulatory       relief for natural gas utilities and the American homes and       businesses to which they deliver natural gas.        The American Gas Association (AGA), founded in 1918,       represents more than 200 local energy companies that deliver       clean natural gas throughout the United States. There are       more than 72 million residential, commercial and industrial       natural gas customers in the U.S., of which 95 percent--just       under 69 million customers--receive their gas from AGA       members. AGA is an advocate for natural gas utility companies       and their customers and provides a broad range of programs       and services for member natural gas pipelines, marketers,       gatherers, international natural gas companies and industry       associates. Today, natural gas meets more than one-fourth of       the United States' energy needs.        H.R. 238 will benefit our industry by exempting end-user       physical contracts from ``swaps'' and ``options'' regulation       more applicable to sophisticated financial derivative       transactions. Specifically, HR 238 would clarify that       contracts containing delivery terms with volumetric       optionality, but intended to result in the physical delivery       of natural gas, will not be treated by the CFTC as swaps.       Currently, the CFTC has provided some guidance on how       physical natural gas contracts with volumetric optionality       are to be reviewed for regulatory treatment, but considerable       confusion and uncertainty still exists. This uncertainty has       caused concern regarding the impact on the willingness of gas       suppliers to offer flexible delivery volume terms, leaving       gas utilities with fewer delivery options and more expensive       contracts--costs ultimately passed to the consumer. HR 238       provides needed regulatory certainty to the physical natural       gas marketplace, as requested by AGA and other industry       stakeholders for several years.        H.R. 238 will also help the CFTC become a more responsive       and well-equipped regulator by subjecting its rulemakings to       administrative process reforms and judicial review. Current       CFTC administrative rulemaking procedures are vague and       provide insufficient avenues for the public to participate in       and seek guidance on rulemakings. This bill would require the       CFTC to comply with the Administrative Procedures Act to       ensure public notice-and-comment on rules or guidance that       have legally-binding effects.        Finally, H.R. 238 would allow the federal appellate courts       to directly review CFTC  [[Page H407]]       rules, replacing the protracted and expensive trial court       process currently in effect as the default rule for judicial       review. This change will not increase litigation nor will it       disrupt the CFTC. Rather, it will incentivize the CFTC to       write better rules and avoid challenge altogether. Also, any       inevitable legal challenges will be more swiftly decided by       appellate courts, benefitting the regulator and the regulated       community. All of the key federal rulemaking agencies are       subject to direct appellate review--including the Securities       Exchange Commission and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.       There is no logical justification to treat the CFTC       differently.        Congress certainly did not intend to provide the CFTC a       large new regulatory mandate without giving it the necessary       guidance and authority to do its job. Furthermore, Congress       did not intend for the CEA to constrain liquidity in the       physical natural gas marketplace, create business-changing       impacts on regulated natural gas utilities, or increase the       costs of reliable service for natural gas consumers. As such,       AGA supports the Commodity End-User Relief Act because it       provides the CFTC with the tools necessary to be a responsive       regulator and restores the regulatory confidence that natural       gas utilities rely on to procure natural gas supplies at the       lowest reasonable cost for the benefit of America's natural       gas consumers.            Sincerely,                                                    George Lowe,                                    Vice President, Federal Affairs,      American Gas Association.                                   ____                                  American Public PowerTM                                                     Association,                                    Arlington, VA, January 10, 2017.      Hon. K. Michael Conaway,      Hon. Collin C. Peterson,      Committee on Agriculture, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Conaway and Ranking Member Peterson: On       behalf of the American Public Power Association (APPA), I am       writing in support of H.R. 238, the Commodity End-User Relief       Act (CERA) of 2017. The legislation includes important relief       for public power utilities and other end-users seeking to use       swaps to hedge commercial-operations risks.        Community-owned, not-for-profit public power utilities       power homes and businesses in 2,000 communities --from small       towns to large cities. They safely provide reliable, low-cost       electricity to more than 49 million Americans, while       protecting the environment. These utilities generate or buy       electricity from diverse sources. They employ 93,000 people       and earn $58 billion in revenue each year. Public power       supports local commerce and jobs and invests back into the       community.        Public power utilities use swaps, options, forward       contracts and other tools to manage commercial operations       risks. As not-for-profit entities, their goal is to provide       affordable and reliable power to customers. APPA supports the       market clarity and oversight provided by the Commodity       Exchange Act (CEA), and supports appropriately funding the       Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). To date,       however, implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to       the CEA shows clear short-comings.        CERA would address these concerns, for example, by       codifying CFTC rules allowing public power utilities to enter       swaps with the full array of counterparties to swaps needed       to hedge their commercial operations risks. CERA would also       address issues related to the definition of ``bona fide       hedging,'' swap reporting in illiquid markets, and forward       contracts with volumetric optionality. These provisions would       help public power utilities and other commercial end users.        On the whole, we believe these provisions will ensure that       public power utilities can continue to make full use of       financial tools necessary to keep electric power prices       stable and affordable to our customers.        Thank for your time and consideration.            Sincerely,                                                    Susan N. Kelly,      President & CEO.                                   ____                                          Chamber of Commerce of The                                        United States of America,                                   Washington, DC, January 11, 2017.        To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The       U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly supports H.R. 238, the       ``Commodity End-User Relief Act.'' H.R. 238 would reauthorize       the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') and enact       a number of important reforms to provide regulatory relief       for end users of the derivatives market. It would also       promote accountability at the CFTC and protect Main Street       businesses from onerous and unintended consequences of       derivatives regulation.        The Chamber supports several amendments being offered to       H.R. 238. Specifically, the Chamber supports Congressman       Lucas' amendment to provide relief to Main Street businesses       by clarifying the treatment of interaffiliate swaps. The       amendment would drive down the cost of using derivatives by       end-users and help Main Street businesses employ safe and       effective risk management strategies on a more cost-effective       basis.        The Chamber also supports the amendment sponsored by       Congressman Duffy and Congressman Scott to clarify that the       CFTC shall not have the authority to access proprietary       source code without a subpoena. Their amendment would protect       highly sensitive intellectual property, which would respect       established due process rights and ensure that proprietary       source code does not fall into the wrong hands as a result of       a cyberattack or wrongdoing.        Finally, as the bill moves forward, the Chamber urges       consideration of how best to address the cross-border       regulation of derivatives. We strongly believe that H.R. 238       should appropriately reflect the potential impact of punitive       or excessive cross-border rules on Main Street businesses       seeking to prudently hedge their commercial and market risks,       both in the U.S. and abroad. We look forward to continuing to       work with the sponsors of H.R. 238 on this issue as the bill       moves forward.        The Chamber commends the House of Representatives for       prioritizing regulatory reform in the 115th Congress and       urges the House to approve H.R. 238 and the amendments listed       above as expeditiously as possible.            Sincerely,      Jack Howard.                                   ____                                                  Church Alliance,                                                    January 9, 2017.                                              Hon. Michael Conaway,      Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Conaway: On behalf of the Church Alliance, I       write to thank you for your leadership on H.R. 238, the       ``Commodity End-User Relief Act.''        The Church Alliance is a coalition of the chief executive       officers of 37 church benefit programs. It includes mainline       Protestant denominations, two branches of Judaism, and       Catholic dioceses, schools and institutions. The benefit       programs (``church plans'') provide retirement and health       benefits to more than 1 million clergy, lay workers, and       their family members.        H.R. 238 contains a provision expanding the church plan       exemption from the commodity pool operator (``CPO'') and       commodity trading advisor (``CTA'') rules under the Commodity       Exchange Act (``CEA'') to include church plan-related       accounts, such as endowments or foundations of churches and       church-controlled nonprofits. The provision was included by a       bipartisan, broadly-supported amendment during the House       Agriculture Committee's consideration of CFTC reauthorization       legislation in the 114th Congress.        Under current law, church plans are generally exempt from       the CPO and CTA requirements; however, the exemption does not       include church plan-related accounts. Church benefits boards       often use investment managers or advisers that engage in       commodities transactions for the purposes of diversification       and hedging. Church benefits boards also have the ability to       pool plan assets with other church-related funds purely for       investment management purposes for the benefit of the church.       This reduces investment fees for church-related entities, as       well as benefit plan participants by providing economies of       scale.        In contrast to the CEA and implementing regulations, the       securities laws contain necessary exemptions for church plans       and church plan-related accounts for the same reason noted       above. Under these laws, church plans are not required to       register or report as investment companies, register       securities held, or disclose information about the securities       they hold.        H.R. 238 similarly exempts church plans and church plan-      related accounts from the commodity pool definition and from       CTA registration requirements. The exemptions would provide       parity between securities and commodities laws concerning       church plans and church plan-related accounts. Additionally,       the exemptions would reduce the cost to church plans and       would ensure they have the full benefit of commodities       investments that provide diversification, opportunities to       hedge, and returns. The ultimate benefit would be to clergy       and church lay worker participants in the retirement and       welfare plans, who have devoted their lives to the work of       the church.        We respectfully urge the enactment of CFTC reauthorization       legislation which includes much-needed relief for church       plans and church-plan related accounts from the CPO and CTA       requirements, along the lines of H.R. 238, as soon as       possible. Thank you for your leadership and support on this       important issue.            Sincerely yours,      Barbara A. Boigegrain.                                   ____                                        Commodity Markets Council,                                    Washington, DC, January 9, 2017.      Chairman Mike Conaway,      House Committee on Agriculture,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Conaway: We, the Commodity Markets Council       (CMC), write in support of H.R. 238, a bill to reauthorize       the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'').        CMC is a trade association that brings together exchanges       and their industry counterparts. Its members include       commercial end-users that utilize the futures and swaps       markets for agriculture, energy, metal, and soft commodities.       Its industry member firms also include regular users and       members of swap execution facilities (each, a ``SEF'') as       well as designated contract markets (each, a ``DCM''), such       as the Chicago Board of Trade, Chicago Mercantile Exchange,       ICE Futures US, Minneapolis Grain Exchange, NASDAQ  [[Page H408]]       Futures, and the New York Mercantile Exchange. Along with       these market participants, CMC members also include regulated       derivatives exchanges.        The businesses of all CMC members depend upon the efficient       and competitive functioning of the risk management products       traded on DCMs, SEFs, and over-the-counter (``OTC'') markets.       As a result, CMC is well-positioned to provide a consensus       view of commercial end-users on the impact of the       Commission's proposed regulations on derivatives markets. Its       comments, however, represent the collective view of CMC's       members, including end-users, intermediaries, exchanges, and       benchmark providers.        CMC urges you to support this legislation to reauthorize       the CFTC because the bill contains clarifications similar to       those in H.R. 2289, the Commodity End-User Relief Act, from       the last Congressional session (114th Congress), which passed       the House Agriculture Committee and the U.S. House of       Representatives with bipartisan support. We believe the       provisions in this legislation would go a long way to       addressing the unintended consequences Main Street businesses       have suffered as a result of derivatives regulation intended       for Wall Street.        Many of the fixes in this legislation are urgently needed       to stop upcoming initiatives that will greatly harm end-users       and drastically reduce the economic efficiency of hedges.       Although the CFTC has recently made great strides in       addressing end-users' concerns, some of the remedies needed       can only be addressed by Congress.        We respectfully request your support for these non-      controversial fixes that are of such importance to end-users.       Thank you for your consideration and your continued       leadership.            Sincerely,                                                        Gregg Doud,      President, Commodity Markets Council.                                   ____                                        Edison Electric Institute,                                                    January 9, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Michael Conaway,      Chairman, House Agriculture Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Collin Peterson,      Ranking Member, House Agriculture Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Leader Pelosi, Chairman Conaway, and       Ranking Member Peterson: On behalf of the member companies of       the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), I want to express our       strong support for H.R. 238, the Commodity End-User Relief       Act. Key provisions in the legislation provide additional       certainty and clarify congressional intent on a number of       issues of significant importance to EEI members.        EEI is the association of U.S. investor-owned electric       companies. EEI's members provide electricity for 220 million       Americans, operate in all 50 states and the District of       Columbia, and directly and indirectly create jobs for more       than 1 million Americans. With more than $100 billion in       annual capital expenditures, the electric power industry is       responsible for providing safe, reliable, affordable, and       sustainable electricity that powers the economy and enhances       the lives of all Americans.        EEI members are non-financial entities that participate in       the physical commodity market and rely on swaps and futures       contracts primarily to hedge and mitigate their commercial       risk. The goal of our member companies is to provide their       customers with reliable electric service at affordable and       stable rates, which has a direct and significant impact on       literally every area of the U.S. economy. Since wholesale       electricity and natural gas historically have been two of the       most volatile commodity groups, our member companies place a       strong emphasis on managing the price volatility inherent in       these wholesale commodity markets to the benefit of their       customers. The derivatives market has proven to be an       extremely effective tool in insulating our customers from       this risk and price volatility. In sum, our members are the       quintessential commercial end-users of swaps.        As such, regulations that make effective risk management       options more costly for end-users of swaps will likely result       in higher and more volatile energy prices for retail,       commercial, and industrial customers. H.R. 238 goes a long       way in providing much needed regulatory relief and even       greater clarity to the compliance landscape facing EEI and       the entire end-user community going forward.        Thank you for your leadership on these important issues. We       look forward to working with you to advance this legislation       through the House.            Sincerely,                                                    Thomas R. Kuhn.     Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Crawford), who is the subcommittee chairman for the  General Farm Commodities and Risk Management Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Davis), who is the subcommittee chairman for the  Subcommittee on Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out for the Record  that over the past two fiscal years, since 2013, the CFTC has received  a 29 percent increase in funding. It has gone from $194 million to its  current level of $250 million. I think you would be hard-pressed to  find any other agency throughout this government that has gotten a 29  percent increase in its resources over that timeframe.   I now yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs.  Hartzler), a valuable member of the Ag Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I am proud to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), another valuable member of the  Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out for the Record  that the cost-benefit analysis rules in this bill are modeled after  Executive Order 13563, which President Obama signed into the executive  order status, and they are forward-looking. Nothing in our bill would  require what might be a much-needed re-look at the Dodd-Frank rules  done in the past. The cost-benefit analysis would require any future  rulemaking to comply.   I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa),  another valuable member of the Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is left  on both sides.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott), who is the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit.    I have no further speakers.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to who has the right to  close?    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As I close, I want to remind us of the need to act today. But before  I do, I also want to thank the ranking member. While we may vote  differently on this bill, he and I generally work well together on a  myriad of issues that face not only production agriculture, but rural  America as well, and I thank him for his work, even though we may not  vote exactly the same way today.   Over the past 4 years, the Committee on Agriculture heard dozens of  witnesses about the upheaval end users have been facing while trying to  use derivative markets in the wake of the post-crisis financial  reforms. While this Congress took affirmative steps in Dodd-Frank to  protect end users from harm, today it is clear that there is still work  to be done. have been facing while trying to use derivative markets in  the wake of the post-crisis financial reforms. While this Congress took  affirmative steps in Dodd-Frank to protect end users from harm, today  it is clear that there is still work to be done.    It isn't enough to simply raise these issues and hope that the CFTC  will take care of them for us--for one, sometimes they cannot. There  are numerous small oversights in the statute that have big implications  for end users that we must correct in this legislation.   Currently, the CEA defines some utility companies as financial  entities, stripping them of their status as end users. The Commission  can't fix this.   The core principles for SEFs, which were added to the CEA by Dodd- Frank, were lifted almost word for word from the core principles for  futures exchanges, even though swaps exchanges and futures exchanges  operate completely differently and SEFs cannot perform many of the  functions of a futures exchange. The Commission cannot fix this.   Certainly, the Commission can and has tried to paper over these  problems, issuing staff letters explaining how it will deal with  incongruities in the law. But that isn't good enough. We know the  problems. We should fix them, and fix them now.   Sometimes, though, the problem isn't the statute. There are a number  of end-user issues that we have heard testimony about which the CFTC  will not fix, because the Commission simply disagrees with Congress  about how to apply the law. We know these problems also.   The Commission has promulgated a rule that reduces the transaction  threshold to be considered a swap dealer from $8 billion to $3 billion,  a 60 percent decline, while it is still studying the matter. We should  require that the CFTC complete the study and have a public vote on that  matter.   The Commission has proposed a new method of granting bona fide hedge  exemptions that is significantly narrower than the current method,  upending longstanding hedging conventions for market participants. This  proposal has the added disadvantage of being dramatically more labor  intensive for the Commission. We should insist that historic hedging  practices be protected.   The Commission has issued a new rule on ownership, control, and  reporting that it knows isn't working. They have delayed its  implementation for over 3 years by continuing to parcel out temporary  reprieves. We should insist the Commission amend the rule so that  market participants know definitively what their compliance obligations  are.   The definition of swap does not exclude transactions that are wholly  contained within a single company and not market facing. Regulators  have used this leeway to require businesses and financial institutions  to follow rules that are, quite frankly, inappropriate for risk  management purposes and costly for the companies to use them. We should  amend the statute, to make it clear that inter-affiliate transactions  should not be regulated the same way as publicly transacted swaps.   The challenges facing businesses who hedge their risks in derivatives  markets are real. Today we have an opportunity to fix some of those  problems. Every dollar that a business can save by better managing its  risk is a dollar available to grow that business, pay higher wages, and  lower costs to consumers or protect investors.   Over the past week, over 30 organizations representing thousands of  American businesses have voiced their support for the important reforms  in the Commodity End-User Relief Act. Businesses from farm country to  major manufacturers, to public utilities need every tool available to  manage their businesses and reduce the uncertainties they face each day  in today's global economy.   I urge my colleagues to support the Commodity End-User Relief Act,  protect these companies, and ensure that they have the tools they need  to compete in a global economy.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the following letters  of support for H.R. 238:                                                   January 11, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: FIA supports H.R. 238,       the ``Commodity End User Relief Act''. Notably, this       legislation reauthorizes the Commodity Futures Trading       Commission (CFTC), which has been without statutory       authorization for almost four years. In addition to       reauthorizing the CFTC, Congress has historically taken the       opportunity of reauthorization to periodically review and       enhance the CFTC's authorities. This is essential in a       regulatory environment where the marketplace is extremely       dynamic. Given the constantly evolving structure to which       these regulatory authorities apply, it is prudent for       Congress to consider updating the statute in response to       market changes. We commend the House Committee on Agriculture       for efforts to build upon previous work and advance this       legislation.        H.R. 238 contains prudent internal risk controls to       safeguard market data and improved customer protections       sought by the market participants who rely on derivatives to       manage their risks. These are examples of policy enhancements       that have garnered tremendous favor in recent years as       evidenced by the bi-partisan support they have received in       previous Congressional sessions.        As noted above, the constant evolution of the markets       regulated by the CFTC has advanced even since the last time       the House of Representatives passed similar legislation,       which warrants the introduction of new statutory updates       expected to be offered as floor amendments. In particular,       FIA would like to lend our support to the bi-partisan Duffy/      Scott amendment protecting critical intellectual property       that is key to the innovative culture in the United States.       Additionally, we commend Congresswoman Hartzler for her       amendment recognizing the need to improve the quality of       information submitted for the Commission's surveillance and       large trader reporting programs.        We look forward to seeing this effort advance to the Senate       where we expect to have continued dialogue on refinements.            Sincerely,      President and CEO.                                   ____           International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.,                                  Washington, DC, January 11, 2015.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: We are writing to       express the International Swaps and Derivatives Association,       Inc.'s (``ISDA'') support for H.R. 238, the Commodity End-      User Relief Act. The legislation was introduced on January 4,       2017.        Since 1985, ISDA has worked to make the global derivatives       markets safer and more efficient. Today, ISDA has over 850       member institutions from 66 countries. These members comprise       a broad range of derivatives market participants, including       corporations, investment managers, government and       supranational entities, insurance companies, energy and       commodities firms, and international and regional banks. In       addition to market participants, members also include key       components of the derivatives market infrastructure, such as       exchanges, intermediaries, clearing houses and repositories,       as well as law firms, accounting firms and other service       providers. Information about ISDA and its activities is       available on the Association's web site: www.isda.org.  H.R. 238 would codify new regulatory customer protections       and enhance oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading       Commission. The Commodity End-User Relief Act would also ease       the regulatory burdens placed on end-users. These are       measures that ISDA supports.        Please also note that, while ISDA appreciates and supports       the Commodity End-User Relief Act, we look forward to working       with Congress to ensure that the cross-border provisions of       the bill are further addressed during the course of the       legislative process.        ISDA urges you to vote for H.R. 238. Thank you for your       consideration of our views. If you have any questions, please       do not hesitate to contact our Head of US Public Policy       Christopher Young.            Sincerely,                                                     Scott O'Malia,      Chief Executive Officer.                                   ____                                            The Jewish Federations,                                                of North America,                                    Washington DC, January 11, 2017.      Hon. K. Michael Conaway,      Chairman, House Agriculture Committee, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Conaway: The Jewish Federations of North       America (JFNA) is writing to express our support for H.R.       238, the ``Commodity End-User Relief Act.'' We are       particularly supportive of section 313 of the bill which       provides for the exemption of qualified charitable       organizations from designation and regulation as commodity       pool operators.        JFNA is the national organization that represents and       serves 149 Jewish Federations across the United States and       North America. In their communities, Jewish Federations and       related Jewish community foundations serve as the central       address for fundraising and support for an extensive network       of Jewish health, education and social services in their       area. Part of the charitable mission of Jewish federations       and Jewish community foundations is to help grow the       endowment assets of their organizations as well as those of       related Jewish agencies and synagogues who have entrusted       their endowment funds with them. This is accomplished through       pooling investment assets to maximize financial return,       minimize cost and risk, and take advantage of investment       expertise and economies of scale. Increased endowment dollars       translate into more current support of essential program       activities as well as helping to assure the long-term       viability of Jewish organizations and institutions. The       enactment of H.R. 238 will harmonize the registration       exemptions between securities and commodities laws and       regulations and exempt qualified charities from registering       their pooled funds as commodity pools or as commodity pool       operators. This exemption will eliminate confusion, spare       needless legal costs, and ensure that such organizations as       Jewish federations and foundations can continue to invest in       widely diversified instruments in order to maximize returns       to their beneficiaries who use such investment income to       provide additional social services to the most needy among       us.        Thank you again for efforts to ensure the enactment of the       Commodity End-User Relief Act. JFNA and the federation system       stand ready to help you in any way to achieve this important       goal. If you have any questions regarding JFNA and its       involvement in this issue I urge you to contact Steven Woolf,       JFNA Senior Tax Policy Counsel.            Sincerely,                                              William C. Daroff,                           Senior Vice President for Public Policy &      Director, of the Washington Office.                                   ____                                                            NRECA,                                    Arlington, VA, January 10, 2017.      Hon. Mike Conaway,      Chairman, House Committee on Agriculture, Washington, DC.      Hon. Collin Peterson,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Agriculture, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Conaway and Ranking Member Peterson: The       National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA)       supports the Commodity End User Relief Act (H.R. 238),       legislation to reauthorize the Commodity Futures Trading       Commission (CFTC) to be considered on the House floor this       week.        NRECA is the national service organization representing       over 900 not-for-profit, member-owned, rural electric       cooperative systems, which serve 42 million customers in 47       states. NRECA estimates that cooperatives own and maintain       2.5 million miles or 42 percent of the nation's electric       distribution lines covering three-quarters of the nation's       landmass. Cooperatives serve approximately 18 million       businesses, homes, farms, schools and other establishments in       2,500 of the nation's 3,141 counties.        Electric cooperatives are commercial end-users and not       financial entities. NRECA believes that Congressional       oversight is essential to help ensure that the CFTC is       implementing the Dodd-Frank Act as Congress intended. To that       end, NRECA supports H.R. 238 as a means to ensure that       resources at the CFTC are prioritized to protect against       systemic risk to our financial system, and to regulate swap       dealers and large traders, and not fruitlessly focused on the       everyday commodity transactions with which end-users hedge       commercial risks arising from ongoing business operations.        Importantly, H.R. 238 amends the Commodity Exchange Act       (CEA) in a very narrow but critical way: to clarify       Congressional intent that the CFTC shall not regulate as       ``swaps'' nonfinancial commodity contracts that are intended       to be physically settled, whether those contracts are forward       contracts or commodity trade options. Our members use these       physical contracts to manage supply and demand for energy       resources, and to keep the lights on for American businesses       and consumers. NRECA is also particularly interested in H.R.       238 language that reduces onerous recordkeeping requirements,       as well as a codified resolution to the utility special       entity requirement that would otherwise negatively impact       such utilities and their customers.        NRECA appreciates the Committee's continued work on CFTC       reauthorization legislation this Congress, and urges Members       of Congress to support H.R. 238 when it is considered by the       House of Representatives.            Sincerely,                                                      Jim Matheson,                                                        CEO, NRECA.  [[Page H414]]                                          ____                                                        SIFMA,                                   Washington, DC, January 10, 2017.      Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: SIFMA and its member       firms support H.R. 238, Commodity End-User Relief Act,       bipartisan legislation that seeks to reauthorize the       Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to better protect       swaps customers, provide market certainty for end-users, and       make basic reforms to improve the functioning of the CFTC.        SIFMA also supports the inter-affiliate amendment sponsored       by Rep. Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), which includes language to       clarify exemptions from swap rules, as well as requirements       for reporting, risk management, and anti-evasion as it       relates to such transactions.        Further, SIFMA appreciates efforts to establish a workable       framework for cross-border regulation of derivatives       transactions. We look forward to continuing to work with the       Committee in an effort to consider this important issue.       SIFMA urges you to vote for H.R. 238. Thank you for your       consideration of our views.            Sincerely,                                                      Andy Blocker,                            EVP, Public Policy and Advocacy, SIFMA.     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this is a pretty straightforward  amendment. It proposes certain technical corrections within the bills.  This would have normally been handled by the Rules Committee without  need for a particular amendment, but because, as I said yesterday, the  language of H.R. 238 is the exact language out of last year's June 15  bill, except for things that we dropped and limiting the appropriations  to $250 million.   So, in the spirit of total transparency, I bring this amendment  forward so the full body can work its will on this technical correction  that would have normally been fixed by the Rules Committee.    I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment I offer today will clarify  amendments made to the Commodity Exchange Act by Dodd-Frank and require  the CFTC to actually determine that position limits will, in fact, help  reduce excessive speculation before they implement those new rules.   This past fall, my colleagues and I all ran for reelection promising  to reduce government regulation and eliminate rules that needlessly  burden the economy. As we consider the CFTC's ongoing work, we should  look no further than the position limits rulemaking to begin that task.   Position limits are a tool that have merit and purpose in regulating  the commodities market. Today, designated contract markets core  principle V requires every U.S. exchange to impose, as is necessary and  appropriate, position limits or position accountability levels on the  contracts they offer.   Further, there are several agricultural contracts that have long- established and well understood federally mandated position limits. My  amendment will not change any of those existing position limits regime.   Prior to Dodd-Frank, the law was clear: if the Commission wanted to  impose position limits, it first had to make a determination that such  limits would diminish, eliminate, or prevent the burdens of excessive  speculation. Post-Dodd-Frank, the courts have ruled that additions to  the statute have rendered it ambiguous.   Chairman Massad and I have disagreed for the past 3 years about how  to read the statute. So today, my amendment fixes the ambiguity by  affirmatively requiring the Commission to determine that position  limits will serve to reduce the burdens of excessive speculation before  they put them in place.   It is important that the Commission affirmatively determines the need  for position limits because limits are an unmistakable burden on market  participants.   The current position limits proposal will cost market participants  substantially in time and money to comply with. Most importantly, it  fundamentally changes the way hedgers can seek relief from the rules.   Agricultural producers and processors, power companies, and other  commercial hedgers may have fewer bona fide hedges. What is more, they  might get a hedge exemption, only to get a call from Washington telling  them their hedge is invalid and they must liquidate their position.   The proposal also imposes new recordkeeping and reporting obligations  on Futures Commission Merchants, exchanges, and market participants.  Less well understood, but no less important, is the impact that  position limits in later months might have on market liquidity.   Position limits do not have anything to do with the long-term price  of commodities. The price of oil, no matter how high it climbs or how  low it falls, is driven by supply and demand.   Congress itself recognized this when it characterized the burdens of  excessive speculation as the sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or  unwarranted changes in the price of a commodity. There is nothing  sudden about a year's-long run-up or a year's-long decline in commodity  prices.   That said, I agree there is a role for position limits to play in the  management of our commodity markets, especially in managing the  convergence of prices at the expiration of a contract. But limits are a  regulatory tool to promote orderly markets, not a silver bullet to  lower commodity prices for consumers.   As a tool, they need to be calibrated to the unique characteristics  and historical patterns of each commodity. We cannot impose them in  blind faith that more regulation automatically improves markets.   My amendment is agnostic about the merits of position limits, but it  is clear about the need for the government to justify its rules that  restrict economic activity.   As this Congress sets about reducing regulatory burdens, it is  important that we start by requiring the CFTC to make a determination  about the need for further regulations before they act.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, the CFTC prepared a draft report this past  year. Quoting from page 142 of that draft, it says the Masters  Hypothesis, which my colleague--who I do have great respect for--said  the mere presence of passives distorts the marketplace, that is what  Masters Hypothesis said. The CFTC found there are no reputable economic  studies which fully endorse this view of how the commodity futures  markets work.   I would like to close with this comment from another study by the  chief economist: ``Comment letters on either side declaring that the  matter is settled in their favor among respectable economists is simply  incorrect. The best economists on both sides of the debate concede that  there is legitimate debate afoot. This analysis paper documents that  the academic debate amongst economists about the magnitude, prevalence,  and pervasiveness of the risk of outsized market positions has  reputable and legitimate standard-bearers for opposing positions.''   I agree with that in full. All we are asking the CFTC to do, Mr.  Chairman, is to do the work to prove that the specific position list  they want to implement, should they believe one is needed, that they  would have to go through regular order, their regular order, to make  that happen. I encourage a ``yes'' vote on the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I support the gentleman's amendment.   I would point out that at the end of his amendment is an antievasion  requirement which would allow the CFTC to watch for the kinds of things  that  [[Page H427]]  the gentlewoman from California was worried about in which foreign  markets might be involved and other things. So there are, structured in  the Lucas amendment, protections to avoid a crafty, interaffiliate kind  of circumstance that she was concerned about.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Hultgren) having assumed the chair, Mr. McClintock, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 238) to  reauthorize the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to better protect  futures customers, to provide end-users with market certainty, to make  basic reforms to ensure transparency and accountability at the  Commission, to help  [[Page H428]]  farmers, ranchers, and end-users manage risks, to help keep consumer  costs low, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's  amendment. Those of you who paid attention  [[Page H450]]  to the debate earlier in the day will find it curious that much of the  debate, some of the debate, was about the specificity with which we  instructed the CFTC to set up a regime in which to evaluate foreign  jurisdictions, and it irritated the group. In fact, many of them are  voting against it because that is in the underlying bill that is there,  so I oppose the gentleman's amendment.   I also don't know that it wouldn't require a referral to the  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and while the vaunted  Committee on Agriculture would love to claim all the jurisdiction we  possibly could, I am not interested in referring it to a different  committee.   For 4 years now, the end users and folks have been waiting to get  this thing done. It is time for us to get it done. I urge my colleagues  to vote against this motion to recommit and support the Commodity End- User Relief Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
