 Mr. President, I come to the floor today, first, to talk  about the Build Back Better Budget. This is an opportunity for this  country to get it right.   For far too long, millionaires and billionaires, corporations in this  country have accrued more and more wealth, have paid less and less  taxes, while average Americans have seen the cost of living rise, their  lives get more difficult, and Washington do virtually nothing about it.  We are going to make a huge downpayment in fixing that imbalance.   The Build Back Better Budget, which we will begin considering  tomorrow, is going to lower costs for Americans. We are talking about  the cost of Medicare, making sure that seniors get a benefit for things  like vision and dental; lower the costs for families, like childcare  costs.   The Presiding Officer and I are amongst the few parents of relatively  young school-age children. We know the cost of childcare today can  bankrupt families that don't have the incomes that we do. It is going  to cut taxes for American families but the right American families.  People who are making $30,000, $60,000 a year, that is who needs a tax  break, not the millionaires and billionaires.   It is going to create millions of jobs while tackling the climate  crisis. Come to Connecticut. We have renewable energy companies  building jobs all over our country, but they are having to compete with  other nations that are making big investments in climate, which are  creating their own renewable energy economies. If somebody is going to  capture millions and millions of jobs in wind and solar and geothermal  and electric cars, it should be the United States.   Lastly, we are going to pay for this by asking the wealthy to pay  their fair share, not more as a percentage of income than anybody else  but their fair share. We have corporations, some of the biggest in  America, that are paying virtually no taxes today. All of the wealth  that is being accumulated by the CEOs of these massive internet  companies, virtually untaxed. That has to change. That has to change. I  am excited to be a part of this process.   As I said, we have the chance to tackle the climate crisis and create  millions of new jobs. We can and have to do both.   You saw the new report challenging us, right? The facts are dire with  respect to what has already happened as this planet has warmed. But  what that report says is that the next 8 years are critical. The  decisions we make in this decade will determine whether there is a  livable planet for our children. That is our obligation. But here is  our opportunity: create millions of new jobs.   In Connecticut, we have solar companies, advance battery companies,  fuel cell companies, that are just waiting for the U.S. Government to  create a market for their technologies in the way that so many other  countries around the world are doing.   We have the chance to invest in community violence intervention  programs and save lives. This is part of the Build Back Better agenda.  President Biden has made it clear that if you want to tackle the  epidemic of gun violence in this country, then you have to invest in  communities in need.   If you take a look at what drives violence and exposure to violence  in this country, the No. 1-correlated factor is income. The poorer you  are, the more likely you are to be the victim of violence.   By investing in communities that have high rates of violence--and  not, coincidentally, high rates of poverty--you are reducing violence  in this Nation.   We have so many examples of programs, like Project Longevity in New  Haven and Bridgeport, CT, for example, that show, when you wrap  services around a small subset of at-risk families and at-risk young  people, you can dramatically lower the rates of violence in this  country.   And, by the way, that puts people to work, too, creating these  investments in anti-violence programming.   Then we have a chance to transform our rail system and create jobs,  speed up our commutes, and address the climate crisis.   And we are making a big downpayment in the bipartisan infrastructure  bill, $66 billion for rail. And I hope to see an additional downpayment  in the budget reconciliation process. But investing in rail, it is kind  of the Holy Grail because it creates short-term jobs as we rebuild our  decrepit rail lines. It speeds up commutes for people. That just makes  their lives better, more time with family. But it also creates a lot of  economic development potential. Companies want to locate here when they  can get their people faster from point A to point B.   Boston to DC is about half the distance as Beijing and Shanghai, but  it takes twice the amount of time to get from those two spots in the  United States as it does in Asia. We are way behind the curve in  investment in high-speed rail, and that is hurting us economically.   But, of course, an investment in rail is also about addressing the  climate crisis because the only way to make a dent in transportation  emissions is to move people out of cars, especially during the period  of time in which we are ramping up the deployment of electric vehicles,  and get those individuals into trains, get people out of planes and  into trains, especially in a corridor like the Northeast, where the  trains  [[Page S6098]]  are electrified, right, where these are cleaner trains than in other  parts of the country. We have a real opportunity, if we get more people  onto trains by investing in them to address the climate crisis.   So I want to just spend a moment, really, telling my colleagues both  the responsibility and opportunity that we have. Millionaires,  billionaires, and corporations are doing better than ever before in  this country. Regular people are hurting. They want a government that  is responsive to that. We need to address the huge costs people are  having to pay today. We need to cut taxes for regular people. We need  to create jobs, solve the climate crisis, and ask those who are doing  very well, the top 0.1 percent, to pay their fair share                                 Afghanistan    Mr. President, as the Taliban continues this rapid advance into  territory that had been controlled by the Kabul-based Afghan  Government, there is going to be a lot of hand-wringing in Washington,  especially amongst those who cheered our open-ended occupation of  Afghanistan for the last 20 years.   Those who opposed President Biden's plan to leave are going to engage  in a battery of ``I told you so's'' and blame the President for the  Taliban's march on Kabul.   But the Taliban's surge isn't a reason for the United States to  reverse course and put massive troop presence back into the country.   No. The Taliban surge is actually a reason to stick to the withdrawal  plan, because the complete, utter failure of the Afghan National Army,  absent our hand-holding, to defend their country is a blistering  indictment of a failed 20-year strategy predicated on the belief that  billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars could create an effective, democratic  central government in a nation that has never had one and a Western- modeled army structure populated by troops who are willing to die to  preserve a government.   Staying 1 more year in Afghanistan means we stay forever because, if  20 years of laborious training and equipping of the Afghan security  forces had this little impact on their ability to fight, then another  50 years wouldn't change anything.   If we choose to keep spending trillions of dollars in Afghanistan  until that nation is a fully functioning democracy and their security  forces can, by themselves, repel extremist attacks, then we are never  ever leaving.   Now, I went to Afghanistan four times in 6 years, from 2007 to 2013.  And each time, what struck me most was the heroism, the patriotism, the  capability of our soldiers. Too many of them never came home. Too many  others came home with injuries that changed their lives. Many of them  were from my home State.   But also, each time I went to Afghanistan, I also met with a new,  impressive American general who had just recently arrived in country  for his short 12-month tour. Each walked me through a PowerPoint  presentation detailing how the previous general hadn't made that much  progress in training the Afghan security forces and how this general  would change course and finally get it right.   This cycle of failure, readjustment, and continued failure must have  played out over a dozen times in Afghanistan between our arrival there  and the beginning of the Biden administration, and the Taliban took  full advantage.   Now, President Trump made a little-noticed decision to stop  publicizing the estimates of how much territory the Taliban controlled  in Afghanistan, no doubt because the news, especially in the last 5  years, got worse and worse. Yes, the Taliban is moving quickly toward  regional capitals right now, but they have been gaining territory for  nearly a decade. That trend is just accelerating now.   One repeating mistake was our belief that we could create the Afghan  National Army from our own mold. Now, our country's sense of  nationalist patriotism, which inspires Americans to put their lives on  the line for the flag and what it represents, does not have a corollary  in Afghanistan. But we didn't get that.   We had no sense of how competing tribal and ethnic affiliations made  creating this common military purpose difficult. And each time our  military leaders and our on-the-ground trainers started to learn about  these local nuances and started adapting their methods, they were sent  home because their deployment was done, and a new deployment of  Americans arrived to start from scratch and start making the same  mistakes again. Our military leaders are incredibly capable, but we  gave them an impossible task.   Our presence in Afghanistan also created a deadly feedback loop where  Taliban and terrorist recruiters easily and eagerly scooped up trainees  champing at the bit to fight the Americans. For instance, research  suggests that in the northwest of Pakistan, where the Taliban and  allied groups organized, our drone attacks actually led to increased,  not decreased, numbers of Taliban fighters. Bombs falling from  pilotless flying machines more often killed innocent civilians instead  of enemy combatants, and this simply caused more anger against the  United States and our Afghan Government allies and more interest in  locals to join the fight against us.   Now, as the Taliban begins to quicken the pace of their assault on  Afghan forces, hawks in the United States are going to lead the charge  for Biden to reverse course and continue these failed policies of the  last 20 years. But to what end?   If the Afghan National Army was so willing to stand aside after 20  years of U.S. investment, why would anything change if we stuck around  longer?   Of course, the answer is nothing would change. I know that that is  hard to hear and to accept. Staying longer would just be to admit that  American taxpayers have got to foot the bill for a permanent occupation  of Afghanistan, to shore up a corrupt government and keep the Taliban  at bay.   Now, this isn't wise, mostly because my constituents, understandably,  have little interest in putting that much money in Afghanistan when  they can't afford groceries or college for their kids or their monthly  rent. The Taliban are bad guys, but so are the leaders who rule  Turkmenistan or Equatorial Guinea or Kazakhstan or North Korea, amongst  others. But we can't afford, as a country, to invade and displace every  brutal regime in the world.   Now, what my constituents do care about is preventing another attack  on American soil, which is why thousands of our brave men and women in  uniform made the ultimate sacrifice fighting in Afghanistan. That is  why we went there in the first place. So if spending trillions to fight  the Taliban was vitally necessary to this project, then the American  public would probably back the investment, but right now it isn't  necessary.   U.S. officials believe al-Qaida in Afghanistan is no longer capable  of carrying out attacks against the United States. We are talking about  200 to 400 al-Qaida fighters in Afghanistan today. Now, this is likely  because the Taliban is seeking a less contentious relationship with the  United States and, therefore, has promised to deny al-Qaida a safe  haven.   Now, I get it. Assurances from the Taliban are of very limited value,  but our intelligence collection on al-Qaida is good enough to be able  to monitor the Taliban's compliance and adjust accordingly.   Now, I understand how difficult it is to watch the Afghan National  Army refuse to defend its territory, to watch the Taliban move so  quickly into provincial capitals. I understand how infuriating it must  be for families who lost loved ones in Afghanistan to see these gains  be eliminated so quickly.   But let's understand, finally, what would have happened if President  Biden had chosen to keep 2,500 troops in Afghanistan. Twenty-five  hundred troops is not a sufficient number to repel this offensive. Our  military leaders have been crystal clear that a minimum of 8,500 troops  are required to provide any modicum of support necessary to keep the  Taliban's gains to a crawl.   That is how many troops were there at the beginning of Trump's term,  but as part of his agreement with the Taliban, he drew down the numbers  to 2,500, a force size completely inadequate to stop any Taliban  advance. And the only reason why those 2,500 soldiers didn't get  overrun by the Taliban is because, as part of the Trump-Taliban  agreement, the Taliban promised to hold off on attacks until the United  States had withdrawn.  [[Page S6099]]    So if President Biden decided to keep our open-ended mission to  support the Afghan military against the Taliban, he would have had to  surge troop levels back to 8,500. Every single troop in Afghanistan  costs over $1 million a year. Now, never mind the complete  unwillingness of the American public to support yet another Afghanistan  troop surge; the cost of this escalation would have just been  indefensible.   The Afghan military, on paper, is far superior a fighting force to  the Taliban. The Afghan National Army has approximately three times the  number of soldiers. The Afghan National Army has an air force. The  Taliban doesn't. The Afghan National Army's equipment and weapons-- thanks to the United States--are much more sophisticated and deadly.  The United States trains that force. We pay their salaries. We support  them.   But despite this advantage, despite 20 years and trillions of dollars  of investment, they are losing to the ragtag Taliban badly. This isn't  a reason for the United States to reescalate. This is evidence of the  wisdom and courage of President Biden's decision to withdraw.   Our counterterrorism mission in Afghanistan is going to remain, but  we should refuse, as a nation, to remain in forever wars that don't  make our Nation safer   I yield the floor.
