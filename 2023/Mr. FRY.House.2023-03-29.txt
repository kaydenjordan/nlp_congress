 Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1, the Lower  Energy Costs Act.   From the minute that President Biden took office, he waged war  against American energy production and the independence that we  previously held.   The Biden administration canceled the Keystone XL pipeline on day  one, imposed a $6 billion tax on natural gas, and promised $27 billion  to special interest climate groups, and severely limited our fracking  capabilities. These are just a few of the examples of why our energy  prices are up 40 percent since the President took office.   In my mind, everything that can be made in America should be,  including energy. American-made energy provides jobs, creates economic  growth, lowers prices, and is an important part of our national  security.   The United States must become energy independent once again, and  regulatory hurdles for energy production here at home must be rolled  back. This begins with permitting reform and cutting the burdensome red  tape that suppresses innovation and development.   I was proud to work on commonsense reforms in the South Carolina  General Assembly, and I am excited to see this being done at the  Federal level. H.R. 1 is a top priority for House Republicans. We want  to work for the people, not against them.    Mr. Chair, this legislation will enhance our Nation's  domestic energy production while lowering energy costs for Americans  across our great country. I urge everybody to support H.R. 1.
