 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  the American Red Cross' annual Holiday Mail for Heroes program.   Each year in early December, the Red Cross hosts this important event  that strives to provide our men and women in uniform with the support  and encouragement that is particularly important around the holiday  season.   We all look forward to gathering with family, friends, and loved ones  during this time of year. For our servicemembers, this is a luxury.   These men and women spend many months at a time away from their  families. That is difficult no matter what  [[Page H9229]]  time of year it is, but around the holidays, their sacrifice is  magnified.   Today, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the Rayburn foyer, we can all play a  small role in brightening the spirits of those in our military by  signing a holiday card.   Mr. Speaker, it is an initiative that I look forward to participating  in every year, and I encourage my colleagues and their staff to  participate as well.   For more than a decade, the Holiday Mail for Heroes program has  worked hard to remind our heroes just how much we appreciate their  service and their sacrifice.   Last year around this time, I had the privilege of sponsoring a  congressional delegation abroad where we met with our troops and had  the pleasure of spending time with them during the week of  Thanksgiving. My colleagues and I traveled to Kuwait to serve and to  share a meal with soldiers stationed there. It was an honor to meet  with so many individuals who have committed their lives to protecting  our great Nation.   We can all do our part to support our dedicated servicemen and -women  now and throughout the year. A gesture as small as sending a card can  brighten the holiday season for those who are deployed.   This holiday season, I encourage each and every one of us to take a  moment out of our days to let a soldier know how much we appreciate  them.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss  H.R. 5249, the Supporting Healthy Outcomes for Mothers and Infants Act.  I am proud to cosponsor this bill alongside my colleague, Congressman    David Trone.   The opioid epidemic is a public health crisis. It does not  discriminate. Opioid abuse impacts all of our communities, and sadly,  expectant mothers and children are particularly vulnerable.   This bill will help address the crisis by properly investing in  opportunities for both education and prevention. Equally important, the  bill works to destigmatize addiction and rightfully treat it as an  illness.   Specifically, the Supporting Healthy Outcomes for Mothers and Infants  Act instructs the Health and Human Services Secretary and the  Agriculture Secretary to develop evidence-based nutrition education  material for WIC-eligible pregnant women and caregivers to infants  impacted by neonatal abstinence syndrome.   It ensures WIC conducts outreach to those who may be eligible for the  program or impacted by substance abuse disorder.   Lastly, the bill makes any nutrition education and training materials  developed available to State agencies through an online clearinghouse.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to urge my colleagues to cosponsor and  support H.R. 5249.                            ____________________
