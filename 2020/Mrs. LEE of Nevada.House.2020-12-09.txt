 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the people  of Nevada's Third Congressional District with a plea to all of my  colleagues:   We are now entering the darkest period of this pandemic. Americans  are scared, and I don't blame them. Americans are also angry, and they  should be. They are angry at Congress and this administration for  failing to pass more relief for struggling families, frontline workers,  and small businesses.   Thousands more Nevadans filed for unemployment during the last few  weeks. Over 400,000 Nevadans remain at risk of eviction as housing  assistance expires.   As this virus uncontrollably spreads in every corner of this country,  our frontline workers and hospitals are overwhelmed with a tidal wave  of new COVID-positive patients.   There is no more time for political games that have consumed Congress  for months. There never was. I am pleading to my Republican and  Democratic colleagues, to our leadership, and to this administration:  It is time to do our jobs and pass more COVID-19 relief now.                            ____________________
