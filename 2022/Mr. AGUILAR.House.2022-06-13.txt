 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 10th  anniversary of the DACA program on June 15, 2022.   In the last decade, this program has allowed young Americans to  pursue the American Dream in the only country they know to be their  home. They have been able to live without fear of being separated from  their families and have been able to pursue higher education and their  dream jobs. They are our friends, our family members, trusted community  leaders, coworkers, and fellow Americans in every way but on a piece of  paper.   Madam Speaker, we need to do more. Since I have been in Congress, I  have been proud to support the DACA recipients, including through  introducing legislation to give them a pathway to citizenship and  advocating for DACA recipients to work in Congress and across the  Federal Government.   I am proud to work with my colleagues in the Hispanic Caucus to fight  for immigrant communities and to urge the U.S. Senate to take up  measures that the House has passed time and time again.                            ____________________
