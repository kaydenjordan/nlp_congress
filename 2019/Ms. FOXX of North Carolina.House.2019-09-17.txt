 Mr. Speaker, when our country was  founded, the idea of a democratic republic was not foreign; it was  nonexistent. Besides intermittent cooperation to win independence, the  Colonies had no sense of unity, and being American had little meaning.  Few citizens could have realized the amount of sacrifice needed to  write and ratify a document to unite them all.   Our Constitution truly is a miracle. Aside from its genius, its  history helps us appreciate the blessing it is. Our colleague,  Congressman Chris Stewart, and Judge Ted Stewart wrote a wonderful  book, ``Seven Miracles That Saved America.'' In it, they offer three  reasons to believe God had a hand in the crafting of the Constitution.   For the remainder of my time today on Constitution Day, I would like  to quote them.   ``One, Timing. The window of opportunity for the writing and  ratification of the Constitution was very small. Every effort to make  the Articles of Confederation workable between 1776 and 1787 had  already failed. But then suddenly, in May of 1787, a group of 55  patriots came together with both the wisdom of the ages and enough  youth to energetically fight for the ratification of the Constitution.   ``Any attempt to create a constitution later than 1787 would have  almost certainly resulted in failure as well. Just 2 years after the  Convention finished its work, France became embroiled in its own  revolution, which lasted a full decade and degenerated into a bloody,  violent affair.   ``Surely, this example of failure would have frightened the Founding  Fathers, giving them reason to think very differently about the degree  of power to be retained by `the people.'   ``Making matters worse was the fact that the Founders split into two  distinct political camps in the years that immediately followed the  Convention. Had the Constitutional Convention been called just a few  years later than 1787, many of these men would have been unwilling to  stand together. And without their input, the Convention would never  have had a chance of success.   ``Two, Miraculous Compromise. The second way in which the  Constitution is demonstrably a miracle is the manner in which it came  about.   ``During the course of the Convention, every delegate had to give up  on some cherished principle.   ``James Madison, who had come to the Convention more prepared than  anyone and was primarily responsible for the general outline of the  government established by the Constitution, lost on many issues. Most  dear to him was his belief that the House and the Senate should be  based on proportional representation.   ``Franklin wanted an executive council voted for life, rather than a  single executive. He did not want the chief executive to have the power  of the veto. He did not want anyone in the executive position to  receive a salary. He lost on all counts.   ``But during the course of the 560 roll calls, no man lost every  time, and everyone was part of a winning vote on some occasion. These  men of social stature, political and business success--`demigods' all-- swallowed their pride, accepted defeat of personal agendas, and went  forth and convinced a nation to accept the product of the Convention.   ``Three, 4,400 Miraculous Words. Perhaps the greatest miracle of the  Constitution is the document itself. In essence, the Constitution has  had only 13 substantive amendments in over 200 years.   ``History has proven that the Constitution creates a system that  defies despotism and tyranny.   ``How was it able to do this? Primarily through the underlying  premise, part of Madison's gift to the world, that the Constitution  comes from the people. Madison coined the phrase `We the People.' These  words are far more than a clever phrase. They restate the principle,  first asserted in the Declaration of Independence, that God gives man  rights and the only legitimate purpose of government is to protect  those rights.  [[Page H7718]]    ``In short, the Constitution not only survived the evolution of this  great Nation but permitted the American people to exercise the greatest  level of individual liberty in history.   ``Further, it has been the `shining light on the hill' that has  provided the inspiration for peoples all over the Earth to seek liberty  and freedom for themselves.   ``Is that not a miracle?''                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank both of my  colleagues from North Carolina for their leadership on doing their best  to help HBCUs.   However, Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2486, the  FUTURE Act. Under the guise of a manufactured deadline, House Democrats  are rushing through a bill that will negatively impact student  borrowers across the country.   I want to make one thing clear: In no way does my criticism of the  underlying bill diminish my support for America's HBCUs and MSIs and  the important role these institutions of higher learning play in our  country.   My issue is with this bill and the process by which it is before us.  We have a responsibility to diligently and responsibly allocate  taxpayer dollars. Too many in this body find it way too easy to spend  hard-earned taxpayer dollars without promising accountability. That is  an insult to every citizen who has entrusted us with their  representation. Yet, the Democrats' bill before us uses budget gimmicks  to skirt House protocols.   This flawed bill also eliminates account maintenance fees, programs  that serve low-income minority students through financial aid awareness  and borrower assistance services. In addition to funding and policy  issues, the bill has serious process issues. Our colleagues have  skipped the markup process and brought it straight to the floor.   This unnecessary move to push forward a bill without the deliberation  of the committee is a disservice to America's students. We have the  time to deliberate this legislation with all parties at the table, but  my colleagues aren't interested in sound policy, they are interested in  sound bites.   Simply put, there are better ways to accomplish the policy goals of  this bill and really work toward improving the future of American  students.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank  Congressman Price for his very kind comments and associate myself with  them.   I want to welcome our new Members, and I want to thank all of the  Members here in advance for helping them feel welcomed to this  wonderful body and for helping them get adjusted in a hurry to their  work here.   Former Speaker Boehner always said that the North Carolina delegation  punched above its weight. I want to say that, with the addition of  these two wonderful Members, we are going to continue that tradition of  punching above our weight and bring to the people's House a wealth of  experience and a commitment to helping all of the people of the United  States of America.   So I want to welcome, again, Representative Bishop and Representative  Murphy to the people's House and say: God bless you, and may God  continue to bless all of us.
