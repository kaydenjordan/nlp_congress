 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Zeldin for his kind  words. The honor is all mine, from one post-9/11 veteran to another  post- 9/11 veteran, from Staten Island or Long Island. I truly respect your  service as well to our great country and applaud the gentleman for  putting the country first ahead of any other political considerations  as we try to do what is right here.   I would also like to, of course, thank the other original cosponsors  of this bill, people who have fought for this incredibly important  project and initiative for more than a decade, Carolyn Maloney, Jerry  Nadler, and Pete King.   I wanted to start off by telling a story of one of my constituents,  Rob Serra. Rob graduated from the academy on September 10, 2001. His  first day on the job with the New York City Fire Department was 9/11.  When he saw the burning towers from the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, he  did exactly what first responders across the city and across the  country did without hesitation, and that is, he raced to the scene. He  raced right to danger.   For weeks, he joined so many in digging through the rubble, looking  for survivors, looking for their friends, looking for those who were  not as fortunate. Dust loaded with cement, asbestos, lead, glass  fibers, and other chemicals caked to his face. He knew this would  probably kill him, but he served without question because it was the  right thing to do.   Rob is a young man, but he is now in a wheelchair, retired from the  FDNY before he could even truly begin his career. He is not looking for  handouts. He is looking for respect, for acknowledgment, and for his  government to just do the right damn thing, not just for him and for  his family, because he is already covered, but he knows there are  thousands of heroic Americans just like him across the country who are  getting sick but facing drastic cuts to their benefits.   Just about every Member in this body has a constituent like Rob and  his family. They all deserve more than our tweets and statements. They  need action. They deserve nothing less because we need to do more than  just say, ``Never forget.'' We need to do more than just shake  somebody's hand and say that we have a picture of the Twin Towers in  our office or that we decided to serve in this body because of 9/11.   We need to make sure that these heroes are never forgotten and are  always taken care of. That means making sure every victim and their  families get the benefits and care they deserve, because this wasn't an  attack on New York. This was an attack on the United States of America.   Keeping our promise to these heroes is not a New York problem. It is  an American issue that we have to address and fix as a country. There  are VCF claims from all 50 States and 99 percent of congressional  districts. In a few years, we may face the tragic fact that more people  will have died from 9/11-related injuries and diseases than were lost  on the day of the attacks.   Each and every person that dies is yet another victim of al-Qaida's  attack. Unless Congress acts to fully and permanently fund the  September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, benefits will be cut and  promises will be broken. This isn't due to mismanagement or fraud or  any other fact than that more people are getting sick.   I applaud this administration for doing the right thing and  effectively managing this program. I applaud the President for that.  But it is unacceptable that we will not adequately fund it, and I won't  stand for it. I am hopeful we can get this done, because we truly have  no other choice.                                time  2015     I was in the wrong place at the wrong time for  that one.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        March 7, 2019, on page H2575 the following appeared: I didn't  realize Congressman ROSE is a Purple Heart too. Mr. ROSE of New  York. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time for that one.      The online version has been corrected to read:  Absolutely, I thank the gentleman. Go Army.
