 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Foxx for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, everyone supports equal pay for equal performance, and  everyone is against gender-based wage discrimination. This has been the  law for nearly 60 years.   When I entered the workforce 30 years ago after college, wage  discrimination was basically nonexistent, thanks to the law and a  simple recognition of the value of a diverse workforce. Companies then,  as now, simply assigned a starting salary based upon the position, and  paid that wage to everyone they hired; thereafter providing merit  increases based upon performance, unlike what happens in union shops  and with government positions.   But do my Democrat friends across the aisle base their staff salaries  on gender? Or do they pay women less than men? Or do they set salaries  based on market conditions, qualifications, and experience?                                time  1245    Why do they assume less of private employers?   We already have laws and protections that ensure fair pay, and  companies must maintain documentation demonstrating nondiscrimination  in wages, performance evaluations, and merit increases.   In fact, we are in a much stronger position today than we were 30,  let alone 60 years ago.   This legislation from the Democrat Party is just another attempt to  insert themselves further into the workplace with a purported cure for  a disease that doesn't exist. Democrats are dependent upon the  perception of discrimination and victimhood to expand their base of  power as they continue to divide us as a Nation.   Democrats also view employers, businesses, and job creators with  disdain, believing that, left to their own devices, they would seek to  harm and exploit their employees. Not to worry, Big Government to the  rescue; or, more accurately, big Democrat government laying on more  control, more regulations, more mandates, all designed to enrich their  trial lawyer friends and increase liability for employers.   The Democrats will disingenuously cite statistics that indicate that  there are discrepancies in income based on gender, but they won't  specify discrepancies in pay for the same positions in the same  industries because they don't exist.   This bill adds more layers of burdensome and costly reporting  requirements for businesses, estimated to cost about $600 million a  year, costs which will be passed on to consumers in higher prices with  no real benefit.   The bill doesn't do anything to help women in the workplace, but it  hurts employers, exposing them to greater liability, and enriches the  trial lawyer donors to the Democrat Party. It allows the lawyers to  litigate every decision an employer makes, and to bankrupt small  businesses by seeking unlimited monetary damages.   It makes it impossible for employers to defend charges of gender- based discrimination when experience, qualifications, or performance  warrants higher pay. They would now need to prove that the  determination is a business necessity.   Leave it to politicians in Washington to think that they have the  right to determine for employers what is a business necessity.   Left to themselves, businesses and employers tend to get it right.  But Big Government almost never gets it right, and this bill is no  exception. I urge a ``no'' vote.
