 Mr. Speaker, on Friday, November 3, 2017, I was  unavoidably detained attending to representation duties in my district  and was not present for rollcall votes 605 and 606.   I would like to have reflected in the Record, on rollcall vote 605, I  would have voted ``yes'' on the motion to recommit with instructions  for H.R. 3922, the Community Health and Medical Professionals Improve  Our Nation Act of 2017.   On rollcall vote 606, I would have voted ``no'' on the passage of  H.R. 3922, the Community Health and Medical Professionals Improve Our  Nation Act of 2017.   On Friday, November 3, 2017, I was unavoidably detained attending to  representation duties and was not present for Roll Call Votes 605 and  606. I ask the record to reflect that had I been present I would have  voted as follows:   1. On rollcall 605, I would have voted ``yes.'' (On the Motion to  Recommit with Instructions for H.R. 3922, the Community Health and  Medical Professionals Improve Our Nation Act of 2017).   2. On Rollcall 606, I would have voted ``no.'' (On Passage of H.R.  3922, the Community Health and Medical Professionals Improve Our Nation  Act of 2017).                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am joining the Congressional Black  Caucus to ask for an extension of the temporary protective status for  Haitians.   I am absolutely appalled that this government would deny this  extension and only allow it for 6 months. Apparently, they are not  aware of the scarcity of food in Haiti and the cholera epidemic. All of  these challenges are continuing since 2011.   Along with the Haitians, I understand that they have now taken away  TPS from 300,000 Hondurans, Nicaraguans, and Salvadorans as well. This  is an outrageous act, and it is important for them to act immediately.   I also stand against the scam tax plan. The scam tax plan would, in  fact, take away opportunities for Americans to have higher education,  build the deficit way beyond one's recognition, would not create jobs,  would send jobs overseas, would allow for 80 percent of the benefits to  go to the top 1 percent, and, frankly, would provide no benefits for  middle class, hardworking Americans.   This plan is not tax cuts and jobs; it is a tax scam with no jobs.   I ask my colleagues to vote against this tax bill, and I ask this  administration to do what is right and provide humanitarian relief and  extend the TPS for Haitians and all others similarly situated for 18  months.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House  Committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committee, I rise  today to express my strong objection to the announced intention by the  Trump Administration not to extend Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for  Haiti, Honduras, and El Salvador.   On May 24, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) re- designated Haiti for 6 months of Temporary Protected Status (TPS),  rather than the full 18 months requested by the Government of Haiti,  Haiti experts in the United States, and the Congressional Black Caucus,  among others.   DHS' decision did not reflect the realities on the ground in Haiti,  which include Haiti's food scarcity crisis, cholera epidemic, and the  ongoing challenges posed by the unprecedented 2010 earthquake.   In a letter sent this past Friday, November 3, 2017, the  Congressional Black Caucus urged DHS, once again, to fully extend  Haiti's TPS designation for 18 months by the November 23, 2017 deadline  in light of the aforementioned conditions in Haiti, as well as the  exarcerbated damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria.   In a report published in October 2017, the highly regarded Global  Justice Clinic concluded that conditions justifying Haiti's  qualification for TPS in 2011 remain as acute today as they were then.   The study also found that 40,000 Haitians uprooted by the 2010  earthquake are officially displaced and that many more likely remain  unofficially displaced in dangerously inadequate shelters.   The cholera epidemic that was tragically caused by international  efforts to aid Haiti in 2010 more than doubled following Hurricane  Matthew and is expected to directly affect more than 30,000 people by  the end of 2017.   Hurricane Matthew also exacerbated the food insecurity crisis in  Haiti, placing 2.4 million Haitians--22 percent of its population--in  the grips of an acute food insecurity crisis.   The Haitian government has been working diligently for years to  improve its economy, public health conditions, and infrastructure in  coordination with the United States government and international  community.   In order to accomplish this task, Haiti relies in large part on  remittances that its citizens receive from TPS beneficiaries in the  United States.   Therefore, the negative consequences of terminating Haiti's TPS  designation would be twofold.   It would end essential remittances that significantly contribute to  Haiti's recovery while also forcing the poorest republic in the Western  Hemisphere to absorb the cost of reintegrating thousands of citizens  all at once.   Such actions could be catastrophic to Haiti's recovery efforts and  run counter to Congressional efforts to improve American relations in  the region through the recently-passed United States-Caribbean  Strategic Engagement Act (Public Law 114-291).   Finally, it is essential to note that Haitian TPS beneficiaries  directly contribute to the United States.   They pay taxes, spend money, contribute to Social Security and  Medicare, and help promote American prosperity in numerous sectors,  such as the restaurant and food service, construction, and hospitality  industries.   About 30 percent of TPS beneficiaries are homeowners, stimulating the  real estate industry and contributing to the local property tax base.   Also, one in nine TPS beneficiaries in the labor force is self- employed, meaning they not only create jobs for themselves, but also  create jobs for others.   A recent report found that the expiration of Haitian TPS would cost  the United States economy more $2.8 billion over a decade in lost gross  domestic product.   Mr. Speaker, we need to be both smart and compassionate when it comes  to extending TPS for Haiti.   The compassionate thing to do is extend TPS for Haiti.   But just as important, extending TPS for Haiti is the smart thing to  do because it strengthens the American economy and advances the  national interests of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I also join my colleagues in the Congressional Black  Caucus in drawing attention to the Republican Leadership's latest plan  to hurt the American taxpayers, especially those who did not support  the President during the election.   The Republican tax cut would result in the biggest increase in the  deficit by any President in the history of the United States, likely  growing it by the annual sum of $1 trillion from now on.   Some may wonder if the President would stoop to punishing people  because they did not vote for him--I would point them to the Republican  Tax Proposal and say the answer is found in the 429 pages of H.R. 1,  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.  [[Page H8520]]    Americans who send their children to private school will be able to  do so--at the expense of taxpayers who send their children to public  schools courtesy of the Republican tax cut plan.   The Republican Tax plan amends Title 26 of the United States Code  Sec.  529 that deals with Qualified tuition programs.   The Code was intended to encourage persons to attain higher education  and provide incentives for persons who pursue doctorates.   Most people know that going back to school to obtain a degree is a  difficult choice to make with full time jobs and family obligations.   Having a degree can substantially increase income and provide choices  that would otherwise be unattainable to the recipient of advanced  degrees.   The benefit to the economy and our nation's leadership in the  sciences rests with the number of people who attain undergraduate and  graduate degrees.   The Republicans have gone into this section 529 of the tax code and  extended the tax write-offs to those sending their children to K-12  private schools.   Other ways the Republican Tax bill hurts taxpayers who pursue college  educations for themselves or their children.   Repeal of Lifetime Learning Credit;   Repeal of the Student Loan Interest Deduction;   Repeal of the qualified tuition reduction;   Repeal of educational assistance program;   Termination of private activity bonds; and,   Creation of a new excise tax on endowments at private colleges and  universities.   The Republican leadership of the House is also causing problems for  private sector investments in Colleges and Universities.   The tax bill threatens tax write offs for donations to colleges and  universities and will limit tax credits associated with university- industry partnerships.   The Republicans claim that their Child Tax Credit proposal would help  working families, but it simply does not do enough.   The House tax plan proposes a nonrefundable $600 increase in the  Child Tax Credit (CTC), and would make more families earning six  figures eligible to claim the CTC.   This proposal wouldn't help the women who need it most.   In addition, whatever benefits this CTC proposal would provide pales  in comparison to those that would be received by the wealthy and  corporations under this tax plan.   The bill cuts taxes for major corporations who already pay far less  than their fair share.   Republicans claim that economic growth will more than pay for the  lost revenue but we've tried this before.   When trickle-down economics fails again and this bill explodes the  nation's deficit, Republicans will call for huge spending cuts to  critical programs that hardworking Americans depend on to make ends  meet.   The plan's negative impact on the Lone Star state would be  particularly hard.   Independent analyses show the Republican plan would actually raise  taxes on about 1.5 million Texas households, or 12.4 percent of  households next year.   On average, families earning up to $86,000 annually would see a  $794.00 increase in their tax liability, a significant burden on  families struggling to afford child care and balance their checkbook.   According to the IRS, 23 percent of tax filers, or 2.8 million Texas  households, deduct their state and local taxes with an average  deduction of $7,823 in 2015.   The Ryan-McConnell plan eliminates this deduction, which would lower  home values and put pressure on states and towns to collect revenues  they depend on to fund schools, roads, and vital public resources.   Placing further strains on middle-class Texans is the elimination of  the personal exemption, which deducts $4,050 for each taxpayer and  dependent on a return from taxable income.   In 2015, roughly 9.3 million dependent exemptions were claimed in the  Lone Star State.   The GOP's reckless and irresponsible tax plan is made all the more  obscene by its disproportionate and immoral handouts to the wealthiest  few.   According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy,  millionaires in Texas, 0.31 percent of filers in 2015 would receive  almost 57 percent of the benefits from the tax plan.   Texans deserve a tax plan that puts working and middle class families  first, not more deficit-exploding tax cuts for millionaires and  billionaires.   We need bipartisan tax reform that creates jobs, fuels economic  growth, and puts more money into the pockets of hard-working American  families.   A recent Pew Research Center report found little support for cutting  taxes for high-income households, which is defined as more than  $250,000 or large businesses and corporations.   In fact, 43 percent favored raising taxes on high-income households  and 52 percent said corporate taxes should be raised.   The Republicans persist with their scheme of raising taxes on hard- working middle class families to pay for tax cuts for the rich.   It is reckless to explode our deficit which according to the Tax  Policy Center, would skyrocket by $2.4 trillion over the first decade.   The wealthy must pay their fair share, but the GOP tax scheme offers  them a free lunch at the expense of those who are most in need of a  helping hand.   The power of the purse rests with the House of Representatives and it  is our job to make sure that the American People are treated fairly.                            ____________________
