 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Thornberry for  yielding.   I want to start by thanking my subcommittee chair, Mr. Langevin, who  is a wonderful colleague to work with. I also thank both of our staffs  for the hard work.   As the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Intelligence and  Emerging Threats and Capabilities, I would like to highlight the key  themes that will ensure the U.S. retains our competitive edge in the  future.   First, this bill places special emphasis on basic research and the  important contributions that our science and technology ecosystem,  including our universities, the DOD labs, and DARPA, provide to our  collective national defense, including our pandemic preparedness and  response.   This bill also restores a critical social science research program  that has provided foundational insights into violent extremism, great  power competition, and foreign information operations campaigns.   In sum, this bill provides an additional $600 million for science and  technology investments in critical emerging fields, including AI,  autonomous systems, and biotechnology.                                time  1415    Two years ago, I introduced legislation in the NDAA that created the  National Security Commission on AI, with the purpose of accelerating  and advancing the development of AI across the Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud the Commission for their work on this  important issue, and I am honored that this bill included 18 of those  recommendations. The adoption of these recommendations demonstrates how  important AI is and how urgently it must be integrated into not only  our weapons systems, but our healthcare, our predictive maintenance  efforts, our humanitarian assistance missions, and our cybersecurity.   Our ability to apply AI and other emerging technologies faster than  our adversaries will allow us to maintain our competitive edge over  Russia and China and prepare our citizens for an AI-enabled future.   Secondly, this bill extends and expands the opportunities for our  Special Operations Forces to partner with foreign forces, build  critical relationships, and more effectively counter the malign  influences of Russia and China.   Furthermore, this bill also increases our investment in the programs  that provide care and support for the families of our special operators  that have been so critical to our counterterrorism operations over the  last 19 years.   Most importantly, as a proud representative of the soldiers and  families of Fort Drum and 10th Mountain Division, this bill will invest  in the technology and training necessary to ensure the safety and  security of the men and women sent into harm's way.   This bill supports our force protection and military intelligence  capabilities to ensure our servicemembers have the tools they need to  mitigate hostile actions while they continue their important missions  abroad.   As a representative of the most deployed division in the United  States Army, currently serving in Afghanistan, my number one priority  is force protection and the safety of the brave men and women called  into action to protect our national interests.   That said, I am very concerned with any amendments that would slash  the defense budget, impact our force protection, or degrade our  investment in new technologies. A $73 billion cut to the defense budget  would cause irreparable harm to our military and our readiness and  would decimate the very programs that keep our servicemembers safe.   Mr. Speaker, I want to close by thanking Ranking Member Thornberry  for his leadership and guidance not only this year, but his many years  of truly exemplary leadership.
