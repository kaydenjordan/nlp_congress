 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the hardworking  volunteers of the North Canton Meals on Wheels as the Ohio 13th  Congressional District's Champion of the Week.   For the past 50 years, North Canton Meals on Wheels volunteers have  served seniors and families in northeast Ohio, consistently providing  hundreds of cold and hot cooked meals to those in need.   Currently led by the program director, Lucy Keenan, and the board  director, Trudy Jones, this crucial organization goes beyond just  providing seniors and families with healthy and nutritious meals. The  approximately 60 volunteers serve our community by becoming friendly  faces to older Ohioans who may feel isolated and lonely.   Combating the harmful effects of food insecurity is a priority near  and dear to my heart, so I am grateful for the North Canton Meals on  Wheels and what they do to ensure vulnerable seniors and families in  Ohio's 13th District never have to worry about going hungry.   As inflation and rising costs continue to make food more expensive  for those on fixed incomes, the service of the North Canton Meals on  Wheels is more important than ever.   Once again, congratulations to North Canton Meals on Wheels on their  50th anniversary, and I thank them for all that they do to ensure our  seniors and families in Ohio's 13th District can live with dignity.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I didn't come to Congress to play politics. I  came here to put the needs of Ohio's 13th Congressional District first,  not to vote on bogus, oppressive, extreme, barbaric, erroneous,  ridiculous, time-wasting amendments like this one.   Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for my colleagues who are  choosing to play partisan games with our national security by including  amendments that would strip lifesaving reproductive healthcare away  from our women in uniform.   This is nothing more than the latest attempt by House Republicans to  advance their extreme agenda taking us backward by punishing women and  banning abortion nationwide.   As the vice chair of the Bipartisan Women's Caucus, we just recently  honored and recognized our women in uniform, but today we are  dishonoring those women.   Our military was founded to protect our freedoms. Politicians should  not be making healthcare decisions for any woman, but especially not  for our women in uniform who serve us each and every day.   I cannot support any legislation that impedes on a woman's freedom to  make decisions about her healthcare, even if it is no longer  constitutionally protected.
