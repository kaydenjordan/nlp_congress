 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend. Both of these guys  are great friends. This is a great tribute today to a great man.   No one is more well-known in the conservative world than Judge Louie  Gohmert. I am very grateful to have served with him as my brother in  the Texas delegation for the last 8 years since I was elected.   It is no secret that Louie is a speaker of truth and a fighter for  our freedoms. He is unapologetic in his principles and a true defender  of the United States Constitution.   As President Trump said: Louie has guts. He is as tough as hell.   Isn't that the truth?   But he is more than that. He is also a man of integrity, a veteran, a  judge, a historian, a Bible scholar, a really fair preacher, a husband,  and a father.   Judge Gohmert is my neighbor to the north. He represents the First  District of Texas, and I represent the last district, the 36th  District. That is changing as we have had redistricting, but I like to  tell people that. He has fought tirelessly to preserve and protect our  border and prosper the State of Texas.   In a judiciary hearing a few months ago, Louie quoted the author  George  [[Page H8792]]  Orwell saying, ``Free speech is my right to say what you don't want to  hear.'' What a fitting quote for our friend, Louie Gohmert.   You can count on Louie to be truthful. Sometimes he says what you  don't want him to say. But he says it if he believes it. He is a man of  integrity, and he stands his ground. You can count on Louie Gohmert to  be bold, and you can count on Louis to be fearless.    There will be a great hole in this august body here without Louie  Gohmert. I imagine that it will really never be filled in the same way  that it was.   In a recent Louie Hour, my friend closed his time on the floor with  following words, and I would like to do the same.         I continue to have hope that springs eternal in the human       breast that we don't and won't lose the greatest freedom, the       greatest country, and the greatest gift of a country any       people has ever received, and that it will not be our       generation that sees it lost.    May God bless Louie Gohmert and his family.   We will miss him.    Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my good friend from Colorado  (Mr. Lamborn) for having this Special Order for National Bible Week.   Mr. Speaker, I am elated to recognize National Bible Week once again  and to share why God's Word is such an immovable pillar, not only in my  life, but millions and millions of people's. From guidance and  encouragement to past lessons and future promises, the Bible holds the  answers to all of it.   Our nation is in the midst of a moral and spiritual war currently,  the likes of which we have never seen. The rule of law is being  trampled. Men compete in women's sports. Child pornography is used to  sell clothing. Babies continue to be murdered, even after a botched  abortion.   Now more than ever, the direction of God's Word is crucial. As we  maneuver through these woke and morally corrupt times, I pray that we,  as a country, the great United States of America, the shining city on a  hill, would find our way back to the teachings of Scripture.   America would not even exist today had God's divine providence and  written word not stirred the hearts of our Founding Fathers 246 years  ago. Only a fool would think that our Nation could ever survive without  God.   I will close with a biblical passage, and I pray that we remember  Proverbs 3:5-6: ``Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not  unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He  shall direct thy paths.''
