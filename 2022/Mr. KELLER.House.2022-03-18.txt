 Madam Speaker, U.S. Customs and Border Protection  information confirms what we know: The Biden border crisis is getting  worse.   There were 164,000 illegal alien encounters in February of this year,  up 63 percent from February 2021. You know what else is up? Fentanyl  seizures. Also, what else is up is illegal aliens with criminal  backgrounds.   What is down is deportations. When we are seeing record increases in  people coming across our border illegally, deportations are down. What  else is down is the morale of Customs and Border Protection agents. I  know this because I traveled with them on a ride-along, and they told  me that it is down because the current administration is making them  out to be the bad guys. Those are their words.   We need to support our Customs and Border Protection agents to secure  our southern border. We need to give them the tools they need to do  their job.   It is time for the President of the United States to make sure he  does his job and keeps America safe and secures our southern border.                            ____________________
