 Mr. Chair, I appreciate the leadership of  my colleague from Washington State (Mr. Newhouse), as well as the  leader from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), on this bipartisan amendment in  support of the Job Corps.   I, too, want to stand in support of the important work that the Job  Corps is doing, specifically in Ferry County.   In addition to closing other centers, the administration recently  announced its plans to terminate the agreement between our Job Corps in  Curlew and the USDA.   In rural Ferry County, which is largely publicly owned, it is right  in the midst of a million-acre national forest. The Job Corps is very  important. It is very important in that it is one of the largest  employers in the county.   It is also where young people, at-risk youth, are gaining critical  skills necessary to fight fires and to better steward our Federal  forests in eastern Washington. We are facing larger and larger  catastrophic fires. This Job Corps program is so important, as well as  the other programs that it is offering.   This amendment will stop funds from being used to close the Curlew  Job Corps, as well as others. Whether for jobs, a healthier  environment, or those on the front lines fighting forest fires in  Washington State and throughout rural America, I urge my colleagues to  vote ``yes'' and support this amendment.
