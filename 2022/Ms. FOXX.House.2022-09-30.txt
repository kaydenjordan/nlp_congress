 Madam Speaker, ``The pandemic is over.'' That is what  President Biden declared in an interview on ``60 Minutes.''   OSHA clearly hasn't gotten the memo, or it wouldn't be attempting to  revive a COVID-19 emergency temporary standard, ETS, regarding  healthcare workers and seeking to make it permanent.   Our healthcare industry is strained enough as it is without the Biden  administration demanding additional burdensome COVID-19 requirements.  This regulation is a perfect example of the left's hypocrisy.   President Biden can't have it both ways, pretending there is a  permanent pandemic when he wants to further his own emergency powers  and declaring it is over when he wants to tout his accomplishments.   It is time to let our medical professionals work in peace instead of  having to jump through these unnecessary hoops. After all, the  President said it himself: ``The pandemic is over.''                            ____________________
