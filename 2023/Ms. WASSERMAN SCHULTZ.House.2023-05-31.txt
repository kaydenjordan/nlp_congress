 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  bipartisan budget agreement and thank President Biden and his team,  particularly OMB Director Shalanda Young, for putting people over  politics, defending our values, and protecting the full faith and  credit of the United States.   My colleagues across the aisle were prepared to force a disastrous  default and crash the economy into the side of a cliff, but Democrats  will always put people over politics and our economy's durability over  default.   My friend from Oklahoma knows well that Republicans' VA  appropriations bill zeroed out guaranteed funding for our toxic-exposed  veterans in fiscal year 2025. It is in the bill in black and white. It  is why they were afraid to vote on it and pulled the bill from  consideration.   Democrats protected toxic-exposed veterans' healthcare, expanded SNAP  benefits to more food insecure people, and stopped Republicans'  dangerous budget cuts in the default on America act.   Yesterday, CBO officially scored the bill and found that  participation rates in SNAP will increase because of this compromise.  President Biden negotiated a deal that gets us through the short-term  and puts us in a good position to work through the appropriations  process.   As an appropriator, I look forward to working with my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to efficiently finish this year's budget.   Furthermore, I will remind my friend from Oklahoma that under the  Trump administration, Republicans blew a hole in the deficit with a  $1.5 trillion tax cut package that was unpaid for, so that is on them.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of the  underlying legislation.                                time  1530
