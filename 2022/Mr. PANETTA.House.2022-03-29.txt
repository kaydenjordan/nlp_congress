 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2954, the  SECURE 2.0.   This bipartisan legislation would make it easier for something that  has been getting harder and harder, saving for retirement for workers  and working families.   I commend the chairman and the ranking member for their very, very  hard work, and I thank them for including two of my bipartisan bills in  SECURE 2.0.   My Public Service Retirement Fairness Act ensures that retirement  savings programs for nonprofits and the public sector have the same  access to low-cost investments as private-sector plans.   This bill would greatly benefit many teachers and nonprofit employees  who serve in my district and also have to spend an inordinate amount on  housing by providing them access to affordable retirement plans.   My Family Attribution Modernization Act, which I worked on with my  good friend, Jodey Arrington, is also included in SECURE 2.0.   This bill would modernize outdated family attribution rules so that  women-owned businesses and other small businesses in community property  States, like California, have more flexibility and independence.    Madam Speaker, these bills, along with many, many other  provisions in this bipartisan legislation, are commonsense solutions  for the futures and the retirements of working families. That is why,  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote for SECURE 2.0.
