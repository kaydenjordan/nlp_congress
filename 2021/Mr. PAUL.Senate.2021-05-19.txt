 Mr. President, Navy Fireman 2nd Class Martin Daymond Young,  born on May 11, 1920, was one of nine children who grew up in a busy  household in the tiny Dukes community in Hancock County, KY. His family  said their goodbyes when he enlisted in the Navy in the summer of 1940  and he headed to the South Pacific--to Pearl Harbor.   Sadly, Daymond Young was one of the 429 crew members who perished  aboard the USS Oklahoma on December 7, 1941. He was 21 years old. The  tragedy of his death was even more unbearable for his family because he  was buried in a mass grave among scores of unidentified shipmates.   His siblings and particularly his twin sister, Daisy, did all they  could to keep his memory alive for their children, who remember a photo  of Daymond in his Navy uniform that was always proudly displayed in her  home. All of his nieces and nephews looked up to him even though most  had never met him.   Beginning in 2015, new dental, anthropologic and mitochondrial DNA  analyses were employed to identify those who had fallen at Pearl  Harbor, eventually certifying Daymond's remains in 2019. His family  members wanted to bury him on what would have been his 100th birthday,  May 11, 2020, but the coronavirus pandemic made travel and a public  ceremony impossible. So, finally, on May 15, 2021, the remains of  Daymond Young returned to beautiful Hancock County, KY, where he was  buried alongside his ever-devoted sister Daisy. Among those welcoming  him were his nephew, Layman Hawkins, of Lewisport, KY, and the many  relatives and residents who knew him only by his legacy of sacrifice  for his country.   The tragedy of war, the unanswered questions of forensic science, and  even the restrictions of a pandemic were ultimately unable to separate  the remains of this honorable sailor from his loving family and the  community that refused to forget him. Likewise, we are honored to  remember him, and to this returning sailor, we say, ``Welcome home.  Fair winds and following seas.''                            ____________________
