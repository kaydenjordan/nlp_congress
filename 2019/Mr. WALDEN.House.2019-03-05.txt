 Mr. Speaker, due to my attendance at memorial services in  Oregon following the untimely passing of Dennis Richardson, Oregon's  26th Secretary of State, I was unable to vote. Had I been present, I  would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 104 and ``yea'' on rollcall  No. 105.                            ____________________
