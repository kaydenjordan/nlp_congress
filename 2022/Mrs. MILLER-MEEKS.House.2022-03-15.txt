 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  service of an amazing educator in my district.   Earlier this year, Ottumwa High School announced that longtime  principal Mark Hanson would be retiring. Mark originally served as  Ottumwa's principal from 2010 to 2017 but returned to the high school  as principal this past July.   Throughout his time at OHS, Mark was a true leader and visionary. He  worked tirelessly to improve graduation rates, improve the school's  culture and curriculum, and increase opportunities for students to  participate in extracurricular activities.   Before coming to OHS, Mark remained active in the community, coaching  basketball and tennis.   Following Mark's retirement, Shelley Bramschreiber will become the  new principal. Shelley has been with Ottumwa schools since 1994. On  July 1 of this year, Shelley will become the first female principal in  school history.   Thank you to Mark for his decades of service to our community and  best of luck to Shelley. Go Bulldogs.                            Happy Birthday Wishes     Madam Speaker, I also want to take this  opportunity to wish my scheduler, Tara Pinette, a happy birthday. I  also wish a very happy birthday to my chief of staff, Tracie Gibler.   Later this month, my good friend Matt Leopold will celebrate his  birthday, and my youngest brother, Fred, has a birthday later this  month as well. Happy birthday to Matt and Freddy.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Washington for yielding to me to speak on this important topic.   Most Americans can agree that the Federal Government is very good at  creating regulations and making what should often be a simple process  extremely complicated. In recent years, Federal permitting regulations  have been some of the most overbearing and burdensome of regulations.   Landmark environmental protection laws, like the National  Environmental Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act have become  outdated and grown far too expansive. It is now nearly impossible to  secure permits in a timely, efficient, and reasonable manner. From  energy and mining projects to infrastructure development and forest  management, burdensome and duplicative permitting processes have slowed  or halted development throughout rural America.   Iowans are all too familiar with the overregulated government  permitting process. One such example is the cumbersome and unworkable  2015 waters of the United States rule, also known as WOTUS.                                time  2000    Under the 2015 definition, the Federal government was given the  authority to regulate almost any waters, including streams, ditches,  ponds, and creeks.   In fact, the Federal Government would have the authority to regulate  water on 97 percent of the land in Iowa. Let me repeat that: 97 percent  of the land in Iowa. This left farmers, ranchers, landowners, and  businesses to face confusion and burdensome restrictions on how to use  their own property. WOTUS drastically expanded the jurisdiction over  bodies of water like streams and ponds that the Clean Water Act never  intended to regulate.   Instead of burdening private citizens with confusing and ambiguous  standards that could end up costing them thousands of dollars, we  should work to ensure that the Federal Government's clean water efforts  are focused on clearly defined bodies of water.   WOTUS hurt American farmers, ranchers, landowners, and businesses, it  caused confusion, and it hindered economic development.   To help rural America, the Trump administration issued the 2020  Navigable Waters Protection Rule, also known as NWPR. The NWPR is much  more workable and keeps our water and land clean without destroying  businesses in the process.   Unfortunately, the Biden administration is taking steps to revoke the  2020 NWPR and return to the 2015 WOTUS rule. Reverting back to terrible  policies such as the WOTUS rule would have an extreme Federal overreach  and would significantly harm small businesses and cripple our country's  economic recovery.   The Trump administration also took steps to streamline processes  under the National Environmental Protection Act to improve the ability  for individuals and businesses to build, improve, and maintain  infrastructure by facilitating more efficient, effective, and timely  NEPA reviews by Federal agencies.   With our economy on the mend, the Biden administration should not be  considering unnecessary and overly burdensome government regulations.   Reverting back to these policies represents a blatant,  unconstitutional power grab aimed at taking Federal control over States  in a way that threatens the rights of farmers, ranchers, and all other  landowners in Iowa and across our great Nation. We need to let people  do their jobs and cut back on the incredible number of Federal  regulations in the permitting process.   We can protect our Nation's waterways and make improvements to  infrastructure without burdensome regulations. In Iowa and in rural  communities throughout the country, we recognize that farmers and  ranchers are the original conservationists, and that bureaucratic red  tape does not help us grow, prosper, protect our water and our land.
