 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5293, the Department of  Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2021. This bill is  sponsored by the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Mrvan), and I thank him  for introducing this bill to extend expiring authorities and programs.   The VA Expiring Authorities Act of 2021 would make VA dental  insurance programs permanent so that veterans under VA's care are able  to buy low-cost dental insurance coverage.   It would also allow veterans to continue to receive travel benefits  when seeking support at vet centers.   It would also extend VA's Communities Helping Invest through Property  and Improvements Needed, or CHIP IN for Vets pilot program by an  additional 5 years.   The CHIP IN program allows VA to accept real property donations from  nongovernment entities. The program was established by Congress in  2016. It  [[Page H4536]]  has already proven successful in delivering VA medical facilities to  veterans in Nebraska and Oklahoma.   Extending this program has been a priority of the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Jackson) and the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon). I  appreciate their leadership on this.   I am also grateful to my fellow House and Senate committee leaders-- Chairman Takano, Chairman Tester, and Ranking Member Moran--for their  work on this bill.   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 5293. Mr. Speaker,  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I just urge my  colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 189, the Veterans'  Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2021. This bill will help  ensure that benefits paid to veterans who are disabled as a result of  their military service do not lose value because of inflation.   S. 189 authorizes a cost-of-living increase for veterans and their  families next year as long as Social Security recipients receive an  increase.   Many disabled veterans and their families rely on these compensation  benefits to pay their bills, such as mortgage payments and groceries.  In some cases, these benefits may even be the veteran's only income.  Moreover, VA benefits are providing much-needed financial support to  many veterans facing uncertainty due to this pandemic.   We must pass this bill and ensure that compensation benefits for our  disabled veterans keep pace with rising costs.   I would like to thank Senator Thune for introducing this important  legislation. I urge my colleagues to support S. 189.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H4537]]         Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4172, a bill to name the  VA community-based outpatient clinic, CBOC, in Aurora, Colorado, after  Lieutenant Colonel John W. Mosley.   Lieutenant Colonel Mosley was one of the famed Tuskegee Airmen.  Mosley served honorably in World War II, as well as the Korean war and  the Vietnam war.   Mosley went on to a career in government, serving in D.C. before  returning to Colorado as a long-time community leader and advocate.   Congressman Jason Crow from Colorado has introduced this bill to name  the VA CBOC in Aurora, Colorado, after Lieutenant Colonel Mosley, and I  am in full support and hope that my colleagues will join me.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1281, a bill to name the  VA community-based outpatient clinic, or CBOC, in Gaylord, Michigan,  the Navy Corpsman Steve Andrews VA Health Care Clinic.   This bill is cosponsored by my friend, fellow marine, and ranking  member of the Subcommittee on Health, General Jack Bergman of Michigan.  I thank him for his leadership.   Navy Corpsman Steve Andrews served during the Vietnam war and  received both the Navy Commendation Medal and the Purple Heart. He was  also an active member of the Gaylord community before and after his  time in uniform. It is fitting that the VA CBOC there will carry his  name.   Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly support this legislation. I urge all of  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Bergman).    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3475, a bill to name the  VA community-based outpatient clinic, or the CBOC, in Columbus,  Georgia, the Robert S. Poydasheff VA Clinic. I am grateful to  Congressman Sanford Bishop from Georgia for introducing this bill.   Mr. Poydasheff was a soldier in the United States Army for 24 years.  He served as an infantry officer in Vietnam and later as a judge  advocate. He continued to serve his country and community after his  time in the Army by pursuing a career in public service and elected  office.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that all of my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle will join me in supporting this bill today in honor of him, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, and I  ask all of my colleagues to join me in that, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
