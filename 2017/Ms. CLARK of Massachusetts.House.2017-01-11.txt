 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so we can bring up  the Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act.   Mr. Speaker, American families are worried. Over the last month, I  have been flooded with messages from my constituents who are anxious  about the direction of our country.   Never before has our country been forced to ask its incoming  President if he is motivated by service to his country or if he is  motivated by personal enrichment. Never before have we had a President- elect who will act as both landlord and tenant of a publicly owned  property being used for private profit. Never before have we had the  same people who are running a President's businesses also act as  official advisers and agents. Never has a President-elect owed millions  of dollars of debt to foreign banks.   The next administration will shape how our tax dollars are spent, who  the Federal Government does business with, and the integrity of  America's standing in the global economy.   Every President in modern history has taken voluntary steps to ensure  his financial interests do not conflict with the needs of the American  people. Yet, the current President-elect refuses to place his assets  and his businesses in a blind trust.   The American people are left wondering whether their President-elect  will work in their best interest or to line his own pockets.   Mr. Speaker, this is unprecedented. There should be no question about  whether the administration will put the needs of Americans first. There  is  [[Page H320]]  nothing partisan about transparency and accountability that comes with  being the leader of the free world. That is why we should all support  the Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act.   This bill strengthens transparency in the Oval Office and guarantees  that the needs of the American people will never compete with or be  beholden to a President's financial interests. This bill ensures that  the President and Vice President's assets are placed in a certified  blind trust.                                time  1300    The bill also requires Presidential appointees to recuse themselves  from matters involving the President's financial conflicts of interest.  Every President in recent history, from President Johnson to President  Obama, has voluntarily used some form of blind trust or placed their  assets in an investment vehicle over which they had no control. Our  bill simply aligns the President-elect and future Presidents with this  long-held practice.   The American people are counting on our leadership. Every Democrat  and every Republican should want to eliminate uncertainty and promote  transparency and accountability in the executive branch. I ask my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so we can bring this  urgently needed legislation to the floor.
