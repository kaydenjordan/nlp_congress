 Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous question so  that we can immediately consider H.R. 1995, the Protecting Our  Communities from Gang Violence Act.   Crime is running rampant in our cities. Smash and grab is the new  normal for malls and small business owners. Carjackings are happening  with such frequency that it is now recommended that you drive in the  center lane of roads and highways. What once were beloved destinations  in our States and our communities have become overrun with street gangs  and violent criminals across this great Nation.   Now, President Biden is helping bring that crime to every suburban  and rural community in America. As we speak, the Biden administration  is using taxpayer dollars to fly and transport illegal immigrants  across this country. This is without knowledge of who these people are  or their criminal background.   Now, violent gang members have been illegally entering our country  and circumventing our laws well before the Biden administration  implemented their weak border policies. But it is gravely naive to  think these gang members are not taking full advantage of this crisis,  crossing the border with ease, hopping on these taxpayer-funded  flights, and making their way into every small town across this great  Nation. The Biden administration is, without a doubt, providing gang  members new playgrounds for their criminal behavior. This is  unacceptable in our great Nation.   As Members of Congress, we cannot sit idly by and allow our  communities to be infiltrated by gang members and exposed to violence.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1995 is simple. It will make gang members  inadmissible to and deportable from the United States of America. This  legislation should be noncontroversial. Violent and dangerous criminals  have no right to live in our communities and benefit from our country.   We must finally send a signal that we will not allow this cycle of  crime and violence to continue.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to defeat the previous question.                            ____________________
