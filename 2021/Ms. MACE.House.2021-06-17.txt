 Madam Speaker, June 17, 2015, was one of the darkest days  in Charleston, South Carolina, history. Six years ago today, nine  church members were gunned down by a white supremacist at Mother  Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.   Today I rise to honor the lives of those lost that day. South  Carolina's African-American community showed enormous restraint and an  outpouring of love during this time, even to the irredeemable; and  today we stand together, wrapped in the pride of Charleston Strong.   So today I would like to recognize Reverend and State Senator  Clementa Pinckney, Cynthia Hurd, Reverend Sharonda Coleman-Singleton,  Tywanza Sanders, Ethel Lance, Susie Jackson, Depayne Middleton Doctor,  the Reverend Daniel Simmons, and Myra Thompson.   You will always be remembered, and may you rest in peace.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle for giving me a minute on this issue. I want to thank  our veterans that have given lifelong service to their country.   Nearly two decades ago, Congress authorized the wars in Iraq and  Afghanistan, but ever since, three President's, both Republican and  Democrat, have used this permission to drag out conflicts and to get us  into new ones.   Americans who weren't even alive on 9/11 or during the invasion of  Iraq are still fighting and dying there, in Syria, across Africa, and  who knows where else. Our Founders wisely gave Congress the exclusive  constitutional authority over whether our Nation goes to war.   Sadly, Congress has failed to perform this sacred duty for far too  long. This is about restoring the powers set forth in Article I.  Congress can go to war with anyone under Article I. When Washington  drags us into a war, they aren't the ones who go do the fighting and  dying, our children are. The very least we can do is give their parents  a say in when and where and if their kids will fight and die thousands  of miles away.
