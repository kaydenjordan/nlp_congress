 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  assault weapons ban which will save lives.   Mr. Speaker, El Paso is coming up on a terrible anniversary. On  August 3, 2019, my district was the site of the deadliest targeted  attack on Latinos in modern history. Three years later, my constituents  are still recovering from their injuries.   Because Republicans have decided that unfettered access to assault  weapons is worth the routine slaughter of Americans, the domestic  terrorist who attacked my community was able to do so with a legally  purchased assault weapon.   What was once an unthinkable tragedy--the mass carnage we saw in El  Paso--is now commonplace across America. Americans are fed up, and so  am I.   Republicans have done nothing meaningful and hide behind thoughts and  prayers--a phrase so empty and devoid of action that Congress is  routinely and deservedly mocked for it.   So, Mr. Speaker, today I am proud to act. I am proud to vote on the  assault weapon ban for El Paso, for Uvalde, and for countless other  communities, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
