 Madam Speaker, let me start off by expressing my  gratitude for Chairman Neal, for his seriousness, his sincerity, and  his solemnity in his leadership in the Ways and Means Committee and in  the way he conducted this request and release of the former President's  tax returns and the writing of this legislation before us.   Because of him, throughout this odyssey, the members of the Ways and  Means Committee always knew and felt the gravity, the implications of  what it meant to release an individual's tax returns.   In fact, prior to this weekend, which was prior to my review of the  former President's tax returns, I admit, I had no intent on voting to  release them. However, that changed. That changed once we were able to  obtain the returns, based on a valid legislative purpose and confirmed  by the Supreme Court, go through the returns, and see the complete  failure of the IRS when it comes to their Presidential audit program, a  program that is absolutely necessary to ensure that the world's most  important public servant is abiding by the law, paying his or her taxes  like you and me, and free from any conflicts of interest.   But clearly, the IRS doesn't appreciate, nor does it prioritize the  importance of this program, especially during the last administration  because, as applied to the former President, not one audit was  completed, despite what the President said to the American public.   That is why I support this legislation, so that any President's  personal and business tax returns are audited and made public, and we  are aware of those returns that are audited.   I am proud to say that under the leadership and seriousness of  Chairman Neal, now Congress needs to do its job and pass H.R. 9640.
