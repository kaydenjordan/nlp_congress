 Madam Speaker, I first thank Bishop Barber for  that very powerful prayer for our Nation.   Today, the Poor People's Campaign's California Statewide Convening  will uplift the launch of the California-led campaign for the Third  Reconstruction resolution called Close the Wealth Gap, California.   Extreme poverty affects over 20 million people in California. This is  a moral disgrace.   As written in House Resolution 438, the Third Reconstruction, we need  the moral resolve to pass laws and policies that fully address  interlocking injustices, which have only deepened during the COVID-19  pandemic.   This country was founded on the moral commitment to ensure domestic  tranquility, promote general welfare, and secure liberty and justice  for all.   It is time we realize a Third Reconstruction to build an equitable,  thriving, and resilient economy from the bottom up.   That is why I am calling on my colleagues to have the political will  to make permanent the child tax credit. The most recent poverty data  show that policy decisions like the temporary CTC, income support, and  nutrition assistance cut the national child poverty rate nearly in half  in 2021. This demonstrates that poverty is a policy choice and there is  no excuse for poverty in America.   Madam Speaker, everyone deserves to live a life free from  socioeconomic policies that are punitive and destructive to their  families.                            ____________________
