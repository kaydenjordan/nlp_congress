 Madam Speaker, as a former ocean engineer, I rise on  behalf of South Carolina's First Congressional District, the Low  Country. And I rise, quite frankly, as someone who typically votes with  Republicans on these motions.   But not today.   I had hoped that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would  want  [[Page H3428]]  to engage in a constructive dialogue that addresses the devastating  impacts of flooding, intensifying storms, and rising sea levels.   But not today.   This is not the way that it used to be. President Teddy Roosevelt  established 150 national forests and five national parks. President  Reagan signed into law 38 bills that added more than 10.6 million acres  to the National Wilderness Preservation System, all with the support of  the distinguished Members of the Grand Old Party.   But not today.   The Grand Old Party has an illustrious history with environmental  conservation, a history it should be proud of.   But not today.   This Republican body does a disservice to that environmental record  by turning a blind eye to science and facts. There are certain things  that go beyond politics, impacts that touch each and every one of us,  regardless of partisanship, regardless of ideology. Climate change is  one of them. The Low Country knows this more than most.   In downtown Charleston, our medical district, which is home to  Charleston's VA hospital and our medical university, is the area that  is most prone to flooding. During a recent hurricane, the Medical  University of South Carolina was forced to float surgeons across the  campus in jon boats to treat patients, including our veterans and our  children.   Parris Island is one of the only two bases that makes enlisted  marines, and the only base that makes female enlisted marines in our  country.
