 Mr. Speaker, let me start by saying that I am a proud  Virgin Islander. I stand on the shoulders of strong Virgin Islanders  who came before me and who are known for their courage, leadership,  sacrifice, and, most importantly, their resilience. We are known for so  much more than just white sandy beaches and as a popular vacation  destination. We are made of culture-rich lands and a diverse history.   March is Virgin Islands History Month. Though not always pretty,  there is great beauty in our past that has shaped the Virgin Islands of  our present. Like most Caribbean countries, the Virgin Islands'  history, too, begins with the story of pre-Columbian inhabitants of the  islands and of slavery.   Almost 3,000 years prior to Christopher Columbus landing in 1493,  Native American tribes, such as the Ciboney, the Caribs, and the Arawak  Indians, have long inhabited the islands.   In 1493, when Columbus attempted to land on the island that I live  on, St. Croix, he was repelled at Salt River, where he met the Carib  Indians who kept him and his troops from landing and making landfall  there.   The period of Columbus' visit ultimately set the course for seven  other European flags to claim the Virgin Islands and, unfortunately,  brought demise to the indigenous people.   Today, they are found on reserved lands, and only for a few islands,  and no longer exist in the Virgin Islands.   Much of our global history was built upon slavery and colonization,  especially in the Caribbean islands. By the early 1700s, the Virgin  Islands was no stranger to enslavement and European colonization.   On the island of St. John, a Ghanaian by the name of Breffu is  credited with leading the first and one of the longest-lasting  rebellions in the Americas on the island of St. John. She empowered  more than 150 enslaved Africans to fight for their freedom and held  that island for over 6 months, where the Danes had to bring in the  Spanish Armada and the French fleet to get the slaves back in line.   Several years, almost a century, later, in 1848 on the island of St.  Croix, slaves led a rebellion, an armed insurrection, which led to the  emancipation--15 years before the United States emancipation. The  Virgin Islands and Haiti are the only two places to gain freedom  through violent overthrow.   The celebration of V.I. Emancipation Day on July 3 marks this day.  Virgin Islands' history does not end with just the bleak stories of  European colonialism and forced slavery. We have so many celebrated  heroes, from individuals who were the founders of San Francisco;  Denmark Vesey, who led the rebellion in South Carolina; Hubert  Harrison, the great socialist mind who was the thought leader for  Marcus Garvey; Edward Wilmoth Blyden, who was the founder of Pan- Africanism; Nella Larsen, one of the Harlem Renaissance writers; Ruby  Rouss, who was an aide-de-camp to Eisenhower; Sam Ebbesen, a general  and friend of Colin Powell.   Without that history and those individuals, we would not be the  Virgin Islands we are today, which I am proud to represent and call my  home and my heritage.   Throughout the month of March, let us celebrate our heritage and our  history and look to our future.   Happy Virgin Islands History Month.                            ____________________
