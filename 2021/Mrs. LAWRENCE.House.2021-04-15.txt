 Mr. Speaker, it is beyond me that in 2021 we are still  having this debate on whether men and women are paid equally. And I  just want to say to my colleague on the other side, being a Black woman  in America, I can tell you I do not feel that she has had the  discrimination and the disrespect in the pay scale that women of color  have experienced. And during the brunt of this pandemic where women are  in the forefront, those who are frontline workers, the service  industry--predominantly women. Paycheck fairness corrects this  injustice by allowing women to challenge pay discrimination and hold  employers accountable.   Many in this Chamber like to talk about leveling the playing field  for all Americans. Then let's do it by passing this bill. And in  America, when you walk in the room as a woman, you know you have  overcome and you have work to do. And please don't continue to  disrespect us by saying that everything is okay. In your world it may  be, but today we can correct that.
