 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight  the Department of Agriculture's Dairy Margin Coverage program.   The Dairy Margin Coverage program, or DMC program, is a relatively  new voluntary risk management tool for dairy producers that was  authorized in the 2018 farm bill. It replaces the Margin Protection  Program for dairy.   As everyone in agriculture knows, the industry is subject to many  unpredictable or uncontrollable factors.   This year, weather has left a sizeable impact on production.   The DMC program exists for incidents like this: for when factors  outside of our control impact agriculture yields.   The enrollment period for the DMC program has been extended through  December 20.   The USDA website has plenty of information on the program, including  a tool to help select the ideal level of coverage.   Agriculture is Pennsylvania's number one industry, with dairy being  the largest sector. With just a few days left to enroll, I would like  to encourage our hardworking dairy farmers to take advantage of the  tools at their disposal, like Dairy Margin Coverage.                            ____________________
