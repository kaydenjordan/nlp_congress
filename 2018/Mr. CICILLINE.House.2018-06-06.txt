 Mr. Speaker, there is nothing that demonstrates the  deeply held American value of living a retirement with dignity than the  promise of Social Security and Medicare. These are benefits that  America's seniors have earned after a lifetime of hard work so they can  enjoy their retirement years with dignity and economic security.   But yesterday we learned the Medicare trust fund will be depleted in  just 8 years, 3 years earlier than expected. The Social Security trust  fund will run dry just 8 years after that.   A few months ago, our Republican friends passed a huge tax cut for  the wealthiest Americans and most powerful corporations. And how do  Republicans want to pay for it: by cutting Social Security and  Medicare.   That is a bad deal for the American people. They deserve better.   When Democrats take back the majority, we are going to deliver A  Better Deal for the American people. We are going to put working people  first and we are going to ensure a secure retirement for everyone who  works hard in this country. Most importantly, we are going to return  the promise of America.                            ____________________
