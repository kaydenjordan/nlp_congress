 Mr. President, I am here today for my 206th ``Time to  Wake Up'' speech.   For colleagues who may be having a hard time keeping up with the  ethical scandals swirling around Environmental Protection Agency  Administrator Scott Pruitt, I thought today I would lay them out one by  one.   I think we all heard Donald Trump's pledge to drain the swamp and to  put an end to government corruption. That hasn't exactly worked out;  has it? Instead, swamp creatures abound, and Pruitt, a longtime enemy  of the Agency he now runs and a longtime toady of the fossil fuel  industry he is supposed to regulate, is absolutely wallowing in the  swamp. Indeed, he is so swampy that he now faces more than a dozen  Federal and State probes exploring how he has been advancing his own  interests and those of his polluter donors. So let's take a look.   Investigation No. 1 is travel expenses. Between March and May of  2017--just that short period--Mr. Pruitt spent 43 out of those 92 days  traveling to his home State of Oklahoma. Pruitt appears to have  conducted little or no official business on many of these trips. Yet  taxpayers still picked up the tab.   Last summer the EPA inspector general opened its inquiry into this  use of official resources. That inquiry has actually since been  expanded to examine the overall frequency, cost, and extent of the  Administrator's travel. Over a 6-month period in 2017, Pruitt is  estimated to have racked up nearly $200,000 in travel expenses. This  includes a $7,000 business-class flight to Italy and $58,000 spent on  military and charter flights. One set of flights to Oklahoma on a  chartered private jet cost over $14,000 alone.   Also under scrutiny is a 4-day trip that Mr. Pruitt, his staff, and  his security detail took to Morocco in December. I hear it is lovely in  Morocco in December, but it cost taxpayers more than $100,000 to  indulge Mr. Pruitt. EPA first justified the trip by saying that Pruitt  was there to promote the U.S. liquefied natural gas industry. That is  actually not in EPA's mission--but never mind. Pruitt himself then  testified before the House that he was there to negotiate part of a  free-trade agreement. Again, that is not part of EPA's mission. Plus,  there is no evidence that Pruitt even conferred with our Trade  Representative. You would think that he might have picked up the phone  to give himself just a little bit of cover if that was going to be his  story. It was eventually reported that Pruitt's Morocco junket was  largely arranged by a lobbyist friend who later was paid $40,000 a  month--$40,000 a month--retroactively to January 1, to represent the  Moroccan Government.  [[Page S2714]]    Pruitt's frequent international travel plans are heavily influenced  by lobbyists and rightwing donors. His trip to Rome appears to have  been largely orchestrated by the head of the Federalist Society, and it  included dinner at a five-star hotel with Cardinal George Pell, who has  been under investigation for multiple allegations of child sexual  assault. The cardinal is a climate denier. So maybe that makes it all  OK for Pruitt.   A planned trip to Australia was organized by a consultant and former  lobbyist for foreign governments. Another planned trip to Israel  appears to have been at least in part scheduled to allow him to promote  a water purification company recommended by Republican megadonor  Sheldon Adelson. Reports say Pruitt actually gave his staff a bucket  list of places he wanted to visit at public expense, and he told them  to arrange pretexts for his travels.   A lot of the cost of these trips is Pruitt's security detail. That  takes us in to investigation Nos. 2, 3, and 4, which stem from  Administrator Pruitt's over-the-top spending on security measures.   The Environmental Protection Agency's inspector general and the House  oversight committee are both investigating this spending, including  almost $3 million that Pruitt has spent on his 24-hours-a-day, 7-days- a-week, 20-person security detail. This security phalanx accompanies  him everywhere--on personal travel home to Oklahoma and on family trips  to the Rose Bowl and Disneyland. Pruitt's security detachment is more  than three times as large as previous EPA Administrators, none of whom  had 24/7 protection. Many of the agents assigned to Pruitt's security  team are pulled from EPA's enforcement arm, leaving fewer agents to  actually investigate environmental crimes. But they do help him to get  to fancy Washington restaurants fast, using lights and sirens to  expedite Pruitt's travel to his dinner dates.   Pruitt has also fortified his office. He installed a $43,000 cone-of- silence, supersecret phone booth. He had biometric locks installed on  his office doors and had his office swept for bugs--a no-bid job, by  the way, that went to a business partner of the guy who was then his  top security agent. The Agency even explored spending $70,000 on a  bulletproof desk for him.   All he is missing is the secret decoder ring.   The evidence that Pruitt cites to justify all of this security  spending, including business-class and first-class plane tickets he  claimed were required by security concerns, is remarkably thin. When he  testified last month before House appropriators, Pruitt claimed that it  was all justified by the Agency's inspector general. Well, on Monday,  Senator Carper and I heard directly from the inspector general, and the  story is not as Pruitt testified.   Pruitt wanted 24/7 security starting on his first day as  Administrator--not as a result of any threats and not because the  inspector general told him that round-the-clock security was justified.  The inspector general, in fact, never told him that. It is not the  inspector general's job. It looks like Administrator Pruitt misled two  House committees when he testified.   Let's move on to investigation No. 5, which involves an inspector  general inquiry into a possible violation of anti-lobbying rules. Once  you are on the Federal payroll exerting the responsibilities of  government, you are not supposed to engage in lobbying. During an April  2017 meeting with the National Mining Association, Pruitt encouraged  the group to press President Trump to withdraw from the Paris climate  accord. The GAO is also looking into improper lobbying activity after  he appeared in a lobbying organization's promotional video, opposing,  by the way, the clean water rule. That GAO investigation is  investigation No. 6.   Investigation No. 7 concerns an inspector general probe into Pruitt's  use of an obscure provision of the Safe Drinking Water Act to  circumvent the usual civil service process to hire and promote staff.  Pruitt used this loophole to hire lobbyists to oversee EPA functions  and to award huge raises to a couple of favorite political aides from  his Oklahoma days. He did this even after the White House had rejected  those proposed pay increases.   One of Pruitt's closest aides may not have even shown up to work for  3 months. Imagine that--not showing up to work for 3 months despite  drawing a nearly $180,000 salary. That is great work, if you can get  it. Incredibly--and I mean that literally--Pruitt testified to the  House that he didn't know whether this senior aide was coming to work  on not. You would think that after 3 months of not seeing this  individual at work, you might have a clue. Well, the EPA inspector  general can help the Administrator answer that question in the eighth  investigation on the list.   Now, every good swamp creature needs a swamp den, and Scott Pruitt  found himself just the place, paying $50 a night for a luxury Capitol  Hill condo co-owned by the wife of an energy lobbyist. Both the EPA's  inspector general and the House oversight committee are investigating  whether this below-market value housing arrangement constituted an  illicit gift. If you have lost track, these are investigations Nos. 9  and 10.   By the way, when the story broke about his swamp den, Pruitt denied  that this lobbyist lobbied EPA. Well, it turns out that Federal  lobbying disclosures and internal emails show that this lobbyist did in  fact lobby EPA, even meeting with Pruitt himself on behalf of an  industry client and also pushing Pruitt to name people favored by his  client to EPA science advisory boards.   That brings us to investigation No. 11. Pruitt has systemically  tilted EPA's science advisory committees toward his industry donors,  replacing academic scientists with industry-tied representatives. The  GAO is examining the role that Pruitt's political appointees played in  selecting industry-connected members to replace expert scientists on  science advisory boards.   Investigation No. 12 is unfolding back home in Oklahoma. The Oklahoma  Bar Association is looking into charges that Pruitt lied when he told  our Senate Environment and Public Works Committee during his  confirmation hearing last year that he had not conducted business using  private email addresses as Oklahoma's attorney general. Well, it turns  out that it looks like he did. Just last night, news broke that the EPA  inspector general is investigating Pruitt's use of private email  accounts, including questions of whether the Agency is properly  preserving records of the Administrator's private emails and including  those records in responses to Freedom of Information Act searches.   That makes the 13th investigation.   So there you have it--a baker's dozen so far of investigations into  Pruitt's conduct as EPA Administrator. Those are just the allegations  that have ramped up to the level of an official investigation. There  are scores of other scandals roiling the EPA. All you have to do is  pick up a newspaper, and you will be bombarded by stories of Pruitt's  truly swampy behavior. There are thousands of pages of communications  between Scott Pruitt and industry when he was attorney general of  Oklahoma that the current attorney general of Oklahoma is fighting to  prevent the public from seeing. There are millions of dollars of  political fundraising by Scott Pruitt from the fossil fuel industry  that he has never told us about. If he has withheld disclosures that  bear on his conflicts of interest, new investigations could result.    While Scott Pruitt dodges full disclosure of all his swampy industry  ties, he has let lobbyists and fossil fuel and chemical industry  operatives infiltrate throughout the EPA. The Associated Press found  that ``nearly half of the political appointees hired at the  Environmental Protection Agency under Trump have strong industry  ties.'' Pruitt rolled back an Obama rule controlling methane leaks  after he met with oil executives at the Trump hotel in Washington.  Pruitt halted environmental protections for an area in southwest Alaska  just hours after meeting with the mining executives looking to dig a  mine there. Pruitt's EPA protected an emissions rule loophole for a  trucking company shortly after Pruitt met with the company's  executives. It is government by ``I know a guy,'' with Pruitt as the  polluters' guy.   It is impossible not to notice the odor of self-dealing and  corruption emanating from the Scott Pruitt EPA. When I talk about  Pruitt with Rhode Islanders, they almost always ask me  [[Page S2715]]  the same questions: How does he still have a job? Why hasn't the  President fired this guy?   One answer goes back to the President himself. When Pruitt's scandals  started to snowball last month, oil and gas magnate Harold Hamm, a  billionaire patron of Scott Pruitt's, lobbied President Trump to keep  him on. Twenty-two polluter front groups, led by the infamous Heartland  Institute, so-called, wrote a letter to President Trump lauding  Pruitt's what they call ``positive record of reform unmatched by any of  Pruitt's predecessors.'' Who is behind those 22 polluter front groups?  Guess what. It is those climate denial champions, the Koch brothers, to  the tune of at least $87 million in funding.   The test in Trumptown is whether Harold Hamm and Charles and David  Koch are happy. And they are. Polluters are free to pollute for free,  and climate change gets scrubbed out of official communications. Big- spending polluters are happy, happy, happy, and that is why Scott  Pruitt remains as EPA Administrator in the Trump swamp.   It doesn't have to be this way. The words of Woodrow Wilson are still  true today about legislative oversight. He said:         It is the proper duty of a representative body to look       diligently into every affair of government and to talk much       about what it sees. It is meant to be the eyes and the voice,       and to embody the wisdom and will of its constituents.    Our constituents--my constituents, anyway--are not just the big  polluters like Harold Hamm and the Koch brothers. The polluters may  have billions to spend in politics, which they do, but they have very  different interests than the millions of regular Americans who look to  EPA to protect the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the climate  we must inhabit. Where are the eyes and the voice in the present  majority for these millions of Americans? Our silence in the face of  this flagrant corruption is deafening.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, National Police Week pays special  honor to the law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in the  line of duty for the safety and protection of our citizens and  communities. I am proud to cosponsor the resolution designating  National Police Week as we recognize the service and spirit of all the  officers who diligently exhibit what Victor Hugo called ``conscience in  the service of justice.''   I am especially grateful for the men and women of Rhode Island's  local and State police who put their lives on the line every day to  keep our families safe. As a former U.S. Attorney and State attorney  general, I have worked closely with some of Rhode Island's finest  police officers, and I believe they are among the best in the country.  Supporting the vital mission of the police and fostering strong  relationships between our communities and law enforcement was a top  priority for me in those roles. Here in the Senate, I remain committed  to supporting our brave law enforcement officers, their departments,  and their families.   I met this week with Colonel James J. Mendonca, chief of the Central  Falls Police Department and president of the Rhode Island Police Chiefs  Association. Under his leadership, the association is working to make  Rhode Island a national leader in gun violence prevention, drunk  driving awareness, and community engagement.   Law enforcement officers are the guardians of our communities, often  paying the ultimate price for our safety. As we recognize the service  and sacrifice of the law enforcement community this National Police  Week, I am particularly mindful of the names of some 50 officers from  Rhode Island etched onto the National Law Enforcement Officers  Memorial, including some Federal officers who died while on duty in  Rhode Island.   In the words of the old hymn:       Now the laborer's task is o'er;      Now the battle day is past . . .      Father, in Thy gracious keeping      Leave we now thy servant sleeping.    In Rhode Island and across the United States, we remember and honor  their vigilance, compassion, and valor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as a young man, I lived with my father  while he served as U.S. Ambassador to Laos. I came to know it as a  heartbreakingly beautiful country, with lovely, kind people, into which  our international contest with communism violently intruded.   The goal of the U.S. in Laos at the time was to prevent North  Vietnamese forces from using Laos as a supply line for attacks on South  Vietnam, along what was known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and to prevent  Laos itself from falling under Communist domination by the Pathet Lao  forces.   So began a covert war in Laos, funded by the CIA, in which at least  35,000 Lao and Hmong perished.   The legendary Hmong military leader, General Vang Pao, operated out  of a base at Long Tieng in the mountains of Laos. He told the New York  Times in 2008, ``There were three missions that were very important  that were given to us and to me. . . . One was stopping the flow of the  North Vietnamese troops through the Ho Chi Minh Trail to go to the  south through Laos. Second was to rescue any American pilots during the  [[Page S2722]]  Vietnam war. Third, to protect the Americans that navigated the B-52s  and the jets to bomb North Vietnam.''   After the war, thousands of displaced Hmong refugees were obliged to  flee Laos. They fled into Thailand, to countries in Europe, and--in  many cases--to the United States. My State of Rhode Island is proud to  have had many settle and build their lives in our communities.   The Hmong Veterans' Service Recognition Act passed into law this  year, finally allowing naturalized Hmong- and Laotian-American veterans  to be buried in U.S. national cemeteries. I am grateful to my fellow  Rhode Islander Philip Smith of the Lao Veterans of America for his  determined advocacy on behalf of Hmong and Lao veterans.   Twenty-one years ago, the Clinton administration authorized a plaque  to be placed at Arlington National Cemetery commemorating the valor of  the Lao soldiers who aided American forces during the Vietnam war. It  is a fitting honor for those brave combat veterans that they lie beside  old comrades-in-arms, a way of keeping the promise inscribed on this  memorial plaque, which pledges that the Hmong and Lao veterans'  ``patriotic valor and loyalty in the defense of liberty and democracy  will never be forgotten.''   After my father retired, he heard that local opposition had arisen to  a proposed Lao temple not far from here in Virginia. He went with his  military aide and CIA station chief from the Laos days to testify at  the local hearing. The military aide was General Richard Trefry, then  the commander of White House military operations, who in full military  regalia testified that, without the courageous Lao resistance, led by  Vang Pao out of the base at Long Tieng, there would be 1,000 more  American names on the Vietnam War Memorial.   It is with that sense of abiding gratitude that we remember the  bravery of those Hmong troops and their dedication to fight for  democracy and to protect the lives of so many young Americans at war in  Southeast Asia.                            ____________________
