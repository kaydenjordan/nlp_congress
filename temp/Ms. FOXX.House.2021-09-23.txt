 Mr. Speaker, the American people are outraged, and they  have every right to be. I am outraged with them.   All they have seen thus far in this administration is the buck being  passed and both a President and his administration that refuse to  uphold the basic tenets of leadership. This administration has ruined,  mishandled, and dissembled every issue it has touched.   Americans are fearful that the country that they love and respect is  being run into the ground at an alarming speed. Americans deserve  answers, and our allies across the world deserve them as well.   Mr. Speaker, Americans feel betrayed. They feel that they have been  betrayed by their own government. That feeling of betrayal was  extremely palpable when Americans were stranded in Afghanistan because  of an arbitrary deadline from the Taliban that this administration  caved to.   In the following days, there were no answers, only speculation as to  how many Americans were still left in Afghanistan who wanted to leave.  Even now, as this administration grapples with how to respond to the  Taliban's takeover, you would be hard-pressed to find real answers.    In a so-called classified briefing yesterday, Members got no concrete  answers. It was a pitiful--I am saying ``pitiful''--display of willful  ignorance and incompetence.   Mr. Speaker, if you look at the past 8 months of the Biden  administration, that incompetence is everywhere: the fall of  Afghanistan, our open borders, skyrocketing inflation, reckless  spending, record levels of unemployment and unfilled jobs, growing  national security threats.   Refusing to respect the rule of law may be the worst, Mr. Speaker.  These are just a few of the crises that have grown exponentially as the  days go by.   Mr. Speaker, there is a common thread that you find in each of these  circumstances, and it is that acceptance of the situation and  accountability are virtually nonexistent.   Mr. Speaker, it is downright shameful that America has been taken  down this rocky and unsettling path, and I fear we may never be able to  fully recover. President Biden and his administration cannot simply  sweep every new crisis under the rug and move on, but based on what has  happened thus far, I suspect we will see more of the same.   The American people deserve better than abdicated leadership and a  consistent failure to uphold our values.                            ____________________
