 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the bill that is before us. I  not only oppose the bill that is before us, but I also have to oppose  the process by which the remaining fiscal year 2019 bills are being  dealt with by the new majority.   Anything but a full open rule on appropriations bills was absolutely  condemned by the Democrats for the past 8 years. However, the new  majority, as one of their first actions, has proposed a closed rule for  all four appropriations bills this week.                                time  1245    I, along with my colleagues, am dismayed at the prospect of adopting  the Senate-passed Agriculture appropriations bill to represent the  House's position on funding and policy matters for our farmers,  ranchers, producers, consumers, and nearly all the citizens impacted by  the great work that has been done by USDA, FDA, and the CFTC.   The priorities of literally hundreds of Members were part of the  original FY19 Republican-led legislation.   Around 10 months ago, we began the process of developing a House bill  with House priorities. We drafted H.R. 5961 after holding five  oversight hearings, after receiving and reviewing nearly 6,000 bills  and report requests that were submitted by over 350 Members of  Congress, after we incorporated bipartisan House Member requests  covering House priorities from every corner of the Nation and from all  demographics, after we held a subcommittee markup with full  participation by the Agriculture Subcommittee members, and after we  held a full committee markup that lasted several hours and was an open  process by which all the members of the committee, Democrats and  Republicans, could offer amendments.   The House Members invested hundreds of hours to produce a spending  bill that is best for the needs and the priorities of the constituents  back home, whether they came from rural, whether they came from  suburban, or whether they come from urban communities.   Starting this past summer, we started the process of negotiating the  House and Senate bills and reports to arrive at a four-corner agreement  between the House and the Senate. The House and the Senate majority and  minority parties made tremendous progress in coming along with a  negotiated agreement.   After all of that time and effort that was invested in the process,  why would we throw it all away today?   I want to point out that over the course of the past 10 months and  during my 6 years that I have served as chairman of the Appropriations  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee, it has been an honor to work beside my  friend and my colleague and now the incoming chairman, Mr. Bishop of  Georgia, as we develop the bills to meet the needs of our fellow  citizens.   But now we have an Agriculture appropriations bill in front of us  today which totals $23.1 billion and $101 million below the Senate- passed Agriculture appropriations bill. And I will point out that the  $101 million represents a change to the Senate bill made by the House  majority to reduce funding for the Special Supplemental Feeding Program  for Women, Infants, and Children.   Let me provide this Chamber with a few of the examples where this  current bill fails to fund House Member priorities:  [[Page H390]]    Regarding public health, the House Republican bill included $3.1  billion for the Food and Drug Administration, while the new Democratic  proposal that is before us includes only $2.9 billion for the Food and  Drug Administration. The higher levels in the Republican bill are  critical to helping industry advance their medical product innovations  to the marketplace sooner, safer, and with greater efficiency. The  ultimate beneficiary is the American consumer or the patient.   Also, compared to the House Republican bill, the Democratic bill  fails to include two provisions that place limits on chicken imported  from China. The Republican bill includes an outright ban on Chinese  chicken in school meals, while the Democratic bill fails to include  this protection for our children.   Regarding rural broadband, in FY 2018, we established a pilot program  to expand broadband infrastructure to rural communities. One of the  greatest needs that I have heard when talking to my constituents in  rural Alabama--and I know this is the same from other Members whom I  have talked to across the Nation--this bill provides $125 million less  than what we provided in the House bill.   When it comes to agriculture research, our Republican bill included  nearly $30 million more for National Institute of Food and Agriculture  for research priorities of House Members who are not included in the  Democratic proposal.   When it comes to rural infrastructure, the Republican bill included  language to secure set-aside funds for persistent poverty counties in  rural areas. This provision is vital to rural communities across the  country that face challenges escaping poverty. This language is not  included in the Democratic bill, and so the new majority chose to  dismiss this protection for the rural poor.   These are just a few examples of why the new House majority's  adoption of a Senate-passed bill is not going in the right direction.   The other side wants to claim that these bills are bipartisan, but  they are clearly not bicameral, and they have no input from the 435  House Members.   Some of the great House appropriators of our time on both sides of  the aisle would probably be rolling over in their graves right now if  they knew of such a move to take up Senate spending bills without any  House input.   So I urge my fellow Members to stand up for the House priorities for  public health and for rural development and reject a strategy of  passing the Senate bills, which at the end of the day is not going to  bring us any closer to resolving the partial government shutdown.   To paraphrase the President's remarks two nights ago: In order for us  to resolve this funding dispute, we need to invest in border security  not because we hate the people on the outside of our borders, but  because we love the people within our borders. The only thing that is  immoral is for politicians to stand by and do nothing.   So I would encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Yoho), who serves on the authorizing committee, the  Agriculture Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo), who serves on the Agriculture, Rural  Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Subcommittee. He has been a vital part of that  subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, at this time I yield such time as she  may consume to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Granger), the new  ranking member of the Appropriations Committee.    Madam Speaker, at this time I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell), who serves on the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and also the Armed  Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Michigan.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  the State of Washington (Mr. Newhouse), who serves on the  Appropriations Committee.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As I noted earlier, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee  received over 350 Members who came before our subcommittee and  submitted requests. Many of those requests included support for animal  disease and for plant pests destroying agriculture products. Let me  just give an example of some that we heard.   The House bill included $15 million to fight the pest from China  called the spotted lanternfly. This pest is destroying fruits,  vegetables, and ornamentals in the mid-Atlantic States.   The House bill included $5 million more for the oriental fruit fly  that ravaged south Florida.   The House bill and also the House report included higher amounts for  the citrus greening disease killing the orange groves across Florida.   I can give numerous examples of other House priorities and directives  included in the House bill and report by the majority that have been  dismissed by the Senate bill. Like I said, these are just some examples  that our Members have requested. It has been important to their  districts. They thought it was very important for agriculture in their  regions.   Again, by us adopting the bill today, we would be doing this for  nothing.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), who is another member of the Appropriations  Committee. He, of course, chaired the Transportation, Housing and Urban  Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee in the 115th Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Florida an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to say, as it has already been said by many  of my colleagues here on the Republican side, that this bill serves  only to give a false impression that the new majority is trying to  resolve our funding differences.   The American people want and need both enhanced border security and  funding of remaining government agencies that are operating on limited  staff currently, as we speak. This bill is really an affront to the  House of Representatives and to the citizens who elected them to serve  them because, as has been said over and over this afternoon, there has  been no input from any of the 435 House Members into this legislation.   Therefore, in closing, Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to  vote ``no'' on this legislation that is before us this afternoon, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    I am, in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit restores a House  priority that had overwhelming support when we put together the FY 2019  Agriculture bill during the last Congress.   As I mentioned in my opening statement, our House bill last year  placed a high priority on delivery of broadband to the unserved and  underserved populations in rural America. Eighty percent of the 24  million American households that do not have reliable, affordable,  high-speed internet, are in rural areas.                                time  1345    That is according to the most recent report by the Federal  Communications Commission. Again, 80 percent are in rural areas.   Reliable and affordable internet connectivity is fundamental for  economic activity throughout the United States. It is also a  fundamental need for rural American households, for schools, and for  healthcare centers.   The National Agriculture and Rural Prosperity Task Force recommended  connectivity for all rural Americans because it has become a modern-day  necessity. It is not simply an amenity anymore. In today's information  age and where we live today, it is driving our global economy.   Our House appropriation bill last year included $550 million for this  new pilot program. This motion that is now before us will simply add an  additional $125 million to the $440 million in the bill before us  today.   This higher level will not fully address the multi-billion-dollar  requirement to address rural broadband internet needs, but it is a wise  and necessary investment.   The new rural broadband program that was designed by USDA this year  takes into account lessons learned from prior-year broadband  initiatives.   The new pilot program is a good balance between grants to the  neediest communities and low-cost loans to those communities and  citizens that can afford the loans.   Mr. Speaker, you might not find a great deal of agreement between the  priorities of President Trump and former President Obama, but the vital  need for rural broadband is one of those things. This motion is a  modest proposal that all of us feel obligated to support, regardless of  your politics.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the motion, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
