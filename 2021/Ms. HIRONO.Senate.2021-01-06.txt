 Mr. President, it has been hard, at times, to find the  words to describe the full harm that Donald Trump has inflicted on our  country. We can spend hours dissecting how his policies have made us  less safe and less healthy, but his Presidency has also been a profound  moral failure.   Let me tell you a story. A few years ago, a father from Hawaii joined  me at one of my talk-story sessions in my office, and he asked me a  question that struck me hard at that time and has stuck with me until  today. He said: How can I tell my son that lying is not OK when the  President of the United States lies every single day? I struggled to  answer his question then, and I am not sure I could offer an adequate  answer now.   But this conversation remains a clear example of how we do not live  in normal times. How is it normal as we and the world watched in horror  as an angry mob stormed the U.S. Capitol? Blood was shed. People were  hurt. Vandalism occurred.   It is not normal when we have a President who lies every single day.  And even in the face of this vandalism, this mob, he really doesn't  have much to say except: I love you. You should go home now.   It is not normal when, in the middle of a pandemic that has claimed  the lives of over 350,000 Americans, which is nearly the combined  population of the islands of Maui and the Big Island, we have a  President who only seems to care about spreading conspiracies to  undermine confidence in our elections and our democracy.   It is not normal when duly elected Senators who took an oath to  uphold the Constitution pull a stunt to try and nullify millions of  votes in six States so that Donald Trump can remain President. I call  this effort a stunt because it is doomed to fail.   We have a strong bipartisan majority, as noted in the vote that we  just took, in both Chambers of Congress who reject this stunt, and  courts have ruled against Trump and his allies in more than 60 cases.   So whenever this farce ends, the result will be the same: Donald  Trump will have lost the election, and Joe Biden will become the 46th  President of the United States.   You can tell a lot about a person from the way they handle defeat.  The way Donald Trump has handled defeat says a lot about who he is.  Watching so many of our colleagues indulge the President tells us a lot  about them too.   We don't have to look back very far in history to find examples of  candidates who lost tough races but demonstrated their character in  defeat. Our colleague Senator Romney graciously conceded his defeat to  President Obama in noting:         At a time like this, we can't risk partisan bickering and       political posturing. Our leaders have to reach across the       aisle to do the people's work, and we citizens also have to       rise to the occasion.    And in 2000, during an election with substantial irregularities and  partisan intervention from the Supreme Court, Al Gore, nevertheless,  put his country first and he said:         Let there be no doubt, while I strongly disagree with the       Court's decision, I accept it. . . . And tonight, for the       sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our       democracy, I offer my concession.    As I reflect on the service of these distinguished public servants  and the acts they took to maintain our democracy, I am also drawn to  remarks President Obama made 4 years ago in his farewell address to the  Nation when he warned that our democracy is threatened whenever we take  it for granted.   It is a particularly sage warning as we contend with the President of  the United States seeking to nullify a free and fair election simply  because he lost. We have to stand up, speak out, and fight back because  our democracy itself is at stake.   American democracy has endured over these centuries in large part  because our institutions serve as guardrails to keep us from going over  the cliff. As elected officials, we can strengthen these guardrails by  listening to our own conscience in moments of peril, by having what our  friend John Lewis called ``an executive session with myself.''   Before making a big decision, John would say: Listen self, this is  what you must do; this is where you must go. Today, we can follow  John's example, listen to our conscience, stand up for our  Constitution, and do what is right   I yield the floor.
