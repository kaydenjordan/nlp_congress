 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my  amendment to defund Joe Biden's radical Occupational Safety and Health  Administration.   Under Joe Biden, OSHA attempted to fire 84 million Americans if they  didn't take an experimental vaccine or show their private medical  documents to their employer.   The Supreme Court had to step in and tell Joe Biden he did not have  the authority to force Big Pharma's experimental vaccine on the  American people.   It shouldn't take the Supreme Court to stop OSHA from attempting to  force an experimental vaccine on 84 million Americans.   I had the opportunity to question the OSHA Assistant Secretary during  an Education and the Workforce Committee hearing. I asked him if he  agreed with the court decision and would commit to never attempting to  force a vaccine mandate again. He refused.   We must rein in OSHA, which is exactly what this amendment does.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, what is reckless is trying to  force 84 million American workers to take an experimental vaccine. OSHA  needs to be reined in. It took the Supreme Court's action to stop them.   Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment to hold the Biden  administration accountable, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today in support of my  amendment to cut the salary of Assistant Secretary for the Office of  Civil Rights at the Department of Education to $1.   The Assistant Secretary has continually refused to enforce current  Title IX law, which puts our young girls in danger. Under current  statute, the Department of Education is required to protect young women  and girls from being forced to compete against biological men in  athletics, but the Biden administration's Department of Education is  ignoring the law to impose their radical political agenda on our  daughters by forcing them to compete against biological males.   The Assistant Secretary's office has proposed two Title IX rules that  violate congressional intent for Title IX.   Title IX was created to protect girls' sports and girls' spaces,  including bathrooms and locker rooms, not to promote a radical leftwing  political ideology.   The Assistant Secretary for the Office of Civil Rights at the  Department of Education is not following congressional intent.   Please join me in standing up for our daughters and all female  athletes by supporting this amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I am being very serious, and  this is not petty. We want to reduce her salary to what she is worth.   Title IX was specifically established to give girls and women  opportunities in education and athletics, and ``sex'' in Title IX  clearly was meant to be biologic and genetic, not sexual identity.   This is dangerous for our girls both emotionally and physically to  have biological men participating in their athletics and entering their  locker rooms and bathrooms.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of my  amendment to cut the salary of Assistant Secretary for Occupational  Safety and Health Douglas Parker to $1.   Under Joe Biden, OSHA attempted to fire 84 million Americans if they  didn't take an experimental COVID vaccine or show their private medical  documents to their employer.   Assistant Secretary Parker is an unelected bureaucrat. He does not  have the power to force 84 million people to take an experimental  vaccine or lose their job.   Thankfully, the Supreme Court stopped OSHA from implementing their  rule because it was illegal and unconstitutional.   It shouldn't take the Supreme Court to stop OSHA from attempting to  force an experimental vaccine on 84 million Americans.   When I questioned Assistant Secretary Parker during an Education and  the Workforce Committee hearing, he refused to agree with the court  decision and would not commit to never again attempting to force a  vaccine mandate on the American people.   We must rein in Assistant Secretary Parker and the entire bloated  bureaucracy that is targeting the American people.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2200     Madam Chair, I urge support of this  amendment to hold the Biden administration accountable for their  illegal and unconstitutional COVID vaccine mandate, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my  amendment to cease all funding to the corrupt World Health Organization  because they lied repeatedly about COVID's origin and then defended  communist China after the outbreak.   Last year alone, Congress approved $434 million for the WHO, and the  Biden administration has been actively working to circumvent the  Senate's constitutional authority to approve treaties that would give  the WHO control over pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response.   This would be a complete surrender of our national sovereignty to an  unaccountable, unelected, and corrupt international bureaucracy. It  would also supercharge the WHO's power and authority to promote leftist  agendas like abortion, gender identity ideology, climate change, and  more.   The nightmare scenario is the Biden administration surrendering our  sovereignty to the WHO to institute global vaccine mandates.   The WHO has gone far beyond its initial purpose of being a health  advisory organization and has transformed itself into a tyrannical  governing body.   We must cease funding to the WHO and not give in to this power grab.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5836]]         Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my  amendment to prohibit funding of Biden's Office of Population Affairs  at the Department of Health and Human Services.   This office is used by Assistant Secretary for Health Rachel Levine  to promote gender transition procedures for children and title X  abortion resources with taxpayer dollars.   The Office of Population Affairs released a guide called Gender- Affirming Care and Young People to sidestep parents and provide  children with information on chemical castration drugs and surgical  castration procedures.   Federal tax dollars are used by the Office of Population Affairs to  run a website called Find a Family Planning Clinic that links to  abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood.   The Biden administration uses the Office of Population Affairs to  promote the radical transgender agenda while preying on vulnerable  children.                                time  2210    My amendment to the HHS appropriations bill would defund this deeply  political office.   Mr. Chair, I urge everyone to support this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the American taxpayer is weary  of their money being squandered on programs like this.   The Office of Population Affairs is a complete waste of taxpayer  dollars. Parents should be deciding what is best for their children,  not the Federal Government.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
