 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to work with Mr.  Engel, Mr. Royce, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. And Mr. Poe, it has been a great  pleasure and honor to work with you in a bipartisan manner on our  Foreign Affairs Committee.   I am very proudly standing here, of course, in support of this United  States-Israel Security Assistance Authorization Act, which recognizes  Israel's right to defend itself and writes into law the continued  cooperation between our two countries.   Defending Israel is in our national security interest, as is ensuring  our great friend and ally is safe. It is more important than ever, as  mentioned by my colleagues here today.   When you look at the region, there is reason to be worried: Hamas in  Gaza, rebuilding its rocket arsenal and calling for Israel's  destruction; Iran now threatening to dramatically increase its  enrichment of uranium while constructing military bases in Syria; ISIS  wreaking havoc in Sinai; and Hezbollah pointing 150,000 missiles at  Israel.   So we must continue strengthening Israel's defenses, and this  important bill codifies the memorandum of understanding with Israel  signed by the Obama administration, the largest U.S. military  assistance package ever.   The measure also expands U.S.-Israel cooperation in areas of mutual  interest, including authorizing USAID to partner with Israel to aid  low-income countries; by leveraging Israeli innovations in the water,  food, security, energy, and global health sectors.   In an increasingly polarized Washington, Israel can never be a  partisan issue. That is why I am so glad this is not a partisan issue.  I urge my colleagues to support it.
