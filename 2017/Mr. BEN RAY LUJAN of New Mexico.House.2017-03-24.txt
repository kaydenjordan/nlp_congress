 Mr. Speaker, my Republican  colleagues have called TrumpCare everything from an act of mercy to a  rescue mission. Now, I might live at the end of a long dirt road, but I  didn't fall off the turnip truck yesterday and neither did the American  people.   Congressional Republicans are jamming their catastrophic bill that  will take health insurance away from 24 million Americans, raise your  premiums, raise your deductibles, raise your out-of-pocket costs, and  will slap a crushing age tax on those over the age of 50.   Republicans in Congress promised they would lower costs, but this  mess raises costs on families. Not only does the CBO tell us premiums  will increase 15 to 20 percent, but TrumpCare will allow insurance  companies to increase deductibles and out-of-pocket costs.   Under the guise of State flexibility, Republicans say they are  shifting responsibilities to States. Here is what that means: TrumpCare  will force States to raise taxes and ration care. It will repeal the  requirement for insurance plans to cover doctor visits, emergency room  care, prescription drug coverage, and even mental health services.   Everyone is entitled to their own opinions but not their own facts.  The fact is TrumpCare will raise your premiums, raise your deductibles,  and hurt millions of hardworking families.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
