 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise during National Police Week to  honor the men and women of the law enforcement community and to condemn  the ongoing attacks of those members of our law enforcement community.   In particular, to Wisconsin's law enforcement community, I say: Thank  you.   The past year has been particularly tough on our law enforcement  officers. Just outside the State Capitol of Wisconsin in Madison is the  Wisconsin Law Enforcement Memorial.   Last year, this memorial was vandalized. A criminal took a  sledgehammer to the granite, which is etched with the names of the men  and women who died in the line of duty protecting our communities.   Last week, six more heroes had their names added to the law  enforcement memorial, but the ceremony was interrupted by antipolice  protestors. During the prayer, protestors yelled that the deaths of  these officers, whose names were being etched into the memorial, were  not a sacrifice.   Antipolice protestors held up signs with hateful words and disrupted  a solemn ceremony with vile chants. It was disgusting to see the  absolute lack of respect and the display of hatred and complete  ignorance.   Contrary to the antipolice protestors at the ceremony, these officers  are heroes. They died protecting us. They died protecting our  communities.   Let me tell you about just one of them. Officer John Hetland was one  of the names added to the Wisconsin memorial this year. He was a 24- year veteran of the Racine Police Department. Officer Hetland was a  hero. He made a commitment to serve and protect our communities,  whether on or off duty. When a local business was being robbed at  gunpoint, Officer Hetland attempted to stop the suspect. Officer  Hetland was murdered. He was shot in the chest by this criminal. He  died protecting our community.   We have seen antipolice rhetoric go too far. After riots broke out in  Kenosha, officers from Kenosha, Racine, Walworth, Rock, Waukesha, and  Milwaukee Counties and across the State of Wisconsin put their lives on  the line to defend Kenosha and protect the people in our communities.   I will never forget hearing those same vulgar chants when criminals  attacked officers in the streets of Kenosha. As fires were being set  throughout the city, I remember watching officers duck as Molotov  cocktails were being thrown at them, as water bottles filled with  concrete were being thrown at them and hurled in their direction. Even  as an officer was struck in the head by a brick and knocked  unconscious, the criminals cheered. That is unbelievable. That is  heartbreaking.   Violence towards our police officers is something our Nation cannot  tolerate. We should collectively speak out against the attacks on our  police and against the calls to defund the police. We should be  supporting our men and women in law enforcement.   To the members of the law enforcement community, I want you to know  this: The people of Wisconsin's First Congressional District say: Thank  you; thank you for keeping us safe.                            ____________________
