 Madam Speaker, recently, the National Archives released  a report in which they concluded a structural nature of racism  permeates all aspects of work and workplace culture at the National  Archives. Unbelievable.   Among other things, they claim that the rotunda where our founding  documents--the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the  Bill of Rights--are housed are displayed as an example of structural  racism. Also, they called out the praise of our Founders that  constructed those documents as being somehow triggering of people.   The report recommends that we reimagine--a buzzword, these days--the  rotunda at the National Archives, including staging dance and  performance art in the space that invites dialogue about the ways the  United States has mythologized the Founding era.   So rather than celebrating our independence, like we will in a few  days, we will be focused on the U.S. failures or flaws. It seems we  have enough bashing of our country, our flag, even our National Anthem,  as we saw at a track and field event of a would-be Olympian who turned  away from our anthem.   The report also calls for putting in place trigger warnings for those  who would view and see the display there.   We are losing our minds, folks. These are our founding documents.                            ____________________
