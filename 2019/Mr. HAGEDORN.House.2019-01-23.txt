 Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank the residents of  Minnesota's First District for the privilege and honor of serving them  as their Representative in the House of Representatives.   As southern Minnesota's servant in Congress, I will work to keep  America safe with secure borders and a military and foreign policy of  peace through strength.   I will work to make America prosperous by transforming the Federal  Government and implementing regulatory reform, individual tax reform,  work for welfare, patient-centered medical care, merit-based  immigration, and achieving U.S. energy independence.   I will work to protect our God-given U.S. constitutional rights,  especially the right to life, the right of law-abiding Americans to  keep and bear arms, and the right to religious freedom.   Lastly, I will work to sustain agriculture and our rural southern  Minnesota way of life.   Madam Speaker, serving this body is humbling, and I look forward to  working with my colleagues to restore America's greatness and reflect  the views and values of the constituents of the First District of  Minnesota.                            ____________________
