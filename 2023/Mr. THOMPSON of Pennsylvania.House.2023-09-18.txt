 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  the Allegheny National Forest centennial. For the last 100 years, the  only national forest in Pennsylvania has been a shining example of what  a multiple-use forest can do and be for a region.   This great forest wasn't always this vibrant. Prior to President  Calvin Coolidge signing a proclamation establishing the Allegheny  National Forest, or what we refer to as ANF, in 1923, there was  considerable deforestation throughout Pennsylvania's northern tier.   This was a result of unsustainable and poor forestry practices during  the 19th century and early 20th century. A century later, forests  throughout the region have largely been restored and forest health has  returned across the landscape by applying science and active forest  management.   Located in the northern portion of my district, this incredible  forest spans more than half a million acres across Forest, Elk, McKean,  and Warren Counties.   Whether it is timber harvesting, energy production, wildlife habitat,  or an abundance of outdoor activities, the Allegheny National Forest  has it all.   The ANF is the economic engine of the region, supporting local jobs  and industries, as well as recreational opportunities for residents and  visitors alike.   The ANF is an important partner to the forest products industry,  which is incredibly important for this region for both economic needs  and encouraging forest health. The local logging and forest products  industry play important roles in supporting the Forest Service's  mandate to actively manage national forests and ensure a reliable  source of domestic timber.   The Allegheny National Forest is also located in the same area as  Pennsylvania's historic oil region, which began in 1859 when Colonel  Edwin Drake drilled the world's first commercially successful well in  Titusville, Pennsylvania.   The oil and gas industry has been a staple industry in northwestern  Pennsylvania, established long before the ANF was even created. Today,  energy production in the ANF continues to be a critical, economic  driver in the region while the Forest Service remains an important  partner with local producers and mineral rights owners.   Mr. Speaker, this centennial is a grand celebration as it highlights  the importance of maintaining our multiple-use forest. To celebrate,  the community is hosting a variety of activities leading up to the  celebration on Sunday, September 24. Events include a Jakes Rocks  Mountain Bike Trail Fest, a forest-themed art show, a forest-themed  film festival, and ending with a birthday party on Sunday, the 24th,  taking place at the Twin Lakes Recreation Area.   The ANF is a nature lover's dream and continues to be a prime  vacation destination for Pennsylvania, as well as Americans and even  international travelers.   While there are numerous hiking, biking, and even snowmobile trails,  the ANF also provides key resources to sustain our country. From world- renowned hardwoods to biomass fuels for energy production, the ANF  truly provides something for everyone. For generations, the forest has  brought economic prosperity to our region, and it is essential that we  are able to contribute to the longevity and sustainability of the  Allegheny National Forest.   I am dedicated to putting forth policies that promote natural  solutions to keep our forests healthy and resilient for generations to  come. These policies include working closely with the Forest Service, a  division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to manage our forests,  foster healthy lands, and allow this economic engine to thrive.    By supporting the Forest Service and encouraging active management,  we can support healthy forests and rural communities for generations to  come.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the only national forest in  Pennsylvania. I will continue to support policies here in Washington  that allow for the ANF to flourish for the next 100 years and beyond.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, September is Suicide  Prevention Month, and nearly every 12 minutes, an American dies by  suicide.   It is now the tenth leading cause of death in the United States.  Suicide claims the lives of more than 2,000 Pennsylvanians each year-- an average of 5 lives each day.   Mr. Speaker, suicide is preventable.   Increasing access to crisis resources saves lives. Mental and  behavioral health research saves lives. Ending the stigma surrounding  suicide saves lives.   There is no single cause of suicide, and suicide risk increases when  several health factors and life stressors converge to create an  experience of hopelessness and despair.   Together we can reverse this course.   By making mental health care, substance abuse treatment, and suicide  prevention a national priority, we can reverse the tide on these deaths  of despair.   In fact, in 2020, the U.S. designated 988 as the national suicide and  crisis hotline, making it easier for all Americans to reach help, if  needed.   Mr. Speaker, let's keep the conversation going year-round. We can all  play an important role in prevention.                            ____________________
