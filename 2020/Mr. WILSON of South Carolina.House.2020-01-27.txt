 Mr. Speaker, last week, I was grateful  to serve on a congressional delegation to Poland and Israel, led by  Speaker Nancy Pelosi, with colleagues Eliot Engel, Chairwoman Nita  Lowey, Chairman Ted Deutch, with Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Brad  Schneider.   On the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the liberation of  Auschwitz-Birkenau, we saw, firsthand, the horrors of the innocent Jews  at the death camps.   From the ashes of German Nazism and despotic Soviet communism, Poland  is now a dynamic, prosperous democracy.   We were welcomed to Jerusalem by Ambassador David Friedman, then  meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. At the Fifth World  Holocaust Forum, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin introduced Vice  President Mike Pence, President Emmanuel Macron, Prince Charles, and  President Vladimir Putin. Heads of state from over 30 countries  attended, and I and fellow co-chair of the Bulgarian Caucus, Brad  Schneider, were honored to be with President Rumen Radev with our  alliance for freedom.   America's associations with Poland and Israel have never been  stronger, citing President Trump's placing 5,000 American troops in  Poland to deter further Russian aggression and Israel still celebrating  his moving of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
