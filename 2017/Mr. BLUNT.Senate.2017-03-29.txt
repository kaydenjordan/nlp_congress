 Mr. President, I certainly agree with the comments just  made by our friend from Oklahoma in looking back at the history of the  Court. The 200 years of giving judges a vote really is an important  thing for us to understand, as hopefully enough Members of the Senate  decide between now and sometime next week that the up-or-down vote-- where they get to vote however they want to--is totally appropriate.   I would like to speak about one other topic that we are dealing with  this week. I was here yesterday to talk about Judge Gorsuch. I will  likely be back again before this debate is over because it is  critically important that he be confirmed.   Mr. President, I want to speak for just a minute about what we are  also doing this week under the Congressional Review Act. One of the  reasons the Court matters is that the Court gets to decide on occasion  whether an agency has the legal ability to make a rule, but just  because they may have the legal ability to make a rule doesn't mean  they should make a rule that stands if the Congress doesn't agree.   The Congressional Review Act, under the late rulemaking of President  Obama, has had a real opportunity to work for, I would say, the first  time, but the truth is, it has worked one other time in 2001. In the  25-or-so-year history of the Congressional Review Act until the last  few days, the last few weeks, it has been utilized only because it is  really only practically available to the Senate and to the House if  there are midnight rules, rules that come up at the last minute.   As of today, the Senate has already passed 11 resolutions that have  disapproved those late rules that came in the final days of President  Obama's administration. By the time we finish this process, I think we  will be toward a total of maybe 15 rules that would have had a real  impact on our economy, that would have had a real impact on job  creation, that would have had a real impact on families. Those rules  are not going to happen because of the Congressional Review Act.   I have been an opponent of many of these rules and many of the  regulations we have seen over the last 8 years, but they have often  been able to become law anyway because the Congress, frankly, couldn't  do anything about it.                               Title X Program    In particular, I would like to commend Senator Joni Ernst for her  work on the resolution of disapproval we expect to consider tomorrow.  Senator Ernst's resolution would simply restore the ability of States  to set their own criteria for grant recipients under the title X  program.   I would like to remind my colleagues that this rule was issued on  December 19, 2016. It took effect January 18, 2017, 2 days before the  end of President Obama's administration. So for 7 years and 363 days,  the Obama administration didn't need this rule, but they issued it on  the way out the door.   Overturning this rule would not reduce a single dollar of funding  that is available under title X. Again, all we are doing is simply  giving back to the States the flexibility they had until the last 48  hours of the Obama administration to determine which health providers  were in the best position to provide the particular set of healthcare  services before the rule took effect.   This rule is another example of overreach. This is another example of  out-of-control regulators. I certainly am pleased to see Senator Ernst  bring it to the floor.   The determination of how the rules should be made and who should make  them and who should do something about it is something that this  Congress, in the next few weeks, has to take a stronger stand on.   I hope we find a way where we have to vote on every rule that has any  significant economic impact. That bill has passed the House of  Representatives already.   I see the Senator from Wyoming here, so I yield the floor.
