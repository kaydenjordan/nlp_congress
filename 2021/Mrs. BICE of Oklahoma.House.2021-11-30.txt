 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the most  expensive bill and largest tax increase in American history, the  recently passed build back broke bill.   The legislation reads like a far-left Christmas wish list that isn't  completely paid for. It is filled with more than 150 social programs  and budget gimmicks that make these expensive programs appear less  costly on paper, although Democrats intend to make them permanent.   Some of these include $7.4 billion for electric bicycles, a SALT tax  cut of $25,900 for millionaires, $80 billion to the IRS, and $100  billion toward amnesty for illegal immigrants.   What is equally concerning is what is not in the bill. Within the  2,000 pages, there is not a single mention of border control, China, or  Afghanistan. This year especially, with record-breaking southern border  apprehensions, Chinese missile testing, and the Taliban takeover of  Afghanistan, Congress should prioritize investing in our country's  safety and security.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats have doubled down on failed policies and  irresponsible spending. It is simply out of touch with the desires of  the American people.                            ____________________
