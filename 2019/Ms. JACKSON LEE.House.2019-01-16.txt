 Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in support for H.R.  268, the Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provides funding for  disaster recovery and provides for a short term continuing resolution  that would reopen the government.   My thanks to the leadership of Chairman McGovern for allowing the  inclusion of a short-term Continuing Resolution that would reopen the  Federal government and allow back pay to over 800,000 federal  employees.   A compassionate and commonsense amendment by Chairwoman Lowey to the  Disaster Supplemental will end the Trump Shutdown, reopen the  government through February 8, and immediately provide back pay to all  impacted federal workers.   The Federal Government can reopen allowing the Congress and the White  House time to negotiate on border security and an agreement on  immigration policy.   I can attest to the importance of Emergency Disaster Supplemental  Appropriations to the efforts of communities to recover following  Hurricane Harvey.   Texans, especially those living in the Houston area impacted by  Hurricane Harvey continue working towards recovery, which would not  have been possible without Federal emergency appropriations.   We are in the midst of a government shutdown that is unnecessary and  wasteful and would impede the use of the very funds provided by this  bill.   Americans who have been affected by natural disasters caused by  Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the California wildfires must be  able to count on a federal government that is fully open and operating.   This appropriation measure also includes much needed funds for Puerto  Rico, which was not provided with sufficient funding to effect the  recovery following the catastrophe caused by an inadequate response by  the White House to the disaster.   Caught in the crosshairs of the government shutdown are 800,000  hardworking government employees who want nothing more than to do an  honest day's work, and be fairly remunerated for their efforts.   More than anyone else, this government shutdown imperils their  financial freedom and security, which makes our country less strong.   Mortgage and rent payments are going unpaid; credit ratings are being  damaged; families are being made more insecure.   This situation requires each member of the House to vote for the Rule  and the underlying bill to reopen the government, while providing vital  assistance to fellow Americans recovering from major disasters.   Instead of President Trump ending his shutdown, he is threatening to  take Emergency Supplemental funding provided by the 115th Congress to  assist with Hurricane Harvey Army Corps projects to address flooding  risks posed by future storms, and divert the funding for the  construction of his border wall.   Those disaster funds were appropriated for recovery efforts  associated with Hurricanes Harvey, Jose, and Maria.   This President is so easily consumed by concerns over a wall to the  point that he cannot see real threats such as the vulnerability of  coastal communities to powerful hurricanes.   The people along the Texas Gulf Coast face real threats from  hurricanes that are increasingly more violent, and result in  catastrophic losses.   The only defense against hurricanes is improving resilience and  survivability of communities from wind, storm surge and rain.   For this reason, I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for the  Rule for H.R. 268.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this       resolution, an amendment offered by Representative Cole of       Oklahoma or a designee shall be in order as though printed as       the last amendment in part B of the report of the Committee       on Rules accompanying this resolution. That amendment shall       be debatable for 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by       the proponent and an opponent.     Mr. Chair, I can attest to the importance of  Emergency Disaster Supplemental Appropriations to the efforts of  communities to recover following a disaster.   Texans impacted by Hurricane Harvey and are working towards recovery  are grateful for the appropriations provided by Congress to address  Emergency Supplemental Appropriations.   We are in the midst of a government shutdown that is unnecessary and  wasteful.   Caught in the crosshairs of the government shutdown are eight-hundred  thousand hardworking government employees who want nothing more than to  do an honest day's work, and be fairly remunerated for their efforts.   More than anyone else, this government shutdown imperils their  financial security, which makes our country less strong.   Mortgage and rent payments are going unpaid; credit ratings are being  damaged; families are being made more insecure.   This situation requires answers, and resolution for hundreds of  thousands of hardworking Americans caught in the middle.   President Trump instead of ending his shutdown is threatening to take  Hurricane Harvey Army Corps funding and divert it for the construction  of his border wall.   He plans to divert funds appropriated for Hurricanes Harvey, Jose,  and Maria recovery to pay for his border wall is outrageous and  immoral, and an affront to the millions of Americans affected by real  disasters that have struck the homeland.   We need to ensure that the President cannot undermine the disaster  recovery projects and programs that Congress has approved and funded by  diverting funds for construction of his border wall vanity project.   This President is so easily consumed by concerns over a wall to the  point that he cannot see real threats such as the vulnerability of  coastal communities to powerful hurricanes.   The people along the Texas Gulf Coast face real threats from  hurricanes that are increasingly more violent, and result in  catastrophic losses.   The only defense against hurricanes is improving resilience and  survivability of communities from wind, storm surge and rain.   We improve coastal resilience against hurricanes by completing Army  Corps of Engineer projects that are paid for previously under separate  appropriations bills that are now law.   The President wants to use his authority under a National Emergency  Declaration to erroneously gain access to the funding so desperately  needed for Hurricane Harvey recovery and other disasters.   Declaring a national emergency for purely political reasons is  antidemocratic, petulant, dangerous and unbecoming of the President of  the United States.   The president and his staff have been routinely and repeatedly  corrected and rebuked for their attempts to spread false and misleading  information about the state of our southern border.   They have wrongly claimed that the lack of a border wall at the  southern border is a major source of drugs coming into the United  States, when in fact it is ports of entry.   They disregarded the fact that border apprehensions are at a 45 year- low, and have been dropping since 2000.   Having been defeated legislatively by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, now the  President according to a story in the New York Times would like to pay  for his immoral border wall by diverting funds that the Congress has  appropriated for disaster relief, such as Hurricane Harvey to help  citizens in my home state of Texas; victims of Maria in Puerto Rico and  other hurricane victims; and victims of deadly wildfires in California.   I support this Disaster Appropriations bill in order to help rebuild  communities devastated over the last year by deadly disasters.   Now the President needs to open the Government in order to stop the  disaster occurring among our out of work federal employees.    Madam Speaker, I think it is important for us to  know what just happened today.   Democrats stood on the floor, unanimously, to open the government.  Democrats stood on the floor, unanimously, to be able to provide for  desperate Americans suffering from devastating floods, hurricanes, and  wildfires.   Yes, we helped our friends in the Northern Mariana Islands for our  good colleague to stand on the floor and to have amendments that would  provide Medicaid for his constituents. Democrats stood for the humanity  of Americans.   Democrats are also standing for our Coast Guard, members who are on  the front lines everywhere around this Nation and in our seas stopping  drugs and saving people.   Democrats are simply asking that there be humanity in this Congress,  in this House, for those who understand TSAs are trying to do their job  without food or gas.   Democrats are asking for Senator McConnell to put our bills that were  just passed to open the government on the Senate floor and to act like  there is leadership in this Nation, to send them to the President.   Mr. President, sign the bill to open the government now and stand for  what America is: a nation that cares.                            ____________________
