 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to mourn  the tragic loss of K-9 Luna, a beloved member of the Duluth Police  Department, who was shot and killed in the line of duty last week.   Luna was a 3-year-old Dutch Shepherd who joined the department's K-9  unit less than 2 years ago, after her handler, Officer Aaron Haller,  lost his K-9 partner, Haas, in a similar incident.   As a former Duluth police officer with the Duluth Police Department,  I know firsthand that our K-9 partners perform their duties bravely and  with great loyalty.   To their handlers, a K-9 is more than a dog. They are a partner,  protector, and a valued family member. K-9 officers go home with their  handlers each night, so their dedication to their handlers and their  job does not end after each workday.   K-9 Luna was a guardian of the Duluth community. She died a hero's  death, giving her life to protect her partner and fellow officers on  the scene.   My heart is with Luna's handler, Officer Aaron Haller, the Haller  family, and the entire Duluth Police Department during this time of  deep sorrow.   I know it cannot be easy to say goodbye to such a good and loving  friend. I speak for the entire Duluth community when I say that we are  eternally grateful for Luna's service and sacrifice.                            ____________________
