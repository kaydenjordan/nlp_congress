 Mr. Speaker, today is International Women's Day, and  the theme is #ChooseToChallenge--choose to challenge gender bias and  discrimination, choose to challenge poor pay, and choose to challenge  desperate conditions that women are in to be opposed to. So we ask that  in this day that women will realize that they are ready and able to  challenge what is wrong.   This is International Women's Day, and I know that the American  Rescue Plan Act will take women out of the quagmire of COVID-19 and  economic depression.   As well, we look forward this evening to introducing the Violence  Against Women Act of which I am the lead sponsor with over 150  cosponsors, so women again can have the protection that is needed by  law. International Women's Day, yes, we should choose to challenge.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor that I will be  introducing members of the Congressional Black Caucus for this Special  Order, including the distinguished chair, who has led us to understand  our power-hour message. I thank the distinguished CBC chair,  Congresswoman Joyce Beatty.   As we begin to do a Special Order on Bloody Sunday and a tribute to  the honorable late John Robert Lewis, who was and continues to be the  conscience of the Congress, it is my privilege to yield to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), the chairwoman of the  Congressional Black Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, let me thank the distinguished  gentlewoman from Ohio for setting just the right tone of why members of  the Congressional Black Caucus are on the floor today.   Let me acknowledge the gentleman from New York, who is now Speaker  pro tempore, who is my co-anchor. How appropriate for him to be  presiding over this Special Order dealing with the deeply embedded  segregationist, violent period when we were fighting for voting rights.   Isn't it interesting that we are now in the midst of fighting for the  passage of H.R. 1, but we are in the midst of a battle to ensure the  passage of H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act?   Let me just briefly set the tone, as my members continue to do, and  to tell the story. Maybe many of us may not know the significance. I  realize that there has been some discussion on the Edmund Pettus  Bridge, which I have crossed now for almost 30 years during Bloody  Sunday, which was, in fact, yesterday, March 7.   It was named after Edmund Pettus. Isn't it interesting that it was  named more than three decades after his death? They wanted to honor a  symbol of the Confederacy. They wanted to honor someone who was soaked  in the blood and the anguish of slavery.   This river, the Alabama River, was a key route for the slave  plantation and cotton economy during slavery. That is what the Edmund  Pettus Bridge was, a key route for the cotton economy during slavery  and Reconstruction. The route for the slave plantation and cotton  economy crossed this bridge during our darkest hour.   That is who the bridge is named after, and this is the bridge that  the foot soldiers Martin King, Hosea Williams, Andy Young, John Robert  Lewis, Albert Turner, and many others crossed.   This 56th commemoration is extremely important today, and it is to  recognize that the fight and struggle still goes. It is to recognize  that this was not, in fact, a simple process. This was not a  circumstance where this was an easy task. This was a dark moment.   It was based on the courage of those who were willing to lose their  life. It was based on the courage of these men and women and little  children as young as 8 years old. It was based on the death of Jimmie  Lee Jackson, in 1964, who had gone to one of the meetings and was  actually shot by a law enforcement officer.   Tonight, this is a serious moment in history. This is a moment in  history that the Congressional Black Caucus is more than able to  present to the American people. Listen to us over these 60 minutes as  we tell the story of how imperative it is to ensure that the Voter  Advancement Act named after John Robert Lewis is actually passed.   Let me just give you the words of John Robert Lewis as we also pay  tribute to him. John Lewis said recently: ``My philosophy is very  simple. When you see something that is not right, not fair, not just,  say something, do something. Get in trouble, good trouble.''   Recently, of course, preceding his death, this is something we are  always reminded of. We can see John Lewis, who gave all that he could  so that we, in America, African Americans, Black Americans, and all  people, could have the precious right to vote.   Tonight, you will hear these stories in tribute to him, in tribute to  all those whose lives were lost in that battle, that their memory never  be forgotten, their fight never be forgotten. The Congressional Black  Caucus makes them a promise that it will not.   Mr. Speaker, fifty-six years ago, in Selma, Alabama, hundreds of  heroic souls risked their lives for freedom and to secure the right to  vote for all Americans by their participation in marches for voting  rights on ``Bloody Sunday,'' ``Turnaround Tuesday,'' or the final,  completed march from Selma to Montgomery.   Those ``foot soldiers'' of Selma, who were led by our beloved  colleague, the late Congressman John Lewis of Georgia, were brave and  determined men and women, boys and girls, persons of all races and  creeds, who loved their country so much that they were willing to risk  their lives to make it better, and to bring it even closer to its  founding ideals.   The foot soldiers marched because they believed that all persons have  dignity and the right to equal treatment under the law, and in the  making of the laws, which is the fundamental essence of the right to  vote.   On March 15, 1965, before a joint session of the Congress and the  eyes of the nation, President Lyndon Johnson explained to the nation  the significance of ``Bloody Sunday'':         I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of       democracy. . . .        At times history and fate meet at a single time in a single       place to shape a turning point in man's unending search for       freedom.        So it was at Lexington and Concord.        So it was a century ago at Appomattox.        So it was last week in Selma, Alabama.    The previous Sunday, March 7, 1965, more than 600 civil rights  demonstrators, including our beloved colleague, Congressman John Lewis  of Georgia whose skull was battered by police batons, were brutally  attacked by state and local police at the Edmund Pettus Bridge as they  marched from Selma to Montgomery in support of the right to vote.   ``Bloody Sunday'' was a defining moment in American history because  it crystallized for the nation the necessity of enacting a strong and  effective federal law to protect the right to vote of every American.   No one who witnessed the violence and brutality suffered by the foot  soldiers for justice who gathered at the Edmund Pettus Bridge will ever  forget it; the images are deeply seared in the American memory and  experience.   Mr. Speaker, what is so moving, heroic, and awe-inspiring is that the  foot soldiers of Selma faced their heavily armed adversaries fortified  only by their love for their country and for each other and their  audacious faith in a righteous cause.   The example set by the foot soldiers of Selma showed everyone, here  in America and around the world, that there is no force on earth as  powerful as an idea whose time has come.   These great but nameless persons won the Battle of Selma and helped  redeem the greatest nation on earth.   But we should not forget that the victory came at great cost and that  many good and dear persons lost their lives to win for others the right  to vote.   Men like Jimmy Lee Jackson, who was shot by Alabama state trooper as  he tried to protect his mother and grandmother from being beaten for  participating in a peaceful voting rights march in Marion, Alabama.   Women like Viola Liuzzo, a housewife and mother of five, who had  journeyed to Selma from Detroit to join the protests after witnessing  on television the events at Edmund Pettus Bridge on ``Bloody Sunday''  and who was shot and killed by Klansmen while driving back from a trip  shuttling fellow voting rights marchers to the Montgomery airport.   Persons of faith, goodwill, and non-violence like the Reverend James  Reeb of Boston, a minister from Boston who heeded the call of the Rev.  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to come  [[Page H1098]]  to Selma and who succumbed to the head injuries he suffered at the  hands of his white supremacists attackers on March 9, two days after  ``Bloody Sunday.''   Mr. Speaker, in the face of unspeakable hostility, violence,  brutality, and hatred, the foot soldiers of Selma would not be  deterred--would not be moved--would not be turned around.   They kept their eyes on the prize and held on.   And help came the very next week when President Johnson announced to  the Nation that he would send to Congress for immediate action a law  designed to eliminate illegal barriers to the right to vote by striking  down ``restrictions to voting in all elections--Federal, State, and  local--which have been used to deny Negroes the right to vote.''   On August 6, 1965, that legislation--the Voting Rights Act of 1965-- was signed into law by President Johnson and for the next 48 years did  more to expand our democracy and empower racial and language minorities  than any act of government since the Emancipation Proclamation and  adoption of the Civil War Amendments.   But our work is not done; the dreams of Dr. King and of all those who  gave their lives in the struggle for justice are not behind us but  still before us.   Mr. Speaker, in the wake of the Supreme Court's 2013 ruling in Shelby  County v. Holder, which severely crippled the Voting Rights Act, we  have seen many states across our nation move to enact legislation  designed to limit the ability of women, the elderly, and racial and  language minorities to exercise their right to vote.   To honor the memory of the foot soldiers of Selma, we must rededicate  ourselves to a great task remaining before us--to repair the damage  done to the Voting Rights Act by working to pass legislation like H.R.  4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2019, introduced in the 116th  Congress, which I was proud to be one of the original co-sponsors.   As I have stated many times, the 1965 Voting Rights Act is no  ordinary piece of legislation.   For millions of Americans, and for many in Congress, it is sacred  treasure, earned by the sweat and toil and tears and blood of ordinary  Americans who showed the world it was possible to accomplish  extraordinary things.   As we remember and honor the foot soldiers of Selma, let us resolve  also to restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965 so that the Voting Rights  Act remains a lasting monument to their heroism and devotion to the  country they loved.   Our leader on this, who has taken up the mantle, who has worked with  John Robert Lewis, is, how should I say, a sister of the South, of  Alabama, a scholar and a lawyer, but with a passion and a heart for  voting rights, for justice. And, yes, as we both have said, our beloved  brother, John Robert Lewis, has a special place in our hearts. I know  that he has a special place in mine, and he has a special place in the  heart of the distinguished gentlewoman from Alabama, Terri Sewell.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  powerful message on good trouble and doing the right thing. I can hear  John Lewis right now.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Johnson), the  distinguished chairwoman of the Committee on Science, Space, and  Technology.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for that  question of how long. Now it is my privilege to yield to a  distinguished leader of the House, the co-chair of the Steering and  Policy Committee, a senior member on Appropriations, the Honorable  Barbara Lee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  remarks.   Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining, please?    Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure now to yield to the  distinguished gentlewoman from Detroit, the co-chair of the Women's  Caucus, and an officer with the Congressional Black Caucus. That is the  Honorable Brenda Lawrence.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  remarks. She reminded us that his sacrifice was not a simple one. He  shed blood. John Robert Lewis shed blood because of his beliefs and his  commitment.   Mr. Speaker, it is now my privilege to be able to yield to the  distinguished gentlewoman, the chair and founder of the Historically  Black College Caucus, a longtime academician and professor at a  historically Black college, and that is the gentlewoman from North  Carolina, Alma Adams.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Adams for saying  what our power is all about.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Horsford), the  first vice chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and a leader in the  fight for labor rights that brought him to the United States Congress.   Congressman Horsford is the distinguished gentleman from Nevada, and  I hope I have gotten that right because I have been there many times,  and I know that I have to get it right.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman. We  will carry on the fight. Thank you for challenging us tonight. I think  that everyone knows that we will not rest until the Voter Rights Act,  H.R. 4, the John Robert Lewis bill is passed.   Mr. Speaker, it is now my privilege to yield to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans), who stood at this podium some  years ago as the leader of the Special Order. And I am delighted to  seek to grow as tall as he is in this job, because he is now a leading  member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania, who has provided our road map that we are going to use to  take this long journey, and we are not going to stop until we finish  the job.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath).  This distinguished Congresswoman has a voice of passion for an issue  that John Lewis had a voice of passion for, and I believe that it  clearly was before she came, if I am not mistaken, that John Lewis led  a floor boycott so that gun legislation could be passed.   You see, he is and was the conscience of the Congress. I think he  must have known that Congresswoman McBath was coming to Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for reminding  us of how broad Congressman Lewis' civil rights fight was. And he was  the conscience to change all that was bad to make it good.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege now to yield to the  distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Jones), who has come with a  storied history on fighting for those who cannot fight for themselves.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much.  Concise but powerful. We know what our guidepost is.   Mr. Speaker, I don't think that the history of the United States has  had a more civil rights activist as Speaker, one who is a fighter for  justice. We are delighted to have her joining us this evening. Her  voice has been alongside John Robert Lewis.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi),  our distinguished Speaker of the House, joining us on the commemoration  of Bloody Sunday.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
