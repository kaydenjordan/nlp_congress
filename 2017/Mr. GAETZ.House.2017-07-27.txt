 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank  our colleagues in the House for their agreement.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the brave men and women of the  greatest military on Earth and to ensure that they are properly  equipped for any and all challenges on the horizon. I support increased  investments in our military test and training ranges with help from our  Armed Forces to deal with the world's challenges.   In my district, the Gulf Test Range provides approximately 120,000  square miles of overwater airspace. It is used for high-altitude,  supersonic air combat training, air-to-air missile testing, drone  targeting, hypersonic weapons testing, space launches, and much more.  It is critical training space for our Armed Forces, including the Air  Force Special Operations Command, the 96th Test Wing, the 33rd Fighter  Wing, and others. This is why I ask my colleagues to support the  amendment to increase funding for the test range program.   I thank the Congressman from Florida, Dr. Dunn, for his leadership,  for the men and women in the military. I thank Chair Granger for her  agreement to this amendment. I thank the minority party.
