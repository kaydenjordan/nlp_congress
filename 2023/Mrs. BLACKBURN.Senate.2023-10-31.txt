 Mr. President, it is my honor to officially  congratulate the Country Music Hall of Fame 2023 inductees and welcome  Bob McDill, Patty Loveless, and Tanya Tucker into country music's  closest circle of friends.   In Nashville, we like to say that ``it all begins with a song,'' but  this year's songwriter inductee took those words to heart in a way that  few ever have. Unlike so many songwriters, Bob McDill found his voice  as a country music storyteller not through the slow burn of experience,  but in a sudden burst of inspiration involving a late-night drive and a  particularly raw George Jones lyric. Over the next three decades, he  wrote more than 30 chart-topping hits and earned a reputation as one of  the most prolific writers in Music City history.   This year's modern era artist inductee took a traditional path to  fame, but for Patty Loveless, the fruits of her long years laboring  through fairs, festivals, and bars to reach the Country Music Hall of  Fame are anything but ordinary. Between 1998 and 2003, Loveless  released 31 Top 20 country hits and topped the charts five times. Her  elite vocal performances made her a star, but it is the skill with  which her songs navigated life's most complicated questions that made  her one of Music City's most relatable and enduring artists.   Country music would look and sound a whole lot different without  Tanya Tucker, this year's veterans era artist inductee. By the time she  turned 25, Tanya had enjoyed more success than many artists could ever  hope to achieve. She created a sound so distinct and a performance  style so irresistible that she maintained her hold on Music City  through career setbacks that lesser artists could never hope to  overcome. Between 1986 and 1997, Tanya sent 24 singles into the Top 10,  and, in 1991, earned the honor of County Music Association Female  Vocalist of the Year. In 2019 she came back with a vengeance and a new  album that earned her two Grammys, the first of her career.   On behalf of the entire Tennessee delegation, I would like to express  my gratitude to Bob, Patty, and Tanya for their passion, their  artistry, and their wholehearted commitment to their craft.                            ____________________
