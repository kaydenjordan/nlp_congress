 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4324, which I  cosponsor, the Strengthening Oversight of Iran's Access to Finance Act,  introduced by Congressman Roger Williams.   I stand with the courage of my convictions while I listen to others  stand with the courage, apparently, of a conviction to coddle the  world's largest state sponsor of terrorism.   I have a problem, and I am not going to apologize for it, and my  colleagues aren't going to apologize for it; when we have an adversary  of our Nation overthrowing foreign governments, financing terror,  developing intercontinental ballistic missiles in violation of U.N.  Security Council resolutions, calling Israel the Little Satan and  America the Great Satan, pledging to wipe Israel off the map, chanting  ``Death to America.''   Just a few weeks ago, the CIA dropped 470,000 documents collected in  May of 2011, in the raid of Osama bin Laden's compound. In those  documents, it shows a strong relationship between Iran and al-Qaida,  and Iran offering finance and arms for carrying out attacks against  America.   I signed up to run for the United States Congress and take an oath to  protect this country, and, right now, while we are here this holiday  season--tonight is the second night of Hanukkah. We are about to have  Christmas, New Year's--we have people who are overseas, sometimes on  their 8th, 9th, 10th deployment, willing to risk everything in defense  of our freedoms and liberties, putting themselves in harm's way.   So when 10 Navy sailors end up getting held hostage and embarrassed  with photography and videography, being shamed by the Iranians, and  then we say, as a matter of response, thank you? That was our response  when they released our 10 detained Navy sailors.   And you want to question the conviction of Congressman Williams  introducing legislation that is incredibly important for protecting the  United States and our servicemembers and our allies; and you want to  mock us for having a problem with them chanting ``Death to America?''  Whose side are you on?    For anyone who has the courage of conviction to coddle the world's  largest state sponsor of terror.   Since the U.S. entered the JCPOA, Iran's state-owned airline, Iran  Air,  [[Page H9886]]  has used its access to the U.S. aviation industry to purchase planes  that aided the Assad regime in carrying out its war crimes in Syria  against its own citizens, innocent women and children.   Courage of convictions to stand with the United States, with our  allies, and on behalf of the women and children being targeted by the  Assad regime in Syria. We have a problem with that, and we want to do  something about it.   Don't try to shame us into being apologetic and unwilling and afraid  to stand up for all of those right principles. That is the courage and  conviction that I stand up with today, with Congressman Williams, with  Chairman Hensarling, and all the others who are encouraging a strong  ``yes'' vote for more accountability, for a stronger national defense,  for a better future.
