 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor John ``Woody'' Wood,  and his loving wife, Candice, or Candy, two long-time and dear friends  of mine.   John, affectionately known as ``Woody'' to his friends and family, is  a true inspiration to all. Woody has endured more than his share of  challenges throughout his life. Woody boldly fought the status quo as a  citizen and, later on, as an elected official in our community.   As a community servant, his creed was no different. He fought for the  truth in government and he never compromised his integrity, and his  word was worth his weight in gold. Most importantly, he made a  difference for all the people that he served in our community.   Woody bravely battled liver cancer, which resulted in a liver  transplant, and now, unfortunately, our dear friend Woody is fighting  pancreatic cancer.   Despite the hardships Woody has faced throughout his life, he has  always remained courageous in the face of every foe, including cancer.  Woody's integrity, compassion, and eternal sunny outlook on life have  been an inspiration to all of us.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in praying for Woody and Candice and  their entire family as they fight the next battle in Woody's life.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it was certainly an honor and a privilege to  serve in the prestigious Financial Services Committee as a Member of  the 115th Congress. It was a distinct privilege to be selected to serve  on that committee by our chairman, Jeb Hensarling, who recognized the  urgent need to reignite our economy and to give small businesses like  ours and millions like our family business around the Nation a chance  to thrive again against the oppressive weight of government  overregulation.   As a small manufacturing business owner and as an attorney to small  community banks and credit unions in my community, I am acutely aware  of the challenges that small businesses and families face concerning  Big Government overreach in the financial realm.   Families were not able to save for their future, small businesses  were laying off employees instead of hiring, and community banks were  closing at a record pace. The policies we championed and the incredible  work we have done on the Financial Services Committee this year under  the leadership of Chairman Jeb Hensarling has turned all of that  around. For the first time in over a decade, I am witnessing growth and  renewed enthusiasm in our economy, thanks to the work of our committee.   The jurisdiction of the Financial Services Committee may seem  esoteric to some; however, the work that we do is vitally important to  this Nation. We have the power, of course, if used correctly, to open  up markets, to unleash free enterprise, and to give citizens the  opportunity to pursue the American Dream.   In May, President Trump signed S. 2155, the Economic Growth,  Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, into law after House  passage. Our committee, through numerous hearings and markups,  originated most of this legislation. The ultimate work product, S.  2155, made much-needed reforms to Dodd-Frank that directly impact the  ability of small community institutions to conduct business and to  drive the economy in a positive direction.   As a freshman member, I was honored to be one of the only members to  have two bipartisan bills included in this package: the first, the  Small Bank Exam Cycle Improvement Act, and, the second, the Community  Institution Mortgage Relief Act. These bills are vitally important  because community banks are the lifeblood of New York's upstate  economy.   Community institutions provide access to capital for entrepreneurs  starting or growing their small businesses, for families and farmers  acquiring new equipment or assets, for loans to new car buyers, and for  mortgages to families purchasing a home, especially for the first time.   In rural areas like the 22nd District in New York, consumers and  small businesses often rely on lending with local institutions in order  to gain access to capital. These reforms ensure that small community  institutions like Tioga National Bank, the Bank of Utica--my personal  bank--Adirondack Bank--another bank that I use--and many others  throughout the country can keep their doors open and continue to lend  to people in our communities.   I am grateful to Chairman Hensarling and the expert and professional  staff on the committee who worked with our office and leaders in  [[Page H10096]]  the financial services community in our region to ensure that we had  the opportunity to pass meaningful legislation that will benefit the  constituents of New York's 22nd Congressional District for many years  to come.   I thank Chairman Hensarling for his unparalleled integrity,  tremendous leadership, sage advice, and deep friendship. I am so  honored and privileged to have played a small role in Chairman  Hensarling's noble mission of empowering all Americans through freedom  and economic opportunity.
