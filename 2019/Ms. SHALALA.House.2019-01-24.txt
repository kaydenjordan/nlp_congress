 Madam Speaker, I want to share the story of Doris, a  constituent from Palmetto Bay, Florida. Doris works as an investigative  program officer for the Department of Homeland Security. For over 27  years, she has devoted her life to the safety and the security of our  community. Today marks the 34th day of this irresponsible shutdown. It  also marks the 34th day that Doris will be going to work without  getting a paycheck.   She has received notice that her department will miss a second pay  period; something that her supervisor has told her will affect her  retirement status.   This nightmare has affected her financially, mentally, and  emotionally. She is terrified about having to default on her mortgage  and not having enough money to cover her car payments or put food on  the table.   Later today, Doris is planning to stand in line at a nearby parking  lot to receive a head of lettuce and some tomatoes from a local food  bank. Is this what the administration thought of when they initiated  this shutdown? Is this what the greatest country in the world has  succumbed to?   It angers me to know that Doris is being used as pawn to fulfill a  campaign promise. Madam Speaker, I say to the President that we do our  jobs and he does his. Open the government.                            ____________________
