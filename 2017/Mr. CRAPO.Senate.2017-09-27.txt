 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  nomination of Mr. Heath Tarbert to be Assistant Secretary of the  Treasury for International Markets and Development. This position is  both a critical national security and international economic policy  job.   A critical part of the Assistant Secretary's job--and the reason for  which this position was created by statute and passed in the Banking  Committee--is to marshal the procedures and processes of the  interagency, Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United  States, or CFIUS, which protects our Nation from hostile foreign  transactions designed to undermine U.S. national security interests.   This is now a very time-sensitive post because Senators on both sides  of the aisle are working to introduce legislation to change the CFIUS  process for the first time in a decade.   Confirmation of Mr. Tarbert is critical so that he is available to  provide necessary input on any proposed changes and to swiftly  implement any new legislation.   Mr. Tarbert would also serve as the principal policy advisor to the  Secretary on international economic matters, including serving as the  Treasury's representative at the Financial Stability Board.   Finally, Mr. Tarbert has strong bipartisan support and was voice- voted out of the Banking Committee.   Mr. Tarbert has served in senior roles in all three branches of  government and is an experienced lawyer and a recognized financial  expert.   In short, he is an important asset whom the Congress and Treasury  Department do not want to lose to further delay.   I urge all of my colleagues to support Mr. Tarbert's nomination today  and to vote for his confirmation.   With that, I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
