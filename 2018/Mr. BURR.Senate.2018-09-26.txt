 Mr. President, I move to proceed to Executive Calendar No.  1111, Robert H. McMahon.    Mr. President, I wish to thank Senators Daines and Gardner  for their critical support for backing this program. If there is only  one takeaway anybody has from anything I say today, let it be this:  This costs zero in taxpayer money, zero. For those who are budget  hawks, it is a great bill.   In June, the three of us, along with some of our colleagues, convened  in front of the Capitol to commemorate the 100th day until LWCF  expires. It is unfortunate we are here today, less than a week away  from its expiration, with no extension of this program.   I believe we ultimately will win this fight because our colleagues  know it is the right thing to do. As Senator Daines pointed out, the  majority of the House of Representatives and the majority of the U.S.  Senate is supportive of this. It costs zero in taxpayer money, and it  provides so much at the State and Federal level.   I appreciate my colleague's comments on public access. That is  usually the focus of my LWCF monologues. Not a lot of my constituents  are thinking about outdoor recreation right now; they are dealing with  Hurricane Florence and her aftermath. As you all know, North Carolina  recently experienced a hurricane of epic proportion. Flooding has  reached record levels. People's homes and businesses are in disrepair,  and flood levels continue today at dangerously high levels in some  areas.   Obviously, much of this is unavoidable. If we ensure our  infrastructure is well positioned to deal with major influxes of water,  we can minimize the devastating impact we saw from Florence. I am not  referring necessarily just to bridges, dams, and roads; I am talking  about our natural infrastructure.   If we strategically create green spaces in our cities and in our  river basins, we can mitigate some of the flooding. Guess what. LWCF  dollars help us do that. A great example is the South Cape May Meadows  Preserve and the surrounding Cape May National Wildlife Refuge which  LWCF helped create in New Jersey.   The State of New Jersey, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Nature  Conservancy have worked together to restore wetlands, which now include  engineered structures, as well as natural features like marshes, dunes,  and wetlands.   This wetland area has since withstood several major storms, including  Hurricanes Sandy and Irene. The wetland was positioned in such a way  that it was able to absorb enough of the impact and water in order to  protect many of the surrounding communities.   In 2016, a study by the Nature Conservancy, in partnership with a  risk modeler for the insurance industry, showed that the marsh wetlands  saved over $650 million in property damages during Hurricane Sandy  alone and reduced annual property losses by nearly 20 percent in Ocean  County, NJ.   This isn't just about protecting lands and public access; it is about  those things we can do that provide a better community--a lower cost of  insurance, a better way to mitigate some of nature's challenges.   Did I mention it is also a bird sanctuary? Did I mention it is a  recreational destination? It also serves as critical infrastructure in  times of disaster, like the one my State is dealing with today.   More and more, our civil engineers are incorporating these pieces of  green infrastructure. At first glance, one would naturally think they  are for aesthetic reasons.   In Charlotte, a series of greenways wind through the city. One of the  greenways, Four Mile Creek Greenway, used an LWCF grant to develop the  land into a multipurpose area, rather than actual acquisition of the  land. It has trails winding through it. It is home to hundreds of  different animal species. Yet it is also used for natural drainage. It  absorbs water. It slows down the water with the vegetation and the  winding creekbeds.   Our cunning civil engineers have us thinking they are building a  park, but what they are really building is a flood mitigation program.  As you can see, LWCF is used for projects in our cities and our rural  areas--big and small projects. Ultimately, the biggest filters of water  in North Carolina are our own natural forest and the Great Smoky  Mountains National Park.   Healthy forests in these public lands help us to slow the flow of  water, and we need those units to have the integrity so they can do  their job of feeding healthy river systems that are much less prone to  that flooding.   In conjunction with traditionally engineered structures, preserving  strategic pieces of land in their natural state or restoring others to  better take in water saves us money in the long run. Ocean County, NJ,  proved that.   I can go on for hours. I can go on with hundreds of examples. There  aren't a lot of facts I can give you about the program that I haven't  already laid out in the past opportunities to be on the floor, but I  think it is useful to end my speech by restating the original mission  laid out 54 years ago when LWCF was created--authorized for 25 years,  reauthorized for 25 years, and then only reauthorized for 5.   What do we want? We want permanent reauthorization. It is a program  that has proven to be successful, regardless of your political views, a  program that uses zero in taxpayer money, a program that produces  benefits to every State in America that started with this mission  statement:         To assist in preserving, developing, and assuring       accessibility to all citizens of the United States of America       of present and future generations . . . such quality and       quantity of outdoor recreation resources as may be available       and are necessary and desirable . . . to strengthen the       health and vitality of the citizens of the United States by       (1) providing funds for and authorizing Federal assistance to       the States in planning, acquisition, and development of       needed land and water areas and facilities and (2) providing       funds for the Federal acquisition and development of certain       lands and other areas.    I am not sure you can sum up any differently what the definition of a  good program is, a successful program. It is not just in the mission  statement; it is in the examples of what over those 54 years we have  accomplished. There are not many things I can walk away from and  believe that my grandchildren and my great grandchildren will be  positively impacted by, but I can assure my colleagues of this:  Permanent reauthorization of LWCF is one of those things. I am  committed, along with my colleagues, to make sure there is no temporary  reauthorization; there is a permanent reauthorization. We have met the  burden of proof as to why this should never go away and why the  American people support it in overwhelming numbers.  [[Page S6326]]    I am grateful to my colleagues for their support and their time to be  on the floor today.   I yield back to Senator Daines.    Will the Senator from Montana yield?    I want to drive home what Senator Gardner said. This is not  the first time we have been here. Almost 100 days ago, after that event  we had outside, we came inside and moved to reauthorize the Land and  Water Conservation Fund.   I just pulled out my drawer and found three instances. All of those  speeches start like this:   ``At this time, we are only 66 days until September 30.''   ``At this time today, we are only 45 days.''   ``Today, we are only 38 days until expiration.''   We continue to drive this with our colleagues. Why? Because the  American public supports this program so much and because this is  effective and impactful in every community of every State in the  country. I know my colleagues agree with me. We are going to be  relentless in how many times we come to the floor.   Sometimes, Senator Gardner, when you have been here as long as I  have, you learn that sometimes you have to wear down the people who  might find a reason to disagree with you. But, you know, nobody has  disagreed with us because it costs money. Nobody has disagreed with us  because it wasn't effective. Maybe they disagree with us because they  haven't utilized it the way so many other Americans have. I can't think  of a better legacy we can leave for generations to come than to  permanently reauthorize that, and I believe it will happen this  calendar year.   I thank the gentleman for yielding.
