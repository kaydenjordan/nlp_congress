 Mr. Speaker, last night, Florida's First Congressional  District lost an American hero who endured the tragedy of Pearl  Harbor--Chief Warrant Officer Frank Emond.   In 1938, Frank enlisted in the Navy as a French horn player where he  went on to become band director. On December 7, 1941, Frank was  preparing to play ``Morning Colors'' on the USS Pennsylvania when at  7:55 a.m., a line of Japanese planes came from the east with a surprise  attack on Pearl Harbor.   Frank boldly walked to the conductor stand, picked up his baton, and  proceeded to direct the band in ``The Stars and Stripes Forever.''   Frank Emond was a true patriot who deeply impacted the lives that he  touched doing what he loved to do: music.   Frank led the Pensacola Civic Band, the U.S. Air Force Band's Airmen  of Note, and currently holds the Guinness World Record as the world's  oldest conductor.   My greatest condolences to Frank Emond's family.   Thank you, Frank, for being an American hero. Your legacy is woven  into the history of this country and this Congress.                            ____________________
