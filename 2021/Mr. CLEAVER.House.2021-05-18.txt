 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1711) to amend the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010  to direct the Office of Community Affairs to identify causes leading  to, and solutions for, under-banked, un-banked, and underserved  consumers, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1711         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Financial Inclusion in       Banking Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. OFFICE OF COMMUNITY AFFAIRS DUTIES WITH RESPECT TO                     UNDER-BANKED, UN-BANKED, AND UNDERSERVED                     CONSUMERS.         Section 1013(b)(2) of the Consumer Financial Protection Act       of 2010 (12 U.S.C. 5493(b)(2)) is amended--        (1) by striking ``The Director shall establish a unit'' and       inserting the following:        ``(A) In general.--The Director shall establish a unit to       be known as the `Office of Community Affairs' ''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(B) Duties related to under-banked, un-banked, and       underserved consumers.--        ``(i) In general.--The Office of Community Affairs shall--         ``(I) lead coordination of research to identify any causes       and challenges contributing to the decision of individuals       who, and households that, do not initiate or maintain on-      going and sustainable relationships with depository       institutions, including consulting with trade associations       representing depository institutions, trade associations       representing minority depository institutions, organizations       representing the interests of traditionally underserved       consumers and communities, organizations representing the       interests of consumers (particularly low- and moderate-income       individuals), civil rights groups, community groups, consumer       advocates, and the Consumer Advisory Board about this matter;        ``(II) identify subject matter experts within the Bureau to       work on the issues identified under subclause (I);        ``(III) lead coordination efforts between other Federal       departments and agencies to better assess the reasons for the       lack of, and help increase the participation of, under-      banked, un-banked, and underserved consumers in the banking       system; and        ``(IV) identify and develop strategies to increase       financial education to under-banked, un-banked, and       underserved consumers.         ``(ii) Coordination with other bureau offices.--In carrying       out this paragraph, the Office of Community Affairs shall       consult with and coordinate with the research unit       established under subsection (b)(1) and such other offices of       the Bureau as the Director may determine appropriate.        ``(iii) Reporting.--         ``(I) In general.--The Office of Community Affairs shall       submit a report to Congress, within two years of the date of       enactment of this subparagraph and every 2 years thereafter,       that identifies any factors impeding the ability of, or       limiting the option for, individuals or households to have       access to fair, on-going, and sustainable relationships with       depository institutions to meet their financial needs,       discusses any regulatory, legal, or structural barriers to       enhancing participation of under-banked, un-banked, and       underserved consumers with depository institutions, and       contains recommendations to promote better participation for       all consumers with the banking system.        ``(II) Timing of report.--To the extent possible, the       Office shall submit each report required under subclause (I)       during a year in which the Federal Deposit Insurance       Corporation does not issue the report on encouraging use of       depository institutions by the unbanked required under       section 49 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.''.       SEC. 3. DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS FUNDS.         (a) In General.--The dollar amount specified under section       7(a)(3)(A) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C.       289(a)(3)(A)) is reduced by $10,000,000.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall take effect on September 30, 2031.       SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and insert extraneous materials thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Scott for his leadership on  this legislation, the Financial Inclusion in Banking Act.   This bill would direct the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's  Office of Community Affairs to identify causes leading to, and  solutions for, underbanked, unbanked, and underserved consumers.   The office would be required to share its findings in a report to  Congress every 2 years and coordinate with other Federal agencies to  increase financial education. Through these new requirements, this bill  would provide important information about unbanked and underbanked  consumers and ultimately help drive solutions that can decrease the  reliance on predatory financing products, like payday loans.   According to FDIC's latest survey from 2019, more than 7 million  American households, or roughly 5.4 percent, are unbanked. However, the  survey was taken before the pandemic, and the agency noted it would  likely result in an increase in the unbanked rate.   Even some individuals and families that may have a bank account still  end up utilizing other forms of credit, like a pawn shop or payday  loan, which are typically more expensive than bank credit. Nearly 5  percent of all households utilize these products, but again, these are  prepandemic numbers, and we know millions have lost their jobs and may  turn to these other forms of credit.   Moreover, access to traditional banking accounts is one way to  expeditiously deliver government stimulus deposits to individuals and  families that need help quickly.   Access to banking is a racial justice issue, as well. According to  the FDIC's prepandemic data, 13.8 percent of Black households and 12.2  percent of Latinx households are unbanked, compared to just 2.5 percent  of White households.   Everyone deserves access to safe, reliable, and affordable banking  options in order to grow their savings, build credit, and conduct  financial transactions in a secure way. This bill would be an important  step in achieving that goal.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the great gentleman  from Georgia (Mr.   David Scott), who is the sponsor of this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank the Hill-Scott combination for this legislation. It also is,  I think, a testament to what we can do if we work together.   The Financial Inclusion in Banking Act, led by Representative Scott,  would provide essential information on unbanked and underserved  customers, as well as identify potential solutions to the reliance on  unconventional financial products, which often lead to predatory  lending and cycles of being trapped in debt.   Communities of color have been excluded from the traditional economic  system due to historical discrimination. All consumers deserve access  to less expensive and more secure mainstream financial products.   The House passed identical legislation unanimously by voice vote in  October 2019, and I urge Republican and Democratic Members to join me  in supporting this bill again.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 707) to award a Congressional Gold Medal to the 23d  Headquarters, Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Service Company, in  recognition of their unique and highly distinguished service as a  ``Ghost Army'' that conducted deception operations in Europe during  World War II, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 707         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ghost Army Congressional       Gold Medal Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) The 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, comprised of the       23d Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Special Troops,       the 603d Engineer Camouflage Battalion, the 406th Combat       Engineer Company, the 3132d Signal Service Company and the       Signal Company, Special, 23d Headquarters, Special Troops and       the 3133d Signal Service Company were top-secret units of the       United States Army that served in Europe during World War II.        (2) The 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, was actively       engaged in battlefield operations from June of 1944 through       March of 1945. The 3133d Signal Service Company was engaged       in operations in Italy in 1945.        (3) The deceptive activities of these units were integral       to several Allied victories across Europe and reduced       American casualties.        (4) In evaluating the performance of these units after the       War, a U.S. Army analysis found that ``Rarely, if ever, has       there been a group of such a few men which had so great an       influence on the outcome of a major military campaign.''.        (5) Many Ghost Army soldiers were citizen-soldiers       recruited from art schools, advertising agencies,       communications companies, and other creative and technical       professions.        (6) The first four members of the 23d Headquarters, Special       Troops, landed on D-Day and two became casualties while       creating false beach landing sites.        (7) The 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, secret deception       operations commenced in France on June 14, 1944, when Task       Force Mason, a 17-man detachment of the 23d led by First       Lieutenant Bernard Mason, landed at Omaha Beach. Task Force       Mason conducted Operation ELEPHANT between 1 and 4 July,       1944, to draw enemy fire and protect the 980th Field       Artillery Battalion (VIII Corps) as part of the Normandy       Campaign.        (8) Operation ELEPHANT was a prelude to 21 full-scale       tactical deceptions completed by the 23d Headquarters,       Special Troops.        (9) Often operating on or near the front lines, the 23d       Headquarters, Special Troops, used inflatable tanks,       artillery, airplanes and other vehicles, advanced engineered       soundtracks, and skillfully crafted radio trickery to create       the illusion of sizable American forces where there were none       and to draw the enemy away from Allied troops.        (10) The 3132d and the 3133d Signal Service Companies,       activated in Pine Camp (now Fort Drum), New York, at the Army       Experimental Station in March 1944, were the only two active       duty ``sonic deception'' ground combat units in World War II.        (11) Soldiers of the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops,       impersonated other, larger Army units by sewing counterfeit       patches onto their uniforms, painting false markings on their       vehicles, and creating phony headquarters staffed by fake       generals, all in an effort to feed false information to Axis       spies.        (12) During the Battle of the Bulge, the 23d Headquarters,       Special Troops, created counterfeit radio traffic to mask the       efforts of General George Patton's Third Army as it mobilized       to break through to the 101st Airborne and elements of 10th       Armored Division in the besieged Belgian town of Bastogne.        (13) In its final mission, Operation VIERSEN, in March       1945, the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, conducted a       tactical deception that drew German units down the Rhine       River and away from the Ninth Army, allowing the Ninth Army       to cross the Rhine into Germany. On this mission, the 1,100       men of the Ghost Army, with the assistance of other units,       impersonated forty thousand men, or two complete divisions of       American forces, by using fabricated radio networks,       soundtracks of construction work and artillery fire, and more       than 600 inflatable vehicles. According to a military       intelligence officer of the 79th Infantry, ``There is no       doubt that Operation VIERSEN materially assisted in deceiving       the enemy with regard to the real dispositions and intentions       of this Army.''.        (14) Three soldiers of the 23d Headquarters, Special       Troops, gave their lives and dozens were injured in carrying       out their mission.        (15) In April 1945, the 3133d Signal Service Company       conducted Operation CRAFTSMAN in support of Operation SECOND       WIND, the successful allied effort to break through the       German defensive position to the north of Florence, Italy,       known as the Gothic Line. Along with an attached platoon of       British engineers, who were inflatable decoy specialists, the       3133d Signal Service Company used sonic deception to       misrepresent troop locations along this defensive line.        (16) The activities of the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops       and the 3133d Signal Service Company remained highly       classified for more than forty years after the war and were       never formally recognized. The extraordinary accomplishments       of this unit are deserving of belated official recognition.        (17) The United States is eternally grateful to the       soldiers of the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops and the       3133d Signal Service Company for their proficient use of       innovative tactics throughout World War II, which saved lives       and made significant contributions to the defeat of the Axis       powers.       SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.         (a) Award Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of       Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate       shall make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf       of the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design to the       23d Headquarters, Special Troops, and the 3133d Signal       Service Company, known as the ``Ghost Army'', collectively,       in recognition of its unique and incredible service during       World War II.        (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award       referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury       (in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall strike       the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and       inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.        (c) Smithsonian Institution.--        (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal in       honor of the Ghost Army, the gold medal shall be given to the       Smithsonian Institution, where it will be available for       display as appropriate and available for research.        (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of the Congress       that the Smithsonian Institution should make the gold medal       awarded pursuant to this Act available for display elsewhere,       particularly at appropriate locations associated with the       Ghost Army, and that preference should be given to locations       affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution.       SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.         The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of       the gold medal struck under section 3, at a price sufficient       to cover the costs of the medal, including labor, materials,       dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses.       SEC. 5. NATIONAL MEDAL.         The gold medal struck pursuant to this Act is a national       medal for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States       Code.       SEC. 6. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 707, the Ghost Army  Congressional Gold Medal Act.   I thank the gentlewoman from New Hampshire for her work on this bill  which honors the creativity and ingenuity of the men of the 23d  Headquarters, Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Service Company in  conducting deception operations in Europe during World War II.   The Ghost Army was a 1,100-man unit comprised mostly of individuals  recruited from art schools. They were from advertising agencies,  communications companies, and other creative fields. They were tasked  with using their creative talents to mislead, deceive, and confuse the  German Army and lure them away from Allied combat units.  [[Page H2453]]    Following the D-day landing in France, the Ghost Army undertook a  ``traveling road show'' utilizing fake radio transmissions, inflatable  tanks, and theatrical sounds and atmospheric effects to conduct  elaborate ruses to deflect German units away from the actual Allied  unit location and towards imaginary ones.   The artists, architects, engineers of the Ghost Army were so  effective that a later Army analysis of the performance found that,  ``Rarely, if ever, has there been a group of such a few men which had  so great an influence on the outcome of a major military campaign.''   The bravery, ingenuity, and patriotic actions displayed by these  citizen-soldiers remained highly classified for more than 40 years  after World War II and were never formally recognized.   This bill honors their unique contributions to the war effort by  directing the Mint to strike a gold medal in honor of the Ghost Army.  The gold medal shall be given to the Smithsonian Institution, where it  will be available for display and serve as recognition of this  incredible service of the Ghost Army during World War II.   Madam Speaker, I thank Ms. Kuster for her work on this bill, and I  urge Members to vote ``yes.''   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), the sponsor of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from New Hampshire.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is one of the most amazing things that I have  had the opportunity to support since I have been in Congress. And this  bill is simply amazing. It ensures official recognition of creativity  and innovation displayed by members of the Ghost Army in saving lives,  contributing to the defeat of the axis powers during World War II.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Kuster for her work in ensuring recognition  of this brave and talented group of citizen-soldiers and their unique  contributions to the war effort.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3146) to amend the Defense Production Act of 1950 to ensure  the supply of certain medical materials essential to national defense,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3146         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Securing America's Vaccines       for Emergencies Act of 2021'' or the ``SAVE Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. SECURING ESSENTIAL MEDICAL MATERIALS.         (a) Statement of Policy.--Section 2(b) of the Defense       Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 4502) is amended--        (1) by redesignating paragraphs (3) through (8) as       paragraphs (4) through (9), respectively; and        (2) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following:        ``(3) authorities under this Act should be used when       appropriate to ensure the availability of medical materials       essential to national defense, including through measures       designed to secure the drug supply chain, and taking into       consideration the importance of United States       competitiveness, scientific leadership and cooperation, and       innovative capacity;''.        (b) Strengthening Domestic Capability.--Section 107 of the       Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 4517) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``(including medical       materials)'' after ``materials''; and        (2) in subsection (b)(1), by inserting ``(including medical       materials such as drugs, devices, and biological products to       diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease that are       essential to national defense)'' after ``essential       materials''.        (c) Strategy on Securing Supply Chains for Medical       Materials.--Title I of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50       U.S.C. 4511 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the       following:       ``SEC. 109.

(2) Scope of definitions.--The definitions required by       paragraph (1)--        (A) shall encompass--  [[Page H2455]]         (i) the organization, people, activities, information, and       resources involved in the delivery and operation of a product       or service used by the Government; or        (ii) critical infrastructure as defined in Presidential       Policy Directive 21 (February 12, 2013; relating to critical       infrastructure security and resilience); and        (B) may include variations as determined necessary and       appropriate by the President for purposes of national       defense.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3146, the Securing  America's Vaccines for Emergencies Act of 2021, introduced by my  colleague, Mr. French Hill.   The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly demonstrated that ensuring the  availability of the essential medical supplies, articles, and equipment  to fight disease is essential to our national defense. This bill would  better equip us to respond to the current pandemic, as well as future  public health emergencies, by amending the Defense Production Act of  1950, to ensure that the definition of national defense includes the  availability of medical articles.   H.R. 3146 strengthens our ability to respond to public health  emergencies through measures designed to secure the drug supply chain.  Specifically, the bill requires the development of a strategy on  securing supply chains for medical articles. This includes reporting to  Congress on an analysis of existing supply chain vulnerabilities for  medical articles and recommendations to address these vulnerabilities,  including measures to diversify supply chains and other efforts to  mitigate risk, while promoting American competitiveness, scientific  leadership, and industrial innovation in this area.   This bill will also provide for investment in supply chain security  for eligible entities if the President certifies to Congress that such  an investment is important to meet the national defense needs of the  United States.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Hill for his work in ensuring that we, as a  country, learn the lessons from this COVID-19 pandemic and are better  prepared to respond to the next public health emergency because of this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Vargas).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this time last year we watched as our brave healthcare  workers struggled all over this country to respond to the mounting  COVID-19 crisis, often with inadequate personal protective equipment  and limited medical supplies.   This bill ensures that we can direct our significant scientific  innovation and industrial capacity towards ensuring essential medical  supplies are readily available, and that our supply chains are  resilient in the face of threats to our collective health and well- being.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Hill for his work on this  important issue, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3125) to enhance authorities under the Defense Production  Act of 1950 to respond to the COVID-19 emergency, to provide additional  oversight of such authorities, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3125         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3125, the COVID-19  Emergency Medical Supplies Enhancement Act of 2021, introduced by my  colleague and friend, Mr. Vargas.   The Defense Production Act of 1950 provides the President with a wide  range of authorities to enhance the domestic industrial base to shift  towards the production of goods and materials essential to the defense  of our country.   At the time this law was written, they did not anticipate that  personal protection equipment, vaccines, and other medical supplies  could be essential to the defense of our country. This pandemic has  made abundantly clear that medical materials to ensure our public  health are absolutely essential to the defense of this country.   This bill would ensure that our Nation has access to medical  materials necessary to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by allowing  certain medical materials to qualify for purchase and increased  production under the DPA's authority. It would also amend the DPA to  ensure that the DPA's authorities could be used to address preparation  for the next public health emergency to help get the United States  ahead of deadly future pandemics.   Additionally, in order to respond to the evolving needs of local  authorities to counter the COVID-19 pandemic, this bill would provide  the Federal Government with the authority to allow State, local, and  Tribal governments' orders for qualifying goods and materials to be  prioritized ahead of the Federal Government.   Finally, to streamline engagement with the private sector on supply  chain support for production of essential materials to counter COVID- 19, this bill provides a framework that includes a dedicated outreach  representative and reporting to Congress on purchases made and  contracts entered into under DPA authority.   I would like to thank Mr. Vargas for his hard work in ensuring that  the President has the necessary tools at his or her disposal when they  respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.   For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to  support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Vargas).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time,  which will be very short like this bathing suit.   Mr. Speaker, this bill takes the lessons we have learned over the  past 14 months and builds on the DPA's purpose of harnessing our  domestic industrial base in the interest of national defense to ensure  that we have the medical materials necessary to respond to the COVID-19  pandemic and to future pandemics.   I thank Mr. Vargas for his vision and hard work in ensuring that our  Nation can bring together its leadership and scientific innovation and  our impressive domestic industrial base to support our collective  public health and well-being through access to necessary medical  materials.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3008) to amend the National Housing Act to authorize State- licensed appraisers to conduct appraisals in connection with mortgages  insured by the FHA and to require compliance with the existing  appraiser education requirement, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3008         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Homebuyer Assistance Act of       2021''.       SEC. 2. APPRAISAL STANDARDS FOR SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSING                     MORTGAGES.         (a) Certification or Licensing.--Paragraph (5) of section       202(g) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1708(g)) is       amended--        (1) by striking subparagraph (A) and inserting the       following new subparagraph:        ``(A)(i) in the case of an appraiser for a mortgage for       single-family housing, be certified or licensed by the State       in which the property to be appraised is located; and        ``(ii) in the case of an appraiser for a mortgage for       multifamily housing, be certified by the State in which the       property to be appraised is located; and''; and        (2) in subparagraph (B), by inserting before the period at       the end the following: ``, which, in the case of appraisers       for any mortgage for single-family housing, shall include       completion of a course or seminar that consists of not less       than 7 hours of training regarding such appraisal       requirements that is approved by the Course Approval Program       of the Appraiser Qualifications Board of the Appraisal       Foundation or a State appraiser certifying and licensing       agency''.        (b) Compliance With Verifiable Education Requirements;       Grandfathering.--Effective beginning on the date of the       effectiveness of the mortgagee letter or other guidance       issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section,       notwithstanding any choice or approval of any appraiser made       before such date of enactment, no appraiser may conduct an       appraisal for any mortgage for single-family housing insured       under title II of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1707 et       seq.) unless such appraiser is, as of such date of       effectiveness, in compliance with--        (1) all of the requirements under section 202(g)(5) of such       Act (12 U.S.C. 1708(g)(5)), as amended by subsection (a) of       this section, including the requirement under subparagraph       (B) of such section 202(g)(5) (relating to demonstrated       verifiable education in appraisal requirements); or        (2) all of the requirements under section 202(g)(5) of such       Act as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment       of this Act.        (c) Implementation.--Not later than the expiration of the       240-day period beginning on the date of the enactment of this       Act, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall       issue a mortgagee letter or other guidance that shall--        (1) implement the amendments made by subsection (a) of this       section;        (2) clearly set forth all of the specific requirements       under section 202(g)(5) of the National Housing Act (as       amended by subsection (a) of this section) for approval to       conduct appraisals under title II of such Act for mortgages       for single-family housing, which shall include--        (A) providing that the completion, prior to the effective       date of such mortgagee letter  [[Page H2459]]       or guidance, of training meeting the requirements under       subparagraph (B) of such section 202(g)(5) (as amended by       subsection (a) of this section) shall be considered to       fulfill the requirement under such subparagraph; and        (B) providing a method for appraisers to demonstrate such       prior completion; and        (3) take effect not later than the expiration of the 180-      day period beginning upon issuance of such mortgagee letter       or guidance.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and insert extraneous materials thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3008, the Homebuyer Assistance  Act of 2021, which would make a commonsense update to the Federal  Housing Administration's requirements governing appraisals to allow  licensed appraisers to conduct home valuations for FHA-backed  mortgages.   The current requirement to utilize a certified appraiser for all FHA  loans is simply outdated as it was put into place at a time when there  were no minimum Federal standards for State licensure of appraisers,  leaving concerns about consistency in competency across States.   Now that we do have minimum standards for licensure, FHA's  certification requirement is not only out of date and out of alignment  with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, it is also creating marketwide  pressures for lenders to require certified appraisers for all loans,  even if they are not FHA loans, just in case the mortgage switches to  an FHA loan midway through the process.   This, in turn, makes it harder for licensed appraisers to obtain work  at a time when certain areas are experiencing appraiser shortages, and  we are already struggling to effectively recruit new and diverse  appraisers. Licensed appraisers who are perfectly qualified to conduct  appraisals for GSE loans should be just as qualified to conduct  appraisals for FHA loans.   I would like to thank Mr. Sherman for introducing this legislation;  and the Republican cosponsor, Mr. Van Taylor, for supporting this all- important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman), who is a sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr.  Sherman) for bringing this legislation forward and for the support of  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Taylor).   This bill removes unnecessary barriers to the home-buying process,  which will help millions of FHA borrowers over time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2655) to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to  prohibit certain securities trading and related communications by those  who possess material, nonpublic information, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2655           Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives       of the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.           The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert any extraneous materials  thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2655, the Insider  Trading Prohibition Act, which was introduced by my colleague, Mr.  Himes.  [[Page H2461]]    This long-overdue bill creates a clear definition of illegal insider  trading under the securities laws so that there is a codified,  consistent standard for courts and market participants. This bill will  help to better protect the hard-earned savings of millions of Americans  and bring legal and regulatory certainty to U.S. securities markets.   For nearly 80 years, the Securities and Exchange Commission has  sought to hold corporate insiders accountable for insider trading  through general statutory antifraud provisions and rules it has  promulgated under those provisions. This has resulted in a web of court  decisions that generally prohibit insiders with a duty of trust and  confidence to a corporation from secretly trading on material,  nonpublic corporate information for their own personal gain.   These insiders are also generally prohibited from tipping outsiders,  known as tippees, who then trade on the information themselves, even  though they knew it was wrongly obtained. But because there isn't a  statutory definition of insider trading, there is uncertainty around  who is subject to insider trading prohibitions.   Further, with various court decisions, liability for this type of  violation has shifted. For example, in 2014, an appeals court added a  brand-new requirement that the tippee must not just know that  information was wrongfully disclosed but must also know about the  specific personal benefit that the insider received. This decision has  severely hampered the SEC's ability to prosecute insider trading cases.   According to Preet Bharara, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern  District of New York, this decision ``provides a virtual roadmap for  savvy hedge-fund managers to insulate themselves from tippee liability  by knowingly placing themselves at the end of a chain of insider  information and avoiding learning details about the sources of obvious  confidential and improperly disclosed information.''   I am pleased that this bill codifies existing case law and overturns  this new controversial requirement, creating a clear, consistent  standard for the SEC, the courts, and market participants to follow.   Last Congress, the House of Representatives passed this commonsense  bipartisan bill with an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 410-13.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to once again support this  important bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Himes), who is also a sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Himes).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, I am prepared  to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   H.R. 2655, the Insider Trading Prohibition Act, is a long overdue  piece of legislation that simply spells out the definition of illegal  insider trading under the security laws. It creates clarity for  participants in financial markets, and empowers the SEC to punish bad  actors.   This bill is supported by groups, including the Council of  Institutional Investors, the California State Teachers' Retirement  System, the North American Securities Administrators Association, and  Public Citizen.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on this important  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2959) to establish the Consumer and Investor Fraud Working  Group to help protect consumers and investors from fraud during the  COVID-19 pandemic, to assist consumers and investors affected by such  fraud, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2959         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``COVID-19 Fraud Prevention       Act''.       SEC. 2. CONSUMER AND INVESTOR FRAUD WORKING GROUP.         (a) Establishment.--Not later than the end of the 30-day       period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the       Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and       the Securities and Exchange Commission shall, jointly,       establish a working group to be known as the ``Consumer and       Investor Fraud Working Group'' (the ``Working Group'').        (b) Duties.--The Working Group shall facilitate       collaboration between the Bureau of Consumer Financial       Protection and the Securities and Exchange Commission on--        (1) providing resources to consumers and investors to avoid       fraud during the COVID-19 pandemic;        (2) providing resources, including information on the       availability of legal aid resources, to consumers and       investors who have been adversely impacted by such fraud; and        (3) such other topics as the Working Group determines       appropriate.        (c) Coordination With Other Agencies.--In carrying out the       duties described under subsection (b), the Working Group       shall coordinate and collaborate with other Federal and State       government agencies, as appropriate.        (d) Quarterly Report.--The Working Group shall issue a       quarterly report to the Committee on Financial Services of       the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking,       Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate on the progress of       the Working Group and summarizing--        (1) the resources made publicly available to consumers by       the Working Group;        (2) any public enforcement action taken jointly or       individually by any member of the Working Group;        (3) the number and description of consumer complaints       received by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and       the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding fraud       related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and        (4) any other actions of the Working Group.        (e) Sunset.--This section shall cease to have any force or       effect on and after December 31, 2022.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Representative Axne for her  leadership on H.R. 2959, the COVID-19 Fraud Prevention Act.   This bill would create a joint Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  and the Securities and Exchange Commission fraud working group to  better protect consumers and investors against fraudulent schemes  during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.   In the wake of the pandemic outbreak in the United States last year,  millions of American families lost work and struggled to keep food on  the table, pay their bills, and a roof over their heads. As early as  April 2020, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that more than 20  million workers had lost their jobs.   As consumers across the country struggled with their finances and to  stay protected against infection, predatory scammers and unscrupulous  actors have profited from consumers' concerns and anxiety.   Scams targeting consumers' economic stimulus payments and  unemployment benefits have delayed or prevented consumers from  receiving the resources that they desperately need.   At the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions  hearing held in March entitled ``Slipping Through the Cracks: Policy  Options to Help America's Consumers During the Pandemic,'' Carla  Sanchez-Adams, managing attorney with the Texas RioGrande Legal Aid,  shared the story of a client she called Ms. Y, who lost her job because  of the pandemic, fell ill from COVID-19, and became a victim of fraud.   Ms. Sanchez-Adams said: ``Ms. Y qualified for unemployment benefits  through the Texas Workforce Commission. Ms. Y does not have a bank  account, so her only option to receive her unemployment benefits was to  have the funds deposited on a prepaid card . . . '' The Texas Workforce  Commission ``disbursed $6,000 in unemployment benefits through the''  card. ``Soon after receiving her card, Ms. Y got COVID-19 and had to be  hospitalized. When she was released, she tried to access the funds . .  . and discovered there was'' not one single penny left. ``When she  called . . . to inquire about the problem, she was told that someone  had called, requested a new card be issued to an address in Michigan,  and that someone in Michigan had used all the funds.''   Ms. Y is, unfortunately, not alone in experiencing this kind of  shameless profiteering during a national crisis. Representative Axne's  bill would help ensure that consumers who have been impacted by fraud  can report it and have access to legal resources to combat it. It would  also provide coordination between the CFPB and the SEC to combat these  fraudulent schemes.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1400     Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers and am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time until Mr. Hill  yields back.  [[Page H2464]]         Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Madam Speaker, the COVID-19 Fraud Prevention Act led by  Representative Axne would provide essential resources and support for  consumers and investors to protect them against fraudulent schemes that  have been rampant during this tragic pandemic.   The House passed this unanimously by voice vote in September of 2020.  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me again in  supporting this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
