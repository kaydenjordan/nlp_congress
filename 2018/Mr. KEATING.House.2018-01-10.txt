 Mr. Speaker, on rollcall No. 8 on H. Res. 682, the rule  providing for consideration of S. 139, the FISA Amendments  Reauthorization Act of 2017, I am not recorded due to my attendance at  a briefing on airport security. Had I been present, I would have voted  ``no.''                            ____________________
