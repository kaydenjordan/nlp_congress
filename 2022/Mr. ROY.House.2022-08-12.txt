 Madam Speaker, my Democratic colleagues own this bill. Let's  be clear:   Tax increases for the average American, check.   $80 billion to the Internal Revenue Service to go after those  Americans, to hire agents, jobs already posted, check.  [[Page H7659]]    Increased electricity prices, increased gas prices, tilted windmills  with your unicorn energy policies, check.   Increased government and corporate control of healthcare, check.   I hear my colleagues talking about, ``Oh, we are going to go after  pharma.'' Well, what did the CDC say yesterday?   Don't worry about all of those mandates, don't worry about all of  those vaccines, and don't worry about all the quarantines. Sorry, pox  on us.   But my colleagues now today are going to dump hundreds of billions of  dollars into corporate America, screwing over the American people every  single day with tax audits, increased energy prices, and increased  taxes.   Congratulations. Take that to the polls.
