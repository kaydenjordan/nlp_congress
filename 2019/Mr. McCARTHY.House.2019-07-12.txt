 Madam Chair, the NDAA has been a bipartisan bill for  the last 58 consecutive years. In those decades, control of Congress  changed hands many times, with Democrats in the majority and  Republicans in the majority. Both parties maintained a consistent  motto: The troops come first. The troops come before politics. We are  making history this week because that all changed.   But not in the Senate, where the National Defense Authorization Act,  the NDAA passed with bipartisan support, not just Republicans, but  Chuck Schumer voted for it as well; 86 Senators.   But it is not being continued in the House, not under this majority.  The NDAA was a test for this new majority. It was a test of whether  they could put their radicalism aside and work across the aisle to do  what was right for the country. The Democrats, or should I say, many  call themselves socialist Democrats, failed that test.   After weeks of infighting they brought yet another partisan bill to  the floor. So this year's NDAA, at least the House version, will not  and cannot be bipartisan.   Now, let me give you a couple of reasons why:   First, the bill is filled with poison pills and rife with flaws. Here  are some of the most harmful ones.   It makes it tougher to recruit and retain effective soldiers and  negatively impacts military families. This bill cuts an astonishing  $1.2 billion from the military personnel accounts.   Terrorist attacks still threaten us and threaten the homeland, but  Democrats would close GTMO and, against all common sense, bring some of  the world's worst and most dangerous terrorists to the United States,  instead of keeping them where they belong.   Madam Chairwoman, it is going to be quite interesting history when  you cast this vote, and when these terrorists come to the homeland, how  you answer to your constituents that you cast that vote to make that  happen.   The humanitarian crisis on the southern border continues; so does the  Democrats refusal to address it. They are working to stop construction  on the border and, worse, placing severe restrictions on the military's  traditional mission to support border security.   Democrats have spent the last 2 years accusing President Trump of  being a Russian agent and telling us how big a threat Putin is. But  what does the NDAA do? It actually empowers Russia and China, gives  them an advantage.   Even when we worked with our NATO allies on what we would deal with  when it came to nuclear weapons, they deny it inside this bill.   When it comes to hypersonics, you cut it. When it comes to the future  of this country, you just put us in a weaker position.                                time  1000    Any way you look at it, this bill will not make America safer.   But the problems here go beyond bad policy ideas. The Democrats'  partisan process is egregious. Let's just look at the facts.   This year, 439 amendments, a record, were made in order. You would  think that would reflect bipartisan amendments. Why do you think it  would reflect bipartisan? Because let's look at the last 2 years, and I  can look at that because the gentleman on our side of the aisle who was  chair at that time ran two NDAA bills. At the end of the day, the vote  tally was way into the 300s, almost 400.   But how do you build something in bipartisanship? First, you start in  committee. Then when it comes to the floor with all the other Members,  you allow their amendments to come.   And those 2 years of those NDAA bills with Republicans in the  majority, do you know who had the majority of the amendments on this  floor? The minority party. The minority party had the most amendments  on this floor.   So of those 439, how was the minority party's voice heard in this new  NDAA that now has become partisan? Fourteen percent. That is right.  Fourteen percent of the amendments on this floor were allocated to the  minority party, when history proves that we have done something  different when somebody else was in charge.   But the most egregious of all of this was how they treated the rules  that we fought for inside this House, that we had this body open. We  are a country of the rule of law. We believe this House should work the  same way.   So when I listened to the new Speaker talk about the changes in this  body, one was a Consensus Calendar, that anybody who is elected to  Congress, if they did their work, if they worked hard, if they were  able to achieve more than 290 cosponsors on a bill, you should have a  voice on this floor. I heard Members on both sides of the aisle say  they could not vote for a Speaker unless somebody would agree to this.  It was agreed to, and it was changed.   So when the moment came when a Member had done the work, when it met  that threshold--and we know that threshold is hard to meet. That  Member's name was Congressman   Joe Wilson.   What did   Joe Wilson put his effort, his sweat, and his tears in?  What could he actually achieve by working on both sides of the aisle?  It was the Military Surviving Spouses Equity Act. It would make it  easier for spouses of servicemembers who died to receive military  benefits. He did everything that the new rule said you had to do.   And what did this new majority do after they quashed any ability for  amendments on the other side? They changed the rule that they just  created.   My father would look at me. He would question my character if I gave  somebody my word and I broke it. Not only did we give somebody our  word, we actually changed the rules in this House.     Joe Wilson has 365 sponsors--not just supporters, but cosponsors.  That is nearly this entire House. It qualified for the Consensus  Calendar that Speaker Pelosi promised to create so the floor would be  open to the best, and most of us agreed with that idea. It turns out  that was just another broken promise by the majority.   I wonder if anyone on the other side will bring it up. I wonder if it  will bother them that, in the moment that you told this body what the  rules would be, and somebody achieved it for the military spouses, that  you had actually changed the rule so it cannot be voted on.   I have seen a lot of things happen on this floor; I have seen a lot  of things that embarrass me; but this is probably  [[Page H5739]]  one of the most shameful things I have ever seen a majority do.   The Democrat Socialists stripped the language from   Joe Wilson's  bill, discarded his legislation, and stuck the language into their own  partisan NDAA that our Conference won't support. They put it into a  bill that   Joe Wilson can't even support after he did all the work,  after they made promises not only to the Members of Congress, but  remember what promise you made to the American public.   Our national security is not a game, but that is exactly how  Democrats are treating it.   Madam Chair, this majority has reached new lows this week. They seem  determined to prove to the American people week in and week out that  they are incapable of governing responsibly.   They can walk out these doors; they can look down the hall; and they  can see the Chamber on the other side taking up a similar bill that  reaches 86 percent of the Senate voting ``yes,'' with the leaders on  the Republican and Democrat side agreeing to it, with the majority in  the Senate not changing the rules that they laid out for the American  public to see.   The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2020 will determine whether our military  maintains its gains in readiness or languishes after years of progress.   The stakes of this year's defense budget are too high to be left to  the wild fantasies to the left. It is time for them to stop the  partisan games and send a message to the world that America is serious  about protecting its interests, supporting our allies, and shaping the  future of the international order for generations to come.   Madam Chair, I know what will happen on this floor today. History  will be written about it. Fifty-eight years that this body has put  troops first, this is not the history I want for this House. They will  write about what happens today, but it won't be in a positive notion.  What gets voted on today will not become law.   Madam Chair, I don't get into conference fights and debates. You can  have differences within, but why make the troops suffer? How difficult  is it to put the troops first?   There are moments for politics, and this is not one. This is not a  moment to be proud. This is probably one of the lowest moments I have  watched a majority use.
