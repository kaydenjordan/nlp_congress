 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule  providing combined consideration for H.R. 8, H.R. 1446, and H.R. 842.   I want to focus on the first two. That is where Democrats are  peddling their dangerous gun control agenda under the guise of working  to stem the tide of firearms used in crime and under the guise of  helping make our communities safer. These Democratic efforts are part  of their larger radical and shameful ploy to slowly chip away at the  Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.   As a Federal firearms dealer by trade, I remain staunchly opposed to  any effort that abridges our God-given Second Amendment right to keep  and bear arms--those inalienable rights recognized by the Constitution.                                time  1645    If enacted, H.R. 8 will criminalize many common and often necessary  firearm transfers between law-abiding citizens while not reducing  criminals' access to guns at all. I predict we will see more moms and  pops get busted for  [[Page H1092]]  illegal possession or transfer of a firearm than we will violent gang  members or criminals.   How on Earth will criminalizing moms and pops curtail firearms used  in a crime? The answer is that it won't. My Democrat colleagues are  naive to think that criminals are suddenly going to rush to the closest  firearms dealer to buy a gun. I know.   Even more egregious than H.R. 8 is H.R. 1446, as it not only sets up  a process by which American citizens would have to petition the  government to exercise their right to bear arms, but it also extends  the amount of time before a dealer can legally transfer a purchased  firearm.   Current law provides a 3-business-day safety valve to ensure the  government doesn't further infringe on the customer's constitutional  rights, and that must not be extended.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule and  ``no'' on the underlying bills.
