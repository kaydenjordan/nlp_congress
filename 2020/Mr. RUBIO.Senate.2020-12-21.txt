 Mr. President, this explanation reflects the status of  negotiations and disposition of issues reached between the Senate  Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select  Committee on Intelligence for the Intelligence Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2021.   The explanation shall have the same effect with respect to the  implementation of this act as if it were a joint explanatory statement  of a conference committee.   I ask unanimous consent that the joint explanatory statement for the  Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 be printed into the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:            Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021         The following is the explanation of the Intelligence       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (hereinafter, ``the       Act'').        This explanation reflects the result of negotiations and       disposition of issues reached between the Senate Select       Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) and the House Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) and the       (hereinafter, ``the Agreement''). The explanation shall have       the same effect with respect to the implementation of the Act       as if it were a joint explanatory statement of a conference       committee. The term ``Committees'' refers to both SSCI and       HPSCI.        The explanation comprises three parts: an overview of the       application of the annex to accompany this statement;       unclassified congressional direction; and a section-by-      section analysis of the legislative text.                 PART I: APPLICATION OF THE CLASSIFIED ANNEX         The classified nature of U.S. intelligence activities       prevents the SSCI and HPSCI (collectively, the       ``congressional intelligence committees'') from publicly       disclosing many details concerning the conclusions and       recommendations of the Agreement. Therefore, a classified       Schedule of Authorizations and a classified annex have been       prepared to describe in detail the scope and intent of the       congressional intelligence committees' actions. The Agreement       authorizes the Intelligence Community (IC) to obligate and       expend funds not altered or modified by the classified       Schedule of Authorizations as requested in the President's       budget, subject to modification under applicable       reprogramming procedures.        The classified annex is the result of negotiations between       the congressional intelligence committees. They reconcile the       differences between the congressional intelligence       committees' respective versions of the bill for the National       Intelligence Program (NIP) for Fiscal Year 2021. The       Agreement also makes recommendations for the Military       Intelligence Program (MIP) and the Information Systems       Security Program (ISSP), consistent with the National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, and provides certain       direction for these two programs. The Agreement applies to IC       activities for Fiscal Year 2021.        The classified Schedule of Authorizations is incorporated       into the bill pursuant to Section 102. It has the status of       law. The classified annex supplements and adds detail to       clarify the authorization levels found in the bill and the       classified Schedule of Authorizations. The congressional       intelligence committees view direction and recommendations,       whether contained in this explanation or in the classified       annex, as requiring compliance by the Executive Branch.             PART II: SELECT UNCLASSIFIED CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTION         This Joint Explanatory Statement incorporates by reference,       and the Executive Branch shall comply with, all direction       contained in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence       Report to accompany the Intelligence Authorization Act for       Fiscal Year 2021 (S. Rept. 116-233) and in the House       Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Report to       accompany the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year       2021 (H. Rept. 116-565).
