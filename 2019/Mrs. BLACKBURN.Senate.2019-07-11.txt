 Madam President, as I begin my remarks, I would like  to thank the Senator from Texas for the work he has done on arranging  our travel to the border tomorrow. I am one of those committee members  who will make that trip.   How wonderful it is that he is working with Chairman Graham to make  certain that we are going to be able to visit with the Border Patrol to  see and hear firsthand what is going on, making certain that we all  focus on the security of this great Nation and provide the resources  that are needed. I thank him for that good work.
