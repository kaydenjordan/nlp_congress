 Mr. Speaker, this Sunday, the Reverend Dr. Ronnie Floyd,  senior pastor of Cross Church in northwest Arkansas, will deliver his  final sermon in a joint service of the many campuses at Bud Walton  Arena in Fayetteville, Arkansas.   Dr. Floyd has served as senior pastor at Cross Church for almost 33  years. He has presided over an unprecedented expansion of the church  over four campuses in Arkansas and Missouri, with a combined membership  of nearly 28,000.   Under his vision and leadership, just under 23,000 have come to know  Christ as their personal savior, and Cross Church has an enviable  reputation of bringing the gospel of Jesus Christ to the Nation and the  world.   Average weekly attendance has grown from 1,800 people in 1986 to  nearly 10,000 today.   Dr. Floyd will become the president and CEO of the Southern Baptist  Convention's executive committee on May 20 in Nashville, Tennessee.   I speak for the entire congregation of Cross Church in wishing Dr.  Floyd and his wife, Jeana, the Lord's blessings during this transition  to a new and exciting ministry and thank him for 33 terrific years at  Cross Church.                            ____________________
