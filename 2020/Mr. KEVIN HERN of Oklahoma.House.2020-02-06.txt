 Madam Speaker, I have a motion to  recommit at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I am in its current form.    Madam Speaker, this motion is the final  opportunity to amend the legislation and would do so without any delay  in passage.   This amendment ensures that labor unions are not using illegal  foreign labor to expand their region to the American workplaces and  collect more union dues.   Under current law, an employee can sign a union authorization card to  count toward the showing of interest in union elections regardless of  whether that worker is authorized to work in the United States. Illegal  immigrants should not be working at American companies, let alone used  by labor unions to organize workplaces.   This motion to recommit ensures that unions cannot communicate with  employees for organizing purposes if the employee is not legally  authorized to work in the United States.   Because of the success I have worked for in life, not many people  know that my life began very differently.   My family was dependant on food stamps for most of my youth. My  stepdad never worked, and my siblings and I paid the price for it.   I knew from a young age that I would not let that be my life. From  the moment I could start working, I did whatever it took to earn  financial security: hog farming, welding, computer programming, and the  list goes on.   If it weren't for the McDonald's Franchisee program, I wouldn't be  here today. After 11 years working in the restaurants, I was able to  work my way into the franchisee program and purchase my first franchise  location, then build a successful company with over 20 locations; a  program that allowed a person that came from a place like I did to  achieve the American Dream.   I have lived a true American story. And my mission in life is to help  every child who grew up like me, wondering where their next meal would  come from, unsure if their lights would be on when they got home from  school; I want those kids to know that our country is a place of  opportunity and a place of hope for those who will work for it.   We shouldn't be here discussing this bill today. It is not worthy of  this Chamber. But since we are, I must do everything I can to show my  disapproval in the strongest terms.   The change we are proposing here is simple. We are asking that unions  be barred from contacting individuals who are not eligible to work in  this country.   If an employer cannot hire someone in our country illegally, a union  should not be allowed to organize those individuals. Believe it or not,  this is not currently outlawed.   If my colleagues insist on moving forward with legislation that  empowers union bosses and strips independence from our workers, they  should not do it in a way that encourages illegal immigration.   This motion to recommit would make the PRO Act pro-American worker,  rather than just pro-union bosses.  [[Page H926]]    I have been doing my research a long time. I spent 34 years as a  business owner before coming to Congress. I have dealt with union  issues for longer than some of my colleagues have been alive.   AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who will financially benefit from  the passage of this bill, said:         Those who will oppose, delay, or derail this legislation,       do not ask us for a single dollar or a door knock. We won't       be coming.    Well, I am standing here today to let Mr. Trumka know that I proudly  oppose this legislation.   One of the biggest glaring failures of this legislation is taking  away employee choice; effectively repealing right-to-work laws all  across this country, like in my home State, where we choose to empower  employers and employees alike.   Decades of legal precedent will be pushed aside. Where workers have  previously had the freedom to choose whether or not to pay fees and  join a union, they will now be forced to pay membership fees or lose  their job. This will put immeasurable power in the hands of union  bosses.   Privacy provisions--that have been in place for decades--barring  unions from accessing private information about employees, will be  eradicated under this bill. You heard that right. Unions will be able  to access employees' private information, even those that are not  members of the union. They can use that information for anything; sell  it to the highest bidder, all without the knowledge or the consent of  the individuals.   The same franchises that gave me the opportunity to achieve the  American Dream are under attack with this legislation. Over 750,000  franchise locations that employ more than 8 million people are at risk  because of the joint employer provisions in the bill.   The expanded joint employer standard has cost franchise businesses  $33.3 billion per year; resulting in 376,000 lost job opportunities and  93 percent more lawsuits.   Many of the ideas in this bill have already been rejected in the  court system and are currently opposed by a bipartisan coalition in  Congress.   I urge my friends across the aisle to support the motion to recommit  on behalf of the American worker and their right to choose.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
