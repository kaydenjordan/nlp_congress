 Mr. President, very sadly, we are on the precipice of a  government shutdown. The majority leader only just allowed us to vote  on a continuing resolution that he knew lacked the votes long before  this hour. It is not just Democrats who oppose this CR; several  Republicans did as well.   All of today, we have endeavored to reach an agreement with President  Trump and the Republicans that would have not only spared a government  shutdown but cemented an agreement on spending caps, including those  for our military, the healthcare issues, disaster relief, and  immigration issues.   President Trump reached out to me this morning to invite me to the  White House to talk over all of these issues, and I accepted. We had a  lengthy and substantive discussion. During the meeting, in exchange for  strong DACA protections, I reluctantly put the border wall on the table  for discussion. Even that was not enough to entice the President to  finish the deal. Many Democrats don't want to go that far on  [[Page S353]]  the border. Many Republicans don't either. But we were willing to  compromise with the President to get an agreement. In the room, it  sounded like the President was open to accept it. This afternoon, in my  heart, I thought we might have a deal tonight. That was how far we had  come. That is how positive our discussion felt. We had a good meeting,  but what has transpired since that meeting in the Oval Office is  indicative of the entire tumultuous and chaotic process Republicans  have engaged in in the negotiations thus far.   Even though President Trump seemed to like an outline of a deal in  the room, he did not press his party in Congress to accept it. Speaker  Ryan and Leader McConnell, without the commitment of the President,  would not agree to accept anything either.   What happened to the President Trump who asked us to come up with a  deal and promised that he would take heat for it? What happened to that  President? He backed off at the first sign of pressure.   We had the outline of a deal on caps. We had the outline of a deal on  healthcare. We had the outline of a deal on immigration, the toughest  issue. It was real, and it was an honest-to-goodness breakthrough. We  could have passed a short-term extension of funding so that we could  cross the t's, dot the i's, and be done with it all, but the dynamic of  the past few weeks during which the congressional Republicans looked to  the President for guidance and the President provided none prevailed  again today, unfortunately. The same chaos, the same disarray, the same  division and discord on the Republican side that has been in the  background of these negotiations for months unfortunately appears  endemic, and it is standing in the way of bipartisan solutions to all  of the issues now before us.   Every American knows the Republican Party controls the White House,  the Senate, and the House. It is their job to keep the government open.  It is their job to work with us on a way to move things forward. But  they didn't reach out to us once on this CR--no discussion, no debate,  nothing at all. It was produced without an ounce of Democratic input  and dropped in our laps. Meanwhile, they can't even get on the same  page as a party. They control every branch of the legislative process,  and it is their responsibility to govern, and here they have failed.   Several Republicans voted against the CR, as well as Democrats, for  the same reason we voted against it. One of the most serious  consequences of having continuing resolution after continuing  resolution is the damage it does to our military. As the Pentagon  spokesman said last night, another CR would be wasteful and destructive  to our military. The Navy Secretary said that because of CRs, ``[the  Navy has] put $4 billion in the trash can, poured lighter fluid on it,  and burned it.'' That is the Navy Secretary--because of what you have  done.   This is no way to conduct the Nation's business. Republicans know it.  Democrats know it. The American people know that this party is not  capable of governing.   So where do we go from here? I believe many of my Republican  colleagues sincerely want to get a deal. I know their hearts are in the  right place. I know they lament the fact that we now accept  brinksmanship where bipartisanship used to be. In the past, there was  always discussions on these issues. Everyone knew in the Senate you  needed both parties to work together. None of that happened here today.   Now, all of this problem is because Republican leadership can't get  to yes because President Trump refuses to.   President Trump, if you are listening, I am urging you, please take  yes for an answer. The way things went today, the way you turned from a  bipartisan deal, it is almost as if you were rooting for a shutdown,  and now we will have one, and the blame should crash entirely on  President Trump's shoulders.   This will be called a Trump shutdown. This will be called a Trump  shutdown because there is no one--no one--who deserves the blame for  the position we find ourselves in more than President Trump. He walked  away from two bipartisan deals, including one today in which I even put  the border wall on the table. What will it take for President Trump to  say yes and learn how to execute the rudiments of government?   Tomorrow marks a year to the day President Trump took the oath of  office on the Capitol steps. Unfortunately, a Trump shutdown would be a  perfect encapsulation of the chaos he has unleashed on our government.  Instead of bringing us all together, he has pulled us apart. Instead of  governing from the middle, he has outsourced his Presidency to the  extremes. Instead of living up to the great dealmaker he marketed  himself to be, he has been the single driving force in scuttling  bipartisan deals in Congress.   Now, at this late hour, his behavior is on the verge of grinding our  government to a halt--a Trump shutdown. Democrats will continue to  strive for a bipartisan agreement on all of the outstanding issues. I  know there are men and women of good will on the other side of the  aisle who are just as upset as I am with the direction we are headed  in. I plead with them to see reason and prevail upon their leaders--and  most of all the President--to give us the space to work together, to  let us do the job the American people sent us here to do.   When President Trump decides he is finally ready to lead his party to  a deal, Democrats will be ready, willing, and eager to clinch it. There  is a path forward. We can reach it quickly.   Tomorrow, the President and the four leaders should immediately sit  down and finish this deal so the entire government can get back to work  on Monday.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to particularly commend the five  Democrats who voted not to shut the government down. The new Senator  from Alabama, during his campaign, said it was important to fund the S- CHIP program before it ran out of money, and he listened to the seven  Democratic Governors who said: This is an emergency; we need help.   There were five courageous Democrats on the other side who stood up  to this ridiculous argument that it made sense somehow to shut down the  government over an illegal immigration issue that the vast majority of  this body would like to do something about anyway.   I want to particularly commend the five Democrats who had the courage  to stand up to this ridiculous strategy that put their whole party in  an incredible predicament because, as the White House just indicated,  the President is not going to talk about the issue at all while the  government is shut down. He made it quite clear. He said: ``When  Democrats start paying our armed forces and first responders, we will  reopen negotiations on immigration reform.''   So this particular strategy has eliminated the possibility of getting  a signature on the thing they shut the government down over. Can  anybody explain to me this strategy? I am perplexed. I wasn't first in  my class, but I wasn't last either. How does this get them what they  are looking for?   We will continue to talk because when all the games stop, the issues  are still there--every single one of them are still there. The American  people expect us to act like adults, to get together and solve the  problems.   Now I will be offering an amendment to change the date to February 8.  We will, unfortunately, not be able to get that vote tonight, but I  will be subsequently asking for consent, but at some point here, we  will be voting on February 8. That is the date the senior Senator from  South Carolina and I have been talking about, and the Democratic leader  and I have been talking about--which begins to move a little bit closer  to where our friends on the other side said they wanted to be--but a  reasonable period of time that takes into account the State of the  Union, our party conferences, and the amount of time it takes to  actually write a bill once you have an agreement. You can't just reach  an agreement, snap your fingers, and everything falls into place and  you are ready to go. It is a reasonable period to first agree, and then  write, get ready to negotiate a settlement that we have been working on  for months. February 8 is a very reasonable time. I hear there is  sentiment for that on both sides of the aisle. I hope so.  [[Page S354]]    At some point, we will vote on that option. I can't get that vote  tonight, but I am going to ask consent to have that vote tonight.               Vote on Motion to Refer with Amendment No. 1905    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to table the motion to refer.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 1301    Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, this shouldn't take very long.   I was most disappointed tonight when the President of the United  States put out a statement that tried to divide us based on party when  it came to support of our military. There is no such division. Everyone  in this Chamber knows it. So, as we have in other instances where we  have had a shutdown--I remember, in 2013, we did this right off the  bat. I want to make sure that tonight we send a very clear signal that  we don't want one moment to pass with there being any uncertainty that  any soldier anywhere in the world will be paid for the valiant work  they do on behalf of our national security.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of Calendar No. 36, H.R. 1301; that the  amendment at the desk, providing for continuing appropriations for pay  and death benefits for members of the Armed Services, be considered and  agreed to, the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and  passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we  passed similar legislation during the government shutdown back in 2013.  My hope is that we can restore funding for the entire government before  this becomes necessary. I am going to object for tonight, but we will  discuss it again tomorrow. Therefore, I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   The Senator from Florida.                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 1301
