 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Connecticut. As I would want her to know, I am ecstatic about the great  leadership of her chairwomanship as well as all the Cardinals who have  worked, and I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, many  of whom really know that this is a very, very fine response to the  needs of the American people.   Might I just say to the chair of the Appropriations Committee, just  very quickly, that I was here for the Hyde amendment. I was on the  Judiciary Committee. I think my colleagues need to understand that for  all the years of the Hyde committee, women who were poor, who were  Medicaid recipients, many of them might have died in childbirth and  might have had other important emergency health issues because they  were subjected to decisions that they did not make for themselves. In  that instance, we have discriminated against women just because of  their poverty.   Again, abortion is that of the woman, her faith, and her family. I  believe this eliminating of the Hyde amendment is finally saying to all  women in America that we respect you and your bodies.   I am very grateful for the support of an amendment that recognizes  the crisis of diabetes and the need for research professionals and  patients participating in clinical trials. Diversity in medical trials  is essential to ensuring that cures, especially vaccines and therapies,  work for the greatest number of persons. So my amendment decreases and  increases the amount for $10 million to emphasize and get more emphasis  to develop that diversity pool in research professionals and patients  participating in trials.     Diabetes impacts all social, economic, and ethnic  backgrounds, particularly African Americans. I meet many people in my  constituency who have had an amputation because they were not able to  receive medical care.   Finally, I have an amendment that increases and decreases funds $10  million with the intent of supporting individuals who might not finish  college because of the impact of COVID. COVID is now resurging but the  delta variant is surging. People are being hospitalized, the  unvaccinated.   I make a national plea for people to be vaccinated.   As well it is impacting young people. That means that we need to  focus on young people getting vaccinated. They are in college. We don't  know, if they are not vaccinated, how it will impact their education  and their future life.   So this is to provide the targeting programs to reach out to young  people to tell them: One, get vaccinated. But to give them a bridge so  that their education will not be interrupted, that they will never go  back again, and that they will not suffer economically.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate my amendments being brought to the floor.  I thank the leadership and as well I thank leadership for all the  community projects that are helping the impoverished in my district.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of En Bloc Amendment No. 2 to Rules  Committee Print 117-12, which incorporates Jackson Lee Amendments Nos.  25 and 26.   I thank the Rules Committee for making these amendments in order and  Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee Chair DeLauro for including  them in this En Bloc Amendment.      Division A--Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and                      Education, and Related Agencies    Jackson Lee Amendment #25, increases and decreases funds by  $10,000,000 increase in funding to support greater diversity in the  pool of diabetes research professionals and patients participating in  clinical trials.   Diversity in medical trials is essential to ensuring that cures,  especially vaccines, and therapies, work for the greatest number of  persons impacted by an illness.   34.2 million people, or 10.5 percent of the U.S. population, have  diabetes. An estimated 26.8 million people--or 10.2 percent of the  population--have been diagnosed with diabetes.   Approximately 7.3 million people have diabetes but have not yet been  diagnosed (2018).   Diabetes impacts all social, economic, and ethnic backgrounds,  particularly African Americans.   Type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5.2 percent of all diagnosed cases  of diabetes, affecting approximately 1.6 million people.   Jackson Lee Amendment #26 increases and decreases funds by  $10,000,000 with the intent of supporting programs that provide  outreach and support services targeting program participants at  greatest risk of not completing a college degree due to COVID-19  education disruption.   I urge all Members to vote En Bloc Amendment #2.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask support for en bloc No. 3  and these important amendments. Let me emphasize my first amendment,  really, with a great deal of gratitude, because this is so very  important.   Human trafficking is a scourge on this Nation, and it has no  boundaries; it is both domestic and international, but one of the  things that is needed is for those who are trafficked, when they are  found, to be able to cooperate with law enforcement. Many of those  women are nondocumented immigrant women.   My amendment says none of the funds made available by this act for  domestic food programs, Food and Nutrition Service, Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program may be used in contravention of section  107(b) of Division A of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence  Protection Act of 2000.   The effect of this amendment will be to make clear that nothing in  this bill restricts the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture or  any Federal agency head from providing assistance and benefits to  victims of trafficking under current law so that they can engage with  law enforcement and get the scourge, the person who trafficked, because  they take advantage of these immigrants, and they cannot survive if  they don't have subsistence. Many times they are denied it, because we  have not made it clear to the States they are allowed to have it.   This amendment is going to save lives. I thank my colleagues for  providing this particular amendment, and as well it is clear that it is  needed, because it provides victims of trafficking access to  information about their eligibility to receive SNAP benefits. It does  not constitute the type of SNAP recruitment activity or advertising of  the SNAP program prohibited by the bill, but more importantly, it helps  those who are victims.   Trafficking in humans, and especially domestic child trafficking, has  no place in civilized society. It is the most lucrative business,  better than drugs, and that is why it is--over and over again.   Having held the first field hearing on human trafficking, I can tell  you this is an important amendment. I ask my colleagues to support the  Jackson Lee amendment and en bloc No. 3.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of En Bloc Amendment No. 3 to Rules  Committee Print 117-12, which incorporates Jackson Lee Amendment No.  68.   I thank the Rules Committee for making these amendments in order and  Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Bishop for including it  in this En Bloc Amendment.   Jackson Lee Amendment #68 is simple and straightforward, but it makes  an important contribution to the bill and to a goal that every Member  of this body shares--and that is ending the scourge of human  trafficking.   My amendment provides that:   None of the funds made available by this Act for ``Domestic Food  Programs--Food and Nutrition Service--Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program'' may be used in contravention of section 107(b) of Division A  of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (22  U.S.C. 7105(b)).   The effect of this amendment will be to make clear that nothing in  this bill restricts the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture or  any federal agency head from providing assistance and benefits to  victims of trafficking under current law as authorized by 22 U.S.C.  Sec. 7105(b) of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act  of 2000 (114 Stat. 1464, Pub. Law 106-386).   In particular, Jackson Lee Amendment #68 is necessary to make clear  that providing victims of trafficking access to information about their  eligibility to receive SNAP benefits does not constitute the type of  SNAP recruitment activities or ``advertising'' of the SNAP program  prohibited by the bill and by Section 4018 of the Agriculture Act of  2014 (Public Law No: 113-079).   Trafficking in humans, and especially domestic child trafficking, has  no place in a civilized society. Those who engage in this illicit trade  should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. This House made  that clear again last month when it passed H.R. 3530, the Justice for  Victims of Trafficking Act, which contained my Sense of the Congress  amendment added during the Judiciary Committee markup.   That means we need to ensure that state and local law enforcement  agencies have the tools, resources, and training necessary to identify,  apprehend, and prosecute criminals who ruthless traffic in children and  young persons.   And one of the most effective resources in bringing criminals to  justice is the cooperation and assistance of their victims.   Perpetrators of crime know that they are more likely to evade  detection and punishment when their victims refuse to assist or  cooperate with law enforcement. That is why they make it a point to  instill fear in their victims--for their own safety or that of family  and loved ones.   I urge all Members to vote En Bloc Amendment #3.  [[Page H4070]]         Mr. Speaker, let me mention the amendments that I  have in en bloc No. 6. I will focus on a few of them.   I have Nos. 157, 216, 220, 219, 218, 217, amendments that I think  will make the legislation better but also help the American people and,  certainly, focus on issues that are impacting my district. But these  are universal matters that should be addressed.   My amendment increases and decreases funding for the Environmental  Programs and Management by $5 million to highlight the need to support  culturally competent Federal, State, and local public health and  environmental protection efforts to address cancer clusters impacting  overburdened communities in the Gulf Coast region. That includes Fifth  Ward and Kashmere Gardens, among others, in the northeast part of  Houston which have suffered because of creosote contamination,  Superfunds, railroads that have contaminated the soil. They have seen  the seismic increase of cancer among families. It is going through  generations. I have met these families, and they have had mothers,  fathers, children, grandchildren have cancer and die of cancer. This is  an important legislative amendment for me.   Amendment No. 216, very quickly, deals with the reckless utilization  of Federal dollars by the Texas Department of Transportation. We have,  by our community, filed 106 complaints against them. This amendment  indicates that you cannot put in place a transportation project that  has not been determined to meet the statutory and fiduciary obligations  of the National Historic Preservation Act. It pertains to I-45.   In addition, we provide funding or focus on motorcycle, urban  bicycle, and pedestrian safety. That is a challenge in the State of  Texas, and we have had a lot of injuries because of the lack of  sensitivity to that question.   In addition, we have a housing amendment and other amendments that  are very important to this legislation in my district.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of En Bloc Amendment No. 6 to Rules  Committee Print 117-12, which incorporates Jackson Lee Amendments Nos.  157, and 216-220.   I thank the Rules Committee for making these amendments in order and  Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Price for including them  in this En Bloc Amendment.                   Division E--Interior and the Environment    Jackson Lee Amendment #157 increases and decreases funding for  Environmental Programs and Management by $5 million to highlight the  need to support culturally competent federal, state, and local public  health and environmental protection efforts to address cancer clusters  impacting overburdened communities in the gulf coast region.          Division G--Transportation, Housing and Urban Development    Jackson Lee Amendment #216 prohibits the Department of Transportation  from using funds for Section 106 Transportation construction projects  in urban areas that have not been determined to meet the statutory and  fiduciary obligations of the National Historic Preservation Act.   Jackson Lee Amendment #220 increases and decreases the National  Infrastructure Investments account by $1,000,000 to emphasize support  for urban bicycle and pedestrian safety programs.   Jackson Lee Amendment #219 increases and decreases by $1 million the  Federal Rail Administration Safety and Operation's account to emphasize  the need to provide dedicated funding to address community engagement  on safety issues related railroad crossings in urban areas.   Jackson Lee Amendment #218 provides $1,000,000 in assistance to  address challenges faced by communities impacted by persistent poverty  and are not included in decision making when major highway construction  threatens their homes, businesses, and culturally significant  structures.   Jackson Lee Amendment #217 increases by $1,000,000 the Office of Fair  Housing and Equal Opportunity to address the fairness in the use of  Community Development Block Grant Disaster funding to repair or replace  single family homes damaged during Hurricane Harvey to ensure that  multigenerational homes can house the family at documented pre-disaster  capacity.   I urge all Members to vote En Bloc Amendment #6 and yield back my  time.
