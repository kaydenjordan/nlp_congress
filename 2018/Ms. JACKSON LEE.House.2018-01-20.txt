 Mr. Speaker, maybe my good friend was not able to  keep his eyes awake last night to see that a bipartisan group of  Members in the other body voted resoundingly to defeat this  insignificant and this shallow CR that you sent to the other body.  Maybe you were not able to see that.   So what I will say to you is that I join with my whip in a 4-day CR,  because maybe you have just forgotten the fact that the most  catastrophic storm hit Texas, and then others went on to Puerto Rico  and the Virgin Islands and Florida.                                time  1800    No one has heard one word about those who are suffering with housing  that still looks like this, or those houses that are under water. Maybe  you don't know that the children who need children's health insurance  need the clinics that you gutted.   I would ask you, if you really have any kind of compassion, to read  Mr. Steele's comments, who indicated, as a former chair of the  Republican National Committee, that those who are at fault for shutting  down the government is a Republican President, Republican House, and  Republican Senate.   You can't do your job. Democrats are trying to do their job for the  American people. You shut the government down. Worry about those who  are suffering from hurricanes.   Where is your compassion?
