 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize SGT Brent  Patterson of Frostburg, MD, for his outstanding service to our Nation.  As a U.S. Army infantryman, Sergeant Patterson distinguished himself  for his personal valor during the global war on terror while deployed  in Iraq for 15 months as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom and in  Afghanistan for 12 months as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. During  his final deployment in Afghanistan's Charkh District, Sergeant  Patterson was wounded on three separate occasions and was subsequently  awarded three Purple Hearts.   On December 9, 2010, Sergeant Patterson and his squad were attacked  while operating a traffic control point in the Charkh Bazaar. With  significant injuries from a grenade to his upper body and while under  fire, Sergeant Patterson ignored his own safety in order to drag his  severely wounded squad leader to safety and direct his remaining squad  members into defensive positions. After first aid and medical transport  had been arranged for his squad leader, Sergeant Patterson and three  other members of his squad accompanied the transport on foot to their  command outpost to provide protection against additional attacks.  Having secured his squad leader and team at their command post,  Sergeant Patterson was treated for his injuries and returned to his  post the following day.  [[Page S6911]]    On July 24, 2011, Sergeant Patterson and three members of his squad  were conducting security at the Charkh Bazaar when an improvised  explosive device detonated, collapsing the building in which they were  positioned. As his platoon sergeant radioed for medical assistance,  Sergeant Patterson conducted a search for the remaining members of the  squad and administered first aid. He and two other members of his squad  were medevac'd to Forward Operating Base Shank to receive treatment for  traumatic brain injuries.   On August 5, 2011, on Sergeant Patterson's second day back after 2  weeks of treatment and observation for his injuries, he and his squad  were again conducting security in the bazaar when a grenade was tossed  into his position, landing on his shoulder and coming to rest near his  back. The grenade detonated, resulting in significant injuries to  Sergeant Patterson and three other members of his squad. Sergeant  Patterson ignored the heavy bleeding from his own back and administered  first aid to his platoon leader and provided assistance to medics  treating the other wounded soldiers.   Sergeant Patterson was admitted to Frostburg State University in  western Maryland in 2016. He is on course to graduate next May with a  bachelor's degree in materials engineering with a minor in math and  physics. He continues to have significant pain from shrapnel in his  back, arms, neck, and shoulder, but he refuses to take pain medication  so he can remain focused like a laser beam on his studies. For his  capstone course in engineering, Sergeant Patterson is the project  leader on converting organic material--nanocellulose--from trees and  turning it into a compound that is lighter and stronger than Kevlar for  use in flak jackets and vests for law enforcement officers and military  personnel. This project has been accepted for presentation at the 2018  Materials Science and Technology Conference in Columbus, OH.   This past Sunday was Veterans Day, and it was the 100th anniversary  of the armistice which ended World War I. We owe so much to our  servicemen and servicewomen, to our veterans, to those who gave ``the  last full measure of devotion,'' and to their families. Repaying that  debt begins with gratitude. I encourage my colleagues to join me in  expressing the Senate's sincere appreciation to Sergeant Brent  Patterson for his distinguished service to our Nation, our  congratulations on his academic achievement, and our best wishes for  his continued success.                            ____________________
