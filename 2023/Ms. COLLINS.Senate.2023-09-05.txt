 Mr. President, on September 10, the people of  Scarborough, ME, will gather to thank Nancy Crowell for her 45 years of  outstanding contributions as Director of the Scarborough Public  Library. It is a pleasure to join them in celebrating Ms. Crowell's  exceptional service.   She began the job in 1977 when the library was a small wooden  building on Black Point Road with a budget of $35,000. Today, she  leaves behind a modern library with a budget of more than $1 million  that reflects the value the townspeople have placed on her efforts.   Ms. Crowell bought the library's first electric typewriter and, as  she noted when announcing her retirement, ``I started at a time when  books were checked out with rubber stamps and the new technologies were  VHS and Betamax tapes and our new equipment was a used 16mm projector  to show films.''   In paying tribute to Ms. Crowell, Bill Donovan, president of the  library's board of trustees, said that, ``Under her leadership and  direction, the library has grown to become an integral part of the town  fabric, becoming a center for children, adults, and retirees to not  just browse and read, but also to gather and take advantage of the  library's many resources--much more than the humble beginnings Nancy  found when she joined 45 years ago.''   The Scarborough Public Library is a beacon in the community, where  everyone receives a warm welcome and the power of knowledge is  accessible to all. It is not just a repository for books, but also a  place that inspires imagination, provides entertainment, spurs  innovation, and fosters lifelong learning and community engagement.   The Roman philosopher Cicero said, ``To add a library to a house is  to give that house a soul.'' In the same vein, to build a community  library is to reveal that community's spirit. Nancy Crowell has done  just that with expertise and dedication, and I wish her all the best in  the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on September 16, Rotarians in Sanford and  Springvale, ME, will gather to celebrate their 100th year of membership  in a global network of neighbors, friends, and leaders working together  for positive change in their communities and around the world. It is a  pleasure to congratulate the Sanford/Springvale Rotary Club on a  century of service.   It is remarkable that what began as a small group of civic leaders in  Chicago in 1905 has grown to a service organization of 1.4 million  dedicated  [[Page S3891]]  members in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. In  any language, Rotarians live up to their motto of ``Service Above  Self.''   There are more than 46,000 Rotary Clubs worldwide. Chartered in 1923,  the Sanford-Springvale Club was part of the first great wave of  expansion that took the Rotary movement from major American cities to  smaller communities, to Canada and Europe, and then on to Asia and  Africa.   Rotary International is a powerful force for good around the world.  The global effort to eradicate polio is considered to be the most  successful public health campaign in human history, one that would not  have been possible without Rotary's commitment. When Rotary launched  its PolioPlus program back in 1985, it was described as a ``gift from  the 20th century to the 21st.'' It has been just that.   In addition to its strong and ongoing support for PolioPlus, the  Sanford-Springvale Club is part of a Rotary International effort to  make affordable and safe water more widely available in developing  countries. On one mission to a small village in India, club members  combined the two initiatives by helping with a childhood immunization  effort and carrying out a safe drinking water project.   The Sanford-Springvale Club is a powerful force for good at home.  From its ``January Thaw'' fundraiser to a summertime golf tournament,  the club generously supports a wide range of charitable endeavors,  including scholarships, literacy programs, food pantries, and nutrition  programs for schoolchildren. Members collect winter clothes for those  in need, participate in beach cleanups, and join together to complete  community projects, like building a healing garden at the Cancer Care  Center in Sanford.   When Paul Harris led the way in founding Rotary International 118  years ago, he said this: ``Whatever Rotary may mean to us, to the world  it will be known by the results it achieves.'' The results are  inspiring, and the world is grateful. The Rotary Club of Sanford and  Springvale, ME, is part of that effort, and I congratulate its members  for their accomplishments and contributions.                            ____________________
