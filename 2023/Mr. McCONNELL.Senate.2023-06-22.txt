 Mr. President, this month, the Supreme Court will  issue some of the term's most consequential decisions. And if past is  prologue, Washington Democrats will let the topline outcome of the  cases determine their view of the Court's institutional legitimacy.   A year ago this week, the Court corrected a half-century of badly  reasoned precedent under Roe v. Wade that cost our Nation millions of  innocent lives. The Democratic leader responded by accusing an  ``extremist MAGA court'' of bringing on ``one of the darkest days our  country has ever seen.'' But almost a year later, when the same exact  Court issued a ruling he agreed with, the Democratic leader celebrated  that ``democracy held firm.''   Democracy held firm--but only because the Court's opinion aligned  with our colleague's political preferences. Unfortunately, this has  been Washington Democrats' playbook for years. They have taught their  base that, when they can't accomplish their political ends from within  our institutions, it is the institutions that need to go.   Last year, intimidation at the Supreme Court took an especially vivid  turn. Activists threatened members of the Court and their families. One  individual even plotted to assassinate a Justice. Here in Congress,  Democrats have responded by trying to take hostage funding for the  Justices' security unless a coequal branch of government restructured  itself.   The nine Justices of the Supreme Court are empowered by the  Constitution to function above the political winds. And they should  continue to do exactly that, no matter how many Washington Democrats  demand otherwise.                            ____________________
