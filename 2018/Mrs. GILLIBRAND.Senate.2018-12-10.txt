 Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee be  discharged from further consideration of H.R. 299, the Blue Water Navy  Vietnam Veterans Act, and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration; that the bill be considered read a third time and  passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, the House of Representatives has  already passed this bill unanimously, 382 to 0. The bill is fully paid  for, and it is long past time that we do the right thing. We have to  right this wrong and help these veterans.   The only thing standing in the way of this bill to help the Vietnam  veterans is the U.S. Senate, and that is shameful. We have just days  before the Congress is finished. Our blue water veterans are waiting  for us, their families are waiting for us, and some of them are dying  waiting for us.   These patriotic Americans went to Vietnam. They risked their lives.  They were exposed to the chemical, Agent Orange, which we now know is  highly toxic. Some of them were exposed on the ground, some while  patrolling the rivers, and some were exposed while stationed on ships  off the Vietnamese coast. These are called our blue water Navy vets.   Now, all these years later, Agent Orange has made many of them sick  and they are severely ill. There have been four different health  studies by the CDC about the detrimental effects of Agent Orange  exposure, and the blue water Navy veterans have been shown to suffer  those exact diseases at the same rate as the other exposed veterans,  but some of my colleagues are wrongly insisting on a fifth study.   We do not have another year to wait. Some of our veterans will not  last that long. Many blue water veterans have already passed away from  the disease associated with Agent Orange exposure.   The 1991 bill to provide coverage for veterans exposed to Agent  Orange didn't discriminate between those who served offshore and those  who served on rivers or on the ground. Yet due to a decision by a VA  bureaucrat in 2002, the coverage for those who served offshore was  wiped out. It doesn't make any sense, and we must help all of our  veterans.   It would be tragic; it would be an absolute failure of this  institution if we did not respond to this call for help from our  veterans community. I urge my colleagues to reconsider their choice to  block this legislation. The bill has had multiple hearings. It has gone  through multiple drafts over the years. It has been subject to numerous  studies.   I have a letter right here to the CBO from the Military-Veterans  Advocacy association, literally going through each of the arguments  that Senator Enzi just made to explain why those aren't true.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                               Military-Veterans Advocacy, Inc.,                                                  November 30, 2018.      Re CBO Revision to the cost for H.R. 299.       Hon. Keith Hall,      Director, Congressional Budget Office,      Washington, DC.        Dear Director Hall: I have reviewed the CBO letter of       November 29, 2018 to Senator Enzi concerning the score for       H.R. 299. By way of introduction I am a retired Navy       Commander familiar with manning policies and surface ship       operations during and immediately following the Vietnam War.       I am currently the Executive Director of Military-Veterans       Advocacy (MVA). MVA has been advocating for this bill since       2011. In January of 2015 we met with CBO analysts to provide       relevant information.        I personally worked with the House Veterans Affairs       Committee to define the geographic points for the current       version of the bill. The geographic points are mirrored by       the red line on the enclosed chart. The dashed line       represents the boundary of the territorial sea which is 12       nautical miles seaward. In other words, the current language       in H.R. 299 exactly mirrors the boundaries of the territorial       sea. The bold line encompasses the entire theater of       operations which, as you can see, is much larger than the       area covered by H.R. 299. This same chart was provided to the       CBO in January of 2015 and was used as the basis for all       subsequent scoring. Accordingly, paragraph 2 of the CBO       letter is in error. There was no change in the nautical area.        Additionally, it must be remembered that most ships       operated close to shore usually within the 10 fathom curve.       This was to maximize the field of fire for operations ashore.       Logistics ships conducting underway replenishment would try       to approach the gun line to reduce the time the gun ships       were offline. Consequently any minor changes in the nautical       area would have little or no effect.        In preparation for the CBO meeting, MVA conducted a       manpower analysis of the ships that deployed. Records showed       that 713 ships deployed to the Vietnam theater of operations.       Congressional Research Service placed the number of personnel       in entire theater at 229,000. The same CRS publication pegged       the number of Navy personnel serving in Vietnam at 174,000.       American War and Military Operations Casualties: Lists and       Statistics (Feb. 2010) p. 11. Liaison with the  [[Page S7381]]       Naval Historical and Heritage Command by MVA and the offices       of then Congressman Chris Gibson confirmed that the 174,000       number represented just those in the territorial sea,       internal rivers and on land. A analysis by MVA showed 173,500       personnel deployed on ships within the territorial sea. This       information was provided to CBO during the January 2015       meeting.        Significant numbers of personnel deployed into the theater       are not included in H.R. 299. This includes ships, mostly       carriers, assigned to Yankee Station throughout the war.       Yankee Station was located at 17 deg. 30' N, 108 deg. 30' E       which is 30 nautical miles north of the Demilitarized Zone.       Multiple carrier battle groups were kept on station in this       area and seldom, if ever, transited south. A corresponding       station off South Vietnam, Dixie Station, was the site of one       carrier battle group designated for close air support       missions in South Vietnam. It was abandoned in the summer of       1966 as more warplanes became available for use in land based       airfields in South Vietnam. Dixie Station was located at       11 deg. N and 110 deg. E which is also outside the scope of       the bill. Admittedly, some ships from Dixie Station may have       entered the territorial sea but they should have been       included in 174,000 number.        Navy ships at the time were not manned to full complement.       The authorized strength reflected on the Enlisted       Distribution and Manning Report (EDVR) included Reserves who       in time of war would be mobilized to round out the crew.       Instead ships were manned in accordance with the Navy Manning       Plan (NMP) that was roughly 80% of the personnel allowance       for the ship. Additionally, due to the length of the war,       many senior people, both officer and enlisted, made multiple       deployments. On the average, about 25% of the personnel       deployed into the territorial sea made multiple deployments.       This number is based on the rating structure for ships at the       time and the pay grade distribution as well as personal and       anecdotal knowledge.        As of December 2014, MVA estimated that 80,305 personnel of       the 174,000 deployed were covered under existing law. This       number, along with the analysis, was presented to CBO. Since       that time, additional ships have been added to the ship's       list. Additionally, an accelerated death rate has claimed       many lives. It should also be remembered that on the average,       only one in three Vietnam era veterans seek any kind of VA       benefits.        VA claims that the bill will require them to hire       additional people to prevent the unacceptable backlog from       expanding. This is preposterous. A significant amount of       personnel in the backlog are Blue Water Navy veterans.       Establishing a presumption will actually help the VA to       reduce the backlog.        We believe that the VA estimates are overinflated and       designed to mislead CBO as to the impact of the cost of the       bill. Our current analysis supports the May 15, 2018 report       and we believe that CBO, in light of the information provided       herein, should revise their November 29, 2018 letter.        If you or your staff have any questions, please feel free       to contact me. Additionally I will be in Washington, DC, next       week and available for meetings.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                  John B. Wells,                                            Commander USN (Retired),                                                Executive Director.     I hope all of us can come together to do the right  thing by our veterans to make sure they get the coverage that they need  and to stand by them in their greatest time of need.   I yield the floor to my colleague.
