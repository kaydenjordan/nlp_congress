 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  opposition to this un-American and cruel bill.   Now, I immigrated to this country as a small child, and I love our  country for all it has provided me and my family. Immigrants love this  country. They dedicate their lives to working, and they make a  community stronger.   This bill does not uphold our values as a nation. A bill that was  true to those values would uplift and celebrate the contributions of  immigrants. Real patriots know that love of country is actually about  helping people.   Let's be crystal clear. We all want a safe and secure border, and the  best way to achieve that is through comprehensive immigration reform  and creating legal pathways for people who want to come here to work.   Sadly, this bill does not do that. Instead, it doubles down on a  failed anti-immigrant agenda. This bill guts the fundamental right to  seek asylum. It strips protections for unaccompanied children, and it  wastes more money on Donald Trump's pointless border wall, a monument  to hate which does nothing to protect us.   Now, in the Homeland Security Committee, I helped lead the fight  against harmful provisions of this bill that target nonprofits who  partner with our border agencies to care for our asylum seekers, but  House Republicans are moving ahead with these disastrous policies that  would require charities to check the immigration status of those who  need care even in a crisis.   By defunding nonprofits, this cold-hearted bill would ignore what the  Gospel teaches us. It ignores our brothers and sisters who are tired,  poor, hungry, and sick; those who are most in need of help.   If this bill ever becomes law, it would cause chaos and suffering.   We need real immigration reform, and America is ready for that  debate. Let's rise to the occasion and create an America that reflects  kindness and centers on helping people. Being anti-immigrant is being  anti-American.
