 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2266, the Bankruptcy  Judgeship Act of 2017, which would make 14 temporary bankruptcy  judgeships permanent and authorize four additional bankruptcy  judgeships.   I introduced this bipartisan legislation together with the support of  Judiciary Committee Chairman Goodlatte, along with Regulatory Reform,  [[Page H4247]]  Commercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee Chairman Marino and Ranking  Member Cicilline. H.R. 2266 warrants the support from my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle for several reasons.   To begin with, this measure reflects the recommendations of the  Judicial Conference of the United States with respect to the judicial  resource needs of our Nation's bankruptcy courts. These recommendations  are themselves based on a comprehensive survey of all judicial  circuits.   This analysis consists of two components. The first is premised on a  case-weight formula devised by the Federal Judicial Center that is  intended to provide a more accurate and useful measure of judicial  workload than a mere count of case filings.   The second component considers a broad array of other factors,  including the nature of a court's caseload, filing trends, demographic  considerations, geographic issues, and economic aspects, among other  items.   Taken together, the resulting analysis provides a reliable basis upon  which Congress may assess the necessity of authorizing additional  judgeships and extending temporary judgeships.   In addition, H.R. 2266 addresses an immediate need. All of the  temporary judgeships addressed in H.R. 2266 will lapse as of May 25,  which is just a week away.   Once a temporary judgeship lapses, any ensuing vacancy may not be  filled, which presents a serious concern. As the Judicial Conference  warns, these bankruptcy courts would ``face a serious and, in many  cases, debilitating workload crisis if their temporary judgeships were  to expire.''    This is particularly true with respect to the Eastern District of  Michigan, which has a weighted caseload well in excess of the minimum  necessary to trigger additional judicial resources.   Although Congress has previously extended temporary bankruptcy  judgeships from time to time, some have also lapsed as a result of  Congress' failure to timely act. So to avoid future lapses in judicial  resources, my legislation converts 14 of these temporary judgeships to  permanent status.   Finally, I am pleased to report that H.R. 2266 pays for all of these  judgeships without having to require consumer debtors to bear that  expense. The cost of this legislation is offset by increasing the  quarterly fees that the largest 10 percent of chapter 11 debtors pay to  the United States Trustee System Fund, a proposal initially made by the  Obama administration as part of the President's budget request for  2017.   Specifically, the fee increase would apply only to chapter 11 debtors  that have quarterly disbursements in excess of $1 million and only  during the period when the fund has less than $200 million.   For all of these various reasons, I support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms. Blunt Rochester).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I am pleased to note that H.R. 2266 is  supported by the American Bar Association, the Federal Bar Association,  the American College of Bankruptcy, and the National Conference of  Bankruptcy Judges.   I want to also express appreciation to our Judiciary chairman, Mr.  Goodlatte, to Chairman Marino and Ranking Member Cicilline, as well as  their staffs, for their cooperative efforts in working with me on this  bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, given the time-sensitive nature of the temporary  judgeships addressed by H.R. 2266 and the immediate need for additional  bankruptcy judgeships to be authorized, it is my hope that our  colleagues in the Senate will expeditiously consider this important  legislation. I urge all of the Members here to support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today also in strong support of S. 419, the  Public Safety Officers' Benefits Improvement Act, a bill which was just  passed by the Senate yesterday.   Each day, public safety officers put their lives on the line for the  greater good of those whom they have taken an oath to serve and  protect. Unfortunately, for some of these brave men and women, the  ultimate sacrifice is made, and they will die while in the line of  duty.   The Public Safety Officers' Benefits program, which is administered  by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Assistance, was  established in 1976 to provide certain benefits to the families of  these officers as well as to officers who are disabled as a result of  their service.   The death benefit is provided to eligible survivors of public safety  officers whose deaths are a direct and proximate result of a traumatic  injury sustained in the line of duty or death from certain heart  attacks, strokes, and vascular ruptures sustained while on duty.   An education benefit is provided to spouses and children of public  safety officers killed or disabled while on duty. The program provides  disability benefits to officers catastrophically injured in the line of  duty.   Mr. Speaker, I support S. 419 because it will significantly improve  in several respects how benefits claims of fallen and injured officers  are processed under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits program. To  begin with, the bill responds to the fact that, all too often, these  officers and their families, after experiencing a loss of life or  traumatic injury, must then endure months, sometimes years, of  uncertainty and delay concerning their benefit claims.   S. 419 requires the Bureau to give substantial weight to evidence and  facts presented by a Federal, State, or local agency when determining  eligibility for death or disability benefits. In addition, the measure  authorizes the Bureau of Justice Assistance to establish rules based on  standards for the Benefits program. These two requirements will help  facilitate and expedite the Benefits program claims processed and,  thereby, reduce the backlog of families awaiting a decision on their  benefit claims.   S. 419 also increases transparency of the Bureau's claims processing.  It requires, for example, the Bureau to publish and update a report  with information on the status of pending claims regarding death,  disability, and educational claims submitted, which will increase  transparency.   As we all know, transparency often leads to accountability, and this  bill will make the Bureau of Justice Assistance and the Department of  Justice more accountable to the families of fallen and  traumatically injured officers, Congress, and the public as well. By  requiring that updates or pending benefit claims be posted on public  websites, Congress and the public will be able to evaluate the  performance of the Bureau in timely processing pending claims.    Finally, S. 419 will help ensure that families, who are the ultimate  victims of those who sacrifice their lives for our protection, are not  deprived of benefits they are due under the Public Safety Officers'  Benefits program.   We all have a responsibility to take care of surviving family members  when a first responder is tragically killed or injured in the line of  duty. This bill is a step in the right direction of ensuring that  families are not overly burdened and that the public is aware of how  the Bureau and the Justice Department are handling claims submitted by  family members.   Mr. Speaker, the sacrifice of these first responders should not be  taken for granted, and their families should not be unduly burdened  when applying for benefits under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits  program. Accordingly, I support S. 419. I urge my colleagues to do the  same.   Mr. Speaker, it is particularly significant to note that S. 419 is  being considered in the midst of National Police Week, a period  dedicated to honor our Nation's fallen law enforcement heroes.   President John Kennedy, by proclamation signed in 1962, designated  May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day and the week in which that date  falls as National Police Week.   S. 419 memorializes our commitment to public safety officers, who  daily risk their lives for us, by removing barriers that prevent  beneficiaries under the Benefits program from obtaining the benefits  they so justly deserve. Families of our first responders deserve timely  consideration of benefit claims when their loved ones give the ultimate  sacrifice.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this measure so  that it may be sent to the President for signature.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1430
