 Madam Speaker, we are 1 week away from Secretary  Yellen's hard default date, the June 1 deadline.   House Republicans have been calling on our colleagues on the other  side of the aisle and the President to be negotiating on this debt  since January. It is now May 25. In the past 140 days, we have been  hearing a lot of name-calling and little bipartisan negotiation.   While this impasse has dragged on, House Republicans passed  legislation, the Limit, Save, Grow Act, that averts a default and  reduces wasteful spending. Let's negotiate from that point.   We have a plan to avert default and are eager to work with the  President to work out a suitable compromise, but we would rather hear a  lot of stuff and name-calling, and keep on printing and spending more  money. Indeed, it was pointed out that if our plan goes  [[Page H2610]]  through, it would mean a 20 percent cut in discretionary spending over  just 5 months, so that must mean we increase spending by 20 percent in  1 fiscal year of discretionary spending.   Madam Speaker, how many years can you keep increasing spending by 20  percent? Not 1, 2, 3, or 5, but a 20 percent increase. How do we afford  that going forward?   It is incredibly amazing we think that should be the route we should  go and keep adding to our debt.                            ____________________
