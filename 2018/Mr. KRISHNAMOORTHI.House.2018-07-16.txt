 Mr. Speaker, there has been an alarming surge of  hate group affiliation over the past year. Even more alarming is the  reality that people who belong to these groups have been able to obtain  security clearances. The intersection of hate groups and access to our  country's secrets is something that I did not expect to exist, and I am  determined to make sure that this does not continue.   Federal agencies should be required to report on how many clearance  holders and applicants are associated with hate groups, and what is the  status of their approval. The American people deserve to know if our  government has decided that those who espouse a hateful ideology have  access to our Nation's secrets.   I have introduced legislation to provide answers and to hopefully  prohibit those associated with hate groups and who possess hateful  ideology from having access to our most sensitive information.   I urge my colleagues to consider this legislation, and to, hopefully,  see it on the House floor.                            ____________________
