 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 199 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, servicemembers report being harassed by  predatory debt collectors at a higher rate than the civilian  population. Predatory and unscrupulous debt collectors send messages to  commanding officers with their private financial information, all in an  effort to harass our men and women in uniform--the best among us  standing up for us. They harass servicemembers by threatening rank  reduction--the debt collectors--revocation of security clearance, or  punishment under the military justice code.   These threats cannot be carried out by the debt collectors, and these  practices are manipulative, and they undermine our national security by  distracting our servicemembers from focusing on their mission and  caring for their families. In fact, a 2014 Army Reserve review found  that the second leading contributing factor to servicemember suicide  was financial stress.   This amendment reinforces the existing protections provided to all  Americans but especially those who are putting their lives on the line  to protect all of our families and our communities by restricting  predatory debt collection practices aimed specifically at our  servicemembers.   This bipartisan amendment costs nothing. It has broad support among  the Nation's military and veteran community. They believe, as I do,  that debt collectors should not be able to weaponize servicemembers'  services. It even has the support--listen--the support of reputable and  responsible debt collectors themselves, the very industry it would  affect.   I want to thank Senators Budd, Cornyn, Tillis, Lummis, and Brown for  their partnership on this, and I look forward to the support of my  colleagues in passing this bipartisan amendment to protect our Nation's  servicemembers.   I yield back the balance of my time.                          Vote on Amendment No. 199     I ask for the yeas and nays.
