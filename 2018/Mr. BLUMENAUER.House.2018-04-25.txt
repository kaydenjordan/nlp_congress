 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in  permitting me to speak on this and the elements that he just put into  the Record. These are tough issues.   The Bonneville Dam, one of the elements here, is in my district. I  have been involved with these issues, literally, for decades. I have  watched the give-and-take.   Part of what we are facing today is the legacy of our moving in to  create the Bonneville system without really knowing what we were doing  when we started. There was a rich fisheries existence. Rumor had it  that you could actually--people claimed you could walk across the backs  of the salmon when they were spawning.   The dams implemented, good for producing energy, not good for the  fishery system, both in terms of the river and the marine ecosystem  that depends on it.   And it is not just the commitment to the Endangered Species Act and  the environment. We are dealing here with commitments to Native  Americans who have been ill-served with their treaty rights. That is  one of the reasons why we have litigated this for years, because they  had valid treaty rights as a sovereign people, and the United States  violated them; and only recently, under the pressure of litigation,  were we responsive to their needs and some changes were made.   Now, it is not just the current Federal judge. We have had objections  through the Judiciary looking at some of the compromises that people  have made. I understand the political pressures. I watch it in terms of  the economy, in terms of transportation, in terms of Native Americans,  in terms of fish and wildlife, in terms of agricultural interests.   These are difficult and troublesome efforts, and there is no good  response because we have made more commitments than the mighty Columbia  River can deliver on. We treat it like a machine, and we have  difficulty reconciling it.   The judge in the case has found that the plan was wanting and has put  in place a system for the new BiOp. This legislation is not going to  stop litigation. If it passes, I will guarantee you, we will be back in  court, and I think there is a very strong likelihood that, rather than  moving it forward, it will delay it.   Look at the record in terms of the opponents to approaches like this  on how they have fared in court. It is not a good record.   Now, I would suggest strongly that we are better served by allowing  this process to go forward. Respect NEPA; respect the Endangered  Species Act; respect the process that is put in place; and look at all  the options.   Now, I am not saying tomorrow we are going to tear down Snake River  dams, but there are lots of options short of dam removal. When we start  taking things off the table, we limit our ability to meet our  responsibilities under the law and under our treaty obligations and,  candidly, in what is going to be in the best interest of solving a very  complex issue.   I would hope that we would reject this legislation not only because I  think it is ill-advised--I think it undercuts the environment, our  obligations to the Native Americans, that it will delay it rather than  accelerate it--but I think it provides a precedent that we don't want  to have. I don't think we want to have Congress intervening in the  midst of these processes.    Mr. Speaker, when I look at what this Congress-- particularly, under Republican rule--has done trying to intervene to  supersede science, to have political decisions on things that really  deserve balance with the environment, with treaty rights, dealing with  the long-term perspective, it is not a very encouraging record.   I strongly urge that we side with environmentalist groups, with our  two Governors, with a number of us in the delegation to allow this  process to work and not undercut it and put us back in court. If so, I  will guarantee that we will be back here next year and the year after  that with things worse rather than better.                                time  1530
