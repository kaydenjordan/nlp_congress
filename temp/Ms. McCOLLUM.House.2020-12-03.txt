 Mr. Speaker, I thank my classmate from Hawaii, who is  overseeing this legislation on the floor today. I thank the chairman of  the full committee as well as the subcommittee chair and the members of  the Natural Resources Committee for their unanimous support of H.R.  733, the House companion to S. 199, the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe  Reservation Restoration Act.   I want to thank Leech Lake's Tribal leaders personally for entrusting  me with the responsibility of advancing this bill as the sponsor in the  House and introducing the bill in the way they wanted it to be  introduced so that they could have negotiations to move this language  forward. I am proud of the ability that we all had in working together  to make today a reality and that we will be voting on this final  version of the bill.    As I said, it has passed through the Senate, and it passed through  the Senate unanimously. I look forward to seeing this legislation  signed into law.   Join me in voting today to restore the land that was illegally taken  from Tribal nations by the Federal Government during the allotment era.  Today we, collectively--the U.S. Congress--have an opportunity to  correct a past injustice by returning the land to the Leech Lake Band  of Ojibwe that the Federal Government sold without the consent of the  rightful owners, to have it returned to them.   Between 1948 and 1955, approximately 17,000 acres were illegally  transferred by the Department of the Interior. The bill we are  considering today would return more than 11,000 of those acres to the  Tribe. The return of this land from the Forest Service is vitally  important to the Leech Lake Band. They currently own less than 5  percent of the land--5 percent of the land--within the boundaries of  their reservation. This is the smallest percentage of any Minnesota  Tribal nations.   The Chippewa National Forest holds over 75 percent of the land within  their reservation. Tribal leaders at Leech Lake have worked diligently  for many years in partnership with the Chippewa National Forest in Cass  County to identify the illegally transferred parcels of land and to  build local support for this legislation. They have addressed concerns  with the transfer through open dialogue and have created a win-win  situation for everyone involved.    The chairman of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe has sent  a letter that describes the injustices that were done when the land was  illegally taken from Tribal members and the efforts that have gone into  this bill that we will vote on today to create that injustice.   Mr. Speaker, I include this letter in the Record.                                                          LEECH LAKE                                                  BAND OF OJIBWE,                                   Cass Lake, MN, November 17, 2020.      Hon. Betty McCollum,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman McCollum: I write on behalf of the Leech       Lake Band of Ojibwe to express our thanks to you for       sponsoring H.R. 733, the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe       Reservation Restoration Act. H.R. 733 will right a historical       injustice to the Leech Lake people by restoring 11,760 acres       to tribal trust status that the Interior Department illegally       transferred out of trust more than 70 years ago.        Previously, former Congressman Rick Nolan introduced a       similar bill in the 115th Congress. While the identical       companion bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent in       December of 2018, it failed to advance in the House of       Representatives before the end of the session.        In January of 2019, the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe asked you       to reintroduce the Leech Lake Reservation Restoration Act to       the 116th Congress. As the former Co-Chair of the       Congressional Native American Caucus, your sponsorship of the       bill helped elevate the national importance of this       legislation and highlighted the historic injustice of the       federal takings of Leech Lake Reservation trust lands.        The Leech Lake Indian Reservation was established through a       series of treaties with the United States and presidential       executive orders from 1855 to 1874. The initial Leech Lake       Reservation consisted or 588,684 acres of the Band's       homelands and included the most valuable red and white pine       in the region. These treaties and executive orders promised       that the reserved lands would be the Band's permanent       homeland.        The United States violated these promises through a series       of federal laws and policies from 1889 to 1911, moving nearly       530,000 acres of our homelands out of trust status. These       federal actions unilaterally sold off large swaths of our       Reservation, and separately established what is now the       Chippewa National Forest, all without consent of the Band.        In the 1940s and 1950s, the federal government, through       unauthorized administrative actions, took approximately       17,000 acres of additional Leech Lake Reservation lands again       without consent of the Band or individual tribal landowners.       In these agency-to-agency transfers, known as ``secretarial       transfers'', the Interior Department illegally transferred       Leech Lake trust lands to the USDA-Forest Service. The       Interior Department put a stop to the illegal transfers in       1955 when Department attorneys acknowledged that the actions       violated federal law. Lawsuits were filed to restore these       lands to trust status in federal courts, but the claims were       time barred. As a result, the only means of achieving justice       for the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe is through federal       legislation. H.R. 733/S. 199 would restore the portion of       these illegal secretarial transfer lands located within Cass       County back to the Interior Department to be held in trust       for the Band.        The Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe has worked for many years to       identify the illegally transferred land parcels, build local       support and address any concerns with the bill. When it was       clear the only recourse to recover these lands was federal       legislation, the Band met on several occasions with       leadership of the Chippewa National Forest to discuss the       issue and draft the bill. The bill includes language       consistent with the U.S. Forest Service's mission to adhere       to national and local policies regarding the management of       Federal lands. It directs the Secretary to work with the       Chippewa National Forest Supervisor and the Band to identify       Federal lands in Cass County near concentrations of the Leech       Lake population and tribal government facilities to ensure       that transferred lands address the immediate needs of the       Band and reduce fragmentation of federal land holdings.        In addition, the Band has held several meetings with rural       electric co-ops and other utilities that utilize federal       lands to ensure the bill would protect rights of way on any       transferred lands. Through meeting and open dialogue, we were       able to address the concerns of the ROW permitees and ensure       that access is maintained not only for citizens of our       community relying on these essential utility services, but       also for the companies crossing federal lands.        Thanks to the work in addressing concerns with the Leech       Lake Reservation Restoration Act, the United States Senate       once again passed the identical companion bill to H.R. 733,       S. 199, by unanimous consent in June of 2019. Likewise, the       House Natural Resources Committee approved the bill by       unanimous voice vote on September 30, 2020.        Advancing this bill to final passage in the U.S. House of       Representatives will restore a sense of justice that       generations of our Leech Lake people have been working to       achieve and provide the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe the       necessary land base to combat the housing and homelessness,       longstanding problems that have been highlighted as urgent       needs by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.        The Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe values your friendship and       dedication to protecting and preserving tribal sovereignty.       We look forward to continuing our work together on this bill       and the many other policy issues facing Indian Country and       our Nation in these trying times.            Sincerely,                                                Faron Jackson, Sr.,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, restoring this land to the Leech Lake  reservation will support Tribal communities while also preserving the  area for public recreation. It will allow the Tribe to consistently  apply their forest management plan across a greater portion of the  reservation. It will also respect all the rights of ways of the utility  permits.   It will be good for Leech Lake Band, good for the forest, and good  for local communities. And it will be good to correct a historical  injustice.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for S. 199.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as was just explained by my colleague across the aisle,  S. 199 would place approximately 11,000 acres of Federal land managed  by the U.S. Forest Service into trust for the Leech Lake Band.  [[Page H6099]]    The Tribe and the lands that would be held into trust under this bill  are located in the Eighth Congressional District, which is represented  by Republican Congressman Pete Stauber. I want to thank Mr. Stauber for  his hard work on this legislation because, without it, we would not be  here today.   After the House companion bill, H.R. 733, was introduced by  Congresswoman McCollum, it was determined that a number of the parcels  affected by the bills had encumbrances, mainly those of public utility  co-ops.   This was, again, another bill that was not properly vetted prior to  introduction by a Member from this district. I truly believe that,  since that time, Congressman Stauber has been a leader in efforts to  bring the Tribe and several utility co-ops together to come to a legal  agreement to resolve those issues with these easements.   We have some concerns regarding the enforceability of this document  but appreciate the willingness of all parties to seek a consensus. I  think that is the important part today, that there is finally a  consensus on this issue. That is a policy the Natural Resources  Committee majority has little interest in pursuing because,  unfortunately, S. 199 does not reflect this improvement in the bill  text. Let's hope the parties will continue to act in good faith despite  this.   I, again, thank Mr. Stauber for his efforts and the members of the  committee who worked across the aisle to make this happen today. I am  pleased he joined our committee during this year. He has been one of  the more active members of the committee during his short tenure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
