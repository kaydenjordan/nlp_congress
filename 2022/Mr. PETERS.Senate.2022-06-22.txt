 Mr. President, for far too long, Americans have grappled  with the epidemic of gun violence that has taken lives and shattered  families and communities in my home State of Michigan as well as all  across the country.   These shootings and attacks not only cause unimaginable pain and  grief for victims and their families but terrorize entire communities,  who must cope with the lasting effects of unspeakable tragedy in their  schools, in their theaters, houses of worship, and other public places.   There is no one easy solution to address this matter, but Americans  deserve to feel safe where they live, where they work and learn and  shop and pray; and these senseless acts of violence occur far too  often.   From the Sandy Hook Elementary massacre of young students and school  staff, to the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church and the Tree  of Life synagogue shootings that killed Americans simply practicing  their faith, to the deadly and hateful and heinous attacks at Pulse  nightclub and a grocery store in Buffalo, gun violence has left no  corner of our country untouched.   In Michigan, sadly, we know all too well the terror and the  devastation caused by gun violence. Late last year, in Oxford, MI, a  horrific shooting unfolded at Oxford High School. In a matter of just  mere minutes, a routine school day at Oxford High turned into a scene  of chaos and heartbreak when a gunman--a 15-year-old classmate--opened  fire inside the school, taking four young lives and wounding seven  other people. That attack forever changed the lives of the students,  the teachers, staff, and shattered the assumption that schools are a  safe haven.   Oxford High School students and the entire community have been  resilient, but as they continued to process the shooting and to work to  heal from it, those emotional wounds again reopened for many when they  watched yet another horrific scene play out at Robb Elementary School  in Uvalde, TX, where 19 young students and 2 teachers were murdered.   Schools are supposed to be a safe haven. Parents and family members  should not live in fear that their children or their loved ones who are  at work won't return home at the end of that school day. And while  there is no single solution to end the gun violence epidemic, for far  too long, partisan gridlock has prevented Congress from advancing  commonsense legislation that can save lives.   For decades, politics have stood in the way of progress, and that is  despite 90 percent of the American people--including a majority of  Republican voters--supporting commonsense steps like expanding  background checks. In today's partisan environment, it is tough to get  consensus, but that just shows how much support there is to getting  something done.   This should not be a partisan issue. We know that many responsible  gun owners across our country support gun safety legislation. I am a  gun owner. I enjoy hunting, as do so many in Michigan, and I know that  we can pass measures to improve public safety while protecting the  rights of law-abiding citizens.   After nearly three decades without major progress, we are on the  verge--on the verge--of a significant breakthrough as we consider the  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. This legislation will take important  steps to address gun violence, improve school safety, and increase  mental health resources.   There is no question that this legislation could have included  additional measures that are overwhelmingly supported by a majority of  the American people, but this is still a significant step forward. We  cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This bill will help  protect our children, our schools, and our communities.  [[Page S3098]]    And by passing this bill, we can make progress right now. Right now,  with this legislation, we can strengthen background checks for gun  buyers under the age of 21 and keep guns out of the hands of dangerous  people who simply should not have them. This includes providing  critical support for red flag laws at the State level to ensure deadly  weapons are kept out of the hands of individuals who a court has  determined to be a significant danger to themselves or to others.   And right now, we can offer protections to victims of domestic  violence by adding convicted abusers in dating relationships to the  National Instant Criminal Background Check System. And right now, we  can crack down on criminals who illegally evade licensing requirements.   Right now, we can increase funding for school safety to institute  safety measures in and around schools and support school violence  prevention efforts. Right now, we can improve access to essential  mental health care resources, which school safety advocates and  violence prevention professionals agree is the key--the key--to  providing an early opportunity for intervention--by investing in  school-based health services to support those impacted by traumatic  events.   I am grateful to my colleague Senator Stabenow, who has led the  charge to ensure that legislation include proven, effective initiatives  that will strengthen mental health services, and I urge my colleagues  to work together to pass this legislation and encourage the House of  Representatives to quickly--to quickly--do the same and send it to the  President to be signed into law.   But know this: The bottom line is that our work to save lives and  protect public safety must not end here. We must continue to come  together and address this very real threat that is hurting communities  all across our country. When we face difficult challenges and crises  here in our country, we persevere because we ultimately come together  as one. Let's channel this spirit and come together for every American  before the next school, the next family, and the next community is  shattered.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________
