 Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the Federal School Meals  Parity Act with my colleague Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett of the U.S.  Virgin Islands as the original cosponsor.   Our bill would ensure that Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands are  reimbursed fairly under the U.S. Department of Agriculture's in-school  meal and child nutrition programs.   These USDA programs provide nutritionally balanced meals to needy K- 12 students each school day, including a breakfast, a lunch, and an  after-school snack.   For many needy school children, these USDA programs often provide  their only well-balanced or full meal of the day.   These important Federal nutrition programs serve millions--millions-- of American schoolchildren nationally, including some 18,000 Guam  students and more than 10,000 students from the Virgin Islands.   However, current USDA regulations reimburse Guam and the U.S. Virgin  Islands at the rate for the continental United States. At the same  time, our peer outlying jurisdictions--Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto  Rico--receive a much higher reimbursement rate.   According to USDA, the higher reimbursement rates for these States  and territory reflect higher costs of delivering these programs in  those outlying jurisdictions.   Well, we agree wholeheartedly that all outlying jurisdictions should  be reimbursed at higher rates than the mainland United States because  of these higher costs.   All five territories and both States outside the continental United  States share the challenges of higher costs of living, fewer locally  available resources, and greater percentages of schoolchildren from  underserved households.   Indeed, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands both have higher costs of  living, lower median household incomes, and greater unemployment than  the mainland United States. Both territories face much higher costs for  imported food, transportation, fuel, refrigeration, and other everyday  necessities than the mainland. Certainly, Guam is the furthest of the  territories.   To address these inadequacies, our bill would require that the USDA  reimburse Guam at the same rate as its peer jurisdictions, Alaska and  Hawaii; and the USDA reimburse the U.S. Virgin Islands at the same rate  as neighboring Puerto Rico.   Under the Federal School Meals Parity Act, public, Department of  Defense, and private schools on Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands would  receive additional Federal funding to provide more in-school nutritious  meals to our needy students.   Lastly, our bill directs USDA to complete a report comparing the  costs of providing in-school meals to students in all five U.S.  territories with the mainland 48 States and the outlying States of  Alaska and Hawaii.   I continue working in partnership with Congresswoman Plaskett to  ensure that parity for Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands under USDA's  in-school meal and child nutrition programs.   So as Congress works to finalize the 2018 farm bill, I hope that our  colleagues will provide equitable reimbursement for Guam and the U.S.  Virgin Islands.   For me and Congresswoman Plaskett, this is an issue of fundamental  fairness for the territories and our students. It must be a priority  for our House and Senate colleagues as well.                            ____________________
