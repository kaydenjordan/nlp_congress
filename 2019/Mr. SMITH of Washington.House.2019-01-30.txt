(e) The Chairman, in consultation with the Ranking Minority       Member, shall establish criteria for recommending legislation       and other matters to be considered by the House of       Representatives, pursuant to clause 1 of rule XV of the Rules       of the House of Representatives. Such criteria shall not       conflict with the Rules of the House of Representatives and       other applicable rules.             RULE 7. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF HEARINGS AND MEETINGS         (a) Pursuant to clause 2(g)(3) of rule XI of the Rules of       the House of Representatives, the Chairman, or the chairman       of any subcommittee, panel, or task force, shall make a       public announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of       any hearing or meeting before that body at least one week       before the commencement of a hearing and at least three       calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, or legal       holidays except when the House is in session on such a day)       before the commencement of a meeting. However, if the       Chairman, with the concurrence of the Ranking Minority       Member, or the chairman of any subcommittee, panel, or task       force, with the concurrence of the respective ranking       minority member, determines that there is good cause to begin       the hearing or meeting sooner, or if the Committee,       subcommittee, panel, or task force so determines by majority       vote, a quorum being present for the transaction of business,       such chairman shall make the announcement at the earliest       possible date. Any announcement made under this rule shall be       promptly published in the Daily Digest, and promptly made       publicly available in electronic form.        (b) At least 24 hours prior to the commencement of a       meeting for the markup of legislation, or at the time of an       announcement under paragraph (a) made within 24 hours before       such meeting, the Chairman, or the chairman of any       subcommittee, panel, or task force shall cause the text of       such measure or matter to be made publicly available in       electronic form as provided in clause 2(g)(4) of rule XI of       the Rules of the House of Representatives.           RULE 8. BROADCASTING OF COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND MEETINGS         (a) Pursuant to clause 2(e)(5) of rule XI of the Rules of       the House of Representatives, the Committee shall, to the       maximum extent practicable, provide audio and video coverage       of each hearing or meeting for the transaction of business in       a manner that allows the public to easily listen to and view       the proceedings. The Committee shall maintain the recordings       of such coverage in a manner that is easily accessible to the       public.        (b) Clause 4 of rule XI of the Rules of the House of       Representatives shall apply to the Committee.               RULE 9. MEETINGS AND HEARINGS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC         (a) Each hearing and meeting for the transaction of       business, including the markup of legislation, conducted by       the Committee, or any subcommittee, panel, or task force, to       the extent that the respective body is authorized to conduct       markups, shall be open to the public except when the       Committee, subcommittee, panel, or task force in open session       and with a majority being present, determines by record vote       that all or part of the remainder of that hearing or meeting       on that day shall be in executive session because disclosure       of testimony, evidence, or other matters to be considered       would endanger the national security, would compromise       sensitive law enforcement information, or would violate any       law or rule of the House of Representatives. Notwithstanding       the requirements of the preceding sentence, a majority of       those present, there being in attendance no fewer than two       members of the  [[Page H1327]]       Committee, subcommittee, panel, or task force may vote to       close a hearing or meeting for the sole purpose of discussing       whether testimony or evidence to be received would endanger       the national security, would compromise sensitive law       enforcement information, or would violate any law or rule of       the House of Representatives. If the decision is to proceed       in executive session, the vote must be by record vote and in       open session, a majority of the Committee, subcommittee,       panel, or task force being present.        (b) Whenever it is asserted by a member of the Committee,       subcommittee, panel, or task force that the evidence or       testimony at a hearing may tend to defame, degrade, or       incriminate any person, or it is asserted by a witness that       the evidence or testimony that the witness would give at a       hearing may tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate the       witness, notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a)       and the provisions of clause 2(g)(2)(A) of rule XI of the       Rules of the House of Representatives and in accordance with       the provisions of clause 2(g)(2)(B) of rule XI of the Rules       of the House of Representatives, such evidence or testimony       shall be presented in executive session, if by a majority       vote of those present, there being in attendance no fewer       than two members of the Committee, subcommittee, panel, or       task force, the Committee, subcommittee, panel, or task force       determines that such evidence may tend to defame, degrade, or       incriminate any person. A majority of those present, there       being in attendance no fewer than two members of the       Committee, subcommittee, panel, or task force may also vote       to close the hearing or meeting for the sole purpose of       discussing whether evidence or testimony to be received would       tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person. The       Committee, subcommittee, panel, or task force shall proceed       to receive such testimony in open session only if the       Committee, subcommittee, panel, or task force, a majority       being present, determines that such evidence or testimony       will not tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person.        (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, and with the approval of       the Chairman, each member of the Committee may designate by       letter to the Chairman, one member of that member's personal       staff, and an alternate, which may include fellows, with Top       Secret security clearance to attend hearings of the       Committee, or that member's subcommittee(s), panel(s), or       task force(s) (excluding briefings or meetings held under the       provisions of committee rule 9(a)), which have been closed       under the provisions of rule 9(a) above for national security       purposes for the taking of testimony. The attendance of such       a staff member or fellow at such hearings is subject to the       approval of the Committee, subcommittee, panel, or task force       as dictated by national security requirements at that time.       The attainment of any required security clearances is the       responsibility of individual members of the Committee.        (d) Pursuant to clause 2(g)(2) of rule XI of the Rules of       the House of Representatives, no Member, Delegate, or       Resident Commissioner may be excluded from nonparticipatory       attendance at any hearing of the Committee or a subcommittee,       unless the House of Representatives shall by majority vote       authorize the Committee or subcommittee, for purposes of a       particular series of hearings on a particular article of       legislation or on a particular subject of investigation, to       close its hearings to Members, Delegates, and the Resident       Commissioner by the same procedures designated in this rule       for closing hearings to the public.        (e) The Committee or the subcommittee may vote, by the same       procedure, to meet in executive session for up to five       additional consecutive days of hearings.                               RULE 10. QUORUM         (a) For purposes of taking testimony and receiving       evidence, two members shall constitute a quorum.        (b) One-third of the members of the Committee or       subcommittee shall constitute a quorum for taking any action,       with the following exceptions, in which case a majority of       the Committee or subcommittee shall constitute a quorum:        (1) Reporting a measure or recommendation;        (2) Closing Committee or subcommittee meetings and hearings       to the public;        (3) Authorizing the issuance of subpoenas;        (4) Authorizing the use of executive session material; and        (5) Voting to proceed in open session after voting to close       to discuss whether evidence or testimony to be received would       tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person.        (c) No measure or recommendation shall be reported to the       House of Representatives unless a majority of the Committee       is actually present.                        RULE 11. THE FIVE-MINUTE RULE         (a) Subject to rule 15, the time any one member may address       the Committee, subcommittee, panel, or task force on any       measure or matter under consideration shall not exceed five       minutes and then only when the member has been recognized by       the Chairman or subcommittee chairman, as appropriate, except       that this time limit may be exceeded by unanimous consent.       Any member, upon request, shall be recognized for not more       than five minutes to address the Committee or subcommittee on       behalf of an amendment which the member has offered to any       pending bill or resolution. The five-minute limitation shall       not apply to the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member or       the chairman and the ranking minority member of a       subcommittee, panel, or task force.        (b)(1) Members who are present at a hearing of the       Committee, subcommittee, panel, or task force when a hearing       is originally convened shall be recognized by the Chairman or       subcommittee, panel, or task force chairman, as appropriate,       in order of seniority. Those members arriving subsequently       shall be recognized in order of their arrival.       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Chairman and the Ranking       Minority Member or the chairman and the ranking minority       member of a subcommittee, panel, or task force, as       appropriate, will take precedence upon their arrival. In       recognizing members to question witnesses in this fashion,       the Chairman shall take into consideration the ratio of the       majority to minority members present and shall establish the       order of recognition for questioning in such a manner as not       to disadvantage the members of either party.        (2) Pursuant to rule 4 and subject to rule 15, a member of       the Committee who is not a member of a subcommittee, panel,       or task force may be recognized by a subcommittee, panel, or       task force chairman in order of their arrival and after all       present subcommittee, panel, or task force members have been       recognized.        (3) The Chairman of the Committee or the chairman of a       subcommittee, panel, or task force, with the concurrence of       the respective ranking minority member, may depart with the       regular order for questioning which is specified in       paragraphs (a) and (b) of this rule provided that such a       decision is announced prior to the hearing or prior to the       opening statements of the witnesses and that any such       departure applies equally to the majority and the minority.        (c) No person other than a Member, Delegate, or Resident       Commissioner of Congress and committee staff may be seated in       or behind the dais area during Committee, subcommittee,       panel, or task force hearings and meetings.                RULE 12. POWER TO SIT AND ACT; SUBPOENA POWER         (a) For the purpose of carrying out any of its functions       and duties under rules X and XI of the Rules of the House of       Representatives, the Committee and any subcommittee is       authorized (subject to subparagraph (b)(1) of this       paragraph):        (1) to sit and act at such times and places within the       United States, whether the House is in session, has recessed,       or has adjourned, and to hold hearings, and        (2) to require by subpoena, or otherwise, the attendance       and testimony of such witnesses and the production of such       books, records, correspondence, memorandums, papers and       documents, including, but not limited to, those in electronic       form, as it considers necessary.        (b)(1) A subpoena may be authorized and issued by the       Committee, or any subcommittee with the concurrence of the       Chairman and after consultation with the Ranking Minority       Member, under subparagraph (a)(2) in the conduct of any       investigation, or series of investigations or activities,       only when authorized by a majority of the members voting, a       majority of the Committee or subcommittee being present.       Authorized subpoenas shall be signed only by the Chairman, or       by any member designated by the Committee.        (2) Pursuant to clause 2(m) of rule XI of the Rules of the       House of Representatives, compliance with any subpoena issued       by the Committee or any subcommittee under subparagraph       (a)(2) may be enforced only as authorized or directed by the       House of Representatives.                         RULE 13. WITNESS STATEMENTS         (a) Any prepared statement to be presented by a witness to       the Committee or a subcommittee, panel, or task force shall       be submitted to the Committee, subcommittee, panel, or task       force at least 48 hours in advance of presentation and shall       be distributed to all members of the Committee, subcommittee,       panel, or task force as soon as practicable but not less than       24 hours in advance of presentation. A copy of any such       prepared statement shall also be submitted to the Committee       in electronic form. If a prepared statement contains national       security information bearing a classification of Confidential       or higher, the statement shall be made available in the       Committee rooms to all members of the Committee,       subcommittee, panel, or task force as soon as practicable but       not less than 24 hours in advance of presentation; however,       no such statement shall be removed from the Committee       offices. The requirement of this rule may be waived by a       majority vote of the Committee, subcommittee, panel, or task       force, a quorum being present.
