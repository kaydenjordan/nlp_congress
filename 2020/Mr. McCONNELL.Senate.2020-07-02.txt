 Mr. President, before I discuss the legislation before  the Senate, I need to spend a moment on something broader. Our country  needs to confront the Democratic Party's willingness to threaten our  governing institutions themselves.   Earlier this year, as the Senate disposed of the least fair, least  thorough, and most rushed impeachment in modern history, I offered a  broader warning. I said: ``Leaders in the opposite party increasingly  argue that if our institutions don't produce the outcomes they like,  our institutions themselves must be broken.''   No longer do disappointments for Democrats mean that Democrats need  better arguments. Now disappointments for Democrats are claimed as  proof--proof--that our country is fundamentally broken or that James  Madison messed something up.   So while we have far-left mobs attacking statues of our Founding  Fathers from coast to coast, we have far-left politicians attacking the  institutions those Founders left us.   Now, step back and look at the landscape of fundamental changes that  leading Democrats or their close allies are demanding: amending the  First Amendment to restrict its protections, ending the electoral  college, packing the Supreme Court with new Justices, packing the  Senate with new States, and, to accomplish all this, destroying the  Senate's distinguishing feature that makes radical change hard by  design.   We have an entire political movement that is telling us--literally  out loud--that they have lost patience with playing by the rules and  may well declare war on the rule book itself. A coalition of leftwing  special interests are explicitly campaigning for ``51 for 51.'' They  want Senators to vandalize the rules to pass legislation with a simple  majority and then use that ill-gotten power to cement a presumed  advantage by awarding the District of Columbia two Senate seats.   They want to nuke the Senate to pack the Senate. This is naked  politics. No neutral principle could explain why all these special  interests prioritize this cause which most Americans oppose. No neutral  principle explains why Democrats want the 20th most populous city to  get two Senators all to itself when retrocession to Maryland would  satisfy their own slogans more cleanly.   No neutral principle explains why House Democrats wasted floor time  on a potentially unconstitutional show vote.  [[Page S4170]]    Just days after Democrats used the filibuster power to block Senator  Scott's police reform bill, even colleagues who recently defended this  important tradition have now bowed to the pressure to flirt with ending  it.   On a similar note, you may remember that a kind of naked intimidation  without modern precedent in modern memory took place a few months ago.  The Democratic leader stood by the steps of the Supreme Court and  directly threatened Justices if they ruled the wrong way in the June  Medical Services case.   This display aligned with a whole new tradition of Senate Democrats  threatening judges. A year ago, several wrote Justices saying the  ``Court is not well [and] perhaps the Court can heal itself before the  public demands it be `restructured.' ''   In other words, nice judicial independence you have got there. It  would be a shame if something happened to it.   Right on cue, a number of leftwing groups are agitating to revive the  discredited notion of court-packing.   Now, following the Democratic leader's display, the Court ruled the  way he wanted on that very case. They handed it down on Monday of this  week. Our colleague took to the floor cracking jokes, giddy--giddy--he  had gotten his way, but just moments later the Democratic leader picked  right up where he left off, impugning and pressuring one Justice whose  vote he disliked   So you see, the improper pressure and the accusations of illegitimacy  will never end. No amount of rulings the Democrats like would be enough  because the fundamental respect for an independent judiciary is simply  not there.   This is about outcomes, not institutions, and there is no limit to  how far left the goalposts will move.   Well, the subject is not going away, but for today I will leave it  there. This weekend, July 4, Americans will celebrate our founding. We  will celebrate the Framers and the traditions and the institutions that  they left us.   We cannot let radicals tear down their likenesses or their legacies.  We must preserve the gifts and the institutions we celebrate so our  grandchildren and their grandchildren can celebrate them as well.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, the  Senate continues to consider the National Defense Authorization Act. I  understand we are close to a bipartisan structure for amendments, and  if our Democratic colleagues will let us, I hope we can move forward  today.   All week I have discussed how the 60th consecutive NDAA will help our  Nation protect its people, stand with our allies, and keep pace with  our competitors. This legislation has global reach, but, as all my  colleagues know, the NDAA is also a profoundly local bill for  communities in all 50 States.   My home State is proud to support three Army installations and the  men and women of the Kentucky Air and Army National Guard. Last fall, I  hosted Defense Secretary Mark Esper in Kentucky to speak with the Fort  Knox community. He called for a renewed commitment to supporting our  all-volunteer force, including military spouses and their families.   The NDAA advances that goal. It will authorize a new elementary  school at Fort Knox. This construction, paired with progress toward a  new middle school at Fort Campbell, will continue making Kentucky's  installations a welcoming home for military families.   This project comes on the heels of Fort Knox's selection for the new  V Corps headquarters. This mission brings more than 600 additional  soldiers to Kentucky in support of U.S. operations over in Europe. They  will join Fort Knox's already impressive list of significant commands,  including the Army's Recruiting, Cadet, and Human Resources Command.  The V Corps will find a premier installation made even better by this  NDAA.   Our bill also authorizes the construction of a new headquarters for  the Kentucky National Guard. The facility will consolidate the Guard's  operation to a central location.   Just recently, our citizen soldiers and airmen have stepped up to  combat COVID-19. I am glad this legislation will deliver for them.   At the Blue Grass Army Depot, the NDAA will advance the disposal of  legacy chemical weapons. Families in Madison County have lived for  generations with these deadly agents practically in their backyards.  For years, I have fought alongside them to support safe and responsible  demilitarization.   In just the first year of chemical destruction activities, the depot  has already completed a campaign ahead of schedule. An entire type of  munition has been completely deleted from the U.S. stockpile. Our  legislation will help us safely consign more of these weapons to the  ash heap of history.   Now, I have also spoken this week about the growing boldness of our  Nation's adversaries and the evolving threats our servicemembers face.  The men and women of Fort Campbell, including the 101st Airborne, are  among those our Nation turns to first to handle serious challenges.  Their recent deployments to Europe, Afghanistan, and to support the  COVID-19 response in New York and New Jersey show their importance to  our country.   Pursuant to the national defense strategy, this NDAA will encourage  new capabilities so elite fighting forces like the 101st are equipped  for success under any circumstances.   The Senate is grateful for the courageous service of our Armed  Forces. The bipartisan legislation before us honors their sacrifices  and authorizes the resources to carry out their missions. Its impact  will not be felt just by our adversaries overseas but by our  servicemembers and communities right here at home.   I would like to once again thank Chairman Inhofe, Ranking Member  Reed, and our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for their  serious and thoughtful work.   Let's get this bill moving toward completion.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, could I ask my colleagues to yield  momentarily?   I would request that Senator Inhofe be able to lock in an agreement  on the NDAA, and then the discussion could resume.
