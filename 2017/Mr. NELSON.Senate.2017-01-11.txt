 Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, if you really want to  rile up the senior citizens of this country, then you start taking away  their prescription drugs. If that is what you want to do, then you  better vote against my amendment. If you take away the ACA, they are  going to end up paying $1,000 per year, out of pocket per senior  citizen, on their prescription drug benefits. So if you want to support  the seniors, you better support this amendment.    I vote no.
