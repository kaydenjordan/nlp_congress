 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the dangerous  crisis our Nation is experiencing on our southern border.   Two weeks ago, on a tour of my district, I had the honor of meeting  law enforcement officers in Clay, Madison, and McDowell Counties. These  counties are in very different parts of North Carolina's sprawling 11th  Congressional District, yet these officers all shared with me that the  number one problem they face every day--number one--is the flow of  fentanyl into our mountains.   Keep in mind that western North Carolina is a thousand miles away  from the southern border. Yet, because of the Biden administration's  lax border policies, every State is now a border State, and we are all  suffering from the consequences.   Since day one, this administration has ceded control of our southern  border to drug cartels and dangerous gangs.   In addition to fentanyl, we have seen a flow of unlawful migrants and  illicit contraband pour into our country at rates never seen before,  and China is a key source of the ingredients used to make fentanyl that  is killing our children and fueling this crisis that is affecting so  many. There needs to be a change.                            ____________________
