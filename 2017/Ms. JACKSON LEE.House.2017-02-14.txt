 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule  and the underlying bill.   I strongly oppose this rule because it makes in order H.J. Res. 42, a  bill disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor  relating to drug testing of unemployment compensation applicants, an  effort to impose drug testing as a condition of receiving unemployment  insurance and other forms of public assistance.   I oppose this rule because it would repeal a Department of Labor rule  intended to implement a bipartisan agreement on implementing a  provision, in the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012,  that allows states to drug test unemployment insurance (UI) applicants  in certain circumstances.   In 2012, Congress approved a bipartisan compromise on drug testing  unemployment insurance claimants.   The agreement permitted states to drug test UI claimants in cases  where:   1) an applicant has been discharged from their last job because of  unlawful drug use; or   2) an applicant who ``is an individual for whom suitable work (as  defined under the State law) is only available in an occupation that  regularly conducts drug testing (as determined under regulations issued  by the Secretary of Labor).''   Congress therefore mandated the Department of Labor to define through  regulation those occupations that regularly conduct drug testing.   The final Department of Labor (DOL) rule, which would be repealed by  H.J. Res. 42, defined ``occupation'' as a position or class of  positions that are required, or may be required in the future, by state  or federal law to be drug tested.   Some members of Congress have criticized the regulations as being too  narrowly drawn, but in fact, they track the bipartisan legislation very  closely.   It seems that what is really at issue is a desire to conduct broader  drug testing of UI applicants.  [[Page H1150]]    Any proposal that seeks to expand the ability of states to drug test  people for unemployment insurance should be vigorously opposed.   States already have the ability to administer drug testing and this  change would needlessly shift employer costs to the states.   State UI programs already penalize job-related drug use.   Virtually all states treat a drug-related discharge as disqualifying  misconduct even if it is not explicitly referenced in their discharge  statutes.   Twenty states also explicitly deny benefits for any job loss  connected to drug use or a failed drug test.   In addition, six states (Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, South Carolina,  Tennessee, and Wisconsin) have passed legislation equating a failed or  refused pre-employment drug screen with refusing suitable work.   Employers already have testing as a tool to screen out people who use  illicit drugs, at no cost to states.   Proponents of drug testing argue that states want to be able to drug  test UI applicants.   However, only three states (Texas, Mississippi and Wisconsin) have  enacted laws permitting state drug testing of UI claimants, consistent  with the federal regulation, with all three of these states delaying  implementation until after the final DOL rule targeted by H.J. Res. 42  was issued.   Suspicionless drug testing of government benefit recipients likely  violates the Fourth Amendment.   Generally, government-mandated drug testing not based on  individualized suspicion is unconstitutional.   Drug tests historically have been considered searches for the  purposes of the Fourth Amendment.   For searches to be reasonable, they generally must be based on  individualized suspicion unless the government can show a special need  warranting a deviation from the norm.   However, social insurance or governmental benefit programs like UI,  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program (SNAP) and Housing Assistance do not naturally evoke  the special needs that the Supreme Court has recognized in the past.   Indeed, when states like Michigan and Florida have tried to impose  mandatory suspicionless drug testing on all TANF applicants or  recipients, they have been stopped by federal courts that have found  such testing to be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.   These court battles also imposed substantial legal costs for states.   State-administered drug testing is a poor investment of public funds.   Claims that testing will save taxpayer money are built upon the  assumption that the tests will return a high number of positive  results.   However, studies show that individuals who receive public benefits  use drugs at rates similar to the general population, and the vast  majority of such individuals do not use drugs.   Most individuals, in fact, refrain from using drugs on a regular  basis.   Ten states have spent substantial amounts of money in recent years to  set up and administer drug testing systems for TANF recipients, but  have identified only a few claimants testing positive.   Drug testing is also costly and prone to returning false-positives.   Drug tests that do come back as positive easily identify marijuana  use but often miss other drugs that ordinarily clear out of the body  within a few days.   Tests do not indicate if a person is impaired, or whether they are  using less than they have in the past.   Working people paid for this insurance policy, and jobless workers  earned the right to access UI through their service to their employer.   Proposals to drug test UI beneficiaries needlessly stigmatize and  punish jobless workers and their families who are trying to get back on  their feet.   If legislators have genuine concerns about drug use, there are far  better ways to respond than targeting and stigmatizing the unemployed.   I urge you to oppose H. Res. 99, the Rule governing debate for H.J.  Res. 42 and any legislation that seeks to expand the ability of states  to condition the receipt of unemployment insurance and other forms of  public assistance on a drug test.   For these reasons and more, I oppose this rule and the underlying  bill. I would also like to include the following list of organizations  actively opposed to H.J. Res. 42:         9to5, National Association of Working Women; AFL-CIO; AME       Church--Social Action Commission; American Civil Liberties       Union; American Federation of State, County and Municipal       Employees (AFSCME); Bend the Arc Jewish Action; Bill of       Rights Defense Committee/Defending Dissent Foundation; Center       for Community Change Action; The Center for HIV Law and       Policy; Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP); Drug Policy       Alliance Economic Policy Institute Policy Center; Food       Research & Action Center; Harm Reduction Coalition; Housing       Works; Institute for Science and Human Values; Interfaith       Worker Justice; LatinoJustice; The Leadership Conference on       Civil and Human Rights; Legal Action Center; Legal Aid at       Work.

The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:             An Amendment to H. Res. 99 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       804) to amend the National Security Act of 1947 to protect       the National Security Council from political interference,       and for other purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided among and controlled by the respective chairs and       ranking minority members of the Committees on Armed Services,       Foreign Affairs, and the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 804.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he  [[Page H1151]]       then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule,       or yield for the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, this is a commemoration of African  American History Month. It is a vital month. It is a month that tells  America's history.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute a distinguished American, Dr.  Thomas Freeman, who has been a faculty member at Texas Southern  University now for more than half a century. Dr. Freeman is the leading  orator of the university, the leading storyteller.   He is the instructor of the Honorable Barbara Jordan, my predecessor.  He taught her the skills to be able to sit before the Judiciary  Committee during the impeachment of Richard Milhous Nixon and say,  ``We, the people.''   He is the individual that has taught and tutored decades of  students--tens upon tens--from a school that is a historically Black  school and called and taught his students to be successful in debates  around the world.   He is a history maker. He is now close to 100 years old. He is  deserving of honor and tradition.   I close, Mr. Speaker, by saying, in our community, he is the tiller  and the holder of the values of the Constitution. I know that he  deserves honor on this floor.   Dr. Freeman, I salute you. You deserve the honor and recognition as a  great American.                            ____________________
