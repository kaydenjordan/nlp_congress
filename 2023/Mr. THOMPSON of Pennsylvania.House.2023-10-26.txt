 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  acknowledge the remarkable history of the Nittany Valley Volunteer Fire  Company located in Clinton County. Their story is one of courage,  dedication, and community spirit.   Their story begins in 1948 as a group led by Jim Wolfe made history  by bidding $300.01 to purchase a retired 1916 Ahrens Fox Pumper from  the Citizens Hose Company in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania. Over the years,  they acquired essential equipment, including a tank truck with a  mounted pump and a 1952 International truck.   Their commitment to the community has never wavered, and they are  always ready to respond to emergencies. The volunteer firefighter  department has evolved over time. Today, residents only have one number  to call, but in the beginning, calls were directed to the Mabus home,  which was directly next to the fire station.   The Nittany Valley Volunteer Fire Company stands as a testament to  the unwavering dedication of its members, past and present, to  safeguarding their community. Their history is one of resilience and  community support.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Nittany Valley Volunteer Fire Company, upon  their 75th anniversary, for their enduring commitment to the safety and  well-being of our community.                            ____________________
