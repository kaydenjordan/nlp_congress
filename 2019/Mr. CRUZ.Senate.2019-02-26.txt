 Under the previous order, the Senate stands in recess until  2:15 p.m.   Thereupon, the Senate, at 12:45 p.m., recessed until 2:15 p.m. and  reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Mrs.  Capito).                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this Saturday, March 2, the great State of  [[Page S1461]]  Texas celebrates the 183rd anniversary of its independence from Mexico.   Texas became a free republic--for 9 years our own nation--and soon  after became one of these United States.   As is tradition, in commemoration of the brave Texans who fought and  died for liberty and the rule of law, let us reflect a moment on the  immortal words of Colonel William Travis, the leader of the besieged  forces at the Alamo. His clarion call for reinforcements resounded  around Texas and still rings with strength today.   Indeed, it has a special place in my heart because the very first  time I spoke on this Senate floor, I read from Travis's letter from the  Alamo. It was during Senator Rand Paul's extended filibuster in defense  of individual liberty. It fit then, and it fits now. It is a letter  that has stood for the ages--written to us today, demanding that we  stand with all good and free people against oppression and reminding us  that there are some things worth dying for.   The letter reads as follows:         Commandancy of the Alamo,        Bexar, February 24th, 1836        To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World:        Fellow citizens & compatriots--I am besieged, by a thousand       or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna--I have sustained a       continual Bombardment & cannonade for 24 hours & have not       lost a man.        The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion,       otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the       fort is taken--I have answered the demand with a cannon shot,       & our flag still waves proudly from the walls. I shall never       surrender or retreat.        Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism &       everything dear to the American character, to come to our       aid, with all dispatch--The enemy is receiving reinforcements       daily & will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in       four or five days.        If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain       myself as long as possible & die like a soldier who never       forgets what is due to his own honor & that of his country--      Victory or Death.        William Barret Travis        Lieutenant Colonel Commandant        P.S. The Lord is on our side--When the enemy appeared in       sight we had not three bushels of corn--We have since found       in deserted houses 80 or 90 bushels & got into the walls 20       or 30 head of Beeves.        Travis    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
