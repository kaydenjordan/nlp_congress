 ROONEY of Florida. Madam Speaker, as one of his final  acts in office, President Obama issued a rule requiring that States  give title X family planning fund grants to abortion providers like  Planned Parenthood.   States have always had the autonomy to distribute these grants to  providers that they choose. Obama took that freedom away from States by  requiring them to directly fund abortions under the false assertion  that this provides women with greater access to health care. That is  just not true.   What people seem to forget is that for every 1 Planned Parenthood  facility in the United States, there are 20 federally funded community  health centers that stand ready and eager to provide health services to  women and don't perform abortions.   States should be able to make their own healthcare decisions. By  passing this resolution, we return that power to the States.
