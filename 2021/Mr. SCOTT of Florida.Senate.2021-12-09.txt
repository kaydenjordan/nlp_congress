 Madam President, we are less than 3 weeks away  from Christmas, and Joe Biden has run this country into the ground.   I know President Biden thinks that Santa can solve his problems, but  our supply chain is such a mess not even Santa Claus, with all of his  Christmas magic, can fix it.   There are nearly 100 ships waiting to dock in California ports. About  40 of them are a few miles off the coast, but more than 50 are holding  back farther in the Pacific. It looks to me like the Biden  administration didn't like the visual.   I recently received a letter from a grandmother in New Smyrna Beach,  FL. She is retired now but was a small business owner who has spent her  life working hard to support her kids and grandkids.   I have the letter with me. In her letter she writes:         I am worried about inflation. I see prices of fuel,       groceries, and staples going through the roof. I see the       American standard of life declining. It is getting harder and       harder for families to make ends meet, buy a home, afford       medical care and higher education for their children.    She also tells me that Joe Biden's unconstitutional vaccine mandate  is putting her husband at risk of losing his job, despite the fact that  he worked throughout the pandemic as an essential worker.   She is not alone. She shares the exact same concerns as millions of  Americans and businesses right now that are reeling from the impacts of  Biden's socialism.   The Pantry of Broward County, FL, usually supplies meals to 500  families each month, but they weren't able to donate as many  Thanksgiving turkeys this year because of skyrocketing prices.   And there are other terrible stories in the news across my State  every day.   I heard about a single father of three in Clearwater, FL, who lost  his job due to COVID, and at his new job he is having to stretch each  dollar as far as it can possibly go as prices for meat, food, rent,  everything goes up and up and up.   I heard about a woman who delivers groceries in South Miami. She is  seeing prices going up and having to send pictures of empty shelves to  her online customers to show grocery stores are out of so many  products. She can hardly ever find any juice boxes for her own  children.   These are the stories of real Floridians, and I could keep going  because Florida families and families all across our great country are  struggling as Biden's inflation and supply chain crisis rages on.   Now, most people, when they are in charge, they want to do something  positive when a problem arises. When the families are struggling,  leaders should want to solve a problem.   What is shocking is that even as ships wait in docks, in ports--wait  to dock in ports and families are forced to count their pennies and  sometimes even go without certain products, the Biden administration is  doing absolutely nothing.   Secretary Raimondo and Secretary Buttigieg would rather play TV  commentator than actually travel to California and solve some of these  problems facing our distributors. Instead of coming to the Senate  Commerce Committee to testify about what actions they are actually  taking, they would rather stay silent. If they don't want to show up  and do the job they signed up for, I have heard there is an opening at  CNN.   Energy prices are up, and families who are simply trying to stay warm  during the winter season are going to face higher bills, just as gas  prices and food prices continue to climb.   The American people are fed up with President Biden's utter lack of  leadership. Time and time again, I have come to the floor to try to get  some information about this crisis, but Senate Democrats have stood in  the way.   When I came down to demand notes from internal meetings the Biden  administration held about the signs of inflation they were seeing,  Democrats blocked--blocked--it. When I walked down here to request a  report about the factors causing the energy prices to rise, Senate  Democrats blocked it. When I came down here to pass bicameral,  commonsense legislation that would alleviate the supply chain crisis  facing our ports, Senate Democrats blocked it.   This isn't how Washington should be working. I came here to make  Washington work for Florida families, but Democrats in this body are  joining hands with the White House to institute policies that make life  more difficult and more expensive.   This isn't government for the people; this is Big Government that  hurts the people.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object.   I am sure my colleague is aware that, last month, I sent a letter to  the Commerce Committee--a committee on which we both serve--informing  the chair that I would be holding all Department of Transportation and  Department of Commerce nominees until the Senate-confirmed leadership  from these Agencies testify about the supply chain crisis.   Right now, there are nearly 100 ships waiting to dock in California  ports to unload their goods, but they are unable to do so because of  President Biden's supply chain crisis. Christmas is just a couple weeks  away, and families and businesses are facing empty shelves, shortages  on goods, and higher prices. And, so far, Secretary Raimondo and  Secretary Buttigieg have been too busy playing TV commentator to  actually go to California and solve the problem.   It is long past time for the Biden administration to tell us what  they are actually doing to solve this crisis and help American  families.   I appreciate my colleague's partnership with me on the issues under  the purview of the Commerce Committee. In fact, I am looking forward to  next week, when the bill we are putting together will be considered  during a Commerce markup hearing.   Given that we will be in session next week, I would urge my  colleagues to join me in urging leadership from the Commerce and  Transportation Departments that come before the committee and testify  on what those Agencies are doing to combat and mitigate the supply  chain crisis that is hurting so many families and businesses in Florida  and across the country.   This isn't an unreasonable request. The Senate has oversight  authority, and we can't allow Agency leadership to just ignore their  responsibility to report to us on these issues impacting our  constituents.   But if that is too much to ask, I am inviting Secretary Raimondo and  Secretary Buttigieg to even just have an open, public meeting with me  and my colleagues. But until we hear from Senate-confirmed officials  responsible for this crisis in the Commerce committee, I will be  objecting to all Commerce and Transportation nominees going through an  expedited process here in the Senate.   This isn't personal. It is about accountability for Florida families.  Therefore, Mr. President, I object.
