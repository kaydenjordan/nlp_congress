 Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the  nomination of Gina Haspel to be CIA Director.   Ms. Haspel played a central role in the CIA's rendition, detention,  and interrogation program. This was one of the darkest chapters in our  Nation's history, and it must not be repeated.   Since her nomination, I and my staff have reviewed thousands of  classified documents detailing her role in the program.   The takeaway is this: Ms. Haspel was a strong supporter of the  torture program.   While many CIA operatives expressed hesitation or outright opposition  to the program, such as John Brennan, Ms. Haspel was not one of them.   As I said last week, this nomination is bigger than one person. This  nomination is about reckoning with our history. It is about grappling  with our country's mistakes and making clear to the world that we  accept responsibility for our mistakes and they will never be repeated.   I was struck by Ms. Haspel's repeated insistence at her hearing that  the torture program was ``legal.''   The torture program was illegal at the time based on international  treaties the United States is signatory to, including the Convention  Against Torture and Geneva Convention.   While the Office of Legal Counsel signed off on waterboarding and  other ``enhanced interrogation techniques,'' its flimsy legal analyses  were withdrawn in 2003 and 2004 and should never have taken precedence  over international law.   The bottom line is this: No one has ever been held accountable for  the torture program, and I do not believe those who were intimately  involved in it deserve to lead the agency.   What message does it send to the world if we reward people for  presiding over what is considered to be one of the darkest chapters in  our history?   Of course, supporters of the torture program are constantly trying to  rewrite history, so I think it is important to revisit that history  here today.   After a 5\1/2\ year review of the CIA's detention and interrogation  program, the Senate Intelligence Committee released a 500-page  declassified executive  [[Page S2720]]  summary in December 2014. The summary was backed up by a 6,700-page  classified report with nearly 38,000 footnotes citing to CIA and other  official records. Every finding and conclusion is thoroughly supported  by documentation. The report examined the detention of at least 119  individuals and the use of coercive interrogation techniques--in some  cases amounting to torture.   It is also important to note this was a bipartisan report with each  key vote during the process of the report having both Democrats and  Republicans voting yes. In December 2012, the Intelligence Committee  approved the Report by a 9-6 vote, with one Republican voting yes. In  April 2014, the committee approved the executive summary and findings  and conclusions for declassification and public release by an 11-3  vote, with three Republicans voting yes. The full report remains  classified.   In December 2014, copies of the full, 6,700-page classified report  were sent to parts of the executive branch, including the CIA, to be  used broadly by those personnel with appropriate clearances to ensure  that the abuses documented in the Report would never be repeated. This  report was intended as an important tool to help educate our  intelligence agencies about a dark chapter of our Nation's history.   However, last May, when Ms. Haspel was already the Deputy Director,  the CIA returned its only copy of the report at the request of Chairman  Burr. The CIA Inspector General, the Director of National Intelligence,  and others followed suit and also returned their copies. In fact, only  three copies of the report exist outside of the Senate Intelligence  Committee; all of the others are gone.   Today, two copies of the full report remain under order by Federal  judges, and a third exists because of President Obama's decision in  December 2016 to preserve the full report with the National Archives  under the Presidential Records Act.   During Ms. Haspel's hearing, she stated multiple times that the CIA's  rendition, detention, and interrogation program was ``legal and  authorized by the highest legal authority in our country and also the  President.''   I find Ms. Haspel's statement to be both misleading and incorrect.  While the Office of Legal Counsel wrote several secret legal opinions  used to justify the program, I don't believe those actions were ever  legal, I am not aware of a single court ruling that affirmed those OLC  opinions, and those OLC opinions were in conflict with the multiple  international treaties to which the U.S. is a signatory to.   In fact, the Department of Justice conducted an investigation of the  facts and circumstances surrounding the drafting of these torture memos  and the Department's role in the implementation of interrogation  practices by the CIA.   On June 29, 2009, the DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility,  the unit charged with investigating allegations of misconduct, issued  its report. That report concluded former Deputy Assistant Attorney  General John Yoo and former Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee  committed professional misconduct in the drafting of those seriously  deficient legal opinions.   Additionally, Jack Goldsmith, the Assistant Attorney General who led  the Office of Legal Counsel in 2003 and 2004, found that their  memoranda were ``riddled with error.'' He also concluded that key  portions were ``plainly wrong'' and characterized them as a ``one-sided  effort to eliminate any hurdles posed by the torture law.''   Moreover, the CIA program certainly didn't meet the bar set by any of  the four major international legal conventions prohibiting torture.   First, the Geneva Convention, ratified by the U.S. in 1949, common  article 3 provides further protections against torture in times of  conflict. It states that those persons no longer taking active part in  hostilities, including those who are detained, are prohibited from  being subjected to: ``violence of life and person, in particular murder  of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture'' as well as  ``outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and  degrading treatment.''   Second, the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights,  ratified by the U.S. in 1948, states in article 5 that: ``no one shall  be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or  punishment.''   Third, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,  ratified by the U.S. in 1992, repeats verbatim, the outlawing of  torture found in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.   Additionally article 5 of the International Covenant includes  language meant to prevent states from utilizing legal work-arounds to  overcome the spirit of the condemnation of torture.   Fourth, the United Nations Convention Against Torture, ratified by  the United States in 1994, defines torture in article 1 as: ``any act  by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is  intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from  him or a third person information or a confession. . . .''   I also find it appropriate to note for the record that the committee  sought to use pseudonyms created specifically for this report so that  the readers could connect the actions of the same CIA officer  throughout the report, but without their actual name or other  personally identifying information.   To address the CIA's concerns, the committee agreed to reduce the  number of CIA personnel listed in pseudonym from a few hundred  ultimately down to 14 people who were most intimately involved in the  CIA's detention and interrogation program.   The CIA and the White House refused to allow these 14 individuals to  be listed in pseudonym. The lack of pseudonyms and, in many cases, even  a title of a CIA officer, means that connections between a person's  actions and statements cannot be made and that the seniority and  positions of authority of individuals in the report are hidden.   In light of Ms. Haspel's nomination to be Director, we have asked  repeatedly for pertinent records to be declassified, only to be  stonewalled at every turn.   Instead, the CIA, with Ms. Haspel as the Acting Director, has engaged  in a selective declassification campaign to bolster Ms. Haspel's  nomination, while keeping all potentially damaging material under  wraps.   Given the CIA's intransigence on Haspel's records, I am very limited  in what I am able to say about her specifically.   However, I am able to revisit what happened at the CIA ``black  sites,'' which is detailed extensively in the report's summary.   For example, one detainee, Abd al-Nashiri, was interrogated using  CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, including being waterboarded  at least three times. These tactics were not just morally  reprehensible; they were ineffective.   The committee found, based on a review of CIA interrogation records,  that the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques on  detainees like al-Nashiri was ineffective in obtaining accurate  information or gaining detainee cooperation.   Contrary to CIA claims, these so-called enhanced interrogation  techniques did not produce intelligence that thwarted terrorist plots  or resulted in the capture of terrorists. That intelligence was already  available from other sources or from the detainees themselves before  they were tortured. In fact, torture often led to false information.   The report also lays out, in excruciating detail, that the program  was grossly mismanaged, and the CIA provided Congress and the public  with inaccurate information.   Again, while I can't speak in depth about Ms. Haspel, our report  makes clear that surprisingly few people were responsible for  designing, carrying out, and managing the torture program.   This was not something that involved the entire Agency. It was  limited to the Agency's top leadership and staff, including Directors,  Deputy Directors for Operations, and senior level management at the  Counterterrorism Center, among others.   As we know from the extremely limited information Ms. Haspel has  publicly provided, she did hold positions including senior level  management at the Counterterrorism Center.   She has declined to answer publically when asked whether she had  responsibility, supervision, or approval relevant to the CIA rendition,  detention, and interrogation program.  [[Page S2721]]    Additionally, because Ms. Haspel as the Acting Director for CIA and  the Director of National Intelligence have refused to declassify any  additional information, I am unable to publically discuss her exact  role in late 2002.   Furthermore, I am also unable to publically discuss the things I know  she approved as a senior level supervisor at the Counterterrorism  Center from 2003 to 2004 or discuss what she worked on as the chief of  staff to the Deputy Director for Operations from 2005 to 2008.   Instead, I can only reference reports by former deputy counsel of the  CIA, John Rizzo, that Ms. Haspel was one of ``the staunchest advocates  inside the [CIA] for destroying the tapes'' of CIA interrogations  conducted under the torture program.   I find the CIA's responses to requests for information about Ms.  Haspel to be wholly inadequate. Ms. Haspel is not an undercover  operative; she is the acting CIA Director seeking a Cabinet-level  position.   It is unacceptable for her or the CIA to hide her behind a wall of  secrecy.   I believe Senators and the American public have the right to know  whether or not the nominee before us was a senior manager for a program  that has been shown to be deeply flawed, as well as a number of other  disturbing facts.   Without the full scope of Ms. Haspel's involvement available for  public review, I do not see how this body can adequately carry out its  constitutionally mandated duty to advise and consent on the president's  nominee.   Proponents of Ms. Haspel's nomination have argued that she was just  doing her job and following orders.   If confirmed, what would Ms. Haspel do? Would she carry out and  enforce the President's directives if they would violate our  Constitution and international treaties?   I am also concerned her leadership could create problems for the CIA  to perform one of its core functions: cooperating with foreign  governments--and European allies in particular.   Specifically, her confirmation could complicate U.S.-German  relations. While the German Government has not made a public position  on Ms. Haspel's nomination, Germany is strongly opposed to torture and  multiple U.S. intelligence actions outlined in the Senate Intelligence  torture report have already caused rifts in U.S.-German relations.   Additionally, when Ms. Haspel was promoted to CIA Deputy Director in  2017, the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights,  headquartered in Berlin, petitioned German prosecutors to order an  arrest warrant for Haspel due to her participation in the CIA torture  program.   While I understand the German Government is unlikely to issue an  arrest warrant, Germans still remember that U.S. intelligence officials  mistakenly abducted and tortured Khalid al-Masri, a German citizen in  2003.   Mr. Masri, a German citizen, was seized on December 31, 2003, as he  entered Macedonia because he was wrongfully believe to be an Al Qaeda  terrorist traveling on false German passport.   He was then turned over to the CIA, which rendered, detained, and  interrogated him. After 5 months, he was dropped on a roadside in  Albania.   This was a grave mistake that even Ms. Haspel acknowledged in a  prehearing question whether the CIA ever rendered or detained suspects  who were innocent by stating: ``I understand that the CIA's Office of  the Inspector General conducted a review of the rendition of Khalid al- Masri and determined that CIA did not meet the standard for rendition  under the September 17th, 2001 Memorandum of Notification (MON).''   Even though the CIA acknowledges this mistake, it is incomprehensible  that no one has been held accountable for this and other violations.   If Ms. Haspel is confirmed, it would send the wrong message to the  country and to the world. It would send the wrong message that America  has abdicated its moral authority. It would send the wrong message that  we condone behavior that belies the conscience and the values of this  nation.   When the Obama administration chose not to prosecute those involved  in the CIA's torture program, they claimed we were moving forward, not  backward.   To elevate a person with reportedly intimate involvement in a torture  program to lead our Central Intelligence Agency would signal to our  allies and our enemies that we are looking backward.   This nomination is, in effect, a referendum on whether America  condones the use of torture.   If confirmed, this nominee's decisions will affect the lives and  safety of all Americans.   Our job is to assess whether the nominee has the strength of  character to stand up to her superiors when reckoning with violations  of our rule of law and moral values.   Unfortunately, based on Ms. Haspel's record at the CIA, the lack of  public transparency regarding her tenure, and the implications for  America's reputation at home and abroad, I cannot support this  nomination.                            ____________________
