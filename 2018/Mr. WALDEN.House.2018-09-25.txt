 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, obviously, in support of the  Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act.   I want to thank my friend and colleague from New Jersey (Mr.  Pallone), our ranking Democrat on the committee, for working with me on  this effort, but especially I want to thank Representative Brooks from  Indiana for her tireless effort and the partnership of my friend,  Representative Anna Eshoo of California. She and Mrs.  [[Page H8780]]  Brooks really did the heavy lift here for the committee on this effort.  They were able to shepherd this critical reauthorization to the floor  today with unanimous support both in the subcommittee and in the full  committee.   So, for those out there who are watching our proceedings, know that  actually we do work together and we do get some really important public  policy done.   These programs, commonly known as PAHPA, enable critical partnerships  between the Federal Government, State and local authorities, and the  private sector to ensure our Nation is responsibly prepared for and  able to respond to public health emergencies. It is time that we get it  right; it is critical that we get it right; and we are.   It is not really a matter of if, but when, the next pandemic strikes.  The projections simply are horrifying. A full-blown pandemic flu  outbreak could literally kill millions of people within months--within  months. We must have the tools, backed by stable and predictable  funding, to respond to these threats and especially to the threat of  pandemic flu.   With this vote, the House will take an important step toward keeping  our families safe in the worst-case scenarios of dangerous disease  outbreak or in the case of chemical or biological attack. We are moving  this reauthorization on time and in a bipartisan fashion.   Like my colleague from Indiana, I remember when anthrax was sent to  our offices and to the postal facility, and loss of life and illness  and concern, and we all wondered what is next. That was part of what  prompted us to get to this point and pass this legislation, not only  today but back then.   This is really important work, Mr. Speaker, and I commend my  colleagues and the staff, who really do the incredible work to help us  get it right. This is legislation now that will head over to the  Senate, where I hope they will give it the same due consideration that  we are about to here today, and then get this down to President Trump's  desk, where he will sign it into law.   Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank my colleagues and staff on both  sides of the aisle.    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle for their great work on the Nuclear Utilization of Keynote Energy  Act, H.R. 1320. I especially thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Olson), who is one of our real leaders on energy issues writ large on  the Energy and Commerce Committee.   By any measure, atomic energy has brought tremendous benefits to the  Nation. It has provided a baseload, emissions-free source of  electricity that has powered homes and industry over the past half  century. It has provided an infrastructure for our national and  international security--from the technologies and fuels for our nuclear  Navy, to the safety and security for civilian nuclear power the world  over.   However, a confluence of factors--abundant natural gas, power market  designs, economic and regulatory burdens--they have all inhibited the  Nation's nuclear industry over the past 10 years.   So the challenge confronting Congress is how to preserve and enhance  the beneficial use of atomic energy for future generations. To continue  to harvest the economic and national security benefits associated with  our domestic nuclear energy infrastructure, we must take steps to  update the relevant policies. So these policies must be forward looking  to enable innovation and the development and deployment of new,  advanced nuclear technologies.   This bipartisan bill by Mr. Kinzinger and Mr. Doyle updates the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission's fee structure for the first time in  nearly 20 years, Madam Speaker. It reflects thoughtful work on both  sides of the aisle to achieve really good public policy.   H.R. 1320 establishes reasonable and predictable timeframes for  regulatory decisions so that companies like Oregon-based NuScale Power  can develop business plans to commercialize new nuclear technologies  while also protecting future consumers from high regulator costs.  [[Page H8792]]    I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their great  work on yet another piece of legislation out of the Energy and Commerce  Committee, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1320.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6511, the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve Reform Act. This bill is another product of  the Energy and Commerce Committee's ongoing and bipartisan work to  modernize the Department of Energy.   The Committee's DOE modernization efforts are focused on ensuring the  Department can more ably address current and future domestic and  international energy and security challenges. These challenges range  from maintaining nuclear safety and security to protecting the reliable  supply and delivery of energy, and they require a DOE that has the  appropriate organization, management focus, and authorities to succeed.   H.R. 6511 was developed by Vice Chairman Barton and Ranking Member  Rush to modernize the forty-year-old Strategic Petroleum Reserve, so  it's prepared to protect our Nation from energy disruptions in the  decades ahead.   H.R. 6511 authorizes DOE to lease underutilized storage capacity,  which will become available in increasing amounts as DOE conducts  mandated drawdowns over the next several years. Rather than have DOE  maintain empty caverns at considerable taxpayer expense, H.R. 6511 will  allow DOE to develop the spare capacity, attracting much needed capital  investments for additional improvements. H.R. 6511 will preserve the  SPR's existing capacity, generate revenue for upgrades and maintenance,  and improve the operational readiness of the entire SPR complex. H.R.  6511 is truly a win-win, and a perfect example of our bipartisan DOE  modernization effort.   I especially want to thank Mr. Barton for his work on this bill. He  has been at the forefront of so many defining moments relating to  energy security. From his leadership as Chairman of the Energy and  Commerce Committee during passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, to  his tireless efforts to repeal the ban on crude oil exports, his work  on this bill contributes to the great legacy he leaves behind at the  Energy and Commerce Committee--and in the United States Congress. I  urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 6511.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the two bills that  will bring some much-needed transparency into the drug supply chain  process, and they will help patients afford the medicines that they  really need.   The Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, sponsored by Senator Susan  Collins, and the Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018, sponsored by  Senator Debbie Stabenow, will, together, ban gag classes from Medicare  and private insurance.   These clauses restrict a pharmacist's ability to inform a patient  that their drug would be cheaper if they paid out of pocket than if  they paid through their insurance. And while there is already a  regulation banning this practice in Medicare part D, this legislation  will end the practice across Medicare Advantage prescription drug  plans, Medicare part D, and group and individual insurance plans.   These two bills mirror legislation authored by Representative Buddy  Carter, who is carrying this legislation for the majority on the floor  today. He is a very valuable member of our House Energy and Commerce  Committee. And, by the way, he is the only pharmacist in the Congress,  so he understands this from a very personal perspective from behind the  counter.   He was joined in this effort by Representatives Welch and Cathy  McMorris Rodgers, Anna Eshoo, Morgan Griffith, Debbie Dingell, Gene  Green, and our chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, Dr.  Michael  Burgess.   I think all of us on the committee are very supportive of this  effort. We, in fact, moved this bill, Madam Speaker, as you know, as an  important part of our committee earlier this month, and it did pass  unanimously. So I commend Mr. Carter for his good work on this issue.   I first heard about the gag clause issue from a pharmacist in Grants  Pass, Oregon, named Michele. That is in my district. She is an  independent pharmacist. We were talking about a lot of these issues,  about how we get drug prices down for consumers, and she told me that  as a pharmacist, she was prevented, precluded under certain insurance  contracts, from telling a patient that their cash price would be  cheaper than going through their insurance.   Can you imagine such a thing in America?   Michele told me that she once even received a cease and desist letter  for trying to help a child with a terminal illness access his  medication--simply unacceptable, period.                                time  1615    Madam Speaker, I am glad we are taking concrete action today to  address this important issue. And as we have heard already, these bills  are coming over from the Senate. We had them in the House, marked them  up in committee, and did our work. At the end of the day, I decided the  important thing was not who had which bill. It was, how do we help  consumers the quickest.   Taking the Senate bills, getting them down to the President's desk  with the support of our colleagues who worked so hard in the House  seemed like the best path. It is about putting consumers first. That is  what we have done on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I encourage  our colleagues in the House to support this legislative effort.
