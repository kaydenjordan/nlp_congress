 Mr. Chair, I rise as the designee of Ranking  Member Lowey, and I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of  my amendment to H.R. 2740, which ensures vital funding for the ongoing  demining and rehabilitation projects in Nagorno-Karabakh.   In 1992, during the fall of the Soviet Union, war broke out in  Nagorno-  [[Page H4681]]  Karabakh. Twenty thousand people were killed and hundreds of thousands  more were displaced before the conflict froze.   While an agreed upon ceasefire has been held for over 2 decades, the  lack of a formal end to the war has left the Armenian people of  Nagorno-Karabakh isolated.   Un-detonated mines and cluster bombs from the conflict remain in the  region. As a result, Karabakh has one of the world's highest civilian  casualty rates from land mines and the explosive remnants of war.   According to the HALO Trust, there have been nearly 400 civilian  casualties from mines and unexploded ordnance in Karabakh over the last  2 decades, and a quarter of those land mine victims have been children.   In 2013, a needs assessment estimated that the HALO Trust's  interventions in Karabakh have benefited over 80 percent of the  region's population.   Mr. Chair, families and children shouldn't have to live in fear of  dying due to a land mine accident. That is why I urge my colleagues in  the House of Representatives to support my amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
