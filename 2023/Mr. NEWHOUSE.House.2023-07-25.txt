 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize a dedicated  public servant to our country, Jessica Carter.   Jess has been my right hand for the past few years, helping me better  serve the people of Washington's Fourth Congressional District as my  chief of staff. During that time she has led our team with integrity,  grit, and unparalleled resolve. Now, after almost 30 years of serving  our Nation, she will be leaving Capitol Hill.   As one of the Hill's finest, Jess started in 1995, moving up the  ranks from legislative assistant to deputy chief of staff in the office  of Representative Richard Pombo. She then served as deputy chief of  staff and senior adviser for Representative Steve Pearce, then director  of public policy at the National Industries for the Blind. Following  that she worked for Representatives Stephen Fincher and Francis Rooney  before joining my team in 2020.   Since joining Team Newhouse, Jess has been instrumental in helping my  office pass 59 pieces of legislation while keeping our team working  together every single day. We have been able to achieve extraordinary  wins for central Washington and our Nation.   Many consider her both a friend and a colleague, and she will most  certainly be missed in the Halls of Congress. As my entire staff knows,  once a member of Team Newhouse, always a member of Team Newhouse.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Jess all the best. Capitol Hill will not be the  same without her.                            ____________________
