 Mr. Speaker, there is no reason our Nation should be  importing natural resources from Russia as we have an abundance of  untapped energy resources right here under our feet.   H.R. 1042, the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act, represents a  crucial step forward in protecting our national security, safeguarding  our interests, and ensuring the responsible use of nuclear energy  within the United States.   We must recognize the importance of having safe nuclear energy in our  national energy portfolio and the related need for responsible sourcing  of critical minerals like uranium.   The risk of relying on Russian imports is just too high. Becoming  energy independent will make us stronger in the long run. We must  utilize our domestic resources and our trustworthy friends. Let us  consider the strategic importance of securing our own nuclear supply  chain.   By passing H.R. 1042, we affirm our commitment to energy  independence, national security, and responsible governance.                            ____________________
