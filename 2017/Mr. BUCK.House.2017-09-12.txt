 Mr. Chair, I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to  speak about my amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related  Agencies Division of H.R. 3354.   Mr. Chair, the right to bear arms is ingrained in our nation's  founding. These rights are given to us by God and guaranteed by the  Constitution.   But for many Americans, this right has been forfeited. And their only  option for recourse has been taken away.   When I was District Attorney in Northern Colorado I met a man who  told me that when he was in college he bounced a check to his landlord.  He pleaded guilty to a felony.   Since that day, he has been a model citizen. He finished college. He  worked hard and raised a family.   This man made a mistake that is still haunting him nearly 40 years  later. He wants to take his grandchildren hunting. But he can't possess  a firearm because he made a mistake in his youth.   The worst part of this situation is that the law allows the Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to consider petitions to  restore this man's right to possess a firearm.   However, for 25 years, the underlying bill has included a provision  authored by then-Rep. Schumer prohibiting ATF from processing these  applications.   America is a land of second chances. We restore civil rights for  those who have made mistakes in their past, including the right to vote  in many states. We help our neighbors find employment after  incarceration.   Why should non-violent individuals who made a mistake in their past  be prohibited from having their case heard?   This amendment simply seeks to remove a 25-year-old ban on the ATF's  legal function to hear petitions from non-violent individuals like the  man I mentioned earlier.   To be clear, my amendment would not act as a rubber stamp on every  application. The ATF must weigh the merits of each individual case.   The burden is on the applicant to prove that he or she is nonviolent  and does not pose a threat to the community.   Any American who can prove to ATF they do not pose a danger to  society should be allowed to state their case. They should be allowed  to advocate for their rights.   It is about time that we give these individuals that opportunity  again.   Mr. Chair, my amendment is simple. It would give nonviolent  individuals who made a mistake in their past the opportunity for a  second chance.   It would allow a grandfather the opportunity to take his  grandchildren hunting and provide a way for a mother to protect her  home.   To be clear, this amendment does not guarantee that an applicant will  have their rights restored. But it does give them hope, a chance to  once again possess their Second Amendment rights.   After all, America is the land of second chances.   I thank the Chairman and urge my colleagues to support my amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).   The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 108 Offered by Mr. Cohen    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 108  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division C (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act       under the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program may be used       in contravention of section 642 of the Illegal Immigration       Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Buck) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.  [[Page H7271]]         Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak about my amendment to the  Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies division of H.R. 3354.   Mr. Chairman, the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, or SCAAP,  is intended to further local law enforcement's ability to adhere to  Federal immigration law. SCAAP provides States and localities with  Federal funds to help offset correctional costs related to  incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens with at least one felony or  two misdemeanor convictions.   However, in recent years, the number of jurisdictions receiving SCAAP  funding that have adopted sanctuary policies, allowing violent criminal  aliens to go free, has skyrocketed. My amendment would cut off SCAAP  money for cities that violate the intent of these funds. These  sanctuary cities must not continue using taxpayer money to flagrantly  violate Federal immigration law and put American citizens at risk.   Look no further than my home State of Colorado in the case of Mr.  Ever Valles. Back in October, Mr. Valles was picked up on charges,  including possession of a weapon, vehicle theft, and eluding. He also  had a history of gang involvement.   ICE placed a detainer on Mr. Valles, but Denver officials failed to  honor the Federal detainer, releasing him without providing the proper  notice to ICE officials. Upon his release, Mr. Valles took part in  robbing and shooting 32-year-old Tim Cruz at an RTD train station. He  has been charged with first-degree murder.   Sanctuary policies just don't break the law. They place people's  lives in danger. We cannot continue allowing these jurisdiction  sanctuary cities to use taxpayer money to further these misguided  policies. In fact, the Office of Justice Programs' own website states  that applicants for SCAAP funds are required to certify compliance with  all applicable Federal laws at the time of application. It goes on to  say that, if the OJP receives information indicating that an applicant  violated the statute related to sanctuary policies, that the applicant  will be investigated by the inspector general and could be subject to  criminal and civil penalties.   A recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency report  identified the top 10 jurisdictions with the highest volume of  detainers issued that restrict cooperation with ICE. Not surprisingly,  every one of those sanctuary cities received SCAAP awards in fiscal  year 2016.   Mr. Chairman, sanctuary cities stand against the rule of law. These  jurisdictions support illegal immigration and allow individuals who  violate the law to remain free. We cannot allow these jurisdictions to  continue these harmful policies on the American people's dime. I urge  my colleagues to support my amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time I have left.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado has 2\1/2\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Culberson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Culberson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 20 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I would just ask my colleagues to support my  amendment, and I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for his  support.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.
