 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 354) condemning the violence against  peaceful protesters outside the Turkish Ambassador's residence on May  16, 2017, and calling for the perpetrators to be brought to justice and  measures to be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 354         Whereas, on May 16, 2017, President Donald J. Trump hosted       President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, a longstanding NATO       ally, for an official meeting at the White House to discuss       counterterrorism cooperation and bilateral issues;        Whereas, on the evening of May 16, 2017, over two dozen       protesters gathered outside of the Turkish Ambassador's       residence in Washington, DC, to demonstrate opposition to       Turkish government policies;        Whereas after hours of peaceful protest, violence erupted       when pro-Erdogan supporters and individuals from the Turkish       Embassy grounds pushed past District of Columbia police       officers to brutally attack the demonstrators;        Whereas those Turkish officials blatantly suppressed the       First Amendment rights of United States citizens, and       multiple armed Turkish security officials beat, kicked, and       choked unarmed demonstrators;        Whereas multiple video recordings of the violence and       reports by the Metropolitan Police Department of the District       of Columbia and the Department of State confirm that the       demonstrators did not instigate the violence;        Whereas at least 11 individuals were seriously injured in       the ensuing brawl, with two individuals requiring immediate       hospitalization;        Whereas separately, two armed Turkish security officers       attached to a security detail were detained for physically       assaulting Federal agents;        Whereas those two Turkish security officers were later       released and subsequently allowed to leave the United States       because they held Derived Head of State immunity;        Whereas the Department of State did not request that Turkey       waive the immunity for these two security officers in order       to fully investigate the assault prior to their being       released from custody;        Whereas a joint criminal investigation into the incident is       ongoing with the combined efforts of the Washington       Metropolitan Police Department, the United States Secret       Service, and the Department of State Diplomatic Security       Service;        Whereas at no point was President Erdogan in danger;        Whereas immunity for diplomatic personnel and certain other       foreign officials is a core principle, as is the right to       protest peacefully and freely in the United States;        Whereas this is the third instance of violence perpetrated       by members of Turkish President Erdogan's security detail in       United States territory;        Whereas in 2011, a brawl erupted in the halls of the United       Nations General Assembly between members of Turkish President       Erdogan's security detail and United Nations security       officers, resulting in one United Nations security officer       being hospitalized due to serious injuries;        Whereas in 2016, members of Turkish President Erdogan's       security detail engaged in unwarranted violence against       journalists reporting on an event at the Brookings       Institution;        Whereas Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on May 21,       2017, that the violence outside the Turkish Embassy was       ``outrageous'' and ``simply unacceptable''; and        Whereas the right to assembly, peaceful protest, and       freedom of speech are essential and protected rights in the       United States: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of       Representatives that--        (1) the rights to peacefully assemble and freely express       one's views are essential to the fabric of American       democracy;        (2) the Turkish security forces acted in an unprofessional       and brutal manner, reflecting poorly on President Erdogan and       the Government of Turkey;        (3) any Turkish security officials who directed, oversaw,       or participated in efforts by Turkish security forces to       illegally suppress peaceful protests on May 16, 2017, should       be  [[Page H4629]]       charged and prosecuted under United States law;        (4) the United States Secret Service and the Diplomatic       Security Service of the Department of State should review       this incident and confirm with the Turkish National Police       the standards expected by visiting security details to       prevent future violent incidents;        (5) the Department of State should immediately request the       waiver of immunity of any Turkish security detail official       engaged in assault in the United States prior to release of       that individual from custody;        (6) the Department of State should conduct a review of its       own security procedures to determine how to mitigate the       likelihood of such an event in the future;        (7) the United States respect for free speech requires       officials of the United States to speak out against such       incidents; and        (8) the United States should take steps to strengthen       freedoms for the press and civil society in countries such as       Turkey, and combat efforts by foreign leaders to suppress       free and peaceful protest in their own countries.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentlewoman from the District of  Columbia (Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                general leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking the gentlewoman from  the District of Columbia, and also the gentleman from New York, the  ranking member of this committee, Mr. Engel, for working with us on  this clear condemnation of the violence against peaceful protesters  outside the Turkish Ambassador's residence in Washington, D.C., on May  16.   That day, President Erdogan of Turkey, a longstanding NATO ally, met  at the White House to discuss counterterrorism cooperation and to  discuss bilateral issues. This was an important meeting. But that  evening, armed members of the Turkish President's security detail  brutally attacked demonstrators who had gathered outside the Turkish  Ambassador's residence on Sheridan Circle in Washington, D.C. They were  there to protest various policies of the Turkish Government.   In an unprovoked attack, armed Turkish personnel broke through D.C.  Metropolitan Police lines and attacked the protesters. They choked,  beat, and kicked the demonstrators until D.C. Metropolitan Police  officers, and State Department Diplomatic Security were able to stop  the melee and restore order.   One woman was beaten unconscious. She testified before the Foreign  Affairs Committee that she sustained brain damage as a result. A  protester near her was beaten to the ground and repeatedly kicked in  the face. His front teeth were smashed.   Mr. Speaker, what was the reason these and other American citizens  were harshly beaten?   They chose to exercise their constitutional right to free speech and  assembly. They chose to criticize actions of President Erdogan's  government. The protesters got under the Turkish delegation's skin.   Let us be clear: at no time was President Erdogan in danger. This was  not an act of protection. It was an act of suppression on our American  soil.   The actions of the Turkish security detail were unprofessional and  dangerous. You had armed security personnel creating a melee. The  actions were unjustified and, up to this point, have gone largely  unchallenged.   H. Res. 354 puts Congress firmly on record in clear, unmistakable  terms condemning the actions of the Turkish security guards last month.  The resolution also demands that Turkey immediately lift diplomatic  immunity for all those who assaulted U.S. citizens and law enforcement  officers.   This resolution also calls for the U.S. State Department and the U.S.  Secret Service to review their security procedures and for them to  convey to Turkish officials in clear terms the expectations for the  behavior of their security teams when they are operating in the U.S.   Mr. Speaker, one of the most disturbing aspects of last month's  attack is that this assault by Turkish security officials was not an  isolated incident. Rather, it was the third instance of violence they  have engaged in while operating in the United States in recent years.   Passage of this resolution is an appropriate, strong response by this  House to those brutal actions by Turkish forces.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   The violent attacks, Mr. Speaker, by officers assigned to Turkish  President Erdogan's security detail against peaceful protesters back on  May 16 were designed to do one thing. They were designed to silence  those protesters' criticism of the Turkish Government. That is why it  is so important that we speak out.   We must speak loudly and clearly that we will protect our citizens  and their fundamental rights to free speech and to assembly. Turkey is  an important and longstanding NATO ally, but the Turkish Government can  and should do better than this, and it can start by addressing the  concerns of the House of Representatives and many Americans who were  very angered by the video capturing this disgraceful attack on these  citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 354,  which condemns the violence, on American soil, against peaceful  protestors outside the residence of the Turkish Ambassador to the  United States and calls for the perpetrators to be brought to justice.   On May 16, 2017, the President hosted President Recep Tayyip Erdogan  of Turkey for an official meeting at the White House to discuss  counter-terrorism cooperation and bilateral issues.   That evening, over two dozen protestors peaceably assembled outside  the Turkish Ambassador's residence in Washington, D.C., to voice their  opposition to Turkish Government policies.   It was not long before unprovoked violence erupted, when pro-Erdogan  supporters and individuals from the Turkish Embassy grounds pushed past  District of Columbia police officers to brutally attack the peaceful  demonstrators.   These Turkish officials violated the First Amendment rights of United  States citizens, and multiple armed Turkish officials beat, kicked, and  choked unarmed demonstrators.   Multiple video recordings show the violence with which these  demonstrators were attacked.   The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia and  the Department of State confirm that the demonstrators did not  instigate the violence.   Two armed Turkish officers attached to a security detail were  detained at the scene for physically assaulting Federal agents but were  later released and allowed to leave the United States because they held  diplomatic immunity.   Mr. Speaker, it is beyond dispute that the life of President Erdogan  was never in any danger.   It must be noted that immunity for diplomatic personnel and certain  other foreign officials is a core principal but so is the  constitutionally protected right to protest peacefully and freely in  the United States.   Mr. Speaker, this is the third instance of violence perpetrated by  members of Turkish President Erdogan's security detail on United States  soil.   In 2011, a brawl erupted in the halls of the United States Nations  General Assembly between members of Turkish President Erdogan's  security detail and United Nations security officers, resulting in one  United Nations security officer being hospitalized due to serious  injuries.   In 2016, members of Turkish President Erdogan's security detail  engaged in unwarranted violence against journalist reporting on an  event at the Brookings Institution.   On May 21, 2017, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson affirmed that  violence outside the Turkish Embassy was ``outrageous'' and ``simply  unacceptable.''   It is imperative that the right to assembly, peaceful protest, and  freedom of speech are not abridged because they are the bedrock of  democracy.   For this reason, the United States Secret Service and the Diplomatic  Security Service of the Department of State should review this incident  and confirm with the Turkish National Police the standards expected by  visiting security details to prevent future violent incidents.   The Department of State should also conduct a review of its own  security procedure to determine how to mitigate the likelihood of  similar events in the future.   It is the duty of this House to stand for our ideals and take steps  to strengthen freedoms for the press and civil society in countries  such as Turkey, and oppose efforts by foreign leaders to suppress free  and peaceful protest in their own countries.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 390) to provide for emergency relief to victims of  genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes in Iraq and Syria, to  provide accountability for perpetrators of these crimes, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 390         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Iraq and Syria Genocide       Emergency Relief and Accountability Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Religious and ethnic minorities in Iraq and Syria are       persecuted groups, and the Secretary of State of State       declared on March 17, 2016, that Daesh, also known as the       Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), was responsible for       genocide, crimes against humanity, and other atrocity crimes       against several of these groups, including Christians and       Yezidis.        (2) According to the Department of State's annual reports       on international religious freedom, the number of Christians       living in Iraq has dropped from an estimated 800,000 to       1,400,000 in 2002 to fewer than 250,000 in 2015, and the       number of Yezidis living in Iraq has dropped from 500,000 in       2013 to 350,000 to 400,000 in 2015.        (3) The annual reports on international religious freedom       further suggest that Christian communities living in Syria,       which had accounted for between eight and ten percent of       Syria's total population in 2010, are now ``considerably''       smaller as a result of the civil war, and that the population       of approximately 80,000 Yezidis in 2010 may now be larger       because of refugees from Iraq.        (4) Local communities and entities have sought to mitigate       the impact of violence directed against religious and ethnic       minorities in Iraq and Syria, including the Chaldean Catholic       Archdiocese of Erbil (Kurdistan Region of Iraq), which has       used private funds to provide assistance to internally       displaced Christians, Yezidis, and Muslims throughout the       greater Erbil region, while growing needs and diminishing       resources have made it increasingly difficult to continue       these efforts.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by recognizing the efforts of our  colleague, Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith of New Jersey is chairman of the  Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and  International Organizations. We appreciate his strong leadership on  this critical issue. And, as always, I also appreciate Ranking Member  Engel for his support.   Mr. Speaker, more than 6 years ago, the world watched with dread as  Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad ordered action against what were  peaceful protestors coming down the main boulevard in Damascus. We  watched on CNN and international television. As they were saying it was  peaceful, we then saw the automatic weapons of the regime open up and  mow them down. What has followed has been year after year of mass  atrocities as Assad seeks to break the Syrian people.   Building on the vacuum created by Assad, ISIS burst onto the  international stage in 2014 by declaring themselves and their supposed  ``caliphate''--and committing obscene, horrific acts in an effort to  spread their nihilistic, death-filled ideology.   We also saw that they targeted anyone unlucky enough to cross their  path across Syria and Iraq. Yet, oddly enough, the regime in Syria did  not target ISIS. They were too busy carrying out their campaign against  the people of Syria--protesters, the Free Syrian Army, and others--who  were pushing back against the regime.   Here, alongside the nightmare that Assad created, came this new  nightmare of ISIS. These two evils, as I call them, ISIS and Assad,  exist side by side, perpetrating extreme violence on anyone who would  oppose their grip on power.   ISIS is committing genocidal violence against Yazidis and Christians  in Syria and Iraq, seeking to destroy their entire communities and to  erase their shared histories. Assad is committing massive crimes  against humanity, targeting men, women, and children from all sects,  all religions, and all groups, as documented by Caesar, a military  photographer who snuck out photos of what goes on in Assad's prisons,  documenting the torture and death of tens of thousands of citizens in  Syria.   More than a year after the Obama administration, under intense  congressional pressure, finally declared that ISIS' actions against the  religious communities of Iraq and Syria constituted ``genocide,'' there  is still an urgent need for assistance to these vulnerable communities.  These communities, which exist on the outskirts in Syria and on the  borders, have been devastated by ISIS' efforts to wipe them out.  [[Page H4634]]    These ancient communities, whose roots go back centuries, include  Christians, Yazidis, Assyrians, Syriacs, Turkomans, and many others.  Their presence in Iraq and Syria is crucial to the social fabric of  these nations.   While the U.S. has been generous in providing assistance to those  targeted, their needs are still urgent and extreme. Whole communities  have been displaced, enslaved, and slaughtered. Survivors need  assistance in feeding and clothing their families and in beginning to  address the extreme trauma caused by ISIS and Assad.   This bill offers additional immediate relief for these vulnerable  communities and also directs the State Department to do more to support  efforts to collect and preserve evidence of ``genocide, crimes against  humanity, and war crimes'' so that, someday, justice might be served.   I urge Members to support this bill so that the possibility of  justice and accountability for these atrocities can give hope to those  suffering today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                     Washington, DC, April 24, 2017.      Hon. Edward R. Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Royce: I write with respect to H.R. 390, the       ``Iraq and Syria Genocide Emergency Relief and Accountability       Act.'' As a result of your having consulted with us on       provisions within H.R. 390 that fall within thc rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I forego any       further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.        The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 390 at       this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our       committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our       committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation and asks       that you support any such request.        I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 390 and would ask       that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of H.R. 390.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, April 24, 2017.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 390, the Iraq and Syria       Genocide Emergency Relief and Accountability Act of 2017, so       that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this resolution or similar legislation in the future. I       would support your effort to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees from your committee to any       House-Senate conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 390 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       resolution. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work together       as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the author of this bill and also  the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global  Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished  chairman for yielding, and I thank him for his leadership on this bill.  I want to thank Ranking Member Engel for his support and also Majority  Leader McCarthy for making sure this bill came to the floor. Without  that, we wouldn't be here, so I want to thank him especially for his  support.   Mr. Speaker, I start off by saying that, since 2013, I have chaired  nine congressional hearings focused in whole or in part on atrocities  in Iraq and Syria. The distinguished chairman has had another dozen or  so such hearings that have brought to light these atrocities.   In one of our hearings in December of 2015, Gregory Stanton,  president of Genocide Watch, testified that ``weak words are not  enough,'' noting that 21 human rights organizations, genocide scholars,  and religious leaders wrote to President Obama imploring him to  recognize the ISIS genocide.   At that same hearing, Chaldean Bishop Francis Kalabat said that  ``since the fall of Mosul in early June 2014, Christians have endured  targeted persecution in the form of forced displacement, sexual  violence, and other human rights violations.'' He said, ``ISIS has  committed terrific atrocities against the Yazidis,'' and then he  bottom-lined it and said the Christians are ``under threat of  extinction.''   On May 9, 2016, the House passed Jeff Fortenberry's genocide  resolution 393-0. A few days later, Secretary of State John Kerry  declared ISIS atrocities to be a genocide.   The existential threat to Christians and Yazidis and other minority  faiths, however, continues to this day. Some of the fortunate ones have  made it to the relative safety of Erbil but, astonishingly, have gotten  no assistance from the United States Government.   Since 2014, as a matter of fact, the Chaldean Catholic Archdiocese of  Erbil has provided almost all of the medical care, food, shelter, and  education received by over 13,200 Christian families,  [[Page H4635]]  almost one-third of the Christians remaining in Iraq, who escaped ISIS.  The archdiocese also provides assistance to Yazidis and Muslims. The  funding for all of this has been private, with money from Knights of  Columbus, Aid to the Church in Need, and a few others.   Carl Anderson, Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, which has  donated more than $12 million to the effort, testified in one of my  hearings and said the Knights and other private sources have responded.  ``But nongovernmental organizations can only do so much.''   ``The rich tapestry,'' as he pointed out, ``of religious pluralism in  the region must be preserved now or it will be lost forever,'' noting  that there has been an 80 percent decline of Christians in Iraq and 70  percent in Syria.   He said: ``With its loss will come increased instability and threats  to our own security and that of the world.   ``We have a unique opportunity--and, some would say, unique  responsibility--to protect the victims of genocide.''   Mr. Speaker, just before Christmas of last year, I traveled to Erbil  with a staff delegation at the invitation of the Chaldean archbishop,  Bashar Warda, to meet with survivors and to visit an internally  displaced person camp of about 6,000 individuals. Both my staff and I  were amazed and inspired by the genocide survivors' resiliency and deep  faith in the Lord, despite the cruelty that they had endured.                                time  1715    There was so much joy, love, and courage despite the loss of family  and friends to ISIS. They had deep hope. The children sang Christmas  carols--it was December 23 when we were there--with smiles and with  reverence. The leaders, especially Archbishop Warda, trusted in God  while working unceasingly and unselfishly for others.   Because the needs on the ground have always exceeded private support,  the archdiocese has had to battle chronic funding crises over these  last several years. Archbishop Warda told me recently that they had to  temporarily suspend their distribution of medicines, and are on track  to run out of money for food sometime this June.   H.R. 390 provides authority and direction to the secretary and the  administrator of USAID to identify the humanitarian, stabilization, and  recovery needs of these communities.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an  additional 2 minutes.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. This bill also authorizes and directs the  secretary to fund entities, including faith-based ones, that are  effectively providing assistance to meet those needs on the ground.   It addresses another urgent aspect of this crisis: evidence linking  specific ISIS perpetrators to specific atrocity crimes that is being  destroyed or lost. And we have seen this in the past in Rwanda, in  Sierra Leone, and in the former Yugoslavia. You have got to collect the  information that is actionable in order to prosecute these crimes  against humanity. This legislation directs that, and that is why it has  the support of all four former U.S. Ambassadors at Large for war crimes  issues.   It also directs the Secretary of State to work with foreign  governments to ensure that they are including identifying information  about suspected perpetrators in their security databases and security  screening and are prosecuting perpetrators of these horrific crimes.   President Trump and Vice President Pence have strongly, publicly, and  repeatedly committed the administration to providing relief to  Christians, Yazidis, and other genocide survivors. This legislation  tangibly supports this commitment and is a blueprint for action.   I especially want to thank tonight the coauthor of this legislation,  Anna Eshoo. Her tireless efforts on behalf of all Christians and other  persecuted religious minorities has been really fantastic, and I want  to thank her for that and for working so cooperatively together with me  and my staff and the full committee staff.   I would also like to thank the great staff work of Nathaniel Hurd,  Piero Tozzi in my office, Matt McMurray in Anna Eshoo's office, Doug  Anderson and Joan Condon in the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and  Roger Mahan and Luke Murry in the majority leader's office. And, as  always, I want to thank Kelly Dixon, who ultimately helped us bring  this legislation to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the statement of Mr. Carl A.  Anderson before the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human  Rights, and International Organizations.   Opening Statement of Mr. Carl A. Anderson, Supreme Knight, Knights of                                  Columbus         (Before the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health Global       Human Rights and International Organizations of the Committee       on Foreign Affairs, U.S. House of Representatives, at a       hearing titled The ISIS Genocide Declaration: What Next?, May       26, 2019)        Thank you for the opportunity to appear before this       subcommittee and to discuss the next steps that need to be       taken needed to protect the survivors of ongoing genocide in       Iraq and Syria. Let me begin by saying that the House of       Representatives, the State Department and the United States       Commission on International Religious Freedom are all to be       commended for the important step of declaring the situation       confronting Christians and other religious minorities in the       Middle East genocide.        The world's greatest humanitarian crisis since World War II       is unfolding now in the Middle East. In addition to millions       of refugees, many of the region's indigenous communities now       face extinction. These communities may disappear in less than       a decade. But their fate is not inevitable. The United States       can avert this unfolding tragedy.                          A unique historical moment         Around the world, people of good will, Muslim and non-      Muslim alike, wish to differentiate themselves from the       horrific and violent theology espoused by ISIS.        It is certainly true that such extremists make up a small       percentage of Muslims overall. But among the world's billion       Muslims, the majority simply want to raise their families in       peace and are scandalized by what ISIS is doing in the name       of Islam.        Prominent Islamic leaders and scholars from around the       world have recently taken an important step in the Marrakesh       Declaration. Attempts such as this, which seek to align Islam       with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights should be       supported.        At the same time, it is clear that Christians, and other       indigenous minorities, are experiencing genocide, at the       hands of the Islamic State and related groups. Their plight       is now at the top of the world's agenda in a way that it       never has been before.        These factors together create an unparalleled opportunity       for the United States, and for all those opposed to ISIS'       radical vision--Muslims and non-Muslims alike--to advance an       agenda of equality, justice, peace, and accountability in the       region.                Six principles for sound policy in the region         The United States can avert the extinction of indigenous       religious and ethnic communities in Iraq and Syria with a       policy that contains the following six principles:        (1) Increase aid and ensure that it actually reaches those       most in need;        We are reliably informed that official government and U.N.       aid does not reach the Christian genocide survivors in Iraq       and Syria.        Repeatedly, we hear from Church leaders in the region that       Christians--and other genocide survivors--are last in line       for assistance from governments. Significantly, the       Archdiocese of Erbil, where most Iraqi Christians now live,       receives no money from any government whatsoever. If       assistance from outside Church affiliated agencies ends in       Erbil, Christians there will face a catastrophic humanitarian       tragedy within 30 days. The situation is similar in Syria,       according to Christian leaders there.        Those who face genocide are a tiny fraction of the       population. They often must avoid official refugee camps       because they are targeted for violence there by extremists.       As a result, these minorities often do not get ``official''       aid. This will continue to be the reality unless specific       action is taken to bring the aid to where these minorities       are forced to reside by continuing violence.        The Knights of Columbus and others private sources have       responded to this situation. Since 2014, we have raised more       than $10.5 million for relief, assisting Christians and other       internally displaced persons and refugees in Iraq, Syria,       Jordan, and Lebanon. We have partnered with dioceses and       religious agencies working in the region to provide general       relief, food, clothing, shelter, education, and medical care.       In doing so we assist both Christians and non-Christians. We       are also working with church entities to ensure that they are       making use of all government or U.N. resources available.        But non-governmental organizations can only do so much.       Government aid is essential to the long-term survival of       these indigenous religious and ethnic minorities. It is       urgent that Congress appropriate funding to save those who       have escaped genocide. I urge you to consider special       emergency appropriations, however modest, to improve the       humanitarian conditions on the ground in Iraq.        This funding, whatever the vehicle, should come with       mechanisms in place--reporting  [[Page H4636]]       requirements and oversight--to ensure that American aid does       not get diverted from its intended purpose.        (2) Support the long-term survival in the region of these       ancient indigenous religious and ethnic communities;        In Iraq, the Christians population has declined by more       than 80 percent, and in Syria by nearly 70 percent.        American policy should recognize the important differences       in the situations of those fleeing violence and those       targeted for genocide. And we should prioritize the latter.        Consider this analogy. After World War II, there were       approximately 50 million refugees, and only a small fraction       were Jews. Yet the world understood that Jews, who had       survived genocide, faced a qualitatively different situation,       and deserved heightened consideration.        The same is true today for the indigenous religious and       ethnic minorities of the region. They have an indisputable       right to live in their country--in whatever region of it they       wish. Depending on the circumstances, this may mean where       they are originally from, or where they find themselves now,       but as survivors of an ongoing genocide, they deserve to be       prioritized, not left behind by American policy decisions.        (3) Punish the perpetrators of genocide and crimes against       humanity;        The United States should support action by the U.N.       Security Council to refer key perpetrators of genocide for       prosecution. Equally important, we should support the Iraqi       Central Government and the Kurdish Regional Government's       adjudication of the cases of thousands of ISIS fighters       and supporters who currently remain in local detention       centers.        As the population of captured ISIS fighters increases,       local detention centers and jails risk becoming their own       humanitarian issue. The need to improve this situation cannot       be overstated.        Additionally, although substantial evidence of genocide       exists, the United States should cooperate in taking further       action to develop additional documentation and preservation       before physical evidence is lost. Appropriations intended to       assist in the adjudication of ISIS fighters will be critical       in the coming months.        (4) Assist victims of genocide in attaining refugee status.        A news report last week indicated that of the 499 Syrian       refugees admitted to the U.S. in May, not one was listed as       being Christian or as explicitly coming from any of the       groups targeted for genocides. How long will this situation       be allowed to continue?        The U.S. should appropriate funding and work with the U.N.       High Commissioner for Refugees to make provisions for       locating and providing status to individuals--such as Yezidis       and Christians--that have been targeted for genocide. Many of       these genocide survivors fear going into official U.N.       refugee camps, where they are targeted. Thus they are       overlooked, and find it nearly impossible to acquire official       refugee status or immigrate.        Congress should act now. Senator Tom Cotton has introduced       the Religious Persecution Relief Act, S. 2708, to provide for       overlooked minorities in the prioritization of refugees. We       support this bill and urge its passage.        (5) Prepare now for foreseeable human rights challenges as       ISIS-controlled territory is liberated by ensuring that       Christians and other minorities have equal rights to decide       their future;        We should prepare now for the consequences of the       liberation of ISIS controlled areas, including Mosul and the       Nineveh Region, as well as regions in Syria. We are likely to       see another humanitarian crisis as civilians flee the       fighting or return to their former communities when fighting       ceases.        There has been much debate concerning plans for victims of       genocide in Iraq. Some have argued for returning people       safely to the Nineveh Region, others that they should be       allowed to stay in Kurdistan, still others that they be       allowed to immigrate. But these are not necessarily mutually       exclusive, competing proposals. People should be allowed to       decide their own future. And when they do, we should work to       ensure they are treated with fairness, dignity and equality.       This also means that it will be increasingly important to       ensure that the property rights and claims of minority groups       are respected.        (6) Promote the establishment of internationally agreed       upon standards of human rights and religious freedom as       conditions for humanitarian and military assistance.        The United States should advocate for full and equal rights       for religious and ethnic minorities in the region in exchange       for our military and humanitarian aid. A necessary first step       to prevent genocide is to overcome the social and legal       inequality that is its breeding ground.        Religious hatred, discrimination and second-class       citizenship too often constitute a way of life in the       region--and it is a way of life that is an antecedent to       genocide. We cannot accept one standard for human rights in       the region and another standard for the rest of the world.        The guarantees in the Universal Declaration of Human       Rights--and the First and Fourteenth amendments to our own       constitution--regarding equality under the law and freedom of       speech and religion must become a reality for all citizens of       Iraq, Syria and elsewhere throughout the region.                                  Conclusion         The rich tapestry of religious pluralism in the region must       be preserved now or it will be lost forever. With its loss       will come increased instability and threats to our own       security and that of the world.        We have a unique opportunity--and some would say, unique       responsibility--to protect the victims of genocide. The       United States can provide such protection with a policy that       includes the principles outlined above. Mr. Chairman, thank       you very much for your leadership and that of the members of       this subcommittee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Just in speaking about the conditions of the Christian community,  outside of Erbil, like Chairman Smith, I had the opportunity last year  to speak to Archbishop Warda and to many of those Christian families  that have survived, and to see many of the children that are struggling  there.   I did want to commend the Knights of Columbus, the archbishop, and  Catholic Charities for their sustained effort, which goes not only to  this Christian community, but also the neighboring Yazidi community.  These communities have no other means of support.   I think that as we reflect upon this, beyond the genocidal actions of  ISIS, we have also seen the depravity of the Assad regime, which has  engaged in a massive effort to destroy anyone, regardless of sect or  religion or ethnicity, if they suspect them of being unwilling to bow  to Syria's murderous dictator. None are safe.   I say ``suspect'' because so many of those who were tortured to death  to give up other names are simply caught up in a web of intelligence  services who go out and try to find those who they believe may not be  loyal. And they haul them in for torture. And under the knife, many of  these people will give up names of other families, whoever they can  remember, whoever they know who may or may not in any way be involved  in politics, but then find themselves in those same torture chambers.   The result of this kind of a society year after year breeds a sense  of absolute hopelessness, of blowback, of problems throughout Syria  from which, I must say, I suspect this long climb back is going to be a  very difficult one.   At the end of the day, though, it is still absolutely imperative that  those responsible for those hideous crimes be held accountable. A key  aspect of any lasting peace is going to be accountability, because a  renewal of trust and the prospect of justice is going to be based on  some measure on whether we are going to hold to account those who  committed those kinds of crimes, those who led to this kind of horror.  Whether it is Assad's regime or whether it is ISIS, there is so much  devastation left in the wake.   I urge Members to support this resolution so that the possibility of  peace can be sustained by the hope that justice will prevail. I again  thank Mr. Smith for authoring this measure. I also thank Ranking Member  Engel for his passionate leadership on the crisis in Syria for so many  years.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, since 2013, I have chaired nine  Congressional hearings focused, in whole or in a large part, on  atrocities in Iraq and Syria.   At one hearing in December of 2015, Professor Gregory Stanton,  President of Genocide Watch testified that ``weak words are not  enough'' noting that twenty one human rights organizations, genocide  scholars, and religious leaders wrote to President Obama imploring him  to recognize the ISIS genocide.   At the same hearing, Chaldean Bishop Francis Kalabat testified that  ``since the fall of  [[Page H4637]]  Mosul in early June 2014, Christians have endured targeted persecution  in the form of forced displacement, sexual violence, and other human  rights violations.'' He said ``ISIS has committed horrific atrocities  against the Yazidis.'' The bishop said Christians are ``under threat of  extinction.''   On May 9, 2016, the House passed Jeff Fortenberry's Genocide  resolution 393 to 0. A few days later, Secretary of State John Kerry  declared ISIS atrocities to be a genocide.   The existential threat to Christians and Yazidis and other minorities  continues to this day. Some of the fortunate ones, however, have made  it to relative safety in Erbil but astonishingly have not gotten  assistance from the United States.   Since 2014, the Chaldean Catholic Archdiocese of Erbil has been  providing almost all of the medical care, food, shelter and education  received by 13,200 Christian families, almost one third of Christians  remaining in Iraq, who escaped ISIS. The Archdiocese also provides  assistance to Yazidis and Muslims. The funding has been private-- Knights of Columbus, Aid to the Church in Need, and a few others.   Carl Anderson, Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus--which has  donated more than $12 million to the effort--testified that the Knights  and other private sources have responded, ``But non-governmental  organizations can only do so much.'' He also made numerous  recommendations including supporting the ``Long term survival in the  region of these ancient indigenous religions and ethnic communities. In  Iraq, the Christian population has declined by more than 80 percent,  and in Syria, it has declined by almost 70 percent . . . The rich  tapestry of religious pluralism in the region must be preserved now or  it will be lost forever.'' He said, ``With its loss will come increased  instability and threats to our own security and that of the world. We  have a unique opportunity--and some would say, unique responsibility-- to protect the victims of genocide.''   Just before Christmas last year, I travelled to Erbil at the  invitation of the Chaldean Catholic Archbishop of Erbil, Bashar Warda,  to meet with survivors and visit an IDP camp.   Both my staff and I were amazed and inspired by the genocide  survivors resiliency and deep faith in the Lord despite the cruelty  they endured.   There was much joy, love, and courage despite the loss of family and  friends to ISIS. They had hope. The children sang Christmas carols with  smiles and reverence.   The leaders--especially Archbishop Warda--trust in God while working  unceasingly for others.   Because the needs on-the-ground have always exceeded private support,  however, the Archdiocese has had to battle chronic funding crises.  Archbishop Warda told me they recently had to temporarily suspend their  distribution of medicines and are on-track to run out of money for food  sometime this June.   H.R. 390 provides authority and direction to the Secretary and  Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development to  identify the humanitarian, stabilization, and recovery needs of these  communities. The bill also authorizes and directs the Secretary and  Administrator to fund entities--including faith-based ones--that are  effectively providing assistance to meet those needs on-the-ground.   H.R. 390 addresses another urgent aspect of this crisis: Evidence  linking specific ISIS perpetrators to specific atrocity crimes is being  destroyed or lost. It is vital that evidence that can be used in a  range of court settings is collected and preserved. This will enable  accountability and support our efforts to counter terrorist groups by  demonstrating that the perpetrators are chronic rapists, child abusers,  drug dealers and human traffickers.   This legislation authorizes and directs the Secretary and  Administrator to fund entities that are conducting criminal  investigations into perpetrators of atrocity crimes in Iraq.   The Commission for International Justice and Accountability is an  example of a non-governmental organization that has been conducting  such criminal investigations on-the-ground. CIJA has collected and  preserved ISIS recruitment forms, foreign fighter passports, and ISIS  instructions from ISIS facilities, laptops, hard drives, and memory  sticks. It has taken hundreds of witness statements from victims,  perpetrators, detained fighters, defectors, insiders, witnesses, and  other witnesses. CIJA has developed pretrial briefs and perpetrator  profiles that are of a world-class quality.   In 2016, CIJA received 409 requests for assistance on cases from law  enforcement agencies in many countries, including the Department of  Homeland Security and FBI and works closely with both agencies. Yet,  CIJA has received no financial support from the U.S. government.   H.R. 390 also directs the Secretary to work with foreign governments  to ensure that they are including identifying information about  suspected perpetrators in their security databases and security  screening and are prosecuting perpetrators.   ISIS fighters in Iraq are being captured and detained in the battle  for Mosul and beyond. Others are escaping the region and attempting to  return to their home countries around the world. We should help ensure  that in addition to being screened and prosecuted for terrorism, they  are screened and prosecuted for atrocity crimes.   President Trump and Vice President Pence have strongly, publicly  committed the Administration to providing relief to Christians,  Yazidis, and other genocide survivors, and ensuring perpetrators are  brought to justice. H.R. 390 supports this commitment and is a  blueprint for implementation.   H.R. 390 has the bipartisan co-sponsorship of 46 members, support  from a range of prominent Christian, Yezidi, religious freedom, and  accountability organizations, and has been endorsed by all four former  U.S. Ambassadors-at-Large for War Crimes Issues.   I especially want to acknowledge my co-author and good friend Anna  Eshoo. Her tireless efforts on behalf of Christians and other  persecuted religious minorities, and the fantastic partnership with her  and her staff on this bill, are a testament to the hi-partisanship of  H.R. 390 and international religious freedom more broadly.   And finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the great staff work  of Nathaniel Hurd and Piero Toni in my office. Matt McMurray in Anna  Eshoo's office. Doug Anderson and Joan Condon in the House Foreign  Affairs Committee. Roger Mahan and Luke Murry in the Majority Leader's  Office. And Kelly Dixon who ultimately helped us get it to the floor.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland  Security Committee and as a member of the Congressional Refugee Caucus,  I rise in strong support of H.R. 390, the ``Iraq and Syria Genocide  Emergency Relief and Accountability Act of 2017.''   This legislation makes clear that it is the policy of the United  States to ensure that assistance for humanitarian, stabilization, and  recovery needs is directed toward those individuals and communities  with the greatest need, including those individuals from communities of  religious and ethnic minorities, and communities of religious and  ethnic minorities, that have been identified as being at risk of  persecution, forced migration, acts of genocide, crimes against  humanity, or war crimes.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a timely and important response to  acts of genocide and other war crimes committed by ISIS in a its  continuing effort to subjugate the Yazidi religious minority in Syria  and Iraq.   ISIS has targeted and continues to target Muslims, Jews, Sikhs,  Christians, Yazidis and its reprehensible actions are reminiscent of  what we have seen in some of the darkest periods of human history.   For example, according to reports of human rights watchgroups, Shiite  Muslims have been killed by ongoing waves of ISIS bombings of Shiite  neighborhoods, and Shiite members of Iraq's security forces have been  victims of mass ISIS executions.   ISIS is believed to be holding 3,500 people as slaves, and most of  the enslaved are women and children from the Yazidi community.   ISIS claimed credit for the twin blasts that struck Christian  Egyptian churches during Palm Sunday services, in which at least 47  Christians were murdered.   Sadly, Mr. Speaker, in our own country we are witnessing an alarming  increase in violence, bigotry, and acts of terror against members of  many of our religious minorities:   1. Muslim college students have been shot and killed, execution- style, in their living room and outside of their mosques.   2. Jewish communities are struggling to deal with desecrated  cemeteries and waves of bomb threats being called to their community  centers and places of worship.   3. Two Sikh men were killed in New York City, a crime police declared  to be a hate-shooting.   4. Nine African American parishioners were shot to death during Bible  study at a Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in  Charleston, South Carolina.   H.R. 390 aims to promote accountability in Iraq and Syria for the  atrocities committed against the religious minorities living in those  countries.   It also provides emergency relief for victims of genocide, crimes  against humanity, and war crimes in Iraq and Syria.   Specifically, the bill authorizes the providing of financial and  technical assistance to those in need, as well as working with  nongovernmental organizations with expertise in international criminal  investigations and law to investigate and address crimes of genocide,  crimes against humanity, or war crimes, and their constituent crimes,  occurring in Iraq since January 2014.   H.R. 390 also authorizes United States aid agencies to provide  assistance to entities determined to be capable of effectively managing  and delivering recovery, humanitarian, or stabilization assistance to  Iraqi and Syrian religious or ethnic minorities that have been  victimized by ISIS.  [[Page H4638]]    Mr. Speaker, the crimes ISIS has committed against Iraqi and Syrian  religious and ethnic minorities are horrific.   The victims of this campaign of terror are innocent and in dire need  of humanitarian and stabilization assistance.   As the global leader and champion of human rights and human dignity,  the United States has an obligation to lead the international effort to  defeat ISIS and ameliorate the suffering caused by its heinous acts.   H.R. 390 is a welcome and positive step in the right direction and I  urge all Members to join me in voting for this important legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 355) condemning in the strongest terms  the terrorist attacks in Manchester, United Kingdom, on May 22, 2017,  expressing heartfelt condolences, and reaffirming unwavering support  for the special relationship between our peoples and nations in the  wake of these attacks, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 355         Whereas, on May 22, 2017, a terrorist triggered improvised       explosive devices at the Manchester Arena following the       conclusion of a concert by American recording artist Ariana       Grande;        Whereas the blasts took the lives of at least 22 people,       and seriously injured 59, many of whom were children;        Whereas British officials are continuing to investigate the       bombing to determine whether it was perpetrated by a lone       individual or by a terrorist network;        Whereas, on May 23, 2017, the Islamic State of Iraq and       Syria (ISIS) claimed responsibility for the attacks and       threatened further attacks;        Whereas on June 3, 2017, three terrorists drove a van into       pedestrians on London Bridge before committing multiple       stabbing attacks against innocent bystanders in the Borough       Market area of London;        Whereas British police quickly arrived at the scene and       successfully ended the terrorist attack;        Whereas at least seven people were killed, and more than 48       wounded in the terrorist attack;        Whereas British police continue to investigate the incident       to ensure that all involved in planning or supporting the       attack are brought to justice;        Whereas the horrific attacks at the Manchester Arena and in       London are the latest in a series of deadly assaults by ISIS       in Europe in recent years;        Whereas British first responders reacted swiftly and       heroically to both attacks, taking immediate measures to       secure the areas and care for the wounded in ways that       prevented further loss of life;        Whereas Prime Minister Theresa May stated on May 23, 2017,       that ``all acts of terrorism are cowardly attacks on innocent       people but this attack stands out for its appalling,       sickening cowardice, deliberately targeting innocent,       defenseless children and young people'' and paid tribute to       ``the spirit of Manchester and the spirit of Britain, a       spirit that through years of conflict and terrorism has never       been broken and will never be broken.'';        Whereas President Donald Trump condemned those who       perpetrated the attacks and offered any and all assistance to       the United Kingdom as it investigates these attacks and works       to bring the terrorists to justice; and        Whereas the United Kingdom has been a steadfast ally to the       United States: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns the recent terrorist attacks in Manchester,       United Kingdom, on May 22, 2017, and in London, United       Kingdom, on June 3, 2017, and extends its deepest sympathies       to all those affected by these tragedies;        (2) reaffirms the American commitment to the special       relationship with the United Kingdom, and supports the       efforts of the British Government to bring all those involved       with these heinous attacks to justice;        (3) appreciates the significant efforts by the United       Kingdom to combat terrorism;        (4) recognizes the persistent and growing threat posed by       Islamist terrorist groups worldwide, and reaffirms the       commitment of  [[Page H4639]]       the United States to the multilateral, global fight against       such violent extremists; and        (5) remains committed to the defense of universal       democratic values.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Espaillat)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material on this measure.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material on this measure.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Congressman Gregory Meeks, the  ranking member of the Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats  Subcommittee; and Congressman Paul Cook, the vice chairman of the House  Foreign Affairs Committee. I recognize them for their work on this  timely and important resolution.   On May 22, as the world knows, in a cowardly act of terrorism, a  suicide bomber attacked those exiting a concert at the Manchester Arena  in England. These were principally teenagers and children who were  attending that concert, in some cases, parents. What many had planned  to be a night of joy, a festival, a chance for them to gather to  celebrate turned with one horrifying blast into a nightmare of chaos  and devastation, and 23 innocent people were killed, 166 were severely  injured, and many of those victims were children.   This past week, in another cowardly attack, terrorists struck  unsuspecting and unarmed pedestrians on London Bridge, and then those  terrorists went on an attack against innocent bystanders in London's  Borough Market area, slashing and killing, and thus far, at least 7  victims have died and 48 have been seriously wounded. We grieve their  loss and send our prayers and condolences to their families.   We also commend the brave and selfless actions of British first  responders who, in the wake of both attacks, moved to quickly secure  the areas, aid the wounded, and prevent further loss of life.   Our deranged enemies, it is clear, are intent on striking us wherever  and whenever possible, often choosing to prey upon the most vulnerable,  the most innocent in our society, preying, in this case, on children  and teenagers. We must be even more determined in our resolve to stop  them and we must continue to build upon our own capabilities,  strengthening our cooperation with our friends and allies like the  United Kingdom.   Mr. Speaker, the United Kingdom has been a staunch friend and ally,  unparalleled in its support for the United States, including as a  partner in our counterterrorism efforts. At this sad time, we stand  solidly beside our friends and allies as they mourn, heal, and most  assuredly rise again following this tragedy. Passage of this resolution  is just one way that we can demonstrate this support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in unanimously  supporting this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Holding), chairman of the British- American Parliamentary Group and co-chairman of the Congressional  United Kingdom Caucus, and he also has strong family ties in Britain.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), chairman of the Foreign Affairs'  Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), chairman of the Foreign Affairs'  Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, following the killing in London this past weekend,  British Prime Minister May compared the attacks in Manchester and those  in the capital, and she said: `` . . . while the recent attacks are not  connected by common networks, they are connected in one important  sense. They are bound together by the single evil ideology of Islamist  extremism that preaches hatred, sows division, and promotes  sectarianism.''   ``Defeating this ideology is one of the great challenges of our time.  . . .''   Those were the Prime Minister's words.   We are committed to standing with our British friends and allies in  this important fight. This resolution signals our resolve to deepen our  collaboration with our friends and allies in the United Kingdom to  counter terrorism and to counter radicalization.   Mr. Speaker, I, therefore, urge my colleagues to join me in unanimous  support of this resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res.  355, which expresses the condolences of the United States to the  twenty-two innocent victims who lost their lives and the fifty-nine  individuals who were seriously injured in the barbaric attack  perpetrated by a terrorist in Manchester, United Kingdom.   Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution's condemnation of this  terrorist attack for the depraved, cowardly act that it is.   Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of the  victims.   Moreover, our heartfelt appreciation goes out to the first responders  and others who selflessly came to the aid of those affected by this  act.   Manchester will emerge from the attack more vibrant and united than  ever before with the same resiliency that has enabled it to grow and  evolve from the ``birthplace of the Industrial Revolution'' to the  modern, progressive, and welcoming metropolis that it is today.   As Manchester recovers and responds, I hope that Mancunians and  Britons as a whole will take comfort in the knowledge that the people  of the United States stand in solidarity with them.   This attack is a reminder of the common danger that democratic,  peace-loving nations of the world face from those who reject the norms  of civilized society and abuse the liberties and freedoms afforded them  by free societies.   This terrorist attack in Manchester was a horrific act on innocent  civilians perpetrated by a depraved individual who had the support of  those who misuse the peaceful religion of Islam for their own misguided  purposes.   Those who claim responsibility for this crime against humanity should  make no mistake; they will be held accountable for their actions.   Today, however, our thoughts and prayers are with the people of  Manchester, a city that represents everything terrorists despise--that  is, a place that welcomes people from all walks of life to live  together in harmony.   That symbol is recognizable to Americans, because we are a society  formed by diverse individuals intertwined to create a mosaic that is  altogether lovely, strong, and unique.   Given our special relationship with the United Kingdom, the people of  the United States of America offer our unwavering support to the people  of Manchester and of the United Kingdom.   Today, I ask a moment of silence for the victims killed and injured  in the terrorist attack in Manchester.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 355, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________
