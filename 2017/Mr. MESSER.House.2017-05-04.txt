 Mr. Speaker, despite the rhetoric on the other side of  the aisle, today is an exciting day for those of us who have been  working and fighting to end ObamaCare's reign over this country.   It is race month in Indiana, and I want to remind my colleagues that,  as exciting as today is, today's vote is a green flag, not a checkered  flag. It is the beginning of the race, not the end.   Today, the House will vote to move legislation forward that will  repeal ObamaCare and replace it with something far better. The bill  will surely undergo more changes as we continue this process in the  Senate, but it is on its way to the finish line.   There are some really strong policies in this bill. It cut taxes by a  trillion dollars on the American people, and government spending by  hundreds of billions, too. Despite the rhetoric, it keeps preexisting  condition prohibitions. No one with a preexisting condition will be  denied coverage because of the policies in this bill. Insurance  companies cannot raise premiums on individuals with preexisting  conditions as long as they maintain coverage.   The bill will also make sure 26-year-olds continue to stay on their  parents' healthcare plans as they enter the workforce. Most  importantly, though, the bill unshackles American families from the  mandates, taxes, and penalties that are costing these families  thousands of dollars each year.   Though ObamaCare helped some, we have to remember that ObamaCare made  things worse for millions of America, and that is where the national  anger has come from. I have heard from countless Hoosiers who tell me  the stories of their premiums going from $500 a month to $1,500 a  month, with deductibles that are through the roof, at $10,000-plus a  month. They have to spend $30,000 out of pocket before they even get to  their insurance. For a middle class family, that means they have no  meaningful insurance at all.   We can do better, and we will. That starts today.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  National Rural Health Association opposed to this bill.                [From the National Rural Health Association]                  Vote NO to the American Health Care Act         The National Rural Health Association urges a NO vote on       the American Health Care Act (AHCA).        Rural Americans are older, poorer and sicker than other       populations. In fact, a January 2017 CDC report pronounced       that life expectancies for rural Americans have declined and       the top five chronic diseases are worse in rural America. The       AHCA does nothing to improve the health care crisis in rural       America, and will lead to poorer rural health outcomes, more       uninsured and an increase in the rural hospital closure       crisis.        Though some provisions in the modified AHCA bill improve       the base bill, NRHA is concerned that the bill still falls       woefully short in making health care affordable and       accessible to rural Americans. For example, the modified bill       contains a decrease in the Medical Expense Deduction       threshold from 10% to 5.8% in an attempt to assist Americans       between the ages of 50 and 64 who would see their premiums       skyrocket under the current plan. However, this deduction is       not a credit and therefore would be of little use to low       income seniors that are in very low tax brackets or do not       pay income tax at all. Additionally, the new amendments to       freeze Medicaid expansion enrollment as of Jan. 1, 2018, and       reduce the Medicaid per-capita growth rate will       disproportionately harm rural Americans.        The AHCA will hurt vulnerable populations in rural       Americans, leaving millions of the sickest, most underserved       populations in our nation without coverage, and further       escalating the rural hospital closure crisis. According to       the Wall Street Journal, the ``GOP health plan would hit       rural areas hard . . . Poor, older Americans would see the       largest increase in insurance-coverage costs.'' The LA Times       reports ``Americans who swept President Trump to victory--      lower-income, older voters in conservative, rural parts of       the country--stand to lose the most in federal healthcare aid       under a Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable       Care Act.'' Let's be clear--many provisions in the ACA failed       rural America. The lack of plan competition in rural markets,       exorbitant premiums, deductibles and co-pays, the co-op       collapses, lack of Medicaid expansion, and devastating       Medicare cuts to rural providers--all collided to create a       health care crisis in rural America. However, it's beyond       frustrating that an opportunity to fix these problems is       squandered, and instead, a greater health care crisis will be       created in rural America.        Congress has long recognized the importance of the rural       health care safety net and has steadfastly worked to protect       it. And now, much of the protections created to maintain       access to care for the 62 million who live in rural America       are in jeopardy. We implore Congress to continue its fight to       protect rural patients' access to care. Three improvements       are critical for rural patients and providers:        1. Medicaid--Though most rural residents are in non-      expansion states, a higher proportion of rural residents are       covered by Medicaid (21% vs. 16%).        Congress and the states have long recognized that rural is       different and thus requires different programs to succeed.       Rural payment programs for hospitals and providers are not       `bonus' payments, but rather alternative, cost-effective and       targeted payment formulas that maintain access to care for       millions of rural patients and financial stability for       thousands of rural providers across the country. Any federal       health care reform must protect a state's ability to protect       its rural safety net providers. The federal government must       not abdicate its moral, legal, and financial responsibilities       to rural, Medicaid eligible populations by ensuring access to       care.        Any federal health care reform proposal must protect access       to care in Rural America, and must provide an option to a       state to receive an enhanced reimbursement included in a       matching rate or a per capita cap, specifically targeted to       create stability among rural providers to maintain access to       care for rural communities. Enhancements must be equivalent       to the cost of providing care for rural safety net providers,       a safeguard that ensures the enhanced reimbursement is       provided to the safety net provider to allow for continued       access to care. Rural safety net providers include, but not       limited to, Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Prospective       Payment Hospitals, Rural Health Clinics, Indian Health.       Service providers, and individual rural providers.        2. Market Reform--Forty-one percent of rural marketplace       enrollees have only a single option of insurer, representing       70 percent of counties that have only one option. This lack       of competition in the marketplace means higher premiums.       Rural residents average per month cost exceeds urban ($569.34       for small town rural vs. $415.85 for metropolitan).        Rural Americans are more likely to have obesity, diabetes,       cancer, and traumatic injury; they are more likely to       participate in high risk health behaviors including smoking,       poor diet, physical inactivity, and substance abuse. Rural       Americans are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured and       less likely to receive employer sponsored health insurance.       Rural communities have fewer health care providers for       insurers to contract with to provide an adequate network to       serve the community.        Any federal health care reform proposal must address the       fact that insurance providers are withdrawing from rural       markets. Despite record profit levels, insurance companies       are permitted to cherry pick profitable markets for       participation and are currently not obliged to provide       service to markets with less advantageous risk pools.       Demographic realities of the rural population make the market       less profitable, and thus less desirable for an insurance       company with no incentive to take on such exposure. In the       same way that financial service institutions are required to       provide services to underserved neighborhoods, profitable       insurance companies should be required to provide services in       underserved communities.        3. Stop Bad Debt Cuts to Rural Hospitals--Rural hospitals       serve more Medicare patients (46% rural vs. 40.9% urban),       thus across-the-board Medicare cuts do not have across the       board impacts. A goal of the ACA was to have hospital bad       debt decrease significantly. However, because of unaffordable       health plans in rural areas, rural patients still cannot       afford health care. Bad debt among rural hospitals has       actually increased 50% since the ACA was passed. According to       MedPAC ``Average Medicare margins are negative, and under       current law they are expected to decline in 2016'' has led to       7% gains in median profit margins for urban providers while       rural providers have experienced a median loss of 6%.        If Congress does not act, all the decades of efforts to       protect rural patients' access to care, could rapidly be       undone. The National Rural Health Association implores       Congress to act now to protect rural health care across the       nation.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  American Thoracic Society opposed to this bill.                                      American Thoracic Society,                                                     April 27, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 16,000 members of the       American Thoracic Society (ATS), I want to voice my grave       concerns with the latest legislative proposal developed to       repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA). While CBO       estimates are not yet available for the most recent       legislation proposal being considered in the House, we remain       concerned that the bill, if enacted, will result in a loss of       health insurance for millions of Americans. Should the       proposal come up for a vote in the near future, we urge you       to vote ``NO'' on the American Health Care Act.        The ATS opposes any legislation that does not ensure       affordable health insurance coverage for Americans currently       insured under  [[Page H4131]]       the ACA. We are concerned that allowing states to waive       important insurance reforms in the Affordable Care Act will       lead to reduced coverage for many Americans and significant       price increases for patients with pre-existing conditions.       Further, we are concerned that reliance on ``high risk       pools'' will not adequately meet the health insurance needs       of many Americans with pre-existing conditions. We note that       previous attempts at implementing state-based high risk pools       have been largely unsuccessful. Members of the ATS serve a       large and diverse patient population, including patients with       respiratory diseases, critical illnesses and sleep disorders       such as asthma, COPD, pneumonia, sepsis and obstructive sleep       apnea. Our patients cannot afford to lose affordable health       insurance coverage for any period of time.        The ATS looks forward to working with Congress to improve       our health care system and ensure health insurance coverage       for all Americans. If you have questions or need additional       information, please contact Nuala S. Moore, Associate       Director of Government Relations.            Sincerely,                                              David Gozal, MD, MBA,                                                         President.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics opposed to this bill.                                                Academy of Nutrition                                                   and Dietetics,                                        Washington, DC, May 2, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: Nutrition services       save money, improve chronic disease outcomes and save lives.       For this reason, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the       nation's largest organization of food and nutrition       professionals, remains opposed to H.R. 1628, the American       Health Care Act (AHCA) as amended by the MacArthur amendment.        The Academy and our 75,000-plus members believe that all       Americans should have both coverage and access to high-      quality health care. The Academy urges Congress to support       measures that include nutrition services and prevention that       reduces the cost of health care and improve patients' lives.        The new proposal set forth in the AHCA not only fails to       improve the health of all Americans, but it will worsen       patient care and public health by removing vital resources       that are currently effective in improving health across the       country.        This legislation continues to eliminate investments in       prevention and public health, reverse advancements made in       disease prevention and chronic care management, and according       to the Congressional Budget Office, would result in the loss       of health care coverage for at least 24 million Americans       Allowing states to waive pre-existing conditions and       essential health benefits will lead to decreased coverage and       utilization of vital nutrition services.        Individuals with chronic disease such as diabetes and       hypertension benefit from medical nutrition therapy and       nutrition services to lower their blood sugar and blood       pressure, while reducing reliance on expensive medications.       The cost of these services is inexpensive and replaces more       costly interventions that are necessary as chronic disease       progresses with many complications.        The Academy holds five key tenets for analyzing any       legislation to reform health care:        1. The health of all Americans should improve as a result       of our health policy choices. Sufficient resources must be       made available to ensure optimal health.        2. Access to quality health care is a right that must be       extended to all Americans.        3. Nutrition services, from pre-conception through end of       life, are an essential component of comprehensive health       care.        4. Stable, sufficient and reliable funding is necessary for       our health care system to provide everyone access to a core       package of benefits.        5. Health care must be patient-centered.        Affordable access to care is an ongoing challenge that any       reform legislation should address. Although this legislation       purports to provide access, it fails to make coverage more       affordable; unaffordable access to coverage is really not       coverage at all. The proposal fails to maintain a core       package of benefits that improve the health of Americans, by       removing a basic floor of services that should be provided       without cost-sharing to the Medicaid population.        Additionally, the new proposal would allow states to opt       out of requiring that health plans cover the Essential Health       Benefits which help reduce longer term health care costs,       allow insurers to charge people higher premiums based on pre-      existing conditions like nutrition related diseases like       diabetes and heart disease and increase out-of-pocket costs       for vulnerable older adults.        By repealing the Prevention and Public Health Fund, the       proposal eliminates the sole federal investment in       prevention, which will harm our state and local communities       that depend on these effective public-private partnerships to       improve the health of their communities.        The AHCA as currently drafted fails to meet the Academy's       five tenets, and therefore we cannot support the passage of       these proposals.        The Academy urges Congress to not hold future votes without       an evaluation of the proposed amendments from the       Congressional Budget Office estimating the budgetary impact       of the amended legislation and the anticipated effect on       coverage for Americans. We look forward to continued       collaboration to improve the health and nutrition for all       Americans.            Sincerely,                                                   Lucille Beseler,                                                         President.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from The  Jewish Federations of North America opposed to this bill.                                              The Jewish Federations                                                of North America,                                        Washington, DC, May 2, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The Jewish Federations       of North America (JFNA) remains staunchly opposed to the       American Health Care Act of 2017 (AHCA), even with the       recently released amendment proposed by Representative Tom       MacArthur (R-NJ). We are disappointed that AHCA retains the       devastating cuts to Medicaid included in the earlier version       of the legislation, cuts which are the result of the       legislation's proposal to dramatically restructure Medicaid's       federal financing structure and roll back coverage for 14       million people covered by the state Medicaid expansions. The       amendment does nothing to alleviate these concerns.        JFNA represents 148 Jewish federations and 300 network       communities that together support 15 leading academic medical       centers/health systems, 100 Jewish nursing homes, and 125       Jewish family & children's agencies, providing health care       for more than one million clients, Jewish and non-Jewish       alike. Medicaid is a lifeline for more than 80 million       people, including low-income children, older adults, and       people with disabilities nationwide. Medicaid is a vital       program for Jewish federations throughout the country and       particularly for our communal health and long-term care       partners that care for the most vulnerable in our       communities.        JFNA is deeply troubled by the findings of the       Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that AHCA will cause $839       billion in reductions--about 25 percent--to federal Medicaid       funding and a loss in coverage for more than 14 million       Medicaid beneficiaries. We believe that converting Medicaid       to a block grant or per capita cap will cause irreparable       harm not only to the millions who depend on the program, but       also to our large network of providers who care for them.        AHCA would convert the long-standing and fundamental       federal-state partnership of the Medicaid program to a block       grant or per capita cap system. Under either approach, states       would receive a limited amount of federal money for their       Medicaid programs. As CBO found, even under a per capita cap       system, the federal share is lower than the average annual       increase in Medicaid spending and will not be sufficiently       flexible to address a variety of key factors affecting       Medicaid spending, including major disasters, economic       downturns, unexpected health care cost increases, and       demographic changes, such as the rapidly aging baby boomer       generation. CBO projected that AHCA's $839 billion cut in       federal Medicaid funding will shift substantial costs to       state and local governments, our providers, and our patients,       thus exacerbating the existing strain on the program. We       agree with CBO's conclusion that, due to these reductions in       funding, states will be left with no choice but to reduce       Medicaid enrollment, eligibility for Medicaid benefits, and       payment rates. Many people who now qualify for Medicaid could       end up uninsured or losing access to critical health and       long-term care services.        JFNA is concerned by many of the unintended consequences of       this legislation, such as:        People who desperately need Medicaid and who are currently       eligible will become uninsured;        States will be forced to cut back on crucial Medicaid       services, such as home and community-based services,       effectively forcing people who are capable of living in the       community with proper home and community-based services into       nursing homes;        States will be forced to reduce already low provider       payment rates, thus further decreasing the pool of providers       serving Medicaid beneficiaries and increasing waiting times       for services; and,        Health care providers and entities that care for these       vulnerable populations will suffer additional financial       strain. As a result, these agencies will be forced to lay off       staff or close their doors altogether, resulting in       significant job losses and further hurting state economies.        For these reasons, we must oppose the legislation as       currently written and urge the House of Representatives to       reconsider moving forward with it. We stand ready to work       with you, in tandem with our Jewish communal health and long-      term care providers, to promote more targeted ways to reduce       Medicaid spending and develop a new framework of policies to       improve Medicaid quality, efficiency, and sustainability.            Sincerely,      William C. Daroff,  [[Page H4132]]         Senior Vice President for Public Policy & Director of the       Washington Office.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article in The  Wall Street Journal today stating: ``. . . employers looking to lower  their costs could impose lifetime limits and eliminate the out-of- pocket cost cap from their plans under the GOP legislation.''                       [From the Wall Street Journal]    Little-Noted Provision of GOP Health Bill Could Alter Employer Plans       Last-minute amendment would allow states to obtain waivers from                  certain Affordable Care Act requirements                 (By Stephanie Armour and Michelle Hackman)         Many people who obtain health insurance through their       employers--about half of the country--could be at risk of       losing protections that limit out-of-pocket costs for       catastrophic illnesses, due to a little-noticed provision of       the House Republican health-care bill to be considered       Thursday, health-policy experts say.        The provision, part of a last-minute amendment, lets states       obtain waivers from certain Affordable Care Act insurance       regulations. Insurers in states that obtain the waivers could       be freed from a regulation mandating that they cover 10       particular types of health services, among them maternity       care, prescription drugs, mental health treatment and       hospitalization.        That could also affect plans offered by large employers,       health analysts said.        The ACA prevents employer plans from putting annual limits       on the amount of care they will cover, and it bars lifetime       limits on the 10 essential benefits. But in 2011, the Obama       administration issued guidance stating that employers aren't       bound by the benefits mandated by their state and can pick       from another state's list of required benefits. That guidance       was mostly meaningless because the ACA established a national       set of essential benefits.        Under the House bill, large employers could choose the       benefit requirements from any state--including those that are       allowed to lower their benchmarks under a waiver, health       analysts said. By choosing a waiver state, employers looking       to lower their costs could impose lifetime limits and       eliminate the out-of-pocket cost cap from their plans under       the GOP legislation.        The measure would give employers added flexibility to take       steps that could lower costs by limiting more-expensive       coverage areas. And it would lessen the federal regulation of       insurers, a goal of GOP lawmakers who believe the ACA is an       example of government overreach.        The impact on employer plans expands the scope of the       health bill to affect, potentially, everyone not insured by       Medicare or small-business plans, since the bill also       includes cuts to Medicaid and changes to the individual       market. Employer health plans are the single largest source       of health insurance in the country, with about 159 million       Americans receiving coverage through their jobs.        ``It's huge,'' said Andy Slavitt, former acting       administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid       Services under President Barack Obama. ``They're creating a       backdoor way to gut employer plans, too.''        But some experts say the impact could be less.        ``The real question is, would employers do this? Many       wouldn't,'' said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the       Kaiser Family Foundation. ``Many employers offer quality       benefits to attract employees. But employers are always       looking for ways to lower costs.''        Fifty-nine percent of employers had a lifetime limit on how       much their insurance plans would cover before the ACA, Mr.       Levitt said.        The potential impact on large-employer plans was picked up       on by health analysts including Matthew Fiedler, a fellow at       the Brookings Institution. It is possible the Trump       administration could minimize the impact by barring employers       from picking plans across state lines, he said, but there is       no sign that that would occur.        ``The core goal of insurance is to ensure that people are       protected if the worst happens, and these protections are       crucial to achieving that goal,'' Mr. Fiedler said.        Potentially, the new provision could play out this way: If       a state did away with a requirement to provide mental health       and substance abuse services, employer plans using that       benchmark could impose lifetime caps on the amount of mental       health coverage they are willing to pay for.        One trade group representing employers said the amendment's       effects on people with employer-sponsored health coverage       would be minimal. Most large employers didn't impose annual       or lifetime limits before the ACA was implemented, according       to James Gelfand, senior vice president of health policy at       the Erisa Industry Committee.        ``Even if self-insured health plans are no longer banned       from imposing annual or lifetime limits, they're unlikely to       attempt to squeeze the toothpaste back into the tube,'' he       said. ``The benefits of reimposing limits are questionable.''
