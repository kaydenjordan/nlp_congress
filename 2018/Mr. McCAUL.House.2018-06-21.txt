 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today because we finally have the opportunity to  secure our borders once and for all.  [[Page H5429]]    Before coming to Congress, I was a counterterrorism prosecutor in the  Justice Department. I saw the threats along our border firsthand.   After getting elected to the House, the very first bill I introduced  put an end to this catch-and-release system. Here we are in this  Chamber 14 years later, and I am still fighting for it.   Doing nothing should not be an option. As I have said before, it is  time for Congress to act. Today, we have an historic opportunity to fix  this problem once and for all with the Securing America's Future Act.   Our legislation delivers on the President's four pillars, which I  worked closely with him on. It secures the border by building a wall,  ends chain migration and the diversity lottery, provides a rational  DACA solution, and also deploys new technology and adds boots on the  ground.   We must move toward a moral, merit-based system and not a random  system.   This legislation also provides, Mr. Speaker, a legal solution that  will keep families together when they cross the border illegally.   Our bill brings a generational change that prevents us from  revisiting these problems down the road.   But this isn't just about closing loopholes and fixing broken laws.  Border security is a national security issue. Violent gangs like MS-13,  human traffickers and smugglers sneaking into our country infect our  neighborhoods, and too many lives are at risk, and opioids come across  the border.   Unfortunately, the threats do not stop there. We know that  international terrorists are trying to exploit our border. This was  made clear from the materials found in bin Laden's compound and from  propaganda outlets like Inspire magazine. The 9/11 Commission report  even stated that predecessors to al-Qaida had been exploiting  weaknesses in our border security since the 1990s.   In April, Secretary Nielsen testified that ISIS has encouraged its  followers to cross our southwest border, given the loopholes that they  are also aware of. We must solve this problem, and we must solve it  today.   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and give  the American people the security that they have long demanded and  deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to gentlewoman from  Arizona (Ms. McSally), the chair of the Subcommittee on Border and  Maritime Security.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Higgins), a member of the Homeland Security Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Estes), a member of the Homeland Security Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), the newest member of the Homeland Security  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me say, this is a historic opportunity to get something done that  we probably haven't gotten done in 25 years. But let me first say that  I am a father of five children.   I have been down to the detention centers and seen these kids down  there, these babies. From a human standpoint, it is one of the most  horrible experiences I have had in my lifetime.   Let me say this, Mr. Speaker: this bill protects our children. It  protects our children because it provides a deterrent for them not to  come here in the first place. It also keeps families together and  doesn't separate them, as current law dictates. Current law dictates  this, if we don't change the law.   Let me also add, I talked to the Secretary today and 10,000 of these  12,000 children who are in the detention centers came without their  parents. And  [[Page H5431]]  who were their guardians: the drug traffickers, the smugglers, and the  coyotes, as they made the dangerous journey from Central America all  the way up through Mexico and into the United States.                                time  1330    I have seen horrors of that, and this bill will provide the  deterrence to stop that from happening because, as we know, they are  abused on the way up that journey. They are abused physically and  sexually and demoralized and recruited. That has to stop, and, Mr.  Speaker, this bill will stop that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of talk about children. I am the  father of five children. This bill will keep families together, not  separated, as exists under current law. This bill changes that law so  that the Department of Homeland Security can keep family units  together.   I talked to the Secretary today. She told me there were 12,000  children in these detention centers. I think it is important that we be  transparent with the American people about the facts.   Ten thousand of these children did not come in with their parents.  Ten thousand of these children made the dangerous journey through  Central America, through Mexico, and up into the United States with  their guardian being the coyote, the human smuggler, the human  trafficker. During the dangerous journey, many of them were abused and  exploited on the way.   I have been to the detention centers, and it is heartbreaking to see  these kids. This bill provides a deterrent to stop this.   In sum, Mr. Speaker, this bill protects the children. I was a Federal  prosecutor in Texas. I saw the threats coming from the United States  southern border: the drug traffickers; the human traffickers; the MS- 13; the opioids we have been talking about all week, precursors coming  from China into Mexico, bringing heroin and opioids into the United  States, killing thousands of Americans; the violence and the  destruction. That is why we need a secure border.   We have been talking about this for a long time on both sides of the  aisle. Hillary Clinton talked about: ``We need a secure border.''  Barack Obama talked about: ``We need a secure border.'' Now we have a  President who I think is serious about securing our border.   This bill does many things, but it sticks to the four pillars we  talked about in the White House: border security, by building a wall  barrier system, technology, and personnel; the visa lottery system, a  random lottery system, to be more merit based to bring in talent rather  than a random system; chain migration is reduced so that it is not just  based on family but rather on merit; and then, finally, we provide the  solution for DACA. We legalize the DACA kids. We give them legal status  to stay in the United States.   I don't understand why my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  can't support that.   But what I want to talk about is my role as chairman of Homeland  Security, why I think this border protection is so important. This is a  map of special-interest aliens' pathway into the United States. Two  thousand special-interest aliens are apprehended trying to make their  way into the United States every year. Special interest means special- interest countries, coming from the Middle East, from Africa, terror  hotspots, coming into our hemisphere and going up into the United  States.   The 9/11 Commission talked about this. They said: ``Before 9/11, no  agency of the U.S. Government systematically analyzed terrorists'  travel strategies. Had they done so, they could have discovered the  ways in which the terrorist predecessors to al-Qaida had been  systematically but detectably exploiting weaknesses in our border  security since the early 1990s.''   Just recently, Secretary Nielsen testified and said: ``We have also  seen ISIS, in written materials, encourage ISIS followers to cross our  southwest border, given the loopholes that they are aware of.''   We heard from Rear Admiral Hendrickson, the U.S. Southern Command  admiral, who said: ``Some of these people''--attempting to cross our  borders--``have ties to terrorism, and some have intentions to conduct  attacks in the homeland.''   Then a recently declassified CIA report written in 2003 says:  Specific information at the time demonstrates al-Qaida's ``ongoing  interest to enter the United States over land borders with Mexico and  Canada.''   And then the CIA reported: ``Bin Laden apparently sought operatives  with valid Mexican passports.''   The Secretary went on to say: `` . . . we are identifying and  stopping terror suspects who would otherwise have gone undetected. In  fact, on average, my department now blocks 10 known or suspected  terrorists a day''--not a year--``from traveling to or attempting to  enter the United States.''   I think it is time we get this done. It is my last year as chairman  of this committee, and I want to end it with providing the American  people the security that they deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I know this is an emotional topic, and I think both sides  have what they think are the best interests of the American people in  their hearts. I feel that the Constitution drives me to protect the  American people, and that is my most solemn, highest responsibility.   I want to close with a quote from our Secretary of Homeland Security.  She said: ``The only people who benefit from the immigration system  right now are the smugglers, the traffickers, those who are peddling  drugs, and terrorists. So let's fix the system.''   Mr. Speaker, I agree with her. Let's fix the system. Let's protect  the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
