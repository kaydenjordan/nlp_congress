 Mr. President, I again thank the chairman for his  leadership. It has been critical, as has been demonstrated throughout  the process during our subcommittee hearings and our committee  hearings, but even before that, the chairman insisted upon hearings  that were comprehensive so, as we prepared for this NDAA, we had a  sense of the threats we faced, the resources we needed, and, as a  result, as the chairman pointed out, we were able to send to the floor,  with a unanimous vote, a very strong defense bill.   Since that time, working together, we have been able to incorporate  over 100 amendments which improve the bill. As the chairman pointed  out, we are still working on issues we hope we can bring forward for  either adoption or, through debate, a vote, and I hope we can do that.  Again, as the chairman pointed out, this is a rare instance of regular  order--of the committee report coming to the floor, moving to it by a  strong vote, taking up and working to get amendments that are not  controversial into the package, and then going ahead and, we hope,  setting up debate, discussion, and votes on more difficult and  challenging issues. I was encouraged by Senator Schumer's comment that  we can anticipate a date for final passage of this bill.   We are confident we will have a national defense bill leaving the  Senate and going to conference now. The final outline of that bill is  still to be determined, and I hope we can add more to it. That is a  very principled process of talking back-and-forth.   Again, I don't think any of this would have been done without the  leadership of the chairman and his insistence that we adhere not only  to regular order but that we don't forget this is ultimately about the  men and women who serve us overseas.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Rhode Island, my dear  friend, Jack Reed, is too kind. It takes two to tango. The partnership  we have developed over the years has made it possible for us to get to  the place we have in the past and we are today. He has not only my  gratitude but that of the men and women who are serving because of his  advocacy and his leadership.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    I thank the chairman.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.    I thank the chairman.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.    I thank the chairman.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators  Portman and Warner be added as cosponsors to the Reed amendment No.  939, relating to a strategy for countering malign Russian influence.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I would like to turn to discuss my amendment  to counter malign Russian influence.   Amendment No. 939, sponsored by Senators McCain, Portman, Cardin,  Brown, Warner, Whitehouse, Durbin, and myself, would advance U.S.  national security interests by requiring the President to submit to  Congress a strategy for countering the threat of Russia's influence  activities intended to undermine democracy in the United States,  Europe, and across the world and to disrupt the global international  order.   The amendment would require the President to provide Congress a  strategy that is comprehensive, using every tool at our disposal to  counter Russia's malign activities. The strategy would direct actions  across the whole of government, including the following areas: security  measures, the strategy would include actions to counter Russian hybrid  warfare operations, building the capabilities of allies and partners to  identify, attribute, and respond to Russian malign activities, short of  conflict, and supporting the NATO alliance  [[Page S5716]]  and other security partnerships against Russian aggression; on  information operations--the strategy would seek to counter Russia's use  of disinformation and propaganda in social media as well as traditional  media and to strengthen interagency mechanisms for coordinating and  effectively implementing a whole-of-government response to Russian  active measures; in the area of cyber, the strategy would require steps  to defend against, deter, and when necessary respond to malicious cyber  activities by the Kremlin, including the use of offensive cyber  capabilities consistent with policies specified elsewhere in the act;  in the political and diplomatic arenas, the strategy would be required  to set out actions to enhance the resilience of U.S. democratic  institutions and infrastructure and to work with countries vulnerable  to malign Russian influence to promote good governance and strengthen  democracy abroad; in the area of financial measures, the strategy would  address the corrupt and illicit Russian financial networks in the  United States and abroad that have facilitated and Russia's malign  influence; and finally, on energy security, the strategy would include  steps to promote the energy security of our European allies and  partners, reducing Russia's ability to use energy dependence as a  weapon of coercion or influence.   The amendment would also require that the administration's strategy  be consistent with prior legislation relating to Russia's malign  activities, including the Russian Sanctions Act that recently passed  with overwhelming support in Congress; the Ukraine Freedom Support Act  of 2014, and the Magnitsky Act of 2012. This amendment would fill an  important gap in our current approach to relations with Russia. To  date, the Trump administration has been unwilling, for whatever reason,  to articulate and implement an appropriate response to the threat to  our democratic institutions and security posed by Russia's malign  influence activities. This amendment would address this critical  national security requirement.   It is both appropriate and critically important that this requirement  for a strategy to counter Russian malign influence be amended to the  National Defense Authorization Act because ultimately this is  fundamentally an issue of national security. The administration's  failure to acknowledge the insidious interference by Vladimir Putin and  his cronies for what it really is--an attack by a foreign adversary on  Western democracies and the institutions underpinning the global  order--has real implications to our national security. The  administration's lack of action to counter this malign influence only  encourages the Kremlin to continue its aggression against the United  States and its allies and partners.   The Russians know they cannot win in a conventional war, so they have  adapted their tactics asymmetrically to leverage their strengths. These  tactics pose a real threat, and we need to appropriately posture  ourselves, using all tools of statecraft, to counter Russian malign  influence.   Before President Obama left office, he ordered an intelligence review  of Russian interference in U.S. elections.   On January 6, the U.S. intelligence community released a report on  its findings on Russian interference in our democracy. This report  included the consensus view of all 17 intelligence agencies, including  the CIA, the National Security Agency, the FBI, and the Office of the  Director of National Intelligence. Among the key findings were  President Putin ``ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the  U.S. presidential election''; ``Russia's goals were to undermine public  faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and  harm her electability and potential presidency''; ``Russia's influence  campaign was multifaceted, combining old-fashion Russian propaganda  techniques with cyber espionage against U.S. political organizations  and mass disclosure of government and private data:; ``Russian  intelligence obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple US  state or local electoral boards''; and ``Russia's state-run propaganda  machine contributed to the influence campaign by serving as a platform  for Kremlin messaging to Russian and international audiences.''   These findings were made public on January 6--over 8 months ago--with  the additional warning from our intelligence experts that ``Moscow will  apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the US  presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including  against US allies and their election processes.''   Furthermore, with each passing week more evidence comes to light  about the depths to which the Kremlin went to interfere with our  democracy.   Just last week, we learned that a Kremlin-linked troll factory bought  $100,000 worth of Facebook ads which were further disseminated through  bot networks as part of Russia's attempt to influence our 2016  Presidential election. The ads traced back to 470 fake accounts and  pages on Facebook and mostly focused on pushing politically divisive  issues such as gun rights, immigration, LBGT rights, and racial  discrimination. Further reporting by the New York Times laid out in  lurid detail how these fake accounts amplified other tactics of Russian  malign influence and ginned up web traffic to DCLeaks--the site where  Russian military intelligence first posted hacked emails.   The New York Times also reported that hundreds or thousands of fake  Twitter accounts regularly posted anti-Clinton messages and used  Twitter to draw attention to hacked materials during last year's  campaign. Cybersecurity firm Fireye concluded that many of these  Twitter accounts were associated with one another and linked back to  Russian military intelligence.   This is just one tactic of influence that Russia is using as part of  the wide ranging campaign it is waging against us.   Again and again, Russia has used the range of coercive tools at its  disposal--including political pressure; economic manipulation;  collaboration with corrupt local networks; propaganda, deception and  denials; and, increasingly, military force--to try to intimidate  democratic countries and undermine the further integration of NATO, the  European Union, and other Western institutions.   It is clear that we need a strategy and we need it soon; yet what is  surprising and disturbing is that the White House has failed to direct  that a plan be developed to counter this Russian malign threat and to  prepare our country for renewed Russian interference in the upcoming  2018 and 2020 elections. Time is running out.   We are now 8 months into the Trump administration.   During this time, numerous administration officials have publicly  reinforced the findings of the intelligence community's January  assessment of the threat posed by Russia's malign influence activities.   On May 11, Director of Central Intelligence Mike Pompeo said he hoped  that we learn from Russian activity in the 2016 election and be able to  more effectively defeat it.   On May 14, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said, ``I don't think  there's any question that the Russians were playing around in our  electoral processes.''   On May 23, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats stated,  ``There clearly is a consensus that Russia has meddled in our election  process . . . Russia's always been doing these kind of things with  influence campaigns but they're doing it much more sophisticated  through the use of cyber and other techniques than they did before.''   On June 13, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis stated, ``We're  recognizing the strategic threat that Russia is provided by its  misbehavior.''   On July 9, 2017, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley stated, ``Everybody  knows that [the Russians] are not just meddling in the United States'  election. They're doing this across multiple continents, and they're  doing this in a way that they're trying to cause chaos within the  countries.''   On August 5, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster described the  threat from Russia ``as a very sophisticated campaign of subversion and  disinformation and--and propaganda that is ongoing every day in an  effort to break apart Europe and to pit political groups against each  other to sow dissension . . . and conspiracy theories.''   Yet, despite the assessment from the intelligence community and these  acknowledgements from the President's  [[Page S5717]]  own national security team that Russian malign influence and  interference in our 2016 election and the elections of our close allies  in Europe pose a national security threat, the President has yet to  direct that actions be taken to counter Russian malign influence. As  far as we know, the Oval Office has not ordered the national security  team even to formulate a strategy to address these pressing threats  from Putin and his cronies. Time is running out.   In fact, 8 months in, and despite the assessments of his Cabinet, the  President can't even clearly admit that the threat is coming from  Russia.   On January 11, President Trump stated, ``As far as hacking, I think  it was Russia. But I think we also get hacked by other countries and  other people.''   On April 30, President Trump said, ``It's very hard to say who did  the hacking . . . I'll go along with Russia. Could've been China,  could've been a lot of different groups.''   On May 11, President Trump said, ``If Russia or anybody else is  trying to interfere with our elections, I think it's a horrible thing  and I want to get to the bottom of it.''   On July 6, just prior to his meeting with President Putin, President  Trump said, ``It could have very well been Russia but it could well  have been other countries and I won't be specific but I think a lot of  people interfered. Nobody really knows. Nobody really knows for sure.''   Let's stop and think about that for a minute. ``No one really knows  for sure''? That this is even a question runs completely counter to the  informed assessments of the entire intelligence community and the  President's own national security team. It is time President Trump  admits what the rest of us know to be true.   We also know, from multiple administration officials' testimony to  Congress, that the President has not directed his Cabinet or senior  staff to work on a strategy.   On May 11, when our colleague and vice chairman of the Intelligence  Committee Senator Warner asked DNI Coats where we stand in terms of  preparation against a future Russian attack, he couldn't think of a  single thing. He replied, ``Relative to a grand [Russia] strategy, I am  not aware right now of any--I think we're still assessing the impact.''   On June 8, when our colleague Senator Heinrich asked whether the  President had inquired about what the FBI Director, our government, or  the intelligence community should be doing to protect America against  Russian interference in our election system, former FBI director James  Comey stated, ``I don't recall a conversation like that.''   When I asked Defense Secretary Mattis on June 13 whether the  President had directed him to begin intensive planning to protect our  electoral system against the next Russian cyber attack, he was not able  to point to any guidance indicating that the President recognizes the  urgency of the Russian threat or the necessity of preparing to counter  it next year during the midterm elections.   On June 21, officials from the Department of Homeland Security  testified that 21 States were potentially targeted by Russian  Government linked hackers in advance of the 2016 Presidential election.  When I asked these officials whether the President had directed them to  come up with a plan to protect our critical elections infrastructure,  they also responded no.   On June 28, Representative Sherman asked U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.  Nikki Haley whether she had even talked to the President about Russian  interference in the 2016 Presidential election. She replied that she  had not talked to the President about the subject.   On July 7, in a press conference at the G-8 summit after the  President's meeting with President Putin, Secretary of State Rex  Tillerson stated, ``I think the relationship [with Russia]--and the  President made this clear as well--is too important, and it's too  important not to find a way to move forward.''   It is long past the point where anyone can deny that Russia  interfered in our election and the elections of our allies and partners  in Europe. This should have been a priority on day 1.   We need to formulate a strategy and take action across the whole of  government to counter the threat from Russia.   We cannot just ignore this problem or sweep Kremlin attacks on our  elections and those of our close European allies under the rug and move  forward. We need a strategy to counter Russian malign influence that  leverages all our tools of power across the government.   Though President Trump may be unwilling to confront or condemn  Russian interference in our democracy, we in Congress have been willing  and able to take a stand to put pressure on Russia and push back  against Russian malign influence.   As you are all aware, we took an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 98-2  this summer and passed long-overdue Russian sanctions. That was an  important first step, but more must be done. We must act because the  Trump administration has refused.   I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Members from both sides  of the aisle in sponsoring this amendment. As former FBI director James  Comey said when he testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee,  ``It's not a Republican thing or Democratic thing. It really is an  American thing. They're going to come for whatever party they choose to  try and work on behalf of . . . They're just about their own advantage.  And they will be back.''   This amendment will ensure the administration does take appropriate  action. It will direct the President to formulate a comprehensive  strategy to ensure that, when Putin and his minions come back in 2018  and 2020, we will have appropriate measures in place to detect, deter,  and counter this serious threat to our democracy.   I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of this important and  necessary amendment.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.    Madam President, I want to join the chairman with respect  to noting the progress we have made with respect to 100 amendments.  They have been bipartisan. They have been carefully weighed by the  staff.   We are still continuing to work together to see if there are  additional amendments we can incorporate before we conclude this bill.  I think the amendments have strengthened the bill. I think it does  reflect the bipartisan effort.   Also, along with the chairman, we would have liked to have been able  to do more and have more debate, more votes, but at the end of the day,  we are going to have a national defense authorization bill that  responds to current threats, that responds to the stresses and demands  on our personnel across the globe, and also be well positioned to go  into conference and hopefully further improve this legislation in the  conference process.   Once again, I will say this is in large part the result of Chairman  McCain's leadership--creating an atmosphere of bipartisan cooperation,  of thoughtful debate, and doing it in a way that brings out the best in  all of us. I thank him for that.   Madam President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Senator from Wisconsin has pointed out  one of the shortcomings in this process, which is that we have not had  a series of amendments on the floor to vote on.   Through the chairman's leadership, we have, as he has indicated,  cleared 103 amendments on a bipartisan basis. We think we have  legislation that is important for the Nation, particularly for our men  and women in uniform.   Senator Baldwin raises an extremely important question. ``Buy  American'' is not only for the people we represent all across the  country but for the quality of goods and services that our men and  women in uniform will receive. I thank her, and I join with her in the  frustration of not having a vote, despite the progress we have made in  so many other areas. This is something that both the chairman and I  would like to see remedied in the next national defense debate on the  floor.   As the chairman pointed out, this will be an issue at conference. I  know Senator Baldwin will not cease her efforts. She has been  incredibly tenacious in pushing forward this ``Buy American'' provision  on behalf of her constituents and all of our constituents. I do, in  fact, support this provision, and I will work to my utmost to see that  we can move this issue forward. I appreciate very much the fact that it  will be considered in conference.   Again, I think we have done a lot over the last several days with the  leadership of Chairman McCain. I regret that we can't wrap up this  legislation with several votes on issues, which each side would like to  see, but I commit myself to work with the Senator from Wisconsin to see  if we can move this ``Buy American'' provision forward.    Mr. President, I yield back the time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.                                Cloture Motion    Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending  cloture motion, which the clerk will state.   The legislative clerk read as follows:                               Cloture Motion         We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the       provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate,       do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Senate amendment       No. 1003, as modified, to Calendar No. 175, H.R. 2810, an act       to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for military       activities of the Department of Defense, for military       construction, and for defense activities of the Department of       Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such       fiscal year, and for other purposes.          John McCain, Mitch McConnell, John Thune, Thom Tillis,             Pat Roberts, Mike Crapo, Richard Burr, Michael B. Enzi,             Orrin G. Hatch, Ted Cruz, John Cornyn, Dan Sullivan,             Roy Blunt, Cory Gardner, Tim Scott, Shelley Moore             Capito, David Perdue.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum  call has been waived.   The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on  amendment No. 1003, as modified, offered by the Senator from Arizona,  Mr. McCain, to H.R. 2810, shall be brought to a close?   The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.
