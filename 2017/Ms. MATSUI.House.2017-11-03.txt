 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3922.   Mr. Speaker, the uncertainty that we have created for our community  health clinics and their patients is unacceptable. Each day it is a new  threat. Most  [[Page H8462]]  of the year it has been TrumpCare's severe cuts to Medicaid, which  health centers and their patients rely upon. Today it is a lack of  extension of the critical grant funding. Tomorrow or the next week, we  will be back to ripping Medicaid away to pay for the Republican's tax  cuts.   We have always extended CHIP and community health center funding on a  bipartisan basis, but, unfortunately, the bill before us today is not  bipartisan. The Prevention Fund, which would be slashed in this bill,  funds programs that are critical to children and families who rely upon  CHIP and community health centers. Many times these programs are even  run out of our community health centers and could not exist without the  Prevention Fund. These are things like childhood asthma prevention,  vaccines, and lead abatement.   It often takes someone going above and beyond a simple doctor's visit  to provide families with the resources they need to stay healthy. We  need to invest in these services. We cannot strip this funding from  critical prevention programs that children and families rely on. We  cannot allow programs like Medicare and Medicaid to be attacked and  raided.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 3922.
