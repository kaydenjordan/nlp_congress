 Mr. Speaker, as this Chamber considers H.R. 1967, the  ``Bureau of Reclamation Pumped Storage Hydropower Development Act,'' I  would like to provide some brief remarks regarding issues raised by the  Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation.   The Colville Tribe has been participating in a Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission proceeding related a proposed pumped storage  project on Lake Roosevelt and Banks Lake in north central Washington. A  portion of Lake Roosevelt is within the boundaries of the Colville  Reservation.   The Colville Tribe has raised several questions about the project's  potential impacts to culturally and economically important fisheries in  Lake Roosevelt, water quality, and to revenues the Tribe receives from  the Bonneville Power Administration from the operation of the Grand  Coulee Dam.  [[Page H5211]]    Because of these questions, the Colville Tribe and the project  proponents have been involved in ongoing discussions in hopes of  reaching an agreement on how to proceed with the project review  process. As those discussions proceed, I would like to provide my  commitment to work with the Colville Tribe and the project proponents  as the legislative process moves forward.   Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS.

The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Cook) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 1967, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania  for his leadership on this important issue and for the opportunity to  address the House on this very important topic.   Mr. Speaker, as you have heard, our Nation is facing an epidemic.  Over the past two decades, opioid overdoses have quadrupled. Think  about that. They have quadrupled in the United States. My home State,  as Dr. Murphy has just mentioned, has faced significant increases in  drug overdose death rates, including a 70 percent increase in synthetic  opioid overdose deaths in just the last 10 years. It is clear that this  is a crisis, which is why we in Congress are committed to combating  this growing epidemic.   Late last year, Congress passed sweeping legislation, called the 21st  Century Cures Act. It was bipartisan legislation that authorized $6.3  billion in funding to bring our healthcare innovation infrastructure  into the 21st century. This legislation included $1 billion for opioid  intervention and prevention treatment programs throughout all 50  States. Earlier this spring, the Federal Government began awarding  grants in order to confront this crisis, including $11.7 million to the  State of Washington.   While these funds will help expand treatment options, there is still  much more work to be done at the Federal level, which is why I  cosponsored legislation like H.R. 1057, the Synthetics Trafficking and  Overdose Prevention, or STOP, Act. Designed to stop dangerous synthetic  drugs like fentanyl, which you heard about, and carfentanil from being  shipped through our borders, this legislation will combat bad actors  from China and India who have been taking advantage of weaknesses in  international mail security standards to break U.S. customs laws and  really wreak havoc on our communities.   This is just one step of the opioid crisis that we must address. We  need to combat the illicit drugs coming into this country as well as  equip doctors, nurses, and first responders with the resources they  need to treat pain appropriately.   We also need to support better access to care for individuals  suffering from psychiatric and substance abuse disorders. And, most  importantly, we must ensure these drugs are not falling into the hands  of our Nation's children.   My colleagues in Congress and I are committed to combating this  epidemic to keep it from causing further harm to our Nation's families  and communities.
