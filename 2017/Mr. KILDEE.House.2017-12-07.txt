 Mr. Speaker, Republicans continue to rush their tax scam  through Congress, raising taxes on tens of millions of people,  borrowing over $1 trillion, just to give massive tax breaks to the  people at the very top of the economy.   For the last 3 months since we passed the temporary spending bill,  what has been their focus?   Has it been to deal with the lack of reauthorization and full funding  for children's health? No.   Have they focused at all on the need to deal with the Dream Act and  those DREAMers who are here, knowing no other place than the United  States? Have they done anything on that? No.   They have an obsession about one thing: tax cuts for the wealthiest.   Have they done anything at all to deal with this opioid crisis? The  President talked about it, declared an emergency.   What have we seen from the other side? Nothing, except an obsession  to give tax breaks to the people at the top. For 3 months since we  passed that temporary spending bill, that has been the singular  obsession of the Republican majority.   That is not what the American people are looking for. That is not  what they sent us here to do. We should do the work of the American  people.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentlewoman, the  ranking member, for yielding, and I thank Mr. Woodall for his comments.  He and I have worked together on issues in the past. We worked together  to try to protect our solar manufacturers in this country, so there are  areas of agreement that we come to.   I think we also agree, I now hear, on this question of continuing  resolutions. We both don't like them. And I think we do have to keep in  mind that, today, we are 48 hours from the government closing, so I  won't address any other subject than that question and the process that  has led us to this moment where we are looking at another continuing  resolution for 2 weeks.    I won't address the Small Business Mergers, Acquisitions, Sales, and  Brokerage Simplification Act. While it may be an important piece of  legislation, it is difficult to forget what has brought us to this  moment where we are 48 hours from the government shutting down.   What is interesting to me about it is, it is true that the  Republicans hold the majority in this House and set the agenda here;  hold the majority in the Senate, set the agenda there. You have your  Republican President, the leader of your party, your leader, who sets  the agenda from the White House.   You have had the entire year to get a package of spending bills to  the floor and through to the President. And here we are, 2 days away  from a shutdown, because 2\1/2\ months ago, after nearly a year, the  process came to a halt, and this body had to approve a 2\1/2\ month  extension because we couldn't get the work done.   Now, instead of, over the last 2\1/2\ months, coming up with a full  plan to fund the government and provide the certainty and security that  the American people and our economy depend upon, after 2\1/2\ months,  the best we can do is promise the people of the country and our economy  14 more days.   I mean, why are we here?   In the last 2\1/2\ months, have we seen any action? No, not on  disaster relief for those places that are struggling through the worst  moments that they have experienced; not to make sure that we have  healthcare, health insurance, which was a bipartisan program, the  Children's Health Insurance Program. Anything? No.   So that DREAMers aren't deported? People who only know this country?   And think about this: since the President, himself--and this is an  area where we have some agreement--declared that we have a national  emergency, our people, our children, are dying due to this opioid  crisis, and where is the solution there?   Where is the debate there?   Where is the effort on the floor of this House to deal with these  big, pressing problems that our country faces?   We have had the last 2\1/2\ months; we could have done it during that  period.   But what has been the focus? A singular obsession around a piece of  legislation that is purported to be tax reform, but at close  examination by just about any significant economist, Democrats,  Republicans, and Independents is the greatest, most significant,  massive shift of hard-earned wealth from working Americans to people  who make more than $900,000 a year.   The notion that, with all the difficulty we are facing in this  country, with all the struggles we are having, with disasters that are  yet to be corrected, with an opioid crisis that is yet to be attacked,  with DREAMers who have uncertainty, with children with no certainty of  healthcare, the most significant priority is not funding the  government, but ensuring that people who make more than those suffering  people, who make more than $900,000 a year, get more?   That is not a reflection of the priorities of the American people;  and that is why it is so difficult for us, who are ready, honestly-- honestly ready to work hand in glove, knowing we are not going to win  every fight, but give us a chance to sit at the table and have a  conversation about where we might find some common ground.   And we do from time to time. It is not impossible. Even with my  friends in this Chamber right now, we have found ways to work together.  But we cannot do it, we cannot do it unless there is a commitment to do  the work of the American people, and we have not seen that.
