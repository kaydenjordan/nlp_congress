 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  3807, the Relief for Restaurants and other Hard Hit Small Businesses  Act.   As you are hearing from my colleagues, the food service industry has  been one of the hardest hit throughout this pandemic, with many  restaurants temporarily closing their doors or dramatically limiting  their capacity during the worst surges but still feeding their  community. Far too many are never opening again.   Right now, many more are looking to close their doors permanently if  we don't give them help and live up to our commitment to support them  through this unprecedented time. We have all heard stories from our  districts of small businesses seeking assistance, many of which have  been eligible but just can't get the funds.   Like my colleagues, the Coney Island that I have gone to for 35 years  is looking at closing. The waitress who worked there for 35 years was  in total tears last week because she doesn't know what she is going to  do. There are other restaurants throughout my district just needing  help.   This legislation provides critical funding that we need to grant to  these restaurants in our communities. I strongly urge my colleagues to  support this important bill.
