 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Bishop for yielding  me this time.   Mr. Speaker, the Natural Resources Management Act is notable for its  bipartisan support and for the conservation of our natural treasures.   Tennessee's Second District, the district I represent, is home to a  large portion of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Mr. Speaker,  the most visited national park in our Nation. Last year, more than 10  million visitors enjoyed the park, its wildlife, and its beautiful  views and vistas.   The Foothills Parkway traverses the park, and it includes a bridge  currently called, creatively enough, Bridge 2. S. 47 would rename the  bridge for the late Dean Stone, a longtime editor of The Daily Times in  Maryville, Tennessee.   During his tenure at The Daily Times, Dean advocated for the  completion of the Foothills Parkway that enables so many to view the  park. I hope to take my daughter, Isabel, and my wife, Kelly, up there  shortly.   Bridge 2 posed one of the greatest challenges to the parkway's  completion. It has been described as an engineering marvel, Mr.  Speaker, for the construction techniques that minimized its  environmental impact.   It is fitting that this bridge bears Dean's name, not only so we can  continue our stewardship of these landscapes, but also so that we can  honor the people who pushed us to preserve them and increase their  accessibility.    Madam Speaker, I rise tonight concerned about residents  of my district dealing with flooding that claimed one life there and  has damaged roads and private property throughout the region. The loss  of life during this recent flooding is tragic, and my family and I  continue to pray for everyone affected back home.   One group of people deserves to be recognized for the work they do in  times of crisis, and they are our first responders and other emergency  personnel. When the rest of us are seeking shelter from the storm, the  men and women who make up our fire and police departments, rescue  crews, and emergency communications professionals are going to work to  coordinate a rapid response that will save lives and help limit  property damage.   It is appropriate that during these times of disaster we continue to  pray for those who are suffering and show appreciation for those who  work so hard to protect us.   Madam Speaker, I ask that all my House colleagues join me in doing  that.                            ____________________
