SEC. 833. WAIVER.         Section 8902 of title 46, United States Code, shall not       apply to the chain ferry DIANE (United States official number       CG002692) when such vessel is operating on the Kalamazoo       River in Saugatuck,  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on S. 140.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to come to the floor tonight, not only  with another Coast Guard reauthorization bill, but it will be the last  bill I will pass and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure  will pass, as my chairmanship expires and I leave Congress here at the  end of the year. So it is a proud moment for me.   I am especially proud that S. 140 was named the Frank LoBiondo Coast  Guard Authorization Act of 2018.   This is a product of bicameral and bipartisan efforts. The Coast  Guard is an armed service with a very difficult mission: to enforce all  Federal laws on, under, and over the high seas in the jurisdiction of  the United States.   This bill supports the Coast Guard and its servicemembers by  authorizing funding for fiscal year 2018 and 2019.   The legislation includes three bills reported from the Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee: the Coast Guard Improvement Reform Act of  2017; the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2017; and the Federal  Maritime Commission Authorization Act of 2017.   The bill promotes commercial and recreational vessel safety, protects  the environment, modernizes Coast Guard administration laws, and  provides protection for American business in regard to foreign shipping  alliances.                                time  1815    Once again, it authorizes a heavy icebreaker to be purchased by the  Coast Guard. We just hope the appropriators find the funding to do that  for a much-needed icebreaker.   The bill is named for our colleague, Frank LoBiondo, who previously  served as chairman and ranking member of the Coast Guard and Maritime  Transportation Subcommittee during five different Congresses. His  leadership on the subcommittee translated into many legislative  victories for the Coast Guard and their hardworking Coast Guard  members. So it is absolutely fitting to name this after Frank LoBiondo.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the Frank LoBiondo Coast  Guard Reauthorization Act by voting ``yes'' on S. 140, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Mast), who is the chairman of the Coast Guard and Maritime  Transportation Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo), who is the current chairman  of the Subcommittee on Aviation, the former chairman of the Coast Guard  and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, and the namesake of this  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Hunter), who is the former chairman of the Subcommittee  on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation and an advocate for the  Coast Guard.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Chabot).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support S. 140, the Frank  LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018. It is a good bipartisan  bill. I urge all my colleagues to vote for it.   Finally, I would like to thank the staff on both sides of the aisle.  On our side, especially, I thank the Coast Guard Subcommittee staff and  John Rayfield, who heads up that staff, for his tremendous work. He  just informed me that, under the subcommittee's jurisdiction, we will  have authorized every single program under that committee's  jurisdiction. Great work by John and his team on the subcommittee.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the names of the staff on the  committee.        From Chairman Shuster's Staff:        John Rayfield        Bonnie Bruce        Lt. Commander Luke Peterson        Kevin Reig        Maggie Chan        Kathy Loden        Brittany Smith        Hannah Matesic        Fred Miller        Geoff Gosselin        Chris Vieson        From Ranking Member DeFazio's Staff:        Dave Jansen        Kathy Dedrick        Alex Burkett        From the Office of Legislative Counsel:        Hank Savage        Tom Dillon     Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank all my members  for the great support they have given me on both sides of the aisle to  move a lot of bipartisan legislation. I want to thank them for that. I  thank my subcommittee chairmen for their leadership in working with me.   Finally, I thank my counterpart, the leader of the Democrats on the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, sometimes being a worthy  foe, most of the time being a dependable and able ally. I thank him for  all his work. I also thank him for the very, very thoughtful small  going away gift that he gave me. I appreciate that greatly. Again, I  finally thank him for all his effort and work.   I have no say in who is going to be the next chairman of the  committee, but I can tell you that nobody is more able and  knowledgeable about the transportation and infrastructure world than  Peter DeFazio. I wish him the best and look forward to seeing him down  the road.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of S. 140, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
