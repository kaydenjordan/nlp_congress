 Madam Speaker, I rise today in my last floor speech in  [[Page H169]]  this body to do what I was sworn to do on the first date: To protect  and defend the Constitution.   President Trump put the domestic terrorists on notice by saying,  ``Stand back and stand by.'' He then summoned them to D.C., directed  them to march on the Capitol, and then he sat back and watched the  insurrection.   Some of my colleagues--some of which may well be coconspirators--in  their latest attempt to placate and please this unfit President,  suggests that we shouldn't punish Trump for his actions in order to  unify the country. That is the climax of foolishness.   Let me suggest to them: Stand up. Man up. Woman up. And defend this  Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic, including Donald  J. Trump.   In the first impeachment, Republicans said we didn't need to impeach  him because he learned his lesson, so no need to remove him.   Well, we said, if we didn't remove him, he would do it again. Simply  put, we told you so.   Richmond out.
