The corporation shall accept such changed       assumptions unless it determines the changes are       unreasonable, individually or in the aggregate.

Such notice shall       specify the reasons the plan is ineligible for special       financial assistance, any proposed change or assumption is       unreasonable, or information is needed to complete the       application.
