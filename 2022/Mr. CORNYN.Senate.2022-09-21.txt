 Mr. President, the crisis at our southern border  continues to break records. For the first time ever, the United States  has encountered more than 2 million migrants at our southern border in  a single fiscal year, and that doesn't even include data for the month  of September.   Now, my State, the State of Texas, has a 1,200-mile common border  with Mexico where most of these migrants show up, although some go to  Arizona, some to New Mexico, and some to California. But the vast  majority of these 2 million migrants have showed up on our backdoor  step. This includes a hodgepodge of people, from asylum seekers to  economic migrants, to criminals, to drug smugglers.   In each of the last 6 months, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection  has logged more than 200,000 migrant encounters--for each of the past 6  months, 200,000 a month. The media used to lose its collective mind  when 100,000 immigrants arrived in a single month, but I guess the  public has become desensitize to these numbers because they are so  huge, and we have now been operating at twice that level for 6  consecutive months.   Communities in my State of Texas have struggled to carry the weight  of President Biden's border crisis, and nobody seemed to care. But the  moment the burden reached the liberal enclaves of Manhattan and  Martha's Vineyard, the outrage machine fired up.   Earlier this year, Texas Governor Greg Abbott began transporting  migrants to other States and cities to ease the burden on communities  in Texas. After all, what are we supposed to do? Two million migrants  show up at the border. Are they supposed to stay there? Well, most of  them have been in contact with relatives and other people in other  cities around the country, and so they eventually make their way to  their destination. And, if they are asylum seekers, they are given a  notice to appear for a future court hearing, which probably will never  occur because of the huge backlog in our immigration courts.   So Governor Abbott did what any reasonable person would do and began  [[Page S4890]]  sending these migrants to other places where they eventually will end  up at their final destination, wherever that may be. You can imagine 2  million migrants showing up on your border and what the strain on local  health systems is like, what the strain is on emergency response  services. The more migrants that show up on our backdoor step, the  lower the capacity to care for taxpayers who pay taxes to make sure  those services are available.   At the same time, nongovernmental organizations--we call them NGOs-- along the border are expected to pick up the Federal Government's slack  and care for the migrants, which harms those charities' ability to  support more Texans and other Americans who rely on them.   To state the obvious, the burden of this crisis should not fall on  our border communities. The Federal Government, after all, is charged  with the responsibility of managing our international borders, and that  includes migration.   Simply stated, the Biden administration has refused to deal with this  crisis or, frankly, even to really acknowledge it. But that doesn't  change the fact that my State--or any other State, for that matter-- should not be left to manage the fallout alone.   Now, since April, more than 11,000 migrants have voluntarily boarded  buses from Texas to Washington, DC; New York; and Chicago. In the past,  the leaders of these cities have made it clear that they would welcome  migrants with open arms. They self-designate as a sanctuary city. Well,  now this is their opportunity to provide that sanctuary and those  services and relieve some of the burden on the border States that have  borne the disproportionate burden for all this time. But you would have  thought that something nefarious was going on or a genuine public  emergency had occurred. They don't care a whit about 2 million people  showing up on the Texas border. But when they show up on a bus in  Washington, DC, or Chicago or New York, they howl like a dog that has  been hit with a rock.   After ignoring the border crisis during the entirety of the Biden  administration, the arrival of a few thousands migrants in these  sanctuary cities has put them into an absolute panic. The Democratic  Mayor of Washington, DC, for example, declared a public health  emergency after her city received only a few thousand migrants. Two  million migrants at the border in my State, Arizona, New Mexico, and  California, and they didn't raise a peep. But a few thousand migrants  to show up here in Washington, DC--roughly the same number that arrive  on the southern border every single day--you would have thought there  was an emergency.   The Democratic mayor of New York said that his city is ``nearly to  the breaking point.'' This is a city of 8\1/2\ million people. Yet the  mayor said his city is near the breaking point even though it has  welcomed only a few thousand migrants. Give me a break.   Our colleague from Illinois, the majority whip, called the  transportation of these migrants ``cruel and inhumane.'' Giving people  a bus ride to their ultimate destination strikes me as not cruel and  not inhumane. The White House Press Secretary had the temerity to say  it was ``shameful and reckless.'' Well, what is shameful and reckless  is the Biden administration's border crisis that it simply ignored for  the last 2 years.   Vice President Kamala Harris even went so far as to call this ``the  height of irresponsibility'' and a ``dereliction of duty.'' I doubt  Vice President Harris recognizes the many layers of irony in that  statement. After all, last March, she was designated as the border czar  for the Biden administration, but she wouldn't visit the border. She  was charged, by the President of the United States, with finding  solutions to address this ongoing crisis. If she wants to talk about  dereliction of duty, her refusal to acknowledge, much less address, the  border crisis is a prime example of irresponsibility and dereliction of  duty.    But what is even more misleading about her statement is the fact that  transporting migrants to cities far from the southern border is nothing  new. In fact, the Biden administration has been doing it all along.  Here is a chart. It shows the cities that have been receiving migrants  from the Biden administration since the President became President of  the United States in January of 2021: In Washington State, Yakima, if I  am pronouncing that correctly; Minneapolis; Denver; Phoenix; Yuma; even  Atlanta; White Plains; Scranton; Baltimore; Harrisburg; Allentown;  Jacksonville, FL; Birmingham, AL; Houston, TX; Brownsville; San  Antonio; Dallas--all of these cities have been the recipients of  migrants transported by the Biden administration.   In April of last year, the Associated Press published a story with  the headline ``Unaccompanied children from border arrive in  Pennsylvania.'' The following month, the local news station in  Chattanooga, TN, posted a story with the headline ``Late-night flights  carrying migrant children arrive in Chattanooga.'' Here is another  headline from October of last year: ``Biden administration quietly  flies illegal immigrants to New York in the middle of the night.'' We  didn't hear the howls of protest from Mayor Adams or the Governor when  the Biden administration was doing what they are now complaining about.  Though they don't talk about it very often, the Biden administration  has a history of transporting migrants to cities far from the U.S.- Mexico border, and they didn't call it shameful or reckless then.   Just to be clear, when somebody claims asylum at the border and  passes an initial test of a credible fear of persecution, they are then  given a notice to appear for a future court hearing that may be years  off, with millions of cases in the backlog. That is called a notice to  appear, and it shouldn't surprise anybody that, over the years, after  people have already made their way into the interior of the United  States, that many of them don't show up for their court hearing. This  is part of what the Border Patrol said is a lack of consequences  associated with entering the United States in an irregular fashion. Oh,  by the way, 90 percent of the people who do show up for their court  hearing are not granted asylum. They don't qualify.   As I have stressed on many occasions, Mr. President, communities in  my State do not have the capacity, the infrastructure, or the resources  to handle this crisis alone. As New York City, the largest city in  America, raises alarms over a few thousand migrants, I can't help but  think about what happened when 15,000 Haitian migrants showed up under  a bridge in Del Rio, TX, a town of 35,000 people. The group of migrants  who showed up under that bridge in Del Rio equated to more than 40  percent of the city's population. Can you imagine what a challenge that  was just to feed people, provide them humane treatment, sanitation. But  if you extrapolate that 15,000 in a city of 35,000, that would be the  equivalent of more than 3 million people showing up in New York City or  280,000 arriving in Washington, DC, in the course of just 1 week.   So whether they intended to do so or not, the mayors of Washington,  DC and New York City--and Chicago, for that matter--have shown that the  weight of this crisis is extraordinarily heavy, and they are only  experiencing a tiny fraction of what Texas communities have faced every  day for the last year and a half. And do you know what? Apparently the  Biden administration simply doesn't care. As these mayors now know,  caring for these migrants who cross our border is a herculean task  because of the sheer volume of people coming across.   Legal immigration is part of the secret to our success as a country.  We naturalize a million people a year. But these are people who have  chosen to jump ahead of those waiting in line to enter the country  lawfully, and we simply don't have the resources in place at the border  or other places to deal with this vast tsunami of humanity--food,  clothing, shelter, medical care, translation services, legal services,  sanitation. Communities in Texas apparently have been expected to bear  the entire brunt and the entire burden. It is time consuming, it is  labor intensive, it is extraordinarily expensive, and it is dangerous.   The criminal organizations that are getting rich moving these  migrants into the country for $5-, $10-, $15,000 a person are flooding  the Border Patrol with these migrants, diverting necessary resources  from the Border Patrol from interdicting the drugs that  [[Page S4891]]  are entering our country that killed 108,000 Americans last year alone.  Seventy-one thousand of those 108,000 died of fentanyl overdose, a  synthetic opioid. Precursors come from China, get to Mexico, are  manufactured there, and are smuggled into the United States. And  fentanyl has taken far too many lives in every State and in every city  in this Nation, and yet the Biden administration has not awakened to  the fact that they are being played; that part of this business model,  if you want to call it that, of flooding the border with migrants is to  divert the Border Patrol and law enforcement officials from stopping  these drugs, this poison, from coming into the country.   Then, yes, in every city in the Nation, we have seen a spike in  crime. Do you know who the distribution network is in the United States  for the drugs that the cartels smuggle across the border? It is gangs  in every city and in every State in the country. And who is responsible  for most of the gun violence and crime in our cities? It is these gangs  that are the principal distribution network for the drugs that come  across the border. Yet the Biden administration has not connected the  dots. I don't know why. The DEA, or the Drug Enforcement  Administration, the FBI Director--there are a lot of people in the  administration who could inform the President and the Vice President of  what the facts are, but they apparently are not even curious, or, if  they know, they don't seem to care.   From El Paso to the Rio Grande Valley, as I said, Texas shares a  1,200-mile border with Mexico out of our total border of 2,000 miles.  The communities situated along that border simply cannot handle the  monumental job of dealing with this flow of migrants and the failure of  the Federal Government to live up to its responsibilities. But this  isn't a partisan matter.   My friend Oscar Leeser, who is the mayor of El Paso, TX--he is a  proud Democrat--he has been busing migrants to get them off the streets  of El Paso to the cities where they want to go.   He said a few days ago:         People are not coming to El Paso, they're coming to       America.    It is only fair for other parts of the country to bear the burden  that we have borne alone in my State and in other border States, as  long as the Federal Government is simply advocating its responsibility  to deal with illegal immigration and to fix this crisis. They know what  to do. They simply are refusing to do it, presumably because some of  their political supporters don't believe in anything except open  borders.   The Biden administration has completely abdicated its duty to secure  the border, and it has failed to supply border communities with the  resources they need to try to manage this fallout. The truth is, no  matter what the resources were, the numbers are just overwhelming. And  that is the point. The cartels get rich; they smuggle drugs and  additional migrants; and that is the point. So it is not going to stop  until the Biden administration wakes up out of its deep sleep and deals  with the reality of what is happening at the border.   In the last 12 months, Customs and Border Protection has encountered  more than 2.3 million migrants at the southern border, and that total  grows every single day. All you have to do is turn on your TV set and  see people streaming across the border, many of them turning themselves  in, getting into this asylum system where they ultimately melt into the  great American heartland, never to be heard from again, successfully  making their way into the country.   Our amazing men and women at the Border Patrol are grappling with  staffing shortages and poor morale. How would you like to be a police  officer where the mayor and city council say: Well, we had to hire a  police force, but we are really not going to fund that police force or  we are not going to do anything to recruit more people to serve in that  police force. And do you know what? We really don't care whether they  enforce the law or not.   That is the message that the Border Patrol is receiving from the  Biden administration. So, of course, morale is bad. Of course, it is  hard to recruit. The agents are outnumbered, they are overwhelmed, and,  frankly, disgusted with the lack of leadership.   Border communities are buckling under the weight of vast humanitarian  needs, and now even the self-proclaimed sanctuary cities don't seem to  want to help. Unfortunately, the Biden administration appears to have  no intention of fixing the problem. And it sure seems like they don't  think anybody else should have to help either.   It is leaving Texas and other border States to buckle under the  weight of a crisis that we had no hand in creating. It is forcing Texas  taxpayers to make up for the failure of the Federal Government to  perform its responsibilities. And what is worse, President Biden, Vice  President Harris, and Members of this body are trying to paint my State  as the enemy for trying to deal with the hand that it has been dealt  while they continue to refuse to lend a helping hand.
