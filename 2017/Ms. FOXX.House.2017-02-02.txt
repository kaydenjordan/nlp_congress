 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Oversight and  Government Reform Committee for yielding time.  [[Page H909]]    Mr. Speaker, we are here today to stand up for workers, taxpayers,  and small businesses.   We all agree employers who do business with the Federal Government  should be held to high standards, and their employees deserve strong  protections. That is why for decades the Federal Government has had a  system in place to deny contracts to employers who violate Federal  labor laws.   Time and again, Republicans in Congress urged the Obama  administration to enforce the current system to ensure workers receive  fair pay and safe workplaces.   Instead, the previous administration did the exact opposite. It went  in search of a problem that doesn't exist. It took its eye off the  ball, and we are here today to demand better.   The Obama blacklisting rule empowers government agencies to deny  employers Federal contracts for alleged violations of various Federal  labor laws and similar State laws. That is right. Under this rule,  bureaucrats can determine employers are guilty until proven innocent,  and then deny them the ability to do business with the Federal  Government.    This is one important reason why a Federal district judge recently  blocked implementation of the rule because it would have a chilling  effect on the due process rights of American citizens. But that is not  the only reason why we are here today. Rather than streamline the  procurement process to better protect taxpayers and workers, the Obama  administration added new layers of red tape on to a system plagued by  delays and inefficiencies. Simply put, this rule is a bureaucratic  nightmare. It turns our already complex Federal procurement process  into a convoluted regulatory maze.   Despite what our Democrat colleagues will claim, this rule will  actually hurt workers by making a system designed for their protection  less efficient. Law-abiding small-business owners, the backbone of our  Nation's economy, will be less inclined to bid on Federal contracts.   As a result, we will see less competition in the Federal contracting  process. With less competition, hardworking taxpayers will be forced to  pay more for goods and services provided to the U.S. Government.   Perhaps most concerning is the threat this rule poses to our national  security. Higher costs and a delayed contracting process will  jeopardize the resources our Armed Services depend on to keep our  Nation safe. With men and women currently stationed in harm's way, this  is simply unacceptable.   If workers, taxpayers, and small businesses stand to lose, then who  stands to gain?   The answer is Big Labor. Union leaders often file frivolous legal  complaints to gain leverage against employers. This is just one more  partisan rule that stacks the deck in favor of union leaders.   The facts are clear: this rule is fatally flawed. It is not in the  best interest of workers, small-business owners, our military or  hardworking taxpayers. It is also unnecessary, but you don't have to  take my word for it.   Last October, our colleagues in the Congressional Progressive  Caucus--Representatives Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva said: ``The  Department of Labor has full authority under current law to hold  Federal contractors accountable.''   I could not agree more. In fact, that is what Republicans have been  saying all along.   I urge my colleagues to stand up for workers, small-business owners,  taxpayers, and our national security by supporting this commonsense  resolution. Then let's work together to ensure existing policies are  enforced and workers have the protections they deserve.    I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), the chair of the Committee on Small  Business.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to our distinguished  colleague from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health,  Employment, Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Byrne), my distinguished colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a list of  organizations supporting this disapproval resolution.                     Letters in Support of H.J. Res. 37         Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM).        Other Stakeholders (19 signatories): Aerospace Industries       Association, American Council of Engineering Companies,       American Foundry Society, American Hotel & Lodging       Association, American Trucking Association, Associated       Builders and Contractors, Inc., Associated General       Contractors, College and University Professional Association       for Human Resources (CUPA-HR), HR Policy Association,       Independent Electrical Contractors, Information Technology       Alliance for the Public Sector, International Foodservice       Distributors Association, National Association of       Manufacturers, National Defense Industrial Association,       Professional Services Council, Society for Human Resource       Management, The Coalition for Government Procurement, U.S       Chamber of Commerce, WorldatWork.     I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I thank my colleagues--Chairman Chaffetz, Chairman  Chabot, and Representative Mitchell--for joining us in this important  effort as well as to thank my colleagues who came and spoke on this  resolution.   Workers deserve strong protections. The best way to ensure fair pay  and safe workplaces is to enforce the existing suspension and debarment  system. It is also important to remind my colleagues of what the  Congressional Progressive Caucus said:         The Department of Labor has full authority under current       law to hold Federal contractors accountable.    It is clear we don't need more layers of red tape to prevent bad  actors from receiving taxpayer-funded contracts. Creating a  bureaucratic maze would only make a system less efficient that is  designed to protect workers. Furthermore, the blacklisting rule would  undermine the ability of small businesses to compete for Federal  contracts, would increase costs for taxpayers, and would jeopardize the  resources of our Armed Forces--the ones they need to keep this country  safe.   I urge my colleagues to block this harmful rule and vote ``yes'' on  H.J. Res. 37.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
