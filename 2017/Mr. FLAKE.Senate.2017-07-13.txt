I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.    Mr. President, I rise to speak about a critical subject  too often overlooked by Congress. It is the Federal debt and our  deficit.   It is no secret that our national debt will soon surpass $20  trillion. To provide some context for that figure, $20 trillion  represents the largest amount of debt ever owed by any nation in  history. This fact, coupled with the fast-approaching end to our fiscal  year, will leave Congress facing an unavoidable debt debate.   Our looming debt and deficit are two of our country's most urgent  challenges, but the legislative branch does not treat them like the  crises they really are. Since January alone, Congress has added $284  billion to the debt over the next 10 years. The Congressional Budget  Office recently projected that if Congress continues on its current  path, deficits will increase dramatically over the next decade.  Specifically, by 2027, the deficit will grow from 3.6 percent of the  Nation's GDP to 5.2 percent of the Nation's GDP, totaling $1.4  trillion. Yet, as the National Debt Clock continues to click upward  toward $20 trillion, the Federal Government continues to spend money  that it simply does not have.   If Congress continues to legislate in this current state of denial,  one day soon, we may well wake up to discover that the financial  markets have declared that the United States is no longer a good bet.  We must also remember that Congress's failure to address this fiscal  train wreck today will force our children and grandchildren to deal  with its consequences tomorrow. Unless Congress can get this  fundamental issue under control, nothing else will matter very much.   There ought to be an option that allows taxpayers to take matters  into their own hands. That is why today I am reintroducing the Debt  Buy-Down Act. The Debt Buy-Down Act is a commonsense bill that allows  taxpayers to rein in the national debt with the simple check of a box.  If passed, this bill would require the IRS to include an option on  individuals' tax forms that allow them to voluntarily designate up to  10 percent of their tax liabilities to go specifically toward reducing  the national debt. The bill would then require Congress to reduce  Federal spending by an amount equivalent to that designated by the  taxpayers. If Congress fails to make these necessary spending  reductions designated by taxpayers, then across-the-board spending cuts  would be imposed.   This is not a good way to reduce the Federal debt. The better way  would be to make priorities as we consider our spending bills, but it  is better than just letting these spending bills go and doing nothing.  We ought to use a scalpel and go in and treat these programs as we  should and make sure they are doing what they were intended to. If we  cannot do that, then we need to take dramatic measures to get our debt  and deficit under control.   The Debt Buy-Down Act would protect Social Security benefits,  benefits for those in the uniformed services, and payments for net  interest on the national debt from being included in any of these  across-the-board cuts.   Simply put, in the absence of responsible Federal budget solutions,  this bill allows taxpayers to take matters into their own hands. In  2014, Americans paid over $1.37 trillion in individual income taxes. If  every one of these individuals had contributed 10 percent of their tax  liability, Congress would have been required to have cut $137 billion  in spending. While $137 billion does not solve our $20 trillion debt  problem, it is certainly a good place to start.   Congress has been so desensitized to the growing national debt that  the word ``trillion'' does not even raise alarm bells anymore. In fact,  after I introduced the Debt Buy-Down Act in 2010, I began sending a  weekly, pun-laden press release to help put the then-$13 trillion  national debt--just in 2010--into perspective. It was called ``So Just  How Broke Are We?'' Maybe it is time to bring it back.   So 7 years and $7 trillion in added debt later, just how broke are we  today? We are so broke that, with our $20 trillion national debt, we  could book 570,000 trips to the Moon on SpaceX. It is a pretty  expensive excursion, but we could do it 570,000 times. We are so broke  that, with our $20 trillion national debt, we could buy every seat at  Chase Field in Phoenix for the next 22 million Arizona Diamondbacks  games. Of course, that is just a ballpark figure, but it is the last  pun. I promise. We are so broke that with our $20 trillion national  debt we could buy 20 billion tickets to see Hamilton.    My love of bad puns and jokes aside, instead of thinking about how  $20 trillion could be spent, maybe we ought to start thinking about how  $20 trillion could be saved.   That is why I am calling on my colleagues to support the Debt Buy- Down Act and empower taxpayers to reduce the national debt. Just think,  a simple check of a box would help save billions of dollars and  preserve the strength of our national economy. It would save future  generations from the consequences of our crippling national debt.   At any rate, I hope this bill makes like the debt and grows a lot of  interest.                                  ______                                         By Mr. JOHNSON:   S. 1553.
