 Madam Speaker, whether it is Putin's price hike, corporate  greed, transitory--depending on the day, Madam Speaker, these are just  some of the false narratives in the laundry list of excuses President  Biden and Democrats have used to try to explain away the impact of  their disastrous economic policies.   The truth is, Madam Speaker, that this historic inflation crisis, the  fastest rate of inflation in 40 years, is the direct result of policy  errors.   The latest excuse from the President comes in this tweet from  yesterday: Can you believe it? At current prices, the average driver  will spend less than they would if prices had stayed at their peak.   The problem is, Madam Speaker, the peak was under his policies.   Here is the real--here's the real tweet: At current prices, Americans  will spend $1,200 more per person for gas and a whole lot more than  they would have if Joe Biden had not been President of the United  States.   The reality is, our country went from energy dominant to energy  desperate, and gas prices have almost doubled in less than 2 years from  $2.36 per gallon to $4.32 today.   Not only did that peak occur under President Biden's policy, but I  think I  [[Page H7157]]  speak for all Americans when I say I never thought I would see the day  when an American President would celebrate gas prices north of $4  nationwide.   My story is Charlie from Fleming County, Kentucky. He is a farmer,  and he cannot afford these diesel prices. He told me: I don't know,  Congressman, where you come up with these numbers in Washington, D.C.,  9.1 percent inflation. To us in America, it feels two or three times  that much.   This inflation is hurting Americans. Time to reverse course and end  these disastrous policies of war against American energy.
