 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  strong support of this Budget Resolution.   The pandemic has left millions of Americans hungry, homeless, or  unable to make rent and mortgage payments. This resolution would  provide critical support that is, quite literally, life or death.   It's a time to make life better for Americans who are hurting, using  every tool available to us.   From extending eviction and foreclosure moratoriums, to supporting  public transit like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority so my  constituents can still get to work and healthcare appointments, we must  act holistically.   Upon passage, the Oversight Committee will immediately get to work on  one of the most important aspects of this package--providing  desperately needed funding for states, local governments, tribes, and  territories.   This money will allow these governments to help distribute vaccines,  expand testing, keep frontline workers employed, and maintain vital  services. It will also keep our economy afloat by allowing states,  local governments, tribes, and territories to avoid laying off their  employees en masse.   The Committee will include expanded emergency paid leave for federal  employees, available for those who need to quarantine, isolate, or need  to provide care due to the coronavirus.   We also will include funding for oversight and transparency efforts  to ensure every taxpayer dollar included in this package is spent on  its intended purpose.   The President's American Rescue plan would deal a decisive blow to  this devastating pandemic, providing the resources that our families,  communities, and economy need to survive.   We must do everything we can, as fast as we can, to get vaccines in  arms, to get resources to struggling communities, and to get Americans  back to work.
