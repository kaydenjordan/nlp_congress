 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, Eastern Kentucky is again facing the  threat of stormy weather and flash floods this weekend. Emergency  responders have been on the ground since the flooding began and will  continue their critical role in the coming days. We are making sure the  Federal Government is stepping up as well.   In addition to the Governor and State lawmakers, I have been in  personal contact with the President, Secretaries Mayorkas and Becerra,  and FEMA Administrator Criswell going back to the beginning of this  emergency.   FEMA has been on the ground since day one, providing enormous help  with search and rescue operations. Once rebuilding begins, their role  will only be more important.   With the President's major disaster declaration, FEMA is now  authorized to send financial assistance directly to the flood victims.  These funds will be critical to those who lost their homes in the  flooding, especially since many lack flood insurance. To reach remote  residents, FEMA representatives are going door-to-door and speaking  directly to survivors in shelters to make sure everyone who qualifies  for help actually receives it. The Agency has already approved hundreds  of thousands of dollars for affected Kentuckians.   FEMA is also helping pull together a wide swath of Federal Agencies  to supplement the Kentucky National Guard and State agencies. The  Forest Service is already on the ground, clearing debris from roadways.  The Small Business Administration is issuing loans to help employers  rebuild. The Army Corps of Engineers is ensuring all dams in the region  remain operational.   The Federal response so far has been extraordinary.   I have been proud to stand with the Governor and Kentucky's entire  congressional delegation to help expand the number of counties  receiving assistance and streamline the aid. Kentuckians can visit my  official website to see the full list of services offered by our  Federal disaster response Agencies.   The Federal Government has done an excellent job so far. The crisis  is far from over.   Soon, I will visit the region myself to meet with flood victims and  listen to their concerns, and then I will take what I hear from my  constituents back to Washington and ensure we stand by their side as we  rebuild bigger and better than before.                                  Inflation    Madam President, now on an entirely different matter, a year and a  half ago, Democrats misread a 50-50 Senate as a mandate for $1.9  trillion in party-line reckless spending. The result has been the worst  inflation in 40 years.   With Democrats in charge, working families are having to spend  thousands of extra dollars each year just to tread water. Grocery costs  are through the roof. Energy bills are skyrocketing. Gas prices are  more than $1 higher than on Inauguration Day. American families are  trapped in an inflation spiral, where many workers have earned pay  raises on paper, but even those bigger paychecks buy them less and less  every time they go to the store.   Because of Democrats' historic failure on the economy, the American  people have lost their patience. Ninety percent say they are feeling  anxious about inflation. Only 28 percent like what President Biden is  doing about it, and just 22 percent think we will be in any better  shape after another year of Democratic leadership. But, amazingly,  Senate Democrats are misreading the American people's outrage as a  mandate for yet another--yet another--reckless taxing-and-spending  spree. Democrats have already robbed American families once through  inflation, and now their solution is to rob American families yet a  second time.   Democrats want to ram through hundreds of billions of dollars in tax  hikes and hundreds of billions of dollars in reckless spending--and for  what? For a so-called inflation bill that will not meaningfully reduce  inflation at all and will actually make inflation even worse in the  short term; for a so-called economic bill that will kill American jobs  and hammer our manufacturing sector; for a so-called climate bill that  will have no meaningful impact on global temperatures whatsoever; for a  so-called prescription drug bill that will result in fewer lifesaving  medicines and higher prices for the new cures that are invented. Every  fact I have just laid out has come from nonpartisan experts and  academics.   Democrats' bill will do nothing to meaningfully cut inflation.  Hundreds of billions of dollars in tax hikes on a struggling economy  will help kill American jobs everywhere, except the IRS, that is, where  the bill would fund the hiring of--listen to this--86,000 new tax  collectors plus new cars and new computers.   Jacking up Americans' electricity bills and gas prices in order to  subsidize rich people buying luxury cars and new appliances will not  make one dent in the future trajectory of global temperatures.   Democrats will choke off the development of new lifesaving medicines  if they pretend that making things cheaper is as simple as passing a  law saying they ought to be cheaper.   Survey after survey, poll after poll has proven that none of this  nonsense is what American people want Democrats to focus on. The  American people don't want hundreds of millions of dollars in Green New  Deal waste. They want less inflation, not more. American families don't  want tens of thousands more IRS agents. What they would like are more  Border Patrol and ICE agents. American families don't want Democrats  policing what kinds of stoves and clothes dryers they can put in their  homes. What they want is for Democrats to actually start policing our  city streets.   Democrats have decided their first economic disaster justifies a  second economic disaster. The working people of this country feel very,  very differently.   Now, on a related matter. I want to drill down on Democrats' plan to  take a buzz saw to the research and development behind new lifesaving  medical treatment and cures. The American people have enough common  sense to know that the government can't actually make something cost  less by making it illegal to raise the price. Let me say that again.  The government can't actually make something cost less by making it  illegal to raise its price. This was the logic of college sophomore  socialism. It is not fair that a certain thing costs more than we like.  Why doesn't the government simply pass a law making it cheaper?   Well, the world would be a lot easier for everybody if things  actually worked that way. It would certainly be easier to be a member  of Congress. We could just vote to set the price of everything in  America, snap our fingers and everybody in the country would enjoy $5  smartphones, $10 TVs, and $100 pickup trucks. What a concept. Why  hasn't anybody thought of this genius idea before?   Well, of course, people have thought of it before. Plenty of  governments have tried crude price-fixing--Cuba, Venezuela, the old  Soviet Union, not exactly thriving paradises, not pinnacles of  prosperity, well-being, or innovation; not the examples we would want  to follow.   Everybody wants prescription drugs and complex medicines to be more  affordable. Everybody wants to help struggling families. That is the  goal we all share. But you know what would not achieve that goal?  Empowering some Biden administration bureaucrat to sit down at a desk  and arbitrarily name the price that manufacturers can charge.   Democrats' policy would not bring about some paradise where we all  get  [[Page S4054]]  amazing new innovations we would have gotten anyway, but at a lower  cost. Their policy would bring about a world where many fewer new drugs  and treatments get invented in the first place as companies cut back on  R&D.   By one analysis, if Democrats' price-fixing scheme had already been  in place, 104 of 110 major new medicines released in the past decade  may never have made it to the market. We would literally have fewer  lifesaving cures and treatments. More Americans would die and die young  under Democrats' policy. And the new drugs that did still get invented  would be more expensive when they hit the market. That is according to  the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.   During the Obama administration, I worked with then-Vice President  Biden on a project he was especially passionate about. I was proud to  help launch his Cancer Moonshot within the 21st Century Cures bill. But  according to one expert's calculation, the bill President Biden wants  Senate Democrats to ram through this weekend would reduce cancer  research spending by more than nine times as much as our Cancer  Moonshot expanded it. I will say that one more time. According to one  expert, this far-left takeover of America's medicine cabinets would  destroy nine times as much cancer funding as we provided with the  Cancer Moonshot.   We are talking about a tidal wave of Washington meddling, wiping out  future treatments and cures for Americans suffering with rare diseases.  What a terrible, terrible and tragic part of their reckless plans.                                Vote on Motion     Mr. President, the last time the Senate was in this  position, the last time Democrats grabbed control of our economy on a  party-line vote, they spent $1.9 trillion and stuck Americans with the  worst inflation in 40 years.   Every Senate Democrat cast the deciding vote for this inflation  nightmare. Their historic mistake has left American families spending  thousands of dollars extra just to avoid losing ground.   In President Biden's America, forget about getting ahead; you have to  pay a multi-thousand-dollar inflation tax just to stand still.   Millions of households haven't been able to keep up with Democrats'  skyrocketing prices no matter how hard they have tried. They have had  to watch their families' hard-earned living standards just slip away-- all because, a year and a half ago, Senate Democrats tried to take over  our economy on a party-line vote. And today, they want to do it again.   Washington Democrats have already robbed American families once  through inflation. Now, they say the solution is to rob the country a  second time. They say they need a second reckless taxing and spending  spree to clean up the damage from their first one.   Every homeowner in America knows that if you call a plumber to fix a  leaky faucet and they end up flooding your entire house, you don't give  them a blank check and a second chance. You show them the door.   President Biden's approval on the economy is 30 percent. An outright  majority of the country--including more than one in four Democrats-- agree that Democrats' policies have actively made the economy worse.   Democrats have lost the country's confidence. They have lost the  people's trust. The voters who placed their families' financial futures  in Democrats' hands have been betrayed. And they know it.   Sadly, there is no shortage of crises that Americans would like this  government to address: an inflation crisis; an energy crisis; a violent  crime crisis; a border crisis.   But this weekend, today's Democratic Party is being unusually honest  about their top priority. They are pulling out all the stops. They have  twisted every arm. And for what? Not taking back our economy from  inflation. Not taking back our streets from murders and carjackings.  Not taking back our border from chaos and deadly drugs.   That is what the American people want addressed. But none of that is  on the agenda this weekend.   President Biden may have won the fight for the Democratic Party's  nomination, but our colleague Chairman Sanders sure did win the war for  its soul.   This reckless taxing and spending spree is a clear catalog of  Washington Democrats' top priorities. It shows the American people what  they care about. And here it is: They want hundreds of billions of  dollars in job-killing tax hikes, 86,000 new IRS agents, new taxes on  American oil and natural gas that will hammer consumers and reduce  energy independence, and a money grab from Americans' medicine cabinets  that will lead to fewer new lifesaving cures in the future.   They want to stick a shaky economy with historic tax hikes, in order  to set up a colossal Green New Deal slush fund. To give rich people tax  credits for buying $80,000 electric cars and new appliances. To send  taxpayer money directly to far-left protest groups. To buy government  agencies fleets of brand-new electric vehicles while working families  can't afford the used car lot.  [[Page S4152]]    And all of it is just unbelievably expensive liberal performance art  because experts say none of this ``retail therapy'' for rich liberals  and bureaucrats will make a dent at all in the future trajectory of  global temperatures--No meaningful impact on the world's climate. None.   That is why none of our Democratic colleagues can talk about actual  results. Have you noticed that? They only have one talking point: that  this is the biggest climate investment ever. That is just a way of  admitting that the only historic thing is the gigantic price tag.   Democrats still define success by how much of your money they get to  take from you in taxes and waste in spending. That is the exactly the  attitude that got us in this mess. That is exactly the far-left mindset  that has crushed American families for 18 months and counting.   Our colleagues want to tax and spend unfathomable sums of money  without making an inch of progress on our citizens' top priorities.  Washington Democrats call that a big success. Do you know what the  American people call it? The lowest Presidential approval rating after  18 months in modern history.
