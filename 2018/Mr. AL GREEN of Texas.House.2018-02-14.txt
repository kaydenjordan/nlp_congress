 Mr. Speaker, I am always honored to stand in  the well of the House.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise as a liberated Democrat, a liberated  Democrat who will not only speak truth to power but who will also speak  truth about power.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to defend freedom of speech. I rise to  defend the freedom of speech of The Hill newspaper. I defend the  freedom of speech of The Hill newspaper when it printed these words: ``  `Morning Joe' host''--I won't mention his name--``said on Sunday that  the Democratic Party should take away funding from Democratic  candidates who talk about impeaching President Trump on the campaign  trail.''   I am such a candidate. I have talked about impeaching the President,  and I will continue to talk about impeaching the President.   I am defending The Hill for printing this, by the way. The Hill goes  on to say: ``Any Democrat mentioning the word `impeachment' on the  campaign trail should have their campaign funds pulled by the  Democratic Party.''   This is what was tweeted by the host of ``Morning Joe'':   ``I defend The Hill's right to print it, and I defend the right of  `Morning Joe' host to say what he said, and I hope people will defend  and respect my right to say what I'm about to say.   ``I will not be intimidated. I want the host to know that, if those  who have threatened my life couldn't intimidate me, he will not. I want  the host to know that I spoke about impeachment just this weekend that  passed.''   And I am looking to future engagements to speak about impeachment.  And I will bring Articles of Impeachment to the floor of the House of  Representatives again if conditions require it. I am not afraid. I have  no fear of these people who would have me abrogate my constitutional  rights. I will stand and defend them, and I will exercise my rights.   The truth is this: We all have a duty to speak up and speak out and  stand up. That is what I will do.   God bless you. Happy Valentine's Day.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I am a  proponent of impeachment. I have not only as much as said so but  brought Articles of Impeachment before the House of Representatives.  There are a good many people who are antithetical to my position, Mr.  Speaker.   As a Member of the House, I would challenge any Member who desires to  debate this issue on the floor of the House. I would also challenge any  member of a morning program, ``Morning Joe,'' who believes that he  should back up his words, to talk to me on his program. Never talked to  me. Never said a word.  [[Page H1136]]    Would you invite me on your program and show the courage to speak of  these issues with me there so that I may defend and you may attack?                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent for all  Members to have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, this is February 14, Valentine's  Day, and this is but one day, of course, in the month of February,  which is Black History Month. I am honored to stand here tonight to  present a resolution that will be filed, a Black History resolution.   But I am also honored to say that a good many of my colleagues are in  support of Black History Month, and they deserve to have their words,  their expressions made known, which is why I have asked for this  unanimous consent. My belief is that we will have many, many persons  who are not here tonight, for legitimate reasons, who will want to make  sure that they are made a part of the Record by and through their  comments that they will submit in written word.   Mr. Speaker, I am here to talk about Black History because for many  years, too many years, to be quite honest, the history of Africans in  the Americas, the history of Black people in America, the history of  African Americans, at one time known as Negroes, this history was  deleted from the history books. It was said in one book that, because  little contributions were made to world history, there would be little  mention of Africans in history.   But, Mr. Speaker, we know now that this is not true, and because we  know that it is not true, we seek to at least give some indication in  the Record that African Americans have made a significant contribution  in America. But also, the truth is that Africans have made a  contribution to world history.   However, tonight, this resolution will focus on and it will recognize  and celebrate Black History Month; and, in so doing, we would like to  present the resolution that will be filed at a later time.   Mr. Speaker, ``Whereas the theme for Black History Month 2018 is  `African Americans in Times of War' ''--something that we have not  focused on to the extent that we should have, because African Americans  have made significant contributions to our country during times of  war--this theme ``which commemorates the centennial of the end of the  First World War in 1918, and explores the complex meanings and  implications of this international struggle and its aftermath;    ``Whereas this resolution will focus primarily on African Americans  in the military, which is but one historically important aspect of this  far-reaching exploration of African-American history;   ``Whereas African Americans have fought for the United States  throughout its history;   ``Whereas despite racial segregation and discrimination, African  Americans have played a significant role during times of war from the  colonial period forward''--Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to note, as  an aside now, that it was not until 1948, by Presidential executive  order, that President Truman desegregated the military.   Continuing: ``Whereas Crispus Attucks was a fugitive slave working  outside of Boston, Massachusetts, as a sailor, and during his time off,  he worked as a rope maker near the wharf;   ``Whereas in early 1770, competition for work and wages became stiff  as British soldiers were contending for the same unskilled positions as  the locals''--that would be Crispus Attucks and other locals;  [[Page H1175]]    ``Whereas this situation created tension which slowly escalated to  violent confrontations;   ``Whereas on March 5, 1770, Attucks led a group of rope makers and  sailors into a confrontation with a group of British soldiers and  subsequently was shot and killed;   ``Whereas Crispus Attucks, a Black man, is generally considered to be  the first casualty of the Revolutionary War and is remembered as the  first of many notable African-American heroes;   ``Whereas Araminta Ross was born into slavery in Maryland and escaped  to freedom in the North in 1849 to become the most famous conductor on  the Underground Railroad;   ``Whereas Araminta Ross was a leading abolitionist before the  American Civil War and also helped the Union Army during war, working  as a spy, among other roles;   ``Whereas Araminta Ross, a Black woman, guided the Combahee River  Raid, which liberated more than 700 slaves in South Carolina;   ``Whereas Araminta Ross, better known as Harriet Tubman, was the  first woman to lead an armed expedition during the Civil War;   ``Whereas Powhatan Beaty was born a slave in Richmond, Virginia, in  1837;   ``Whereas when the Civil War broke out, Beaty enlisted in the Union  Army;   ``Whereas Powhatan Beaty, a Black man, was quickly promoted to  sergeant and oversaw 47 other Black recruits in noncombat jobs;   ``Whereas in September of 1864, Beaty's division attacked the enemy  at Chaffin's farm, near Richmond, Virginia;   ``Whereas with all of the other unit's officers and most of its  enlisted men dead or wounded, Beaty took over and led a second charge,  driving the enemy back;   ``Whereas for his heroism, Powhatan Beaty, a Black man, was awarded  the Medal of Honor . . . ;''   ``Whereas Benjamin Oliver Davis, Sr., entered the military service on  July 13, 1898, during the Spanish-American War and, as a temporary  first lieutenant of the 8th United States Volunteer Infantry;   ``Whereas on June 18, 1899, he enlisted as a private in the 9th  Cavalry of the Regular Army;   ``Whereas Davis eventually came under the command of Charles Young,  whom, at the time, was the only African-American officer serving in the  U.S. military;   ``Whereas Young took Davis under his tutelage and helped him to  prepare to take his officer candidate test;   ``Whereas in only 2 years, he rose to sergeant major and earned a  commission as a second lieutenant in 1901;   ``Whereas Benjamin Oliver Davis, a Black man, rose through the ranks  and became the first African American to achieve the rank of brigadier  general in the U.S. military;   ``Whereas, during World War I, approximately 800``--no one is sure of  the number--``approximately 800 African Americans were killed in  action;   ``Whereas Doris Miller enlisted in the U.S. Navy as a mess  attendant''--meaning he was a person who served those others with food  and took care of the cleaning of facilities--``where he served on the  USS West Virginia when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December  7, 1941;   ``Whereas Miller was assigned to carry the wounded sailors to safer  quarters;   ``Whereas he returned to the deck and picked up a 50-caliber Browning  antiaircraft machine gun that he had never been trained to shoot and  managed to shoot down enemy aircraft;   ``Whereas, Doris Miller, a Black man, was commended by the Secretary  of the Navy and became the first African American to be presented the  Navy Cross;   ``Whereas before 1940, African Americans were barred from flying for  the U.S. military;   ``Whereas civil rights organizations and Black press exerted pressure  on President Roosevelt, which resulted in the formation of the Tuskegee  Airmen based in Tuskegee, Alabama, in 1941;   ``Whereas the Tuskegee Airmen included pilots, navigators,  bombardiers, maintenance and support staff, instructors, as well as the  personnel who kept the planes and pilots in the air;   ``Whereas the Black Tuskegee Airmen overcame segregation and  prejudice to become one of the most highly respected groups of World  War II;   ``Whereas the Tuskegee Airmen's achievements helped pave the way for  full integration of U.S. military;   ``Whereas during World War II, approximately 700 African Americans  were killed in action;   ``Whereas Cornelius Charlton, a career military man, served in the  Army during the Korean war;   ``Whereas on June 2, 1951, his platoon encountered heavy resistance  while attempting to take Hill 543 and the leader of his platoon was  wounded;

  ``Whereas Cornelius Charlton, a Black man, posthumously received the  Medal of Honor for his actions near Chipo-ri, South Korea;   ``Whereas African Americans literally fought for the right to die in  defense of their country;   ``Whereas in the face of injustices, many African Americans  distinguished themselves with their commitment to the noble ideals upon  which the United States was founded and courageously fought for the  rights and the freedom of all Americans;   ``Whereas the preservation and teaching of Black history are  nationally recognized due to the efforts of Dr. Carter G. Woodson and  his establishment of Negro History Week, the precursor to Black History  Month;   ``Whereas Black History Month, which represents Dr. Carter G.  Woodson's efforts to enhance knowledge of Black history, started  through the Journal of Negro History, published by Woodson's  Association for the Study of African American Life and History; and   ``Whereas the month of February is officially celebrated as Black  History Month, which dates back to 1926, when Dr. Carter G. Woodson set  aside a special period of time in February to recognize the heritage  and achievements of Black Americans.   ``Now, therefore, be it resolved that the House of Representatives--   ``Recognizes the significance of Black History Month as an important  time to acknowledge and celebrate the contributions of African  Americans in the Nation's history, and encourages the continued  celebration of this month to provide an opportunity for all peoples of  the United States''--regardless of where they are from--``to learn more  about the past and to better understand the experiences that have  shaped the Nation;   ``Recognizes that ethnic and racial diversity of the United States  enriches and strengthens the Nation; and   ``Encourages all States to include in their year-round educational  curriculum the history and contributions of African Americans in the  United States and around the world.''   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to say to this audience that this Congress  has been very responsive to the notion of celebrating African-American  history. My hope is that, once we are back in the business of approving  resolutions of this type, this resolution will be taken up by the  Congress of the United States of America, that it will be voted on, and  that it will be passed.   My hope is that this will be an indication to our country that our  Congress does truly appreciate what the African Americans have done to  make America the beautiful a more beautiful America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 20 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, February 15, 2018, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
