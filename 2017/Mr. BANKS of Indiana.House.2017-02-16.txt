 Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong  support for H.J. Res 43, which would overturn the previous  administration's title X family planning funding rule.   In December, the Obama administration finalized a misguided rule  which dictates that States must send title X family planning grant  money to abortion providers. Even more, this rule also threatens to  deprive noncompliant States, such as Representative Black's home State  of Tennessee, of all title X family planning funds.   This politically motivated requirement was made neither in the  interest of protecting life, nor in the interest of the States.   Under the rule, States that decline to send title X funds to abortion  clinics  [[Page H1275]]  would lose their title X funding completely. If States make the  decision they want to use their funding to affirm life, then they  should be allowed to do so. This rule blatantly steps all over states'  rights and goes out of its way to favor abortion providers at the same  time.   Let's ensure States continue to have the freedom and flexibility to  make the right decisions for themselves. That is exactly what I have  advocated for my entire career, both in the Statehouse in Indiana and  again here on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.   I express my strong support for the passage of H.J. Res. 43,  introduced by Representative Black.                                time  1430
