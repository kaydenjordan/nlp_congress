 Madam Speaker, I stand today before this deliberative body  to talk about the importance of rural infrastructure; more  specifically, watershed and flood control infrastructure.   Our Nation's watershed dams play a critical yet silent role in many  of our daily lives. Across the Nation, watershed projects provide an  estimated annual benefit of $2.2 billion in reduced flood and erosion  damage and improving wildlife, habitat, recreation, and water supply  for more than 47 million people.   In my home State of Oklahoma alone, there are more than 2,000  watershed dam projects that help Oklahomans meet a myriad of public  needs: public safety, water supply, soil health, and fish and wildlife  management, just to name a few.                                time  1045    In fact, the country's first upstream flood control dam, Cloud Creek  Site No. 1, was built right in the backyard of my district in Washita  County. Built in 1948, following the passage of the Flood Control Act  of 1944, the dam allowed for the preservation of farmland, wildlife,  and several municipal services.   Fast forward to today, and many of our country's 12,000 watershed  dams have exceeded their designed lifespan. Like so much of the public  infrastructure investments across this country, our watershed dams are  aging and need to be upgraded to remain safe and continue to provide  benefits for generations to come.   Seeing the need to rehabilitate many of our dams, in 2000 I authored  the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Amendments which have provided  important investments to help countless dams in need of repair.   After more than two decades of funding through the Small Watershed  Rehabilitation Amendments, more than $900 million has been appropriated  for rehabilitating aging dams. In the 2018 farm bill alone, we provided  $50 million per year in mandatory funding for watershed rehabilitation  and management.   I am proud to mark the 20th anniversary of the Small Watershed  Rehabilitation Amendments being signed into law this past year, but we  must not delay the continued need to rehabilitate and repair other  aging dams and water infrastructure. These silent sentinels are vital  to public safety, economic prosperity, community viability and must not  be allowed to fail.   We learned a lot of lessons 20 years ago in passing the dam  rehabilitation bill. Now we must continue this mission as we debate and  consider infrastructure legislation.   Madam Speaker, to aid in these efforts, I include in the Record the  brought forth report at damsafety.org \ smallwatershed.   In closing, as Congress negotiates on how best to invest in our  Nation's infrastructure, we must continue to invest in the  rehabilitation of these aging public works.   It is time to put the lessons of past appropriate investment to good  use and build the capacity of a new generation to protect critical  infrastructures for decades to come.                            ____________________
