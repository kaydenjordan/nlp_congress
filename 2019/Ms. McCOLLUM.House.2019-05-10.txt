 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this funding package  today. I am pleased that, within the Interior Subcommittee's  jurisdiction, the bill provides more than $2 billion for recovery from  devastating natural disasters.   This includes $849 million to rebuild drinking water and waste  treatment systems to a state of resiliency against future storms, and  $50 million for coastal resiliency projects to reduce flooding and  erosion caused by sea level rise and climate change.   This bill provides funds to repair Federal facilities that were  destroyed or damaged, like the Hawaii Volcanoes Observatory, funds for  Historic Preservation grants to repair culturally significant sites and  properties, and funds to clean up hazardous and solid waste.   A critical provision in this bill provides $720 million to fully  repay the U.S. Forest Service for funds it was forced to borrow in the  last fiscal year to cover the cost of wildland fire suppression.   An additional $134 million will help the Forest Service to address  damage to national forests and to treat hazardous fuel loads.   This emergency funding in this bill will help Americans who are  struggling to restore their lives to return to their homes after  devastating fires and hurricanes of last year.   Communities in all of our States and our territories deserve Federal  support as they recover from natural disasters. Democrats are proud,  under the leadership of Chair Lowey, to be bringing this bill to the  floor to help those who have suffered from these natural disasters to  begin to rebuild and heal their lives.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
