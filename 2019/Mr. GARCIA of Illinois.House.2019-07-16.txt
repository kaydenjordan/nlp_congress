 Madam Chair, I rise in support of the  amendment we have filed to study and limit the use of facial  recognition technology.   The intelligence community collects large amounts of data with  limited oversight about how and from whom data is collected. Facial  recognition technology has shown to be less accurate on nonwhite faces,  and its use disproportionately hurts communities of color because of  algorithmic bias.   This amendment studies the potential for bias and expresses the sense  that people should not be targeted for their ethnicity, race, or sexual  orientation, or to suppress dissent. Given the U.S. Government's  history of tracking protesters and activists, especially in minority  communities, this is important.   Congress can and should exercise Federal oversight of emerging  surveillance technologies. For facial recognition technology, this  means our work is only just beginning. I urge support for this  amendment.                                time  2045
