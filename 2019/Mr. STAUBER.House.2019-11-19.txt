 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the critical need  to pass the USMCA, a trade agreement for the 21st century. The USMCA  would expand our markets, add $63 billion to the economy, and create  176,000 new jobs, with thousands of those jobs coming to Minnesota.   When I am back in Minnesota's Eighth Congressional District meeting  farmers, workers, and businessmen and -women alike, I am often asked  why Congress has not yet passed the USMCA, even though it was signed by  the President nearly a year ago. And my answer is this: If we voted on  the USMCA today, it would pass the House with strong bipartisan  support.   Unfortunately, Democratic leadership's refusal to bring this critical  trade agreement to the House floor for a vote continues, and  uncertainty remains for millions of Americans.   Pursuing partisan impeachment rather than clinching bipartisan wins  for the American worker, is not what a majority of the American people  sent us here to do. Enough is enough. I urge Democratic leadership to  stop playing politics and join the rest of us in working for the  American people.   The time to pass the USMCA is now.                            ____________________
