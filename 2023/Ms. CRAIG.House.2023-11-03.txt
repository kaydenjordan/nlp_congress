 Mr. Speaker, on October 23, 1983, the United States of  America suffered an unspeakable loss as 220 Marines, 18 Navy sailors,  and 3 Army soldiers were killed in a horrific act of violence in the  Marine barracks at the Beirut airport.   My heart is with every American grieving the loss of a loved one.  Each of those 241 Americans represents the best of our country: brave,  selfless, and dedicated.   We must recommit ourselves to working to defend democracy at home and  around the world. That is how we rightfully honor the legacy of the 241  heroes we lost that day. That is what we owe all of the servicemembers,  family members, and loved ones whose lives were changed forever those  40 years ago.                            ____________________
