 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and  for her diligent effort to save the lives of unborn children. And that  is really what this bill is about, saving the lives of unborn children.   For all of us that have children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren,  this is about them and their rights. I hear us talking about our  rights, but what about their rights? Don't they have a right? Because  they have no choice. So thank you for being their voice.   But I rise today to speak the truth. I want to talk about the truth,  which doesn't happen much. This act is titled the Women's Health  Protection Act, more properly titled the abortion on demand act.   Stop hiding behind Texas. Stop hiding behind women's rights.   The majority has chosen once again to lie to the American people  about what this legislation is about. This bill has nothing to do with  women's health. This bill is about infanticide. To my Democratic  colleagues, if you are in support of infanticide, just say it. You  don't need to sugar coat it. Just say it. To my democratic colleagues,  if you are in support of killing a child for any reason, you wanted a  boy but it is a girl, oh, we will just get rid of it and try again,  just have the courage and the guts to say it.
