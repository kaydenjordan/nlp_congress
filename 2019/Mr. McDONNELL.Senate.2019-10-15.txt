 Madam President, it is my pleasure today to salute a  transformative leader in my home State of Kentucky, Dave Adkisson. At  the end of October, Dave will retire as the president and CEO of the  Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, ending nearly 15 years of representing  our Commonwealth's employers and signature industries. His talent for  advocacy and consensus-building have benefited Kentucky, and I would  like to thank him for his many achievements for our State.   Dave began his career at his hometown chamber of commerce in  Owensboro, KY. His creativity and successful management won him a lot  of fans early on, and he was elected the mayor of Owensboro at the age  of 34. Championing several development projects and attracting new  businesses to the city, Dave was reelected to a second term without  opposition.   Leaving public service, Dave accepted an offer to lead the  Birmingham, Alabama, Chamber. The career move took Dave's talents out  of Kentucky, but he wouldn't be gone for long. He returned home and  began his current role leading the statewide chamber. At the helm of  our Commonwealth's largest business association, Dave has grown the  organization and expanded its reach. Now, it represents more than 3,800  businesses in Kentucky.   As the leader of the Kentucky Chamber, Dave has made a positive and  lasting impact on the public policies enacted both in Frankfort and in  Washington. His organization helped lead the charge to pass a right-to- work law in Kentucky, giving workers more freedom over their paychecks  and drawing new investment into the Bluegrass State. Dave was also a  key ally in our drive to pass comprehensive Federal tax reform and cut  burdensome regulations. Kentucky's strong economy is a result, in part,  of Dave's leadership.   He has also been recognized nationally among his peers for his  important work. In 2017, the Kentucky Chamber was named the top chamber  in the country, and Dave has lent his expertise to several national  business associations. To foster future innovators, Dave cofounded  Leadership Kentucky, a highly selective program to equip prominent  Kentuckians with the skills to excel. It is just one example in a long  list of contributions Dave has made to improve our State's bright  future.   As Dave leaves the Kentucky Chamber, I am glad to know he will  continue leading various projects around the Commonwealth. I am sure  our communities will continue to benefit from his talent and guiding  hand. I am also reassured to know that, while Dave is spending some  well-deserved time with his wife Bonnie and their family, the Kentucky  Chamber will be in the capable hands of its new president, Ashli Watts.  A seasoned advocacy veteran, Ashli can build upon the years of success  and help the Kentucky Chamber continue to be a strong voice for our  state's job creators.   So, Mr. President, I would like to thank Dave for his years of  leadership in Kentucky. As an elected official and a public policy  advocate he has created a legacy of accomplishment that will be enjoyed  for years to come. It is a privilege to pay tribute to my friend today,  and I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in honoring Dave Adkisson and  wishing him a fulfilling retirement.                            ____________________
