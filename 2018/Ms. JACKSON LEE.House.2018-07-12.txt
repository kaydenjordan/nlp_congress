 Mr. Chair, I rise to speak on House consideration of  H.R. 6237, the ``Matthew Young Pollard Intelligence Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2018 and 2019.''   I thank Chairman Nunes, Ranking Member Schiff for their work to bring  this bill before the full House of consideration.   Our nation's national security professionals require our support in  words as well as deeds in the form of legislation like the  authorization measure we are debating and sufficient funding to carry  out the work of protecting our great nation from our enemies.   I offered several Jackson Lee Amendments for consideration under this  bill.   I thank the Rules Committee for making in order Jackson Lee Amendment  No. 3, designated as No. 33 on the Rules Committee roster for  consideration for this bill.   This Jackson Lee Amendment, amends the Sense of Congress already in  the bill on the importance of re-review of security clearances held by  individuals by adding consideration of whether the security clearance  holder's association or sympathy with persons or organizations that  advocate, threaten, or use force or violence, or any other illegal or  unconstitutional means, in an effort to prevent others from exercising  their rights under the Constitution or laws of the United States or of  any state, on account of race, religion, national origin, disability,  or other impermissible factors.   In addition to this amendment, I offered three other Jackson Lee  Amendments to H.R. 6237:   The first Jackson Lee Amendment is designated as No. 32 on the Rules  Committee roster, and would have amended the Sense of Congress already  in the bill that addresses the importance of conducting background  checks for retention of security clearances or the issuance of new  clearances to also consider an applicant's membership in a hate group  and their participation in activities espoused by hate groups that  involve violence or incitement of violence which disrupts civic life.   The second Jackson Lee Amendment is designated as No. 34, on the  Rules Committee rosters, and would have amended the Sense of Congress  already in the bill on the  [[Page H6133]]  importance of review of a security clearance by adding that a security  clearance should not be held by an individual who actively engages in  violent acts in the United States or its territories that target  persons based upon their race, religion, ethnicity, national origin,  sexual orientation, or gender identity for the purpose of inflicting  physical harm or emotional distress with the objective of normalizing  anti-social behavior towards vulnerable groups.   The third Jackson Lee Amendment is designated as No. 38 on the Rules  Committee rosters, and would have required that the Director of  National Intelligence conduct an assessment and report to Congress on  the reliance of intelligence activities on civilian contractors to  support Government activities, including intelligence analysis.   Each of these Jackson Lee Amendments sought to strengthen and improve  the process of security clearance awards and oversight of contractors  engaged in national security work.   The rights and dignity of all Americans must be held dear and  protected from assaults that challenge the very freedom we value most.   It is our diversity and our capacity for tolerance of others who are  different that is the essence of American exceptionalism.   As a nation we have come through many struggles and challenges to  reach a point where we accept the diversity of our nation as a strength  and not a weakness.   A period in our history that challenges the very foundation of our  nation was framed by a speech given by Abraham Lincoln on the occasion  of his nomination to become the Senator from the State of Illinois.   He said: ``A house divided against itself, cannot stand. I believe  this government cannot endure, permanently, half slave and half free. I  do not expect the Union to be dissolved--I do not expect the house to  fall--but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all  one thing or all the other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest  the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest  in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction; or its  advocates will push it forward, till it shall become lawful in all the  States, old as well as new--North as well as South.''   He was speaking of the pernicious national shame of slavery that led  ultimately to the Civil War that cost more than 600,00 lives over the  very question of human rights and human dignity for all persons.   Although the question of equality and justice for all has been asked  and answered during pivotal moments in our nation's history today we  are facing another challenge to our core beliefs.   I offered these Jackson Lee Amendments to establish that this  Congress is not wavering in its commitment to protect the lives,  liberties or freedom of Americans from those who seek to do them harm.   Specifically, four of the Jackson Lee Amendments were prompted by the  actions of Mr. Miselis who has a security clearance and worked for  Northrup Grumman, a major defense contractor, at the time he engaged in  physical violence against persons protesting racism and white supremacy  in Charlottesville, Virginia.   In May 2018, Northrup Grumman was informed of Mr. Miselis' membership  in RAM and the violent assaults he initiated while he was in  Charlottesville participating in activities in support of white  supremacy, which were captured on video and in photos.   Mr. Miselis worked for a government contractor and held a security  clearance authorizing him to work on projects that were of vital  interest to our nation and its defense.   Northrup Grumman did not dismiss him until the story broke earlier  this month with media reports on the violence Mr. Miselis engaged in at  the white supremacists' rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia.   The violence of RAM members has been a hallmark of the group and its  members.   The Anti-Defamation League describes RAM as a white supremacist group  whose members believe they are fighting against a ``modern world''  corrupted by the ``destructive cultural influences'' of liberals, Jews,  Muslims and non-white immigrants.   They refer to themselves as the ``premier MMA (mixed martial arts)  club of the Alt-Right.''   RAM is characterized as operating like a street-fighting club.   Members actively train to do physical battle with their ideological  foes, and have been involved in violent clashes during political  rallies and demonstrations.   RAM members consider themselves to be part of the ``Alt Right.''   RAM's membership has deep roots in California's racist skinhead  movement, and includes individuals who have faced serious criminal  charges, including assault, robbery and weapon offenses.   RAM consists of several dozen loosely affiliated neo-Nazis and racist  skinheads who were formerly known as the DIY Division, but rebranded  themselves as the Rise Above Movement in the spring of 2017.   The FBI has opened an informal investigation into this group because  of the violence associated with its members.   The United States is a nation of laws, which gives us the freedom to  agree and most importantly disagree with not only each other but with  our government.   But the limitations to the right to disagree can be best described by  the ancient wisdom: ``Your right to swing your arms ends just where the  other person's nose begins.''   There is a limit to the expression of free speech and the freedom to  assemble and that limit is violence.   I know that the work of our intelligence community is difficult and  often goes without notice by the American public.   I firmly believe that the actions of those who hold security  clearances as they go about their lives should reflect the higher goals  and values of nation.   To engage in violent acts against persons engaged in constitutionally  protected activity on account of race, religion, color, gender, sexual  orientation, language of original, immigration status, or creed is an  affront to the framers of the Constitution for this great nation.   The actions of Mr. Miselis put at risk not only his career, but also  the reputation of people who hold national security clearances.   The awarding of security clearances to contractors must be better  managed and the consequences for involvement in activities that would  be cause for dismissal from the armed services or any federal agency  should not go unnoticed.   I am committed to the task of building the capacity and resources of  the intelligence community to ensure that our nation's national  security and national defense are all that they need to be.   I ask that my colleagues support the Jackson Lee Amendment made in  order for consideration of H.R. 6237, and support the underlying bill.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member and the  chairman for bringing this bill to the floor and working on some very  important items, including diversity, outreach, HBCUs, issues of which  I have worked on as well. So I thank them very much, because bringing  the expertise of diversity to the national security and intelligence  community can only make us stronger.   Mr. Chairman, I have just left the Judiciary Committee where we have  been spending a period of time dealing with questions that wrap  themselves around the intelligence community and the importance of  preserving confidential sources and as well the importance of the  intelligence community as it relates to the ongoing Russian  investigation.   Equally important, of course, is to ensure that we have a community  that is well-recognized to have security clearances that are not  impacted by actions or views that would do harm to the American people.   My amendment adds to the sense of Congress in the bill that a re- review of a security clearance holder's credentials can be triggered by  his or her association or empathy with persons or organizations that  advocate, threaten, or use force or violence or any other illegal or  unconstitutional means in an effort to prevent others from exercising  their rights under the Constitution or laws of the United States or of  any State, on account of race, religion, national origin, disability,  or other impermissible factors, which maybe include LGBTQ, and whether  one is, in essence, considered different. That is the basis of I think  a very positive addition to this legislation.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record an article published on July 6,  2018, by PBS FRONTLINE about Michael Miselis, an active member of the  California-based Rise Above Movement, RAM, as a well-known violent  white supremacist group.     He Is a Member of a Violent White Supremacist Group; So Why Is He        Working for a Defense Contractor With a Security Clearance?         This story is part of an ongoing collaboration between       ProPublica and FRONTLINE that includes documentaries       scheduled to begin on PBS in August 2018.  [[Page H6146]]         If you've witnessed or experienced hate crimes, harassment       or incidents of bias, you can use this form to send       information to FRONTLINE, ProPublica and other partners in       the Documenting Hate project.        Update, July 6, 2018: One day after being exposed as a       member of a violent white supremacist group, Michael Miselis       has lost his job as an aerospace engineer. In an email,       company spokesman Tim Paynter told ProPublica and FRONTLINE       that Miselis ``is no longer an employee of Northrop       Grumman.'' Paynter did not say whether Miselis was fired or       resigned from his position.        There likely isn't such a thing as a ``typical'' violent       white extremist in America in 2018. Still, Michael Miselis--a       University of California, Los Angeles doctoral student with a       U.S. government security clearance to work on sensitive       research for a prominent defense contractor--makes for a       pretty unusual case.        For months, ProPublica and FRONTLINE have been working to       identify the white supremacists at the center of violent       demonstrations across the country, including the infamous       Unite the Right rally last August in Charlottesville,       Virginia. The Rise Above Movement, a Southern California       group that expresses contempt for Muslims, Jews, and       immigrants, became a focus of that effort. ProPublica and       FRONTLINE were able to quickly identify a number of the       group's leaders, and find evidence that put them in the       middle of violence in Charlottesville and Berkeley,       California, among other places.        But one seeming member of RAM was harder to nail down. In       video shot in Charlottesville, a bearded, husky man is seen       in a red Make America Great Again hat with his hands wrapped       in tape that came in handy for the brawling that occurred       that day. During one encounter, the unidentified man in the       red hat pushed an African-American protester to the ground       and began pounding on him, video of the episode shows;       moments later, a known RAM member choked and bloodied a pair       of female counter-protesters. The possible RAM member also       had turned up in video shot during hours of combat at a Trump       rally in Berkeley, as well. Wearing protective goggles to       ward off pepper spray, the man fought alongside RAM members,       wrestling one protester to the ground and punching others.        Ultimately, ProPublica and FRONTLINE determined the man in       the violent footage was Miselis, a 29-year-old pursuing a       Ph.D. in UCLA's aerospace engineering program. Miselis was       identified using video footage and social media posts, and       reporters confirmed his identity in an encounter with him       outside his home. In interviews, a number of California law       enforcement officials said Miselis was a member of RAM.        In addition to his scholarly pursuits, Miselis works as a       systems engineer for Northrop Grumman, the giant defense       contractor with a plant in Redondo Beach, California.        When approached by ProPublica and FRONTLINE in front of his       home in Lawndale, a small city south of Los Angeles, Miselis       said he ``didn't know anything'' about what happened in       Charlottesville.        ``I think you got the wrong guy,'' he said before driving       off in his car.        Miselis did not respond to questions about his involvement       with RAM. He did not answer additional questions sent by       email.        Several current and former employees at Northrop Grumman       told ProPublica and FRONTLINE that Miselis has received a       security clearance to work in a computer modeling and       simulation group within Northrop's aerospace division. Such       security clearances are typically issued in a two-step       process. The federal Office of Personnel Management conducts       an investigation into the individual. The agency's findings       are then forwarded to a special unit within the Department of       Defense, which makes the final determination on whether the       person should receive a clearance, a status that often allows       the person access to classified or otherwise sensitive       information concerning national security.        Public affairs officers at the Defense Department declined       to comment about Miselis and his security clearance. The       federal personnel management office referred questions       regarding Miselis to Northrop Grumman.        Northrop Grumman did not respond to several requests for       comment. However, interviews with current and former Northrop       employees, as well as an internal email, make clear the       company knows of Miselis' actions in Charlottesville and       involvement with RAM. Miselis informed his superiors about       his contact with reporters from ProPublica and FRONTLINE, as       is required by any individual who holds a higher-level       security clearance, the people said.        So far, it seems, the company has taken no action against       Miselis, who remains employed.        Keegan Hankes, an analyst with the Southern Poverty Law       Center who follows RAM closely, said he was surprised that       nothing has been done about Miselis' employment and security       clearance.        ``It's ridiculous,'' Hankes said.        ``They're openly motivated by racism,'' he added of RAM.        As ProPublica has previously reported, RAM first surfaced       publicly last spring and has quickly established itself as       one of the violent groups in the resurgent white supremacist       scene; members, who regularly train in boxing and martial       arts, have been documented engaging in a string of melees.       Founded in early 2017 by Robert Rundo, a Queens, New York,       native who served an 18-month prison sentence for stabbing a       rival gang member six times during a 2009 street fight, the       group's core membership is small--15 to 20 young men--but       capable of real menace, ProPublica's reporting has shown.        Rundo has recruited followers from the Orange County and       San Diego chapters of the Hammerskin Nation, the country's       largest Nazi skinhead gang, and one the authorities say has       been behind at least nine murders. One of the Hammerskins who       joined up with RAM, Matthew Branstetter, went to prison in       California in 2011 on hate crime charges for robbing and       assaulting a Jewish man in an Orange County park. The attack       left the victim with ``a concussion, broken jaw, eye socket       fracture, broken nose, cracked ribs, severe facial bruising,       and cuts and bruises to his body and face,'' according to a       news release issued by county prosecutors at the time. Other       RAM members have spent time in prison and Los Angeles County       jail on charges for robbery, firearms possession and other       offenses.        The FBI has taken notice. Several law enforcement officials       familiar with the bureau's work said agents have opened a       formal investigation into RAM. In a statement, the FBI said:       ``While the FBI neither confirms nor denies the existence of       an investigation, our agents investigate activity which may       constitute a federal crime or pose a threat to national       security. Our focus is not on membership in particular groups       but on criminal activity. The FBI cannot initiate an       investigation based solely on an individual's race,       ethnicity, national origin, religion, or the exercise of       their First Amendment rights, and we remain committed to       protecting those rights for all Americans.''        Since last August, local prosecutors have brought charges       against a handful of participants in the Charlottesville       rally, successfully convicting several men so far, including       activists on both sides of the clashes. Now federal       authorities are targeting neo-Nazi James Alex Fields, the man       accused of killing counter-protester Heather Heyer and       injuring more than two dozen others. Federal prosecutors       recently filed 30 charges against Fields, including 28 hate       crime charges.        A native of Stockton, California, Miselis earned a       bachelor's of science degree in mechanical engineering from       UCLA in 2011. UCLA's website today lists Miselis as a Ph.D.       candidate in the engineering department's hypersonics and       computational aero-dynamics group. After FRONTLINE and       ProPublica began making inquiries about Miselis, the school       issued a brief statement saying only that he is technically       on leave from the doctoral program.        Miselis was clearly prepared for the unrest in Berkeley in       the spring of 2017. At the Trump rally he wore protective       goggles to ward off pepper spray or tear gas, taped his hands       up like a boxer, and wore a gray active-wear uniform, as did       several other RAM members that day. In video footage reviewed       by ProPublica and FRONTLINE, Miselis can be seen fighting       alongside other RAM members.        The event turned into a multi-hour street battle pitting       Trump supporters, including fascists and extreme-right       activists, against counter-protesters, some of them militant       anti-fascists. Police made 20 arrests, confiscating knives,       pepper spray, a stun gun, an axe-handle and many wooden dowel       rods, which were used as clubs by participants. At least       seven people were transported to the hospital for their       injuries. Rundo, RAM's founder, was arrested and detained for       assault on a police officer, but Alameda County District       Attorney Nancy O'Malley declined to file charges. ``We       determined we didn't have enough evidence to prove the       charges beyond a reasonable doubt,'' said Teresa Drenick, an       Alameda County deputy district attorney.        After the Berkeley rally, Miselis traveled across the       country to take part in the massive white supremacist       convergence in Charlottesville, where his activities were       photographed and recorded on video, both by professional       journalists and other people equipped with smart phones. At       the rally on Aug. 12, pictures taken by photojournalist Jason       Andrew show Miselis walking alongside two other RAM members       previously identified by ProPublica, Tom Gillen and Ben       Daley.        At roughly 10 a.m., Miselis and the other RAM members       confronted counter-protesters a few steps away from       Emancipation Park, where white supremacists had gathered       beneath a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.        Daley attacked two female counter-protesters, kicking and       punching them, a scene captured in video obtained by       ProPublica and FRONTLINE. He wrapped both hands around the       throat of one woman, throttling her until she fell to the       ground, blood seeping from a gash on her temple. The other       woman emerged from the incident with a laceration across her       forehead. On video, she screams as blood drips across her       face.        Miselis jumped into the fracas. In addition to FRONTLINE       and ProPublica, National Geographic produced video       documenting the brawl.        A sequence of pictures shot by photojournalist Edu Bayer,       who was on assignment for The New York Times, show Miselis       hurling what appears to be a can of soda at counter-      protesters. In one photo he flexes his biceps muscles in       celebration.        It's this sort of street combat that worries the SPLC's       Hankes. In his view, such brazen  [[Page H6147]]       criminal activity should be a red flag for both Northrop       Grumman and the Pentagon.        ``I can't believe that participation in an organized white       supremacist group focused on street-level violence wouldn't       jeopardize your security clearance,'' Hankes said.     Mr. Chair, this gentleman was at Charlottesville  speaking loudly, intimidating my fellow alumni and students, having  gone to the University of Virginia School of Law. I spoke to the  president and officers there, and the students were patently and  conspicuously intimidated and frightened. But more importantly, this  individual had a security clearance, and he worked for a defense  contractor.   My amendment would ensure that the American people have strong  national security, a strong intelligence community, but individuals who  receive a clearance can receive it appropriately and that they  themselves will not be a jeopardy to the citizens of the United States.   Mr. Chair, the Jackson Lee Amendment No. 3, designated as No. 33 on  the Rules Committee rosters, amends the Sense of Congress already in  the bill on the importance of re-review of security clearances held by  individuals by adding consideration of whether the security clearance  holder's association or sympathy with persons or organizations that  advocate, threaten, or use force or violence, or any other illegal or  unconstitutional means, in an effort to prevent others from exercising  their rights under the Constitution or laws of the United States or of  any state, on account of race, religion, national origin, disability,  or other impermissible factors.   Mr. Miselis has a security clearance and worked for Northrup Grumman,  a major defense contractor, at the time he engaged in physical violence  against persons protesting racism and white supremacy in  Charlottesville, Virginia.   In May 2018, Northrup Grumman was informed of Mr. Miselis' membership  in RAM and the violent assaults he initiated while he was in  Charlottesville participating in activities in support of white  supremancy, which were captured on video and in photos.   Mr. Miselis worked for a government contractor and held a security  clearance authorizing him to work on projects that were of vital  interest to our nation and its defense.   Northrup Grumman did not dismiss him until the story broke earlier  this month with media reports on the violence Mr. Miselis engaged in at  white supremacists' rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia.   The violence of RAM members has been a hallmark of the group and its  members.   The Anti-Defamation League describes RAM as a white supremacist group  whose members believe they are fighting against a ``modern world''  corrupted by the ``destructive cultural influences'' of liberals, Jews,  Muslims and non-white immigrants.

There is a limit to the expression of free speech and the freedom to  assemble and that limit is violence.   The awarding of security clearances to contractors must be better  managed and the consequences for involvement in activities that would  be cause for dismissal from the armed services or any federal agency  should not go unnoticed.   This Jackson Lee Amendment is an opportunity to make a clear  statement to government contractors that the awarding of contracts that  involve the security of our nation should not be taken lightly and that  Congress will not tolerate the allocation of federal funds to  contractors who employ persons who advocate or participate in acts  against persons on account of their race, creed, religious beliefs, or  gender who engage in constitutionally protected activities.   I ask that my colleagues support this Jackson Lee Amendment to H.R.  6237.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/4\ minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff), the ranking member of the  Intelligence Committee.    Mr. Chairman, RAM, the group that I have indicated  in the letter I submitted for the Record, of which the gentleman in the  article was a member of, is characterized as operating like a street  fighting club. Members actively train to do physical battle with their  ideological foes and have been involved in violent clashes during  political rallies and demonstrations.   RAM members consider themselves a part of the alt-right. RAM's  membership has deep roots in California, with the Skinheads and other  individuals who face serious criminal charges. But more importantly,  RAM consists of several dozen loosely affiliated neo-Nazi racist  Skinheads.   It is not an emphasis on that group. This amendment is broadly  structured to deal with protecting the security clearance process and  the American people. I join with my colleagues in hoping and helping  the intelligence community to be able to have the resources for the  backlog of thousands and thousands of those seeking security clearance,  so that they can be particular and astute to ensure that for the people  who receive it, it is a benefit. It is, in essence, a gift. It is an  honor to receive a security clearance.   The clearance that I and Members of Congress have, we hold with the  highest respect and dignity. Therefore, if it is given to anyone, it  should be given in that manner.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I will be returning to the House  Judiciary Committee. We have been there for more than 8 hours, maybe 11  hours, with Peter Strzok, an FBI agent who has been vindicated by the  inspector general regarding the Hillary Clinton emails, which were  found to have no effect on any violation or any criminal violation, but  yet Republicans have continued over and over again to hold these  hearings without addressing the question of jailed children snatched  from their families.   Today, we understand that Health and Human Services is holding back  the reunification of some of these babies under 5 to their moms and  their dads on the basis of unrelatable or unnecessary predicaments of  these parents, where they have been incarcerated for misdemeanors  regarding immigration.   This is the administration that really has no caring and no love for  people.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, the World Health Organization had the  delegation from this Nation, not representing me, fight a country that  was trying to support breastfeeding, and they wanted to condemn Ecuador  for a resolution supporting breastfeeding for mothers around the world.   What are we coming to? Where is the heart in this administration?                            ____________________
