 Madam Speaker, two weeks ago, I spent additional time  at the U.S. border, which I think, by a mile, is the biggest crisis  this country has.   It has recently been brought to my attention that the Rio Grande  Valley sector, where I was at, recently had 20,000 people a week  processed. They had never seen such a thing.   What difference does this make? The more people come across, first of  all, it probably means more illegal drugs crossing the border, which  means more fentanyl, which is the reason why we have 90,000 deaths a  year in this country. Since they're processing more people, it means  less Border Patrol agents to guard the more rural areas of the border,  which means more people coming across.   Finally, we are in a situation, we found out, down there, when they  turn people over with COVID to the nongovernmental entities, those  entities do not have secure facilities, and it means people are flowing  into this country who we already know have COVID.   Please, during this appropriations season, please add more money to  our Border Patrol so we can get a handle on these ridiculously high  numbers.                            ____________________
