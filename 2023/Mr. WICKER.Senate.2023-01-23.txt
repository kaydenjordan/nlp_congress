 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Mrs. Victoria  Long Rubin, a Knauss Sea Grant fellow on the U.S. Senate Committee on  Commerce, Science, and Transportation.   Mrs. Ruben's scientific expertise has informed the committee's  efforts in a meaningful and professional way. She has worked on several  pieces of legislation that are important to improve the safety and  economic security of the Nation, including the TORNADO Act, the  Maritime Technical Advancement Act, and the first authorization of the  Minority Business Development Agency. Her contributions will help  improve tornado forecasting to keep Americans safer from deadly storms,  promote maritime education at our Nation's community colleges, and  increase support for rural minority businesses.   I would like to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Mrs.  Rubin for all of the fine work she has done and wish her luck in the  years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Ms. Ashlyn  Spector, a Knauss Sea Grant fellow on the U.S. Senate Committee on  Commerce, Science, and Transportation.
