 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 1585.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1585, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization  Act of 2019, will not only reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act,  also known as VAWA, but will also strengthen and expand the act's  critical programs.   VAWA's grant programs provide communities across America the crucial  assistance they need to combat crimes of domestic violence, dating  violence, sexual assault, and stalking. H.R. 1585 builds on this  foundation by enhancing the services available under these programs and  by expanding their reach to include vulnerable populations who are  victims of these crimes.   VAWA, which is not gender exclusive, addresses the needs of men and  women, children, persons with disabilities, homeless persons, and LGBTQ  people, among others. Importantly, H.R. 1585 includes new protections  for transgender individuals.   The range of individuals VAWA helps is broad and should be as diverse  as our communities around the country. I am pleased that this  reauthorization continues our commitment to this important principle.   This bill reauthorizes a wide variety of grant programs, including  programs to help prosecute violent crimes against women and to provide  services to sexual assault victims. It also strengthens various  nondiscrimination provisions, provides greater protections for  survivors during the prosecution of perpetrators, expands services for  older survivors of abuse, authorizes programs specifically targeted  toward rural areas, strengthens protections against gun violence in  domestic abuse situations, and expands the jurisdiction of some Tribal  authorities over non-Indians who commit certain crimes on Tribal lands.   I want to thank Ms. Bass, the chair of the Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism, and Homeland Security and the sponsor of this legislation,  for her outstanding leadership in the effort to reauthorize VAWA.   I also want to thank Ms. Jackson Lee for her longstanding and  tireless efforts over the years to protect and strengthen the act.   Thanks to their efforts and the efforts of many others, this bill  will not only continue the progress enabled by VAWA as originally  enacted, but it will also make the act an even more effective tool in  addressing the horrible scourge of domestic violence.   Mr. Chair, accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy       and Commerce. I acknowledge that your Committee will not       formally consider H.R. 1585 and agree that the inaction of       your Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any       future jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in       H.R. 1585 which fall within your Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill.

Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chair, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chair: I write concerning H.R. 1585, the       ``Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019,'' as       amended, which was additionally referred to the Committee on       Energy and Commerce.        In recognition of the desire to expedite consideration of       H.R. 1585, the Committee on Energy and Commerce agrees to       waive formal consideration of the bill as to provisions that       fall within the rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on       Energy and Commerce. The Committee takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and that the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. I also request that you support my       request to name members of the Committee on Energy and       Commerce to any conference committee to consider such       provisions.        Finally, I would appreciate the inclusion of this letter in       the report on the bill and into the Congressional Record       during floor consideration of H.R. 1585.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                     Washington, DC, March 14, 2019.

Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 1585, the       ``Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019.''       Because you have been working with the Committee on Financial       Services concerning provisions in the bill that fall within       our Rule X jurisdiction, I agree to forgo formal       consideration of the bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.

The Committee on Financial Services takes this action to       forego formal consideration of H.R. 1585 with our mutual       understanding that, by foregoing formal consideration of H.R.       1585 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and       that our Committee will be appropriately consulted and       involved as this or similar legislation moves forward. Our       Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation and request       your support for any such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and, while I understand that       your letter to the Committee and my response will be included       in the Committee report on H.R. 1585, I would ask that a copy       of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 1585.

Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                     Washington, DC, March 18, 2019.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chair, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chair: I write concerning H.R. 1585, the       ``Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019,'' as       amended, which was additionally referred to the Committee on       Natural Resources.        I will allow the Committee on Natural Resources to be       discharged from further consideration of the bill. I do so       with the understanding that the Committee does not waive any       jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in       the bill that fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. I also       request that you support my request to name members of the       Committee on Natural Resources to any conference committee to       consider such provisions. Finally, please include this letter       in the report on the bill and into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor.        I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation       and look forward to continuing to work with you as this       measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                     Raul Grijalva,      Chair, Committee on Natural Resources.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                     Washington, DC, March 14, 2019.      Hon. Mark Takano,      Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Takano: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       1585, the ``Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of       2019.''        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on       Veterans' Affairs. I acknowledge that your Committee will not       formally consider H.R. 1585 and agree that the inaction of       your Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any       future jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in       H.R. 1585 which fall within your Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you       as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Veterans' Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, March 18, 2019.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I write concerning H.R. 1585, the       Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019. As a       result of your having consulted with us on provisions within       H.R. 1585 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I forego any further       consideration of this bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.        The Committee on Veterans' Affairs takes this action with       our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of       H.R. 1585 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over       subject matter contained in this or similar legislation and       that our committee  [[Page H3006]]       will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or       similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Further I request your       support for the appointment of conferees from the Committee       on Veterans' Affairs during any House-Senate conference       convened on this or related legislation.        Finally, I ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on       this matter be included in the bill report filed by the       Judiciary Committee, as well as in the Congressional Record       during floor consideration, to memorialize our understanding.            Sincerely,                                                       Mark Takano,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Demings), the vice-chair of the Crime, Terrorism, and  Homeland Security Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), a distinguished member of the Judiciary  Committee.     Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Mrs. McBath), a distinguished member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Wexton).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan), the assistant Democratic leader.     Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Brown).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Bass), the chair of the Crime, Terrorism and Homeland  Security Subcommittee and the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Speier).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence), a co-chair of the Bipartisan Women's Caucus.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader.    Mr. Chairman, every year approximately 7.9 million women  are victims of rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate  partner. An average of three women are killed every day by a current or  former intimate partner.   These grim statistics underscore the crucial need for us to act  without delay to reauthorize VAWA and to enhance and expand the act so  that it is even more effective than it has proven to be in the past.   The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019 is  comprehensive and inclusive legislation that I hope will earn  bipartisan support in the long tradition of this important law.  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join with me in voting for this  critical legislation today.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I support this amendment, which would require the  preparation of a GAO report on the return on investment for legal  assistance grants for victims.   Studies show that the efficiency of the legal system improves  whenever victims receive assistance by legal professionals. This  amendment would provide a vehicle to help us assess the effectiveness  and ramifications of providing legal assistance for victims,  particularly in the areas of housing, medical needs, and employment  social welfare programs.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I support this amendment, which would direct the preparation of a  report on the status of women in Federal incarceration. The amendment  would also direct the Attorney General to work on a model of gender- responsive transition for incarcerated women, including the development  of a national standard on prevention with respect to domestic and  sexual violence.   According to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, very little current  data exists on the status of incarcerated women in Federal custody.  This amendment will allow us to better respond to the needs of  incarcerated women, and it will provide us with vitally important data,  for oversight purposes.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I support this amendment to improve the  reporting requirements for States and localities that receive funding  under the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program.   As we all know, because of the increased awareness of the potential  for DNA evidence to help solve criminal cases, the demand for DNA  testing continues to grow nationwide. Crime laboratories now process  more DNA than ever before. In recognition of this, H.R. 1585  reauthorizes the Debbie Smith Act, which I helped to originate.   This amendment directs States and localities to report information to  the Attorney General on best practices for reducing the backlog of DNA  evidence. The emphasis on best practices is a good one, as it will help  ensure that the backlog is cleared in as expeditious and efficient a  manner as possible.   Madam Chair, I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I support this amendment which expands the  types of grants that can be funded to combat violent crimes on college  campuses.   Evidence-based research on the neurobiology of trauma has shown the  effectiveness of using victim-centered, trauma-informed interview  techniques when investigating allegations of sexual harassment, sexual  assault, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking.   This amendment seeks to ensure that campus personnel who investigate  these types of cases are trained in up-to-date, research-based methods  for interviewing victims and handling cases in a sensitive manner.   Madam Chair, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I support this amendment because it improves  and enhances the special Tribal criminal jurisdiction pilot project  created by VAWA in 2013 specifically to benefit Alaska Natives.   For over 5 years, the special Tribal criminal jurisdiction has given  qualifying Tribes across the United States the authority to prosecute  non-Tribal members for certain offenses.   This year's reauthorization of VAWA would extend that jurisdiction to  more crimes, including dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.   Tribes across the country have been effectively exercising their  authority under VAWA and keeping their communities safe. This amendment  would ensure that Alaska Native villages that qualify are also able to  exercise this type of jurisdiction. It is only fair that they be  allowed to do so.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I support this bipartisan amendment, which would ensure that entities  focused on addressing sex trafficking maintain eligibility for CHOOSE  grants.   We know that sex trafficking is a serious problem in the United  States. At this time, CHOOSE grants are available for the purpose of  enhancing the safety of youth and children who are victims of or  exposed to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault,  stalking, or sex trafficking, and for preventing future violence.   This amendment ensures that we continue to provide critical funding  to address sex trafficking in our communities. I urge my colleagues to  support this amendment.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I support this amendment, which would make  entities found by the Attorney General to have fraudulently misused  VAWA grant funds ineligible to apply for future grants for up to 5  years.   This amendment tries to guard against the potential misuse of grant  funds, but it does so in a way that safeguards due process, after  reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing.   Any misuse of funds that does not rise to the level of fraud, or that  is merely an error, is insufficient to make a grantee ineligible for  funds and only places a temporary, but sufficiently lengthy, ban on  receipt of funding.   Because this is a commonsense measure, I urge my colleagues to  support this amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Malinowski) having assumed the chair, Mr. Rose of New York, Acting  Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union,  reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill  (H.R. 1585) to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
