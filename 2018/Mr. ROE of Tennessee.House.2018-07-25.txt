Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 5693, as  amended, the Long-Term Care Veterans Choice Act. This bill would expand  long-term care opportunities for veterans by allowing the Department of  Veterans Affairs, VA, to cover the cost of a medical foster home for  certain veterans.   Medical foster homes are private homes in which a trained caregiver  provides round-the-clock care to a small group of individuals. Medical  foster homes have proven to be a popular, safe, and cost-effective  alternative to traditional nursing homes, particularly for veterans who  prefer a more familial, less institutional care setting.   However, VA is unable to cover the cost of care for a veteran  residing in a medical foster home. That is true even for veterans who  VA would otherwise be required to pay for in a more expensive nursing  home.   As a result, VA estimates the department pays more than twice as much  for nursing home care than it otherwise would. The Long-Term Care  Veterans Choice Act would help address that issue, and, in doing so,  ensure that veterans have the flexibility to choose the long-term care  setting that feels most comfortable for them.   The bill would also create a Veterans Economic Opportunity and  Transition Administration to be led by an under secretary for Veterans  Economic Opportunity and Transition. Investing in education and  employment opportunities for our Nation's veterans is one of VA's most  important but least recognized missions.   Today, programs concerning education and employment are embedded  within the Veterans Benefit Administration, which, understandably,  devotes most of its time, attention, and resources on disability  compensation-related issues and backlogs that rise and fall with time.   Creating a new administration within VA to house education and  employment programs will ensure that those programs receive the focused  leadership, time and attention that they deserve.   To offset the medical foster home and Veterans Economic Opportunity  and Transition Administration provisions of the bill, it would also  authorize a temporary increase in the VA home loan funding fee for  interest reduction loans when refinancing homes. This bill is sponsored  by Congressman Clay Higgins from Louisiana. As an engaged member of the  Subcommittee on Health, Clay is a champion for his  [[Page H7174]]  fellow veterans, and I thank him for his leadership on this  legislation.   I am also grateful to my good friend and former senior committee  member, Dr. Brad Wenstrup from Ohio, who has sponsored the Veterans  Economic Opportunity and Transition Administration provisions of this  bill. As a veteran and physician, Brad has championed veteran  employment and education issues because he knows better than most how  important it is that veterans transitioning from combat zones come home  to meaningful education and employment opportunities.   I thank him for his efforts and urge all of my colleagues to join me  in supporting this bill today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins), an active member of the VA committee and  one of the primary sponsors of this, an Army veteran, and reserve  police officer.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup), my good friend, who has been an active member  of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and chairs the Subcommittee on  Health. I appreciate his leadership on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, this is commonsense legislation  that will allow veterans in certain circumstances to stay in a less  intense nursing home facility. We hear this all the time: ``I don't  want to go to a nursing home.'' This will allow veterans who have  earned these benefits to reside outside there. It is much less  expensive for the VA, and it is also much  [[Page H7175]]  better for the veteran if they can do this.   A second part of this bill, which is to create the fourth  administration, is not more bureaucracy, but to focus on the education  benefits and transition as Active-Duty military leave and enter  civilian life again. I think it is one of the most critical things we  do. A seamless transition from Active Duty to an active job, I think,  will help reduce veteran depression, suicide, dependence, and other  things. That is why we wanted to do this.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5693, as amended,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  2353.   The number one thing I hear from employers back home is that they  have good-paying jobs available, but they can't find workers who have  the necessary training or soft skills. I have also heard that employers  are not engaged early enough in the process, and the reforms in today's  bill should help address these concerns.   This bill helps encourage community partnerships and engages  employers to help ensure employment opportunities for future  generations. Most importantly, by Congress acting today, we show our  commitment to help those for whom college may not be the right fit by  offering them better, skills-based learning opportunities that will  ultimately result in jobs to support themselves and their families.   I am also pleased to see the inclusion of provisions from the  American Dream Accounts Act, which I introduced last week with  Representative Moulton. This will allow community partnerships to help  engage kids to plan and save for technical education programs. A  program in Elizabethton, Tennessee, is doing just this, with promising  results.   With these important reforms, we can help ensure that the labor force  of tomorrow has the skills it needs today. I urge support.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  6311. This bill makes a number of welcome changes to our broken  healthcare system to put patients back in charge of their healthcare.   I have been a physician in rural east Tennessee for over 30 years.  Mr. Speaker, we heard about how the tax bill had caused these premiums  to go up. Let me tell you what has happened in the State of Tennessee.  Since the ACA took place, the number of options went down and the  premiums have gone up, on average, 175 percent.   Let me say this: In the hospital where I practiced, a university  hospital, the majority of people with uncollectible debt are people  with insurance.   Let me say that again. The majority of uncollectible debt are people  with insurance.   Why? Because the out-of-pockets and copays are so high that they  can't afford it. And that is one of the reasons we need this bill.   And let me say, also, that a year ago I was facing a major operation,  Mr. Speaker, a cancer operation. I had the ACA insurance. I looked at  what my out-of-pocket was, what my copays were, what my premiums were,  and what my employer, the taxpayers of this country, paid for me. I  would have been better off if I had just written a check for the cost  of that cancer operation that I had. I had an insurance card. I didn't  have insurance coverage. That is what I had with the ACA so-called  insurance.   Now that the mandate is gone--I want to say this--we heard: Oh,  goodness, the sky is falling because premiums are going to go up. In  Tennessee, our premiums actually went down 10 percent from the major  insurer in the State, Blue Cross, and for that we are eternally  grateful in my State.   What we want, now that the mandate has gone, this bill will help  create a more affordable copper plan option which will allow the tax  credit recipients to use their credit to pay for coverage. This is  something we should look at to expand. In fact, Senator Alexander and  Congressman Duncan have introduced legislation which would allow  consumers to purchase an off-market plan when there are limited  options.   In my district, in the First District of Tennessee, almost as many  people, within a few hundred, paid the penalty tax, whatever Justice  Roberts wanted to call it, as actually got a subsidy. Almost as many  people paid it. So what good is it?   All of these changes are long overdue. Americans have dealt with the  crushing costs associated with ObamaCare, and we are trying to give  them as much relief as possible. By passing this bill today, we will  return control to patients to determine what level of coverage is best  for them and their families rather than the government making an  arbitrary decision for them.   If we had a system of healthcare in this country where it was patient  centered and market driven, these changes would be unnecessary.  Instead, we still have a top-down, government-knows-  [[Page H7664]]  best approach to healthcare that continues to cost folks all across the  country more than they can afford.   I support the provisions in this bill because I have worked very hard  to get to it.    Mr. Speaker, I will finish by saying that the  current system under ObamaCare is unsustainable, and we must increase  affordable options or the system will collapse.   Finally, I will put it this way: We need to put patients and  doctors--no insurance companies and bureaucrats--in charge of  healthcare decisions in this country. That is what a health savings  account does, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this.
