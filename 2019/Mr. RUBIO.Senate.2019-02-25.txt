 Mr. President, I wish to honor and commend one of  the dedicated and hard-working small businesses that does so much for  the State of Florida. As chairman of the Committee on Small Business  and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small business that  exemplifies the unique American entrepreneurial spirit. Today, it is my  distinct pleasure to name Magellan Transport Logistics, of  Jacksonville, FL, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Founded in 2006, Magellan Transport Logistics is a Service-Disabled  Veteran-Owned Small Business dedicated to providing its customers with  a wide range of transportation needs. Tom Piatak founded Magellan  Transport Logistics based on many of the same qualities that he learned  while serving in the U.S. Army. A graduate of the U.S. Military  Academy, Tom instills into the company the values he learned from West  Point, as well as from his service as a combat engineer during  Operation Desert Storm.   Today, Tom serves as chief executive officer and chairman of  Magellan. Under his guidance, the company has quickly become a leader  in supporting the vast transportation needs of its clients. Tom and his  team have gained much of their success by recruiting some of the most  talented leaders and logistics professionals in the industry. By  instituting four core values of entrepreneurship, ownership mentality,  innovation, and transparency within the company, Magellan has created a  positive culture that has translated into rapid growth and success. In  March of 2018, Magellan announced the acquisition of a 47,000-square- foot warehouse and the hiring of 100 employees over the next 5 years,  furthering its investment in the Jacksonville community.   Magellan is known for its dedication to its employees and as a pillar  of the Jacksonville community. The company offers complete logistics  and transportation services, both local and international, by truck or  airplane, while also providing warehousing services and supply chain  management. Magellan has built strong relationships with its clients by  embracing the ``no man left behind'' principle that Tom learned during  his time serving our country in the U.S. Army.   As a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Magellan is  committed to hiring veterans and participating in community service  events to benefit America's veterans. This past December, Magellan  sponsored 20 wreaths for National Wreaths Across America Day, as well  as assisted with unloading and placing the memorial wreaths on the  graves of fallen servicemembers. Magellan actively supports the Wounded  Warrior Project, and their commitment to veterans in their community is  a testament to the company's values.   In addition to their continued service to our Nation's veterans,  Magellan has also aided the community in disaster relief efforts.  Following Hurricane Michael in the fall of 2018, Magellan  [[Page S1436]]  worked directly with FEMA, providing 40 trucks and three staff members  as part of the disaster recovery effort. They also partnered with  Operation BBQ Relief, a nonprofit organization, to deliver meals and  supplies to families throughout impacted areas.   Tom Piatak and Magellan are regularly honored for their success and  dedication to the Jacksonville community. During the 2017-2018 NFL  football season, the Jacksonville Jaguars honored Magellan as their  Veteran Business Owner of the Week. The Jacksonville Business Journal  recognized Tom and the team at Magellan for their efforts to hire  veterans, and the Wounded Warrior Project awarded the company with the  Wounded Warrior Certificate of Recognition in 2017.   Tom Piatak's work to grow Magellan Transport Logistics while staying  committed to his community and veterans represents the dedication to  service for which Florida entrepreneurs are well known. Through hard  work, Tom and his team at Magellan Transport Logistics have built a  successful business grounded in strong values, while serving as an  example of superior corporate citizenship. I would like to congratulate  Tom and the entire team at Magellan Transport Logistics for being named  the Senate Small Business of the Week. I wish them good luck and look  forward to watching their continued growth and success.                            ____________________
