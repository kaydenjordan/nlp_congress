 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Schneider).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Landsman) as he provides his statement.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and submit  extraneous materials for the Record.    Mr. Speaker, the State of Qatar poses the gravest and  most profound threat to the national security interest of the United  States in the Middle East.   This was true before October 7, but it is now undeniable in the  aftermath of the unspeakable horrors of that day, where at least 32  Americans were brutally murdered, and another 12 Americans were taken  hostage.   Qatar poses a threat to the U.S. not through its military. Nor does  Qatar threaten the U.S. by training and directly equipping terrorist  groups the same way that the Ayatollah and the mullahs from Iran do.   Qatar threatens the U.S. even though it does not call Israel the  Little Satan, nor does it call the United States the Great Satan. It is  true that Qatar does not loudly proclaim that it wants to wipe Israel  off the map, just as it does not publicly chant ``death to America.''  But it is precisely because Qatar does not espouse extremism so boldly  and brazenly that this tiny but wealthy emirate is so dangerous to our  national security interests.   The nature of this threat is best understood by comparing and  contrasting the two main state sponsors of Hamas--Qatar and Iran.   Qatar has access to the corridors of power and the ability to mingle  with world elites. Iran, on the other hand, simply does not have the  ability to influence our glad-hand Western leaders.   Iran does not get involved and invited to the G20. Qatar does.   Iran does not attend Davos. Qatar does.   Iran does not host the forward headquarters of CENTCOM, Central  Command. Qatar does.   The Iranian Ayatollah can't simply get President Biden on the phone  for a friendly call, but the Qatari Emir can, and does.   The Islamic Republic of Iran in its current form run by the mullahs  would  [[Page H6044]]  never be designated as a major non-NATO ally. Yet just last year,  President Biden bestowed this prestigious designation on the State of  Qatar.   Qatar has used its enormous influence with the West to help terrorist  groups, such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Taliban. Qatar's singularly  unique support for Hamas has proved invaluable for the bloodthirsty  terrorist group.   Hamas leaders not only planned the unprecedented error campaign from  luxury villas and penthouse suites in Doha, provided to them by the  State of Qatar, but they have been allowed to promote blood libels  daily since October 7 on Al Jazeera, the propaganda outlet owned and  ultimately controlled by the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al  Thani.    For years and continuing to this day, Qatar has promoted and  whitewashed Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Taliban, among other terrorist  groups, including with fawning coverage on Al Jazeera. Qatar also  effectively serves as the diplomatic arm for these terrorist groups,  including when they claim to act as mediators with the terrorists from  the West. And, of course, Qatar also funds these and other terrorist  groups, sometimes overtly and sometimes quietly.   But Qatar has also provided direct and material support to Hamas here  in the United States, such as aggressively protecting the terrorist  group by successfully killing legislation that was to enact harsh  sanctions on the state sponsors of Hamas.   As I will soon explain in more detail, the State of Qatar was single- handedly responsible for killing the Hamas Sanctions Bill, which was  first introduced in 2017 by my friend and colleague, Congressman Brian  Mast.   The State of Qatar not only killed the Hamas Sanctions Bill in the  115th Congress, but after it was reintroduced in 2019, the emirate once  again killed the legislation in the 116th Congress.   While it is impossible to know for sure, it is distinctly possible  that if Qatar had not gone to such extraordinary lengths to protect  Hamas from sanctions, that the atrocities of October 7 might never have  happened.   Almost the entire Beltway foreign policy establishment, not just  Democrats but also Republicans, have gotten Qatar wrong for the past  25-plus years. The establishment's conventional wisdom is that although  almost all outward indicators show that Qatar is firmly aligned with  Iran, Islamists, and jihadists, the supposed truth is that they are  secretly moderate and pro-America.   Unfortunately, our foreign policy elites have chosen to cling to the  illusion of who the Qataris privately claim to be, while ignoring the  harsh reality of who they actually are.   It is simply not true that Qataris are reluctantly close with Iran,  Islamists, and jihadists, engaging with these malign actors out of  necessity or to help the United States and the West.   The overwhelming evidence shows that, in fact, the Qataris are true  believers.   Qatar's apologists claim that the emirate only has dealings with Iran  because they jointly own the North Field, the world's largest natural  gas reserve.   Yet time and again, Qatar acts in sync with Iran across the Middle  East, where both regimes just so happen to try and destabilize the same  governments, especially those that are strong allies of the United  States. And Qatar and Iran both sponsor some of the same terrorist  groups, including Hamas and Hezbollah.   There is no support for Ambassador Al Thani's allegation. The most  generous interpretation for the emirate is that Qatar wanted to serve  as the home for Hamas headquarters and its leaders, and that it  convinced the Obama administration to allow them to become joined at  the hip with this bloodthirsty terrorist group.   Similarly, Qatar is also no reluctant supporter of Hamas. Qatar's  Ambassador to America, Meshal Al Thani, implied in a Wall Street  Journal op-ed earlier this month that the United States essentially  requested Doha to host Hamas' world headquarters and to provide  sanctuary to the terrorist group's leaders.   The best evidence that Qatar genuinely supports Hamas and generally  shares the same world view and goals as the terrorist organization is  what you see when Hamas leaders, such as Ismail Haniyeh or Khaled  Mashaal, meet with the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.   As you can see in photos of their meetings, the Emir warmly embraces  Mashaal, terrorists with blood on their hands, and the Emir clearly  demonstrates with his smile and body language that he considers these  Hamas thugs to be his close, personal friends.   There are two other powerful indicators that Qatar agrees with the  radicals who hate America.   The first is the ruling Al Thani family's close relationship with the  longtime spiritual leader of the International Muslim brotherhood,  Yusuf Al-Qaradawi. The other is something available for anyone to see  for themselves, the stomach-turning content of Al Jazeera, the Qatari  state-owned propaganda outlet.   Until Yusuf Al-Qaradawi died last year at the age of 96, he was not  only the top religious cleric for the Muslim Brotherhood, but also for  the ruling Al Thani family.   The Qatar Foundation, which is actually a private company owned by  the Emir of Qatar and his parents, worked closely with Qaradawi for  decades, spending hundreds of millions of dollars to export and promote  Qaradawi's deranged brand of Islam.    To understand just how much of an extremist Qaradawi was, all you  would have to do is watch the old broadcasts of his show on Al Jazeera.  Over the years, Qaradawi used his platform to endorse violent jihad  against the West, and he specifically advocated for terrorist attacks  on Israel, as well as attacks on U.S. soldiers in Iraq.   Qaradawi also praised the Holocaust and repeatedly used his show to  promote the mass murder of Jews.   On his Al Jazeera show in 2011, Qaradawi proclaimed that Allah used  Adolf Hitler to wreak the Holocaust upon the Jews as divine punishment,  and he praised Hitler for putting Jews in their place.   Qaradawi was also well known for praising Hamas during the Al Jazeera  broadcasts. Unfortunately, the entirety of Al Jazeera is now well known  for praising Hamas.   Al Jazeera has served as an unabashed cheerleader for Hamas for  years, and especially since October 7. The broadcasts of state-owned Al  Jazeera have been rife with explicit cheerleading for Hamas and  spreading blood libels about the Jewish State.   Not only does Al Jazeera reveal its repugnant biases in hailing Hamas  as the resistance and casting Israel as the occupiers, but among its  earliest reporting on Hamas' October 7 terrorist attack was a story  praising the brutal kidnapping as ``humanitarian,'' under the headline,  ``Activists praise the resistance's humanitarian treatment of an  Israeli woman and her children.''   In the time since, Qatar's propaganda outlet has continued to  interview top Hamas leaders, often in-studio in Doha, allowing them to  promote dangerous falsehoods designed to incite viewers against not  just Israel, but also America and the West.   For years, Hamas has tried to sell the West a fiction, the idea that  there is an armed wing and a political wing of the terrorist  organization. Well, it is safe to say that since October 7, Al Jazeera  has become the media wing of Hamas.   If someone wants to know about Qatar's true foreign policy positions,  all they need to do is check out Al Jazeera's Arabic language coverage.                                time  1945    That way, it wouldn't be a surprise to anyone that Qatar's Ministry  of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on October 7 that holds Israel  solely responsible for the mass murder of 1,200 innocents and the  kidnapping of another 200-plus.   Earlier this month, at a Gulf Cooperation Council gathering, Qatar's  Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani doubled down on this position when  he had the audacity to condemn the world for allowing Israel supposedly  to be above the law, as if a nation should not be allowed to defend  itself from mass murders at its border, even as the Emir himself very  much treats the Hamas leaders as above the law by refusing to arrest  them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ogles).    Mr. Speaker, time is finite because once a minute is  gone, it is lost forever.   I have countless examples here of how Qatar's influence is so deep in  Washington, D.C. That includes hacking. That includes targeting  committee chairmen. Most importantly, the biggest example that is read,  The Gray Lady, The New York Times, is a business partner, to an extent,  with Hamas.   It is time that we stop treating Hamas' benefactors and the  government as an ally. The time is now for the U.S. to force Qatar to  choose between the U.S. and Hamas. They cannot embrace both. If they  choose to continue embracing Hamas, we must treat them as we treat any  other state sponsor of terrorist groups that murder Americans.  [[Page H6046]]    Mr. Speaker, the State of Qatar poses the gravest and most profound  threat to the national security interests of the United States in the  Middle East.   This was true before October 7th, but it is now undeniable in the  aftermath of the unspeakable horrors of that day--where at least 32  Americans were brutally murdered and another 12 Americans were taken  hostage.

Qatar has been able to hoodwink the State Department and the foreign  policy ``elites'' for years through a two-tiered, carrot-and-stick  approach.   They lavish money in all directions to purchase ``friends'' and  supporters. And when they encounter the principled few who can't be  bought off, Qatar has used its considerable espionage capabilities to  target those critics it views as harmful to their interests.   In short, Qatar's influence strategy can be summed up in three  words--buy or destroy.   The ``visible'' portion of Qatar's strategy has been to spread  billions and billions of dollars across the U.S. Here's a srnall  sampling of Qatar's largesse inside the U.S.:   A total of $6 billion given to our universities, which doesn't  include the millions it gives to radical, anti-American campus groups,  such as Students for Justice in Palestine.   An unknown dollar amount, but probably hundreds of millions of  dollars in total, to think tanks.   Millions and millions of dollars to The New York Times--yes, the  ``Gray Lady''--in the form of co-hosting dubious ``Art for Tomorrow''  conferences in Doha, as well as sponsoring other New York Times  junkets, such as its ``Oil and Money'' conferences.   Since 2017, Qatar has engaged at least 75 lobbying and PR firms,  according to the FARA website, and it has paid these firms  approximately $225 million, for an average of $3 million paid to each  registered FARA agent.   And most recently, Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar  Investment Authority, or QIA, ``invested'' $200 million dollars to  purchase 5 percent of Monumental Sports Entertainment, founded and run  by Ted Leonsis, and which is the parent company of the NBA and NHL  franchises right here in Washington, D.C., the Wizards and the  Capitals.    Qatar's lavish spending habits on lobbyists and now for sportswashing  have garnered at least some media attention. But the dirty secret is  that it is the darker side of Qatar's ``buy-or-destroy'' approach that  has probably been even more effective.   Qatar has engaged in hacking operations to intercept the  communications of Americans whom the wealthy emirate believes to be  harmful to its interests, reportedly by hiring firms such as Global  Risk Advisors, founded and owned by former CIA agent Kevin Chalker, to  plan and orchestrate these so called ``hack-and leak'' operations.   In recent years, Qatari espionage activities have used hacked  materials to smear a long list of powerful and influential figures,  including both former and current U.S. government offIcials.   Here are a few examples of the American critics of Qatar that the  emirate went after through targeted dissemination of hacked materials  to friendly media outlets:   the former Homeland Security Advisor to the President, Fran Townsend;   a former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Mark Wallace;   the former Deputy National Security Advisor, Elliott Abrams;   the former acting head of the Central Intelligence Agency, Michael  Morell: and   the then-sitting Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed  Royce.   The decision to target Chairman Royce is as stunning as it was  brazen. But here is the cold, hard reality: a foreign government that  sponsors numerous terrorist organizations used American citizens and  others to intimidate and neutralize one of the most powerful U.S.  government officials in matters of foreign policy, who at that time was  the Chairman of this body's Foreign Affairs Committee.   Although Qatar has never publicly stated why they unleashed their  espionage forces on Chairman Royce, the reason seems obvious.   It was to protect Hamas.   In late 2017, Chairman Royce's committee unanimously passed the Hamas  Sanctions Bill, whose findings mentioned two state sponsors of Hamas-- Iran and Qatar. It was no secret at that time that Qatar's top priority  was killing the legislation, and Qatari lobbyists were swarming Capitol  Hill, desperately attempting to halt the bill.   Just a few months later, in early 2018, Qatar's high-priced PR agents  worked in cahoots with media outlets, including The New York Times, to  smear Chairman Royce--a good man, known and loved by many in this  body--with splashy ``news'' stories that created false narratives  through the use of hacked materials.   What makes the whole operation to smear Chairman Royce even more  outrageous is the very significant ethical conflict of the primary  media outlet that relied on hacked materials to do Qatar's bidding--The  New York Times.   What the ``Gray Lady'' did not mention in any of the many stories it  published based on emails hacked by Qatar is that The New York Times  was in business with Qatar.   In fact, Qatar and Brookfield had reached an agreement to purchase 42  percent of the New York Times Building in Times Square by January 2018.   The New York Times also neglected to mention in these stories placed  by Qatar's Intelligence services that Qatar had been lining the pockets  of The New York Times for at least several years by this time, with  untold millions of dollars for ``sponsoring'' junkets hosted by The New  York Times.   So when the tiny but wealthy emirate needed to ``teach a lesson'' to  any other Congressman or Senator thinking of criticizing Qatar--or even  Hamas--the State of Qatar turned for help to its own business partner,  The New York Times, which dutifully published a hit piece smearing the  then-current Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.   The hit pieces that Qatar generated had the desired effect.   Even though the Hamas Sanctions Bill, H.R. 2712, had been unanimously  passed by the Foreign Affairs Committee in November 2017 and was  expected to easily pass a Floor vote in this body.   But after the Qataris successfully weaponized hacked materials to  smear Chairman Royce, the Hamas Sanctions bill died a quiet death,  never even making it to a Floor vote.   Could anyone imagine the Chairman Royce scenario playing out the same  way, but with different countries or a different target?   For example, if Russia had targeted a Democratic Congressman or  Senator that same way, does anyone doubt that the media and foreign  policy ``elites'' would have been up in arms?   Or if it had been Iran smearing a Democratic Congressman or Senator  with hacked materials? This is yet another example of the unique threat  posed by Qatar.   There's no other nation that would be so daring as to intercept the  communications of prominent Americans--let alone high-ranking U.S.  government officials--that also has a cozy relationship with top media  outlets or that has financial ties to a wide array of prominent and  influential Americans.   Who in academia would dare step up to criticize Qatar for openly  targeting American critics, including U.S. government officials?   Not likely someone affiliated with Harvard, which has received at  least $17 million from Qatar.   Probably not anyone affiliated with Northwestern University, which  has raked in over $600 million from Qatar.   The same goes for anyone affiliated with Georgetown University--which  has received over $800 million in Qatari cash--or Cornell University,  which Qatar has paid a staggering $2 billion.   The top ranks of the think tank world are also surprisingly reluctant  to criticize Qatar--which is no surprise given the millions upon  millions of dollars that Qatar spreads to think tanks.    And in case you might think that major law firms would be outraged at  a foreign government hacking the communications of its American critics  and then weaponizing those hacked materials, that has certainly not  happened with Qatar.   Among the law firms retained by Qatar is Covington, a law firm that  acts as personal counsel to President Biden.   Three Covington partners serve as the trustees of Biden's Vice  Presidential Archives.   Covington partner Dana Remus was the first White House Counsel in  this Administration, and before that, she was the general counsel for  the Biden 2020 Presidential campaign.   Another Covington partner, Robert Lenhard, served as the lead outside  counsel for the Biden 2020 Presidential campaign.   And Lenhard's wife, Viveca Novak, was an editor at McClatchy News  when that outlet was publishing stories based on materials hacked by  Qatar in 2017-2018.   Even with its tentacles everywhere in American society, the State of  Qatar is looking to extend its influence operations into one of the  last areas in the U.S. that has been immune from foreign influence-- American professional sports.   The Qatar Investment Authority has purchased 5 percent of Monumental  Sports Entertainment, the parent company of the NBA and NHL franchises  right here in Washington, D.C.--the Wizards and the Capitals.   Over the past month, I have sent multiple letters about QIA's  proposed investment to the NBA, the NHL, and Monumental Sports.   All three of them responded to my initial letters with dismissive  replies, and then the NBA and Monumental ignored my following-up  letters sent two weeks ago, which included straightforward questions  that would shed light on some of the basic details regarding this  business deal that is obviously of significant importance to the  American public.   There should be no doubt that Qatar's sole motivation for its  investment into the Washington Wizards and the Washington Capitals is  to give it a uniquely powerful tool for further  [[Page H6048]]  cementing its death grip on our Nation's capital.   Congress must investigate this business arrangement. And because  Monumental's President, Ted Leonsis, is seeking $600 million in  taxpayer money to pair with Qatar's $200 million ``investment'' in  order to renovate the Verizon Center, Congress has a duty to  investigate.   As my time comes to a close, let me conclude by saying that it is of  paramount importance that the United States immediately begin to  reassess its relationship with the State of Qatar.   The only path forward is to pressure Qatar. It is unconscionable that  Hamas is holding as hostages nine Americans and almost 200 others,  while Hamas leaders live freely--and luxuriously--in Doha, just miles  from the United States Air Base at Al Udeid.   We owe it to the memory of the 32 Americans murdered on October 7.  And we owe it to the American people, whose government should not be  treating Hamas' benefactors as an ``ally.''   The time is now for the U.S. to force Qatar to choose between the  U.S. and Hamas. They cannot embrace both. And if they choose to  continue embracing Hamas, we must treat them as we treat any other  state sponsor of terrorist groups that murder Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 57 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, December 1, 2023, at  9 a.m.                            ____________________
