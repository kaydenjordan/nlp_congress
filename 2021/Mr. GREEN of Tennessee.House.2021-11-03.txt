 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, the RENACER Act,  that seeks to address the Ortega regime's dismantling of Nicaragua's  democracy, and seeks to support freedom-loving Nicaraguan's democratic  aspirations.   Frankly, Mr. Speaker, this legislation should have been passed months  ago when Congress had an opportunity to stop Ortega's campaign of  terror.   The world has watched in horror as Nicaragua, under Daniel Ortega's  authoritarian rule, has brutally consolidated into one-party  dictatorship. Joining the governments in Cuba and Venezuela, Ortega's  Nicaragua is now Latin America's third socialist regime.   On November 7, this coming Sunday, Nicaragua will hold a political  farce claiming to resemble elections. Meanwhile, Daniel Ortega holds  opposition candidates and over 140 political prisoners unlawfully  incarcerated. This includes people like opposition student leader  Lesther Aleman, a 23-year-old who cannot even walk due to the brutality  he has endured while illegally detained; or the husbands of Victoria  Cardenas and Berta Valle. They were leading presidential candidates who  planned to oppose Ortega in the next election, but found themselves  imprisoned in inhumane conditions and deprived of due process.   I have met with these brave women and I admire their courage and  advocacy for all of Nicaragua's unjustly detained.   I am a lead cosponsor of this bill, and I am grateful for the  leadership of Congresswoman Maria Salazar, and to the chairman of the  Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, Albio Sires, for his advocacy of the  plight of Nicaragua's political prisoners. I greatly appreciate his  friendship and his leadership.   This bipartisan bill will require targeted sanctions against corrupt  regime officials who have dismantled Nicaragua's democracy and  undermined these elections. It will also ensure the United States is  coordinating targeted sanctions with our Canadian and European Union  allies.   This legislation also expands oversight to ensure international  financing institutions are not enriching the corrupt regime while  making sure there are humanitarian exceptions. It requires a classified  report on Russia's nefarious activities in Nicaragua, whose  intelligence and security cooperation has dramatically expanded.   The United States must condemn the electoral charade taking place on  Sunday and urge our international partners to join us. America must  continue to be the beacon of freedom and stand against authoritarian  socialist leaders. We must hold the Ortega regime accountable for its  atrocious and destabilizing behavior.   We only need to look at Venezuela to see the consequences of ignoring  rising socialist authoritarianism. More can and should be done, and a  positive first step is passing this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join my colleagues in this effort. Mr.  Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H6151]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Salazar).    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would once again  like to thank my good friends, Mr. Deutch, Mr. Sires, and Ms. Salazar  for leading this measure. I am proud to join my colleagues in this  effort, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution expressing solidarity with the  freedom-loving Cuban citizens, condemning the regime's violence against  innocent protesters, and calling on our international partners to  pledge support for Cuban freedom.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my colleagues, Debbie Wasserman  Schultz, Mario Diaz-Balart, and Albio Sires for their work on this  resolution.   For over 60 years, Cubans have been held hostage by a tyrannical  dictatorship. The Communists have bankrupted a beautiful country,  condemning three generations to misery, and separating countless  families.   Castro's Cuba is also a threat to regional stability and security,  trafficking weapons to North Korea, propping up Venezuela's cruel  regime, and forging alliances with pariahs like Russia and China.   The Cuban regime is a cancer that has metastasized throughout Latin  America. Starting on July 11, tens of thousands of protestors across  the island demanded and pleaded for an end to the oppressive regime.  Some were even waving the greatest symbol of liberty known to mankind,  the American flag.   Since the protests began, Ranking Member McCaul has called on the  majority to consider a resolution standing  [[Page H6153]]  in solidarity with the Cuban people; each time it was blocked. I am  pleased that the leadership has finally allowed a measure to be  considered 4 months after the initial protests.   Meanwhile, the Senate unanimously passed a bipartisan resolution  reinforcing Congress' support for the pro-democracy movement in Cuba.  As Members of Congress and Americans, we have a moral obligation to  support them.   The United States remains committed to democracy and respect for  human rights in the Western Hemisphere, and this resolution urges the  international community to join us in these efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure and  advocate for many Cubans who cannot speak for themselves. Mr. Speaker,  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Salazar).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I would like to first associate myself with the comments that the  majority leader made at the beginning of his comments, where he  described a significant overlap, a place here where both parties can  come together to support this resolution. We all agree on the  importance of human rights.   I am hopeful a dialogue on the policy differences that he mentioned  occurs soon. The shift toward authoritarianism in Latin America  continues, and I believe most of this body recognizes Cuba's hand in  all of that.   Patria y vida. Cuba libre.   (English translation of Spanish is as follows: Country and life. Free  Cuba.)   Once again, I want to thank my friends, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, Mr.  Diaz-Balart, and Mr. Sires, for leading this measure, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
