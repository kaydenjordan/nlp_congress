 Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer for the  recognition, and I thank all who are here.   There are some things we experience in life that we can never prepare  for no matter how hard we try. Embarking on a life with the person you  love is one. Having, raising, and loving a child is another. And then  there is this one today.   I have been here 48 years. Perhaps to the dismay of hundreds of  distinguished Presiding Officers, I have delivered many floor  statements--some more eloquent than others, some less--but I have never  delivered a speech like this, and I so appreciate all of you indulging  me.   My friends and colleagues, Marcelle and I have such warm and lasting  memories of so many who have served in this Chamber, now and through  many years, including mentors from the first day I arrived here, like  Republican Senator Bob Stafford. He was our State's senior Senator when  I arrived here, and I watched him in awe. But he was a person who  looked me in the eye and said to this 34-year-old freshman: Patrick,  you are not my junior Senator; from here on, you are my Senate partner.  And what a difference that made.   In the last 48 years, the Senate has become a family to both Marcelle  and me. Here, we have found friends--some of our best friends--and  relationships that will last throughout our lifetime. It is also the  place where I had the privilege of fighting for Vermont--the place  where I was born, where I met Marcelle; the place where we started our  family; and the place to which, early in the new year, we will return  together, the State of our birth.   But I have a reverence for this place and its history, its  constitutional role that, as people, I know we all share. I have had  this sense of awe about the Senate from an early age. I used to walk to  the Capitol in my time here as a law student at Georgetown University  Law Center. I would sit in the Gallery. I would watch, transfixed, as  the Senate debated the most pressing issues of the day. Back then, I  could have never imagined that I would one day etch my name into one of  these desks, let alone that I would have the opportunity to cast well  over 17,000 votes, that I would serve with 400 Senators during my time  here.   Eight times the voters of Vermont--my neighbors, my friends, my  family--gave me the great gift of their faith in sending me here to be  their voice in the United States Senate, but what propelled me to run  was the belief that I understood the needs and values of Vermont and  thought it was time for a new generation to address them.   Dublin-born Parliamentarian Edmund Burke's speech to the Electors of  Bristol serves as my North Star. He said:         Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but       his judgment.    Burke also said that a representative ought not to sacrifice to you  his conscience.   After what many described at that time as an improbable win in a  State that had never elected a Democrat, never elected anybody as young  as I was, I began my time in the Senate in the aftermath of a  constitutional crisis. We faced a nation broken by the Watergate  scandal, the resignation of President Nixon, and an endless war in  Vietnam. As I leave in a few days, the Nation is coping with strains  and challenges of other kinds, including very real threats to the whole  concept of a working democracy, the sanctity of our Constitution, our  elections, and the strength of the rule of law.   Another thing I could never have imagined as that young law student  sitting up there in the Gallery was that one day this Chamber itself  and the Capitol would be stormed by a lawless and violent mob.   Now, the Senate can be the conscience of the Nation. Being elected  three times as President pro tempore, I felt I was entrusted as one of  many stewards of the time-honored norms and traditions which were  passed down over the years, which helped build trust, which helped the  Senate, when possible, to work through problems to get difficult things  done and to allow the Senate, at its best, to rise to the occasion and  serve as the collective conscience of the Nation. I have seen the  importance of acts of grace and political self-restraint that make the  Senate work.    When I arrived here, bipartisan cooperation was the norm, not the  exception. It was engrained in the fabric of what it means to be a U.S.  Senator.   Now, make no mistake, the Senate of yesterday was far from perfect. I  came here in 1975, and I realize several of you were not old enough to  vote at that time. In that body, there were still Senators who signed  the Southern Manifesto, who filibustered landmark civil rights laws. It  was a Senate of 99 people because there had been a tied race in New  Hampshire. So I was sworn in to serve alongside 98 other men--all men,  not a single woman out of 100--and I thought, boy, progress was a long  way away.   But the Senate I entered had one remarkable, redeeming quality: The  overwhelming majority of Senators of both parties believed they were  here to do a job, not just score political points or reduce debate  oratory to bumper sticker slogans. Issues like budgets and farm bills  and transportation bills had nothing to do with whether a Senator was a  Republican or a Democrat; it was all about the nature of our home  States.   Now, no one would accuse Bob Dole or Ted Kennedy or George McGovern  or Howard Baker or Paul Laxalt or so many others of being closet  Democrats or closet Republicans, but each one of them understood that,  to do our jobs the right way, we had to work together. And we did.   Republican leader Senator McConnell and I have worked together on the  Appropriations Committee. We passed our gavel back and forth on the  Foreign Ops Subcommittee depending upon who was in the majority, and we  worked together passing complex bills, but we worked with a sense of  common purpose and respect and incredible productivity because we had  that common purpose.   Now, of course, that did not mean there weren't times when both sides  fought like cats and dogs on the Senate floor, in an election campaign.  That was understood. But there were unwritten rules that applied, quite  different than they are today. Senators didn't engage in scorched-earth  politics because they knew they would return the day after the election  to a Senate that only worked if you found and stood on common ground.  The person you battled today might be someone you need to work with on  a different issue tomorrow.   Now, I will share something easily forgotten but something I learned  on the Agriculture Committee. I once overheard someone say in the  cloakroom that they had been out driving in the middle of nowhere.  Well, I thought to myself, if you are one of the people who live there,  you know it is always the middle of somewhere. And that was a bit of a  brainstorm.   For years, I had been traveling, when Senate recesses allowed, to try  to understand the world a little better, traveled to build some  relationships with other leaders in other countries, allies and  adversaries alike. From that very first codel onward, I found that  almost without fail, when Senators of both parties travel together,  their partisan differences dull and their shared perspective grows. You  see a country, and you see the country through each other's eyes, not  just your own.  [[Page S7794]]    So Dick Lugar and I came up with a new idea: Let's have a codel here  at home in the United States to help Senators understand that rural  States--whether they are north, south, east, or west--had a lot in  common, to make it clear that everywhere was somewhere and ``nowhere''  was just a place on a map you hadn't experienced yet. So we explored  those States together, having codels in each of the States--Republican  States and Democratic States--and would hear from the people there, but  more importantly, we got to know each other. We all became invested in  each other's success, legislative and personal.   I fear those days may be gone, but I pray just temporarily because if  we don't start working together more, if we don't know and respect each  other, the world's greatest deliberative body will sink slowly into  irrelevance and, Heaven forbid, become our own version of the House of  Lords.   I am especially proud of the work I have been able to do for Vermont  and for Americans across the Nation. Our distinguished leader here,  Senator Schumer, has heard more about Vermont than anybody from New  York ever has, and I thank him--I thank him, as a lifelong Vermonter,  for listening. Among them are things that came from Vermont--the  organic standards and labeling act. It was first blocked because it  would be crunchy granola. Well, it is a $60 billion industry in this  country now. Some crunch. Some granola.   We also enacted in this body the world's first ban on the export of  anti-personnel landmines. I started off having three votes backing me,  three or four votes. When it came to a vote--every desk carrying a  publication I helped write--the vote was 100 to 0 across the political  spectrum. I am very, very proud of that.   There were decades of work here to protect our beloved Lake  Champlain; supporting our farmers and forging new markets; revitalizing  historic town centers across our State; greatly expanding the Green  Mountain National Forest by more than 140,000 acres, protecting one of  Vermont's and actually one of America's greatest treasures; and  bringing resources to rebuild after disasters, from the devastation of  Tropical Storm Irene to the ravage of the COVID pandemic. I can never  thank enough the Senators of both parties who joined with me on that.   The Leahy War Victims Fund is helping innocent victims of war across  the globe. The Innocence Protection Act and the Kirk Bloodsworth  Program facilitate use of DNA evidence to convict the guilty and  exonerate the innocent. And there are the human rights protections of  the Leahy Law. I will be forever grateful that I had an opportunity to  be here to put those laws in place.   We strengthened and extended the Violence Against Women Act. I was  joined on that by colleagues on both sides of the aisle so we could do  it, making it the act it is today.   Then there is the work on the Voting Rights Act and the Freedom of  Information Act, where I joined with a prominent Republican, and I as a  Democrat said: Americans have a right to know what their government is  doing no matter which party is in control of the government; a longtime  effort to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba; and a landmark  program to remediate toxic sites in Vietnam left over from the use of  Agent Orange in the Vietnam war and to care for those who were exposed.  I thank the Presidents of both parties who backed me on doing that and  brought relief to a country that so desperately needed it.   We made our copyright laws more effective--the bill we were able to  write updated the copyright laws for the first time in 50 years--and  protected Americans' privacy from government overreach.   I mentioned the strengthening of the Freedom of Information Act  several times and in several ways. No matter what party we belong to,  we ought to know what our government is doing.   I have often been asked for the formula that I have used to get laws  like these across the finish line. I must admit, I allowed a little bit  of humor this morning at 1 or 1:30 when we filed the omnibus bill. I  should probably release what I told Chairman Schumer. I do it very  fairly. I treat every State the same, alphabetically starting with the  letter V--no. Let me be serious for a moment in case anybody thinks  that is what we do. We do it because Democrats and Republicans learn to  work together, and each side knows that they don't get every single  thing they want, but they can get most of the things the American  people need. It is far more important that the American people are  helped than any one of us individually.   It feels like yesterday that I walked into my first meeting with the  person who would become my first majority leader, ``Iron Mike''  Mansfield. The majority leader put a fundamental question to every new  Senator: Why do you want to be here--for the title or to make a  difference, to make lives better?   Although he was a soft-spoken man who listened more than he spoke and  rarely gave speeches on the Senate floor, Leader Mansfield dispensed  one piece of advice that made as enduring an impression as the question  he left to each Senator to answer for themselves. He said: ``Senators  should always keep their word.'' And I think of that every single time  I look at his portrait in the Mansfield Room.   It struck me that across all those weighty debates, navigating the  complicated and contradictory politics of a Senate and a caucus that  included everything from--remember when I came in--social conservatives  and segregationists to civil rights icons and prairie populists,  Mansfield succeeded because he understood that the currency of the  institution was actually trust, not ideology. ``Senators should always  keep their word.'' It was a simple formula, but it worked.   If you knew what commitments colleagues had made to each other, you  could count the votes. If you could count the votes, you could set the  agenda. If you knew the agenda, you could set the schedule. If you  could set the schedule, you could pass legislation and still send the  Senators home to be present in their States when it counted. And if 100  Senators were invested in keeping their word to one another, then  together we could keep our word to this institution and to the  Constitution.   So, Mr. President, I am going to leave here with the satisfaction of  knowing that I answered Leader Mansfield's question the best way I  could, in keeping with my conscience, and that I did what I could to  make a difference. And I leave here knowing above all that, right or  wrong, difficult or easy, I kept my word to Vermont and to each of you.   I want to thank my current staff and my staff throughout those 48  years. They have steadfastly stood by me and our shared goals to  deliver for Vermonters, for Vermont, and for all of our country.   I want to thank my family--our children, their spouses, our  grandchildren, my parents, who were here with me to start this journey  in my first Senate election, who I know watch over the entire Leahy  family today, as do Marcelle's parents, who were also there. What a  gift. What a gift to have had a mother and father who passed down to  their children and grandchildren not privilege but a powerful example.    One of the problems of being half Irish and half Italian is that  sometimes your emotions get under you.   And, of course, Marcelle. I was 19 and she was 17 when we met. I took  one look at Marcelle, and I knew I wanted to go on every journey  together. Sixty-three years later, we are still on that journey. She is  still my closest friend, my partner, and my anchor.   I have been uniquely blessed to have served with fellow Vermonters  who share my deep love and commitment to Vermont: Senator Bob Stafford,  Senator Jim Jeffords, Senator Bernie Sanders, Representative Peter  Smith, and, of course, Representative and now Senator-elect Peter  Welch. I couldn't be more grateful that Congressman and Senator-elect  Peter Welch will be carrying on after me with his own agenda.   I might mention, you are going to like and respect your new fellow  Senator. I think people will on both sides of the aisle. Our collective  efforts are why in so many ways Vermont continues to set an example for  the Nation to follow.   Marcelle and I will leave with the same conviction that brought us to  Washington in the first place: that the brighter horizons of tomorrow  hold the hope of the future. I leave still carrying that same sense of  reverence  [[Page S7795]]  about the place I felt as a law student. I have had and still have so  many ``pinch-me'' moments, and one of the last ones will be etching my  name inside my desk.   I will forever carry with me the enduring bond of my fellow  Vermonters, whose common sense and goodness are what I have tried to  match as their representative.   ``What a place this is.'' I wrote those words in the margin of my  legal pad as I rode back to our house late one evening after a very  full Senate session last year when we were working out COVID relief for  people who were still hurting. But what a place this is still.   I wondered what this 82-year-old President pro tempore of the United  States Senate would love to say to the 33-year-old version of myself  nervously walking for the first time onto the Senate floor. The 82- year-old President pro tempore would say to that 33-year-old brand new  Senator from Vermont: Don't lose that sense of awe, kid. Hold on to it.  Treasure it. Don't even for a minute forget what a privilege and a  responsibility it is to serve here.   I have never forgotten.   Sometimes when I drive past the Jefferson Memorial and I look at  Jefferson in his marble rotunda, I am reminded of the tension that was  and is America: imperfect people struggling to make reality out of  ideals that they fail themselves to meet but always, always keep on  trying. I think of my father, the self-taught historian. He loved to  share with me the twists and turns of times gone by, not to lift up  heroes as idols or point out their feet of clay but to find meaning and  purpose in the journey. Only first-generation immigrants like my  mother, whose parents had left homes where such journeys of change and  redemption were not possible, could have such a gleeful appreciation  for the fact that America wasn't a place but an idea--an idea of  unmatched possibilities ever in search of its own perfection, for new  and next generations to write.   I have so loved the privilege of being even a small part of this  story, America's story, and I have loved the privilege of working with  giants and heroes here in this Chamber.   I think of John Glenn and the Senate he represented. We came in  together. I wonder what he would think of how we carried the baton that  he passed on to the next generation. And then my mind flashes back to  John's internment at Arlington National Cemetery. In the chapel where  we gathered, at the end, the marine bugler played ``Taps.'' Imagine a  somber feeling. He paused and then, completing a request that Senator  Glenn had made himself but kept as a surprise, burst into ``Reveille.''  The mood in that chapel. That was John Glenn. There was a time to mourn  and remember what was lost, but there was always another mission,  another call to serve, another day. And that is how it has to be for  every one of us--every one of us--in this Chamber.   Yes, the Senate is broken in too many places. No, our institutions  are not what Mike Mansfield, Hugh Scott, Gerry Ford, Hubert Humphrey,  Ted Kennedy, John Stennis, and Barry Goldwater knew them to be.   But some of that change is good. A lot of it is tragic. It all is  simply what it is. I tell my colleagues: You can point fingers, or you  can point the way forward to something better. And that is America,  isn't it?   So I don't leave here today with a requiem for the Senate. I leave  here with a recipe and request for its renewal--not taps, but  reveille--always reaching, always repairing, never retreating, never  retiring from the journey. America doesn't stop. The Senate just keeps  turning. If we are lucky--if we are lucky--all of us get a chance to  help tilt the trajectory forward. Just remember what Mike Mansfield  said: Keep your word.   Thirty years ago, I visited a refugee camp after a war in that  country. I brought my cameras, as I do everywhere, so I can show people  back in Washington the human toll of this issue. Always on visits like  this, I would ask if it is OK to take someone's picture. To be a  displaced person is to have endured enough without somebody invading  your privacy. On this trip, a man encouraged me to take his picture. I  looked at his worn, weary face with a rangefinder. We sat and talked  afterward, and he said simply: Don't forget people like me. That black  and white picture has hung above my desk for 30 years since. Every day  I come to work, he is looking at me. He is saying: You don't know my  name; you don't speak my language; there is nothing I can do to help  you, but what are you doing to help people like me?   Conscience--that is what people are hungry for governments to stand  for. So now I am taking my ``conscience photo'' home with me, but I  know that man's eyes will keep watching all of us and all of you.   What a journey. What an abiding hope that someday after I am gone,  the Senate and both parties will come back together and be the  conscience of the Nation. You can build a Senate defined not by sound  bites, but one strength in the women and men with a sense of history  who insist our Republic move forward. For the sake of all those  children and their children and all children and all Americans, it not  only can be done, it has to be done.   Serving with 400 different Senators has been an honor, but  representing Vermonters has been the greatest honor. I am humbled and  always will be by their support. I am confident what the future holds,  but that is going to be up to all of you.   I will submit a list of the staff that made it possible over the  years for me to do this, people who deserve the credit for my  accomplishment.   I end with, to every one of my colleagues: Thank you.   (Applause, Senators rising.)   Mr. President, the Senate in a real sense is a family. I have come to  know and work with so many staff members and their families, reporters  and photographers, the Capitol Police--including the detail assigned to  me in my current role--the Senate pages, and the many others whose work  helps run and maintain this hallowed building.   I have been blessed with talented aides who were drawn to public  service for the right reasons--superb assistants like my current chief  of staff, J.P. Dowd; legislative director Erica Chabot, who now assists  Chairwoman Stabenow as the new staff director for the Agriculture  Committee; my current legislative director, Sherman Patrick; my deputy  chief of staff, Annette Gillis; my senior adviser, Kevin McDonald; my  State director, John Tracy, and Chuck Ross, before him; my longtime  chief foreign policy adviser, Tim Rieser; my longtime communications  director, David Carle; my two top aides leading the Appropriations  Committee staff, Charles Kieffer and Chanda Betourney; my press  secretary on the Appropriations Committee, Jay Tilton; my chief counsel  and staff director on the Judiciary Committee, Raj Venkataramanan; and  Bruce Cohen and Kristine Lucius, my former chief counsels and staff  directors on the Judiciary Committee; also former chiefs of staff Luke  Albee, Ed Pagano, Ellen Lovell and Paul Bruhn; former deputy chief of  staff Ann Berry, who now so ably serves as Secretary of the Senate;  Clara Kircher was deputy chief of staff before her; and so many others.   I will submit for the Record a full roster of those who have served  on my staff over the years. Marcelle and I thank them all, and we will  miss seeing them in the hallways and hearing rooms.   I ask unanimous consent that the names of all those who served on my  personal office and committee staff be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Abare, Kimberly A; Abrams, Evan; Acheson, Emma R; Ackerman,       Kenneth D; Adcock, Alexandra Brooke; Adegbile, Debo P; Aden-      Wansbury, Casey; Adkins, David C; Aeschliman, Katherine E;       Agnew, C.W.

Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that late last  night, I introduced the bipartisan, bicameral, fiscal year 2023 omnibus  appropriations bill. This bill invests $772.5 billion in nondefense  discretionary programs, including $118.7 billion--a 22-percent  increase--for VA medical care, and $858 billion in defense funding. It  provides $44.9 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine and our NATO  allies and $40.6 billion in emergency funding to assist communities  across the country recovering from drought, hurricanes, flooding,  wildfire, natural disasters, and other matters.   The pain of inflation is real, and it is being felt across the  Federal Government and by American families right now. Our bill offers  relief, certainty for the operations of the Federal Government through  the fiscal year, and the resources necessary to secure the national  defense. From funding for nutrition programs and housing assistance, to  home energy costs and college affordability, this is a strong bill that  directly invests in the American people. It is the product of  bipartisan negotiations in line with the framework announced by Vice  Chairman Shelby, Chair DeLauro, and myself last week, and I strongly  urge my colleagues to support it.   It fulfills the promise of bipartisan, landmark legislation that we  passed this year, and it fulfills our promise to the American people.   If you voted for the PACT Act to care for our veterans, you should  vote for this bill. If you voted for the CHIPS Act, you should vote for  this bill. If you voted for the infrastructure law, you should vote for  this bill. If you want to help families deal with the cost of heating,  childcare, college, and housing, you should vote for this bill. If you  actually want to fund the troops and their families at the levels of  the NDAA, you should vote for this bill. If you want to help the  victims of domestic violence, you should vote for this bill. If you  want to support law enforcement, you should vote for this bill.   I will have more to say about our bill tomorrow, but our choice is  clear. The alternative, a continuing resolution into the New Year, is  short-sighted and wholly unnecessary. It imperils our national  security, and it ignores the real pain and consequences of inflation.  Without a clear path forward based on a bipartisan framework, punting  on our responsibility to fund the Federal Government risks a full-year  continuing resolution. Under a continuing resolution, America gets left  behind. This is unacceptable.   We have a bipartisan bill. We have a path forward now. I look forward  to continuing to work with my friend, Vice Chairman Shelby, to pass  this bill out of the Senate as soon as possible.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the joint explanatory  statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 be  printed in the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                            ____________________     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I will  object.   I agree with the Senator from Florida that we have a responsibility  to help Americans in the wake of disasters. It does not matter if you  are a Republican or a Democrat or if you are from a Blue state or a Red  state. I still remember the devastation in Vermont when Tropical Storm  Irene hit. I remember the people who were hurt, the  [[Page S9595]]  property that was destroyed, and the roads, bridges, and homes that  needed to be rebuilt. When we needed help, the Congress came to our  aid. The Senate and the House enacted supplemental disaster assistance  to help us recover and rebuild.   That is why I included $27.1 billion in disaster assistance in the  omnibus bill I filed last night. This money will go to States that have  been hit hard this year by natural disasters, including Hurricane Ian.  The disaster supplemental included in the omnibus is nearly identical  to the bill the Senator from Florida is proposing now. The difference  is that the omnibus and the disaster supplemental in it has a clear  path to becoming law now. It is part of a bipartisan, bicameral bill  that we will pass, this week. We do not have time to play politics. We  need to enact this bill and get aid to the people in Florida and  communities across the country who need it most. I urge the Senator to  vote for it.   I object to the Senator's unanimous consent request.
