From the early days of this coronavirus pandemic, a public-private  partnership has employed scientists who have worked around-the-clock to  prevent people from getting infected by developing effective vaccines.  We saw the results of this effort in the last week with announcements  from Pfizer and now Moderna that their interim success rates were above  90 percent during their trials. Other companies have vaccines at  various stages of development, and there is hope that they will have  similar results.   Getting safe and effective vaccines across the finish line will be a  monumental achievement. Not only are we witnessing unprecedented  progress in creating an effective widespread vaccine, we are doing so  at a speed unheard of in modern medical history. This result is going  to be our best hope of getting out of this pandemic. With cases rising  not only across the country but around the world, we are running out of  other tools needed to stop the pandemic. I support the social  distancing, wearing of masks, PPE, the testing, but I believe  widespread inoculation is the most effective way to avoid the negative  economic and social impacts the virus and the subsequent mitigation  efforts have caused.   If these vaccines receive the expected emergency use authorization  from the Food and Drug Administration over the coming weeks and months,  this will be a testament to the unprecedented support that Congress has  provided for vaccine development, the Trump administration's innovative  approach to cut bureaucratic redtape with Operation Warp Speed, and the  commitment and ingenuity of our researchers, our scientists, and our  manufacturers.   The bipartisan CARES Act we passed here in March with unanimous  support provided $27 billion in funding for countermeasures against  COVID, including funding this important vaccine development research.  It was money well spent.   Thanks to these funds and the innovative approach by the  administration, we have been able to invest in building the  infrastructure to begin manufacturing these vaccines now so that if the  vaccine is approved, we can quickly ramp up distribution. This two- track approach also involves ramping up large-scale clinical trials,  which are critical to furthering our scientific understanding of this  pandemic and verifying the safety and effectiveness of these vaccines.  By using these CARES Act funds to invest in both research and trials  and in manufacturing at the same time, we are able to ensure that the  trials are thorough and methodical while also ensuring that if and when  approved there is vaccine ready to be distributed.   At the same time, the Food and Drug Administration, which is the  Federal agency responsible for approving the use of any new vaccine,  has followed the science and moved cautiously. As an example, they have  actually raised the standards needed for giving an emergency use  authorization for a vaccine. Normally, a vaccine only needs to be  effective about 50 percent of the time to be approved under the EUA,  emergency use authorization, but with the coronavirus vaccine, the  standard is much higher. By requiring companies to collect more  rigorous information to show longer lasting results from their  respective vaccine candidates, this will help ensure greater confidence  in the system, and I am grateful that they took these additional  careful steps.   This progress on the vaccine is critical for our economic recovery as  well. When a vaccine and therapeutics are authorized by the FDA and  made widely available and people actually get vaccinated, all of us  will feel safer returning to the workplace, retail establishments,  restaurants, churches and other places of worship, and schools, as well  as feeling more comfortable gathering with friends and family. We will  finally be able to truly reopen and get millions of Americans back to  work. In short, a widely available vaccine is our best bet for getting  America back to normal--something we all are desperate for.    Last month, I received a briefing from CTI Clinical Trial and  Consulting Services, a research company that is based in my hometown of  Cincinnati, OH. I met with them to receive a briefing to find out what  is going on in Ohio and what they are doing around the country. CTI is  a global leader in actually executing these clinical trials that we  always talk about for these vaccines and therapeutics, and right now  [[Page S7043]]  they are helping to conduct clinical trials on a potential COVID  vaccine being developed by a number of companies, including Janssen, J  & J. That is Janssen, Johnson & Johnson.   I was impressed with the progress they had made in their phase 1 and  phase 2 trials for the J & J vaccine, as well as the precautions they  are taking with regard to safety and privacy of participants in the  trial. In fact, the previous trial of this vaccine found 99 percent of  participants developed antibodies to COVID-19, and 98 percent still had  these antibodies in their system after 29 days. These are encouraging  figures that suggest that this J & J vaccine could prove to be another  useful tool in our toolkit to fight COVID-19, but there is still a lot  of work to be done.   CTI explained to me that they were focused on encouraging more people  to join their trials. I asked if it would help if I signed up, and they  said yes. Along with tens of thousands of other participants, I am now  joining this trial for this promising new vaccine. Like other  participants in the program, I don't know if I got the vaccine or if I  got a placebo.   I enrolled in this vaccine trial for really three reasons. One is  because I think it is so important to get this vaccine moving, and  these trials are really important to having that be successful. In my  view, again, the vaccine is the most effective way for us to defeat  this coronavirus.   Second, I enrolled because I want to encourage others to join these  trials around the country. If you are interested, go online. Look at  the vaccine trials and join one in your community.   And, third, I hope it will convince my fellow Ohioans and others that  getting vaccinated makes sense.   There is a concerning Gallup poll from last month that found that  only half of Americans are comfortable getting a COVID-19 vaccine, and  50 percent of us are not comfortable at this point getting vaccinated.  Actually, that is down from August, when two-thirds of Americans said  they would be willing to be vaccinated. This concerns me a lot.   I suspect in part this is happening because of the rhetoric we have  heard from some public officials casting doubt on a vaccine solely  because it may be approved by the Trump administration's FDA. We need  to stop playing politics with people's health and let the science and  the data determine which vaccines get approved. The FDA is being very  cautious, and they are being driven by science. Casting doubt on the  efficacy of a vaccine to try to score political points is dangerous and  needs to stop.   Public confidence in vaccines is declining at exactly the time that  we need these vaccines the most, and we need to do what we can to  reverse that trend. My hope is that being involved firsthand I can use  my platform as a Senator to help give people confidence that these new  vaccines being developed are safe and effective. The more folks  participate in these trials, the sooner they will have the complete  data to finalize this phase of the trial and move on to the FDA  approval process.   But just as important as participating in these vaccine trials is  what we do here as legislators in Congress to ensure that these  vaccines can continue to be developed and deployed safely and rapidly.  As I mentioned earlier, the CARES Act provided $27 billion for the  development of vaccines and other countermeasures--an unprecedented  show of support from Congress in our fight to defeat the underlying  healthcare challenges of this pandemic.   Unfortunately, since that bill was passed--the CARES bill--way back  in March, 8 months ago, we have been unable to focus on following up  with more funding to help this effort. Twenty-seven billion dollars is  a lot of money, but it only gets us so far in an effort like this.   What is also missing from the uses for this $27 billion is the  ability to fund a campaign to explain to Americans that there is a safe  and effective vaccine out there that they can use, that the science has  been followed. As I mentioned, there is a lot of vaccine hesitancy  right now. It existed before this pandemic. Unfortunately, it has been  made worse by some elected officials trying to politicize this science- driven effort.   That is why I am working on bipartisan legislation to support a  national awareness campaign that would empower HHS to cut through the  politics and promote the scientific advancements we have made in order  to increase public confidence.   We don't have a vaccine yet, and we are still facing another round of  shutdowns, with little help to support those who will be impacted by  it. That is the reason we need to do more here in Washington right now  to ensure that the healthcare response to this pandemic does not  falter, because this crisis is getting worse, not better. In my home  State of Ohio and around the country, we are seeing this, and we can  make a difference here.   In Ohio, the number of daily cases has risen every day for the past  month. We are seeing double what we saw just a few weeks ago.   In the United States, we are now averaging more than 100,000 new  cases per day, double the rate from just a month ago. As was predicted,  it got colder, people are inside more, and the third wave has arrived.   Unfortunately, we have also seen an increase in Ohio in  hospitalizations, in ICU patients, and, sadly, in fatalities along with  these new cases.   We need to do more to help the economy, too, and that is another  reason we need a COVID-19 package--a stimulus package--because as the  pandemic has worsened, the impressive economic growth we were seeing  has slowed down at a time when the economy is still down 10 million  jobs since February. What we really don't want is for those ten million  people, in a slowdown of the economy, to become long-term unemployed  and who may never reenter the workforce. And, of course, certain  sectors--like hospitality, restaurants, hotels, travel, and  entertainment--are still struggling badly, with no end in sight, as  some States are beginning to re-implement stricter social distancing  measurers and even to close down these facilities in order to counter  the spread of the virus   I am pleased that Leader McConnell has called on Congress to work  together to pass another coronavirus response package before the end of  the year. We can't afford to wait any longer. It is my hope that my  Democratic colleagues recognize the urgency as well. And I have talked  to a number of them who do. We have to refrain from making this  political at this point. We have to figure out how to work together to  find common ground.   If we can come together and get a bipartisan coronavirus bill passed  before the end of this year that takes a commonsense approach targeting  the healthcare challenges of this pandemic, targeting the economic  consequences, we will not only help the men and women working  tirelessly in labs around the country to fight this disease, but we  will send a clear message to the American people that we are with them  in this fight.   And as we continue this critical national effort, let's be sure we  are doing our part here in Congress to pass legislation that provides  additional funding for treatments and therapies for the coronavirus so  that we can be sure we have the resources necessary to treat the virus  as people get it.   The time is now for us to put the partisanship aside and figure out  how we can work together to give the American people a little hope, to  address the healthcare crisis that is in all of our States, and to  ensure that the economic consequences are not devastating for the  people we represent.   I urge my colleagues to come together and to do that before we recess  for the holidays.   I yield back my time.
