Facilities.--It has come to the Committees' attention that       additional resources may be needed for facilities challenges       in Menlo Park, California; Lakewood, Colorado; and Madison,       Wisconsin. The Survey is expected to expeditiously move       forward on innovative proposals for resolving these issues,       to address funding needs in the fiscal year 2018 budget       submission, and to keep the Committees informed of       developments related to these facilities.        Prohibition on Destruction of Records.--The Office of       Inspector General's report on Scientific Integrity at the       USGS Energy Geochemistry Laboratory in Lakewood, Colorado,       concluded the incident ``has had numerous real and potential       adverse impacts on customers, products, and the       organizational integrity of USGS.'' While the Survey has       taken action and closed the laboratory involved, it is       critical the Survey adhere to Federal records management       requirements and abide by the prohibitions against unlawful       removal or destruction of Federal records, specifically those       regarding, related to, or generated by the Inorganic Section       of this laboratory while USGS and Congressional assessments       of the incident are ongoing.

The Bureau is       urged to focus the program increase on roads and bridges in       poor or failing condition, particularly along school bus       routes. The Bureau is directed to consolidate the reporting       requirements for road maintenance contained in the House and       Senate reports and to report back to the Committees within 60       days of enactment of this Act.        Human Services.--The Bureau is directed to report back to       the Committees within 90 days of enactment of this Act on the       performance measures being used to monitor and track the       Tiwahe initiative's effectiveness in Indian Country.        Trust--Natural Resources Management.--The agreement       includes $11,266,000 for the Tribal Management/Development       Program and a $2,000,000 program increase for Alaska       subsistence programs as requested, including consideration of       funding for the projects and pilot programs referenced in the       budget submission including the Ahtna Subsistence Cooperative       Management Project and the Kuskokwim River Inter-Tribal       Fisheries Commission. Forestry is funded at $54,155,000 and       includes a $2,000,000 program increase for forest thinning       projects. The Fish, Wildlife, and Parks program is funded at       $15,203,000 and includes program increases of $545,000 for       Tribal hatcheries currently not receiving BIA hatchery       operations funding as outlined in the Senate report, and       $1,000,000 for fish hatchery operations. The ongoing Seminole       and Miccosukee water study is funded at $390,000 as       requested.        The Bureau is directed to enter into a formal partnership       with local Tribes and the United States Geological Survey to       help develop a water quality strategy for transboundary       rivers affected by discharges caused by mines across the       Canadian border.        Trust--Real Estate Services.--The agreement includes       $123,092,000 for real estate services and includes the       following program changes: a decrease of $6,893,000 as       requested from trust services; a $400,000 increase for the       historical places and cemetery sites program, including ANCSA       sites; and a $1,500,000 increase for settlement negotiations       and implementation related to water rights and Tribal trust       fishery resources in the Klamath Basin. The agreement does       not include the directive contained in the House report       regarding reservation boundary recognition.        The Committees are concerned that the Bureau does not       adequately maintain rights-of-way records. The Bureau is       encouraged to develop a plan to update and digitize its       inventory of records and to make the records publicly       available in a commonly used mapping format, consistent with       the guidance provided in Senate Report 114-281.        Bureau of Indian Education.--The agreement includes       $891,513,000 for the Bureau of Indian Education, of which:       $400,223,000 is for ISEP formula funds; $2,500,000 is for the       development and operation of Tribal departments or divisions       of education (TEDs) as authorized by 25 U.S.C. 2020;       $55,995,000 is for student transportation; $18,659,000 is for       early child and family development and should be used to       expand the Family and Child Education (FACE) program;       $80,165,000 is to fully fund Tribal grant support costs,       based upon updated information provided by the Bureau;       $66,219,000 is for facilities operations; $59,043,000 is for       facilities maintenance; $7,414,000 is for Tribal technical       colleges; $22,117,000 is for the Bureau-owned and operated       Haskell Indian University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic       Institute (SIPI), as requested; $34,783,000 is for       scholarships and adult education; $2,992,000 is for special       higher education scholarships; $24,763,000 is for education       program management; $10,287,000 is for information       technology; and $12,201,000 is for education program       enhancements, which shall be supplemented by the use of       $2,000,000 in prior year unobligated balances.        The Committees support efforts to revitalize and maintain       Native languages and expand the use of language immersion       programs and have provided $2,000,000 within education       program enhancements for capacity building grants for Bureau       and tribally operated schools to expand existing language       immersion programs or to create new programs. Prior to       distributing these funds, the Bureau shall coordinate with       the Department of Education and Department of Health and       Human Services to ensure that Bureau investments compliment,       but do not duplicate, existing language immersion programs.       The Committees also direct the Bureau to submit a report to       the Committees within 180 days of enactment of this Act       regarding the distribution of these funds and the status of       Native language classes and immersion programs offered at       Bureau-funded schools.        The Johnson O'Malley program is funded at the fiscal year       2016 enacted level. The Committees remain concerned that the       distribution of funds is not an accurate reflection of the       distribution of students. The Bureau is directed to       consolidate the program reporting requirements contained in       the House and Senate reports and to report back to the       Committees within 60 days of enactment of this Act.        The one-time increase of $5,100,000 provided in fiscal year       2016 to forward fund Tribal technical colleges has been       transferred to forward fund the Institute of American Indian       Arts in fiscal year 2017. The Bureau is encouraged to forward       fund Haskell and SIPI in future budget requests so that all       Tribal colleges are on the same funding schedule.        The Committees remain concerned about recent Government       Accountability Office (GAO) reports detailing problems within       the K-12 Indian education system at the Department of the       Interior, in particular as they pertain to organizational       structure, accountability, finance, health and safety, and       ultimately student performance. As the Department takes steps       to reform the system, the Secretary is reminded that future       support from Congress will continue to be based in large part       upon successful implementation of GAO report recommendations.       In particular, consistent with GAO report 13-774, the       Secretary is urged to reorganize Indian Affairs so that       control and accountability of the BIE system is consolidated       within the BIE, to present such reorganization proposal in       the fiscal year 2018 budget request, and to submit to the       Committees a corresponding updated workforce plan. Consistent       with GAO testimonies 15-389T, 15-539T, 15-597T, and any       subsequent reports, the Secretary is urged to personally       oversee immediate actions necessary to ensure the continued       health and safety of students and employees at BIE schools       and facilities.        Public Safety and Justice.--The agreement includes       $385,735,000 for public safety and justice programs, of       which: $202,000,000 is for criminal investigations and police       services and includes a $1,000,000 program increase to       implement the Native American Graves Protection and       Repatriation Act; $96,507,000 is for detention/corrections;       $10,319,000 is for law enforcement special initiatives; and       $30,753,000 is for Tribal courts.        Funding for Tribal justice support is restored to       $17,250,000, of which not less than $10,000,000 is to address       the needs of Tribes affected by Public Law 83-280. The       Committees remain concerned about Tribal court needs as       identified in the Indian Law and Order Commission's November       2013 report, which notes Federal investment in Tribal justice       in ``P.L. 280'' States has been more limited than elsewhere       in Indian Country. The Committees expect the Bureau to work       with Tribes and Tribal organizations in these States to fund       plans that design, promote, sustain, or pilot courts systems       subject to jurisdiction under Public Law 83-280. The Bureau       is also directed to formally consult and maintain open       communication throughout the process with Tribes and Tribal       organizations on how this funding supports the technical       infrastructure and future Tribal court needs for these       jurisdictions.        Community and Economic Development.--The agreement includes       $41,844,000 for community and economic development, of which:       $12,504,000 is for job placement and training; $25,304,000 is       for minerals and mining; and $2,235,000 is for community       development central oversight.        Executive Direction and Administrative Services.--The       agreement provides $228,824,000 for executive direction and       administrative services, of which: $10,006,000 is for       Assistant Secretary Support, $2,970,000 is for safety and       risk management; $23,060,000 is for human capital management;       $23,552,000 is for intra-governmental payments. The       reductions from Assistant Secretary Support and human capital       management reflect a transfer of school-related       responsibilities, personnel, and budget to the Bureau of       Indian Education.        Tribal Recognition.--The Committees acknowledge concerns       expressed by certain Tribes, States, and bipartisan members       of Congress regarding effects of recent changes in Tribal       recognition policy on standards that have been applied to new       applicants since 1978. Federal acknowledgement of a Tribe       impacts the Federal budget, other Tribes, State and local       jurisdictions, and individual rights. The Committees expect       the Administration to maintain rigorous recognition standards       while implementing a more transparent, efficient, and       workable process.                            CONTRACT SUPPORT COSTS         The bill provides an indefinite appropriation for contract       support costs, consistent with fiscal year 2016 and estimated       to be $278,000,000.                                 CONSTRUCTION                       (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)         The bill provides $192,017,000 for Construction. In       addition to the funding allocation table at the end of this       explanatory statement, the agreement includes the following       instructions:        Education.--The agreement includes $133,257,000 for schools       and related facilities within the Bureau of Indian Education       system, equal to the fiscal year 2016 enacted level after       accounting for a one-time funding surge in 2016 to reduce the       backlog of critical deferred maintenance projects. The Bureau       is directed to submit an allocation plan to the Committees       for campus-wide replacement and facilities replacement within       30 days of enactment of this Act.        Indian Affairs is directed to reallocate $2,000,000 from       prior year unobligated balances in order to accelerate       advance planning and design of replacement schools and school       facilities as proposed. Of these unobligated balances,       $1,000,000 shall be from the Construction Management activity       and $1,000,000 shall be from the General Administration       activity.        The agreement does not include an authorizing provision in       the House bill to reconstitute the National Fund for       Excellence in American Indian Education. The Committees       continue to strongly support innovative financing options to       supplement annual appropriations and accelerate repair and       replacement of Bureau of Indian Education schools, including       through the use of construction bonds, tax credits, and grant       programs. The Department is urged to revise  [[Page H3882]]       and resubmit its proposal to reconstitute the Fund and to       include authority for the Fund to facilitate public-private       partnership construction projects.   INDIAN LAND AND WATER CLAIMS SETTLEMENTS AND MISCELLANEOUS PAYMENTS TO                                  INDIANS         The bill provides $45,045,000 for Indian Land and Water       Claims Settlements and Miscellaneous Payments to Indians. In       addition, the Bureau shall reallocate $5,916,000 in prior-      year unobligated funds that remain after completion of       settlement requirements, for a total program level of       $50,961,000. The Department is directed to submit an       allocation plan for these funds to the Committees within 90       days of enactment of this Act.                    INDIAN GUARANTEED LOAN PROGRAM ACCOUNT         The bill provides $8,757,000 for the Indian Guaranteed Loan       Program Account to facilitate business investments in Indian       Country.                          ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS                      (INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)         The bill includes a rescission of $3,400,000 from prior       year unobligated balances within the Operation of Indian       Programs account. The Bureau is directed to take the       rescission from no-year funds within the Executive Direction       and Administrative Services activity.                             DEPARTMENTAL OFFICES                          OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY                          DEPARTMENTAL OPERATIONS         The agreement provides $271,074,000 for Departmental       Offices, Office of the Secretary, Departmental Operations.

Increases above the fiscal year 2016 enacted level within       the Leadership and Administration activity are outlined       within Senate Report 114-281 and include $225,000 as       requested for equipment associated with monitoring classified       computers and communications devices supporting the Office of       the Secretary and the intelligence community in light of       ongoing terrorist threats to national icons. Within the       Management Services activity, an additional $110,000 is       provided for law enforcement and investigative activities,       including combatting counterfeit activities and enforcement       functions related to Indian art and craftwork. The agreement       provides $11,000,000 for the Office of Valuation Services.       The agreement also includes an additional $968,000 as       requested within the Office of Natural Resources Revenue       (ONNR) to address certain Trust responsibilities for the       Osage Nation consistent with the services ONRR already       provides to every other Tribe.

Energy and Minerals Programs and Management.--The       Committees are aware that the Department is administratively       addressing many of the energy-related provisions and       directives contained in the House and Senate bills and       reports with the goal of increasing responsible and       sustainable energy development on Federal lands, while       providing economic benefits to States, Tribes, communities,       and the economy.        Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation.--The       Department is directed to work with the Office of Navajo and       Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) on a plan to close ONHIR and       transfer any remaining functions to another agency or       organization, as described in further detail under the ONHIR       heading within this explanatory statement.

The initial estimate was made       during formulation of the fiscal year 2017 President's       Budget, over 20 months before enactment of the appropriation.       This estimate was overstated because it was predicated on the       relevant inflation rate at the time--nearly twice the current       rate. Additionally, the initial estimate presumed average       historical prior-year payment information, which has now been       updated with current data from States and counties.                GENERAL PROVISIONS, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR                       (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)         The agreement includes various legislative provisions       affecting the Department in Title I of the bill, ``General       Provisions, Department of the Interior.''

Section 108 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to       continue the reorganization of the Bureau of Ocean Energy       Management, Regulation, and Enforcement in conformance with       Committee reprogramming guidelines.

Section 113 allows the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Bureau       of Indian Education to more efficiently and effectively       perform reimbursable work.        Section 114 addresses the issuance of rules for sage-      grouse.        Section 115 addresses National Heritage Areas.        Section 116 addresses the humane transfer of excess wild       horses and burros.

Congressional Budget Justification.--The Agency is directed       to continue to include the information requested in House       Report 112-331 and any proposals to change State allocation       formulas that affect the distribution of appropriated funds       in future budget justifications.        Reprogramming.--The Agency is held to the reprogramming       limitation of $1,000,000 and should continue to follow the       reprogramming directives as provided in the front of this       explanatory statement. It is noted that such reprogramming       directives apply to proposed reorganizations, workforce       restructure, reshaping, transfer of functions, or downsizing,       especially those of significant national or regional       importance, and include closures, consolidations, and       relocations of offices, facilities, and laboratories.       Further, the Agency may not use any amount of deobligated       funds to initiate a new program, office, or initiative,       without the prior approval of the Committees.        Within 30 days of enactment of this Act, the Agency is       directed to submit to the House and Senate Committees on       Appropriations its annual operating plan for fiscal year       2017, which shall detail how the Agency plans to allocate       funds at the program project level.        Other.--It is noted that the current workforce is below the       fiscal year 2016 level, therefore, the agreement includes       rescissions in the Science and Technology and Environmental       Programs and Management accounts that capture expected       savings associated with such changes. The Agency is directed       to first apply the rescissions across program project areas       to reflect routine attrition that will occur in those program       project areas in fiscal year 2017 and then to reflect       efficiency savings in a manner that seeks, to the extent       practicable, to be proportional among program project areas.       Amounts provided in this Act are sufficient to fully fund       Agency payroll estimates. The Committees understand that the       Agency routinely makes funding payroll requirements a top       priority, and the Committees expect the Agency will continue       to do so as it executes its fiscal year 2017 appropriation       and applies the rescissions. The Committees do not expect the       Agency will undertake adverse personnel actions or incentive       programs to comply with the rescissions. As specified in the       bill language, the rescissions shall not apply to the       Geographic Programs, the National Estuary Program, and the       National Priorities funding in the Science and Technology and       Environmental Programs and Management accounts. The Agency is       directed to submit, as part of the operating plan, detail on       the application of such rescissions at the program project       level.                            SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY                      (INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)         For Science and Technology programs, the bill provides       $713,823,000 to be partially offset by a $7,350,000       rescission for a net discretionary appropriation of       $706,473,000. The bill transfers $15,496,000 from the       Hazardous Substance Superfund account to this account. The       bill provides the following specific funding levels and       direction:        Research: National Priorities.--The bill provides       $4,100,000 which shall be used for extramural research       grants, independent of the Science to Achieve Results (STAR)       grant program, to fund high-priority water quality and       availability research by not-for-profit organizations who       often partner with the Agency. Because these grants are       independent of the STAR grant program, the Agency should       strive to award grants in as large an amount as is possible       to achieve the most scientifically significant research.       Funds shall be awarded competitively with priority given to       partners proposing research of national scope and who provide       a 25 percent match. The Agency is directed to allocate funds       to grantees within 180 days of enactment of this Act.        Additional Guidance.--The agreement includes the following       additional guidance:        Computational Toxicology.--The Agency shall follow the       direction under this heading in Senate Report 114-281.        Enhanced Aquifer Use.--The Agency shall follow the       direction under this heading in Senate Report 114-281.        Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS).-- The Committees       are aware of efforts to implement the 2011 National Academy       of Science's (NAS) Chapter 7 and 2014 NAS report       recommendations for the IRIS program, including six specific       recommendations. These recommendations include objective       evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of critical       studies, the need for weight of evidence evaluation and       integration, and clearer rationale for selecting studies to       calculate toxicity values. Additionally, the NAS identified       specific recommendations and considerations when evaluating       the hazards of formaldehyde. The Committees believe that EPA       should contract with the NAS to conduct the peer review of       the revised draft IRIS assessment of formaldehyde, should it       be released in fiscal year 2017, to verify the       recommendations from the previous NAS report of 2011 have       been fully resolved scientifically.                    ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS AND MANAGEMENT                      (INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)         For Environmental Programs and Management, the bill       provides $2,619,799,000 to be partially offset by a       $21,800,000 rescission for a net discretionary appropriation       of $2,597,999,000. The bill provides the following specific       funding levels and direction:        Environmental Protection: National Priorities.--The bill       provides $12,700,000 for a competitive grant program to       provide technical assistance for improved water quality or       safe drinking water to rural and urban communities or       individual private well owners. The Agency is directed to       provide on a national or multi-State regional basis,       $11,000,000 for grants to qualified not-for-profit       organizations, including organizations authorized by Section       1442(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C.300j-      1(e)(8)), for the sole purpose of providing on-site training       and technical assistance for water systems in rural or urban       communities. The Agency is also directed to provide       $1,700,000 for grants to qualified not-for-profit       organizations for technical assistance for individual private       well owners, with priority given to organizations that       currently provide technical and educational assistance to       individual private well owners. The Agency shall require each       grantee to provide a minimum 10 percent match, including in-      kind contributions. The Agency is directed to allocate funds       to grantees within 180 days of enactment of this Act.        Geographic Programs.--The bill provides $435,857,000, as       distributed in the table at the end of this division, and       includes the following direction:        Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.--The bill provides       $300,000,000 and the Agency shall continue to follow the       direction as provided in House Report 112-589. In addition,       as EPA distributes funds across the five focus areas, Tribal       related activities shall be maintained at not less than the       fiscal year 2016 level.        Chesapeake Bay.--The bill provides $73,000,000 and the       Agency shall allocate funds consistent with the direction       under this heading in Senate Report 114-281.        Water: Ecosystems.--The agreement includes $47,788,000. The       Committees recognize that Public Law 114-161 created a       competitive grant program to help prioritize challenging       issues within estuaries. Passage of this law occurred after       the Agency's budget submission. After the Agency provides       $600,000 to each of the 28 national estuaries in the program,       the Committees urge the Agency to fund a competitive grant       program using available resources, and consistent with House       report 114-632. In addition, the Committees direct EPA to use       the funds provided to accelerate the processing of mining       permits with the Corps of Engineers. Further, the Committees       direct EPA, in consultation with the Corps of Engineers, to       continue to report monthly on the number of Section 404       permits under EPA's review, consistent with the direction       under this heading in House Report 114-170.        Additional Guidance.--The agreement includes the following       additional guidance:        Accidental Release Prevention Requirements.--The Committees       note that EPA has postponed the effective date for       implementation by 90 days as it reviews and reevaluates the       rule. The Committees expect EPA to work with State       regulators, facility managers, small businesses, and other       stakeholders as it reevaluates the rule.        Agricultural Operations.--The Committees note that Congress       never intended the Solid Waste Disposal Act to govern animal       or crop waste, manure, or fertilizer, or constituents derived       from such sources. The Agency's longstanding regulations       accurately reflect Congress' intent not to regulate manure       and crop residues under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, and the       Committees support legislative efforts to clarify and codify       the treatment of agricultural byproducts under the Solid       Waste Disposal Act.        Clean Air Act Economic Analysis.--The Committees note that       Section 321(a) of the Clean Air Act states that the EPA       ``shall conduct continuing evaluations of potential loss or       shifts of employment''. On October 17, 2016, a Federal       district court opinion found that the Agency has a non-      discretionary duty to compile such evaluations, and ordered       the Agency to develop a plan for compliance. In January 2017,       the Federal district court directed the EPA to develop an       economic analysis of the effects of regulations on the coal       mining and power generation industries by July 1, 2017. EPA       has also been directed to demonstrate by the end of the year       that it has measures in place to monitor employment shift as       a result of its regulations. The Committees expect the Agency       will keep the Committees apprised of progress to comply with       the recent court orders.        Coal Combustion Residuals.--Section 2301 of the WIIN Act       (P.L. 114-322) amended the Solid Waste Disposal Act to       authorize the Agency to review and approve, as appropriate,       State programs for permits or other systems of prior approval       and conditions under State law for the regulation of coal       combustion residuals. To expedite the process for reviewing       and approving such State  [[Page H3884]]       programs, the Agency should establish, as expeditiously as is       practicable, streamlined procedures for prompt approval of       those State programs.        Combined Sewer Overflows.--Senate Report 114-281 included       language directing the EPA to report to Congress, within 60       days of enactment of this Act, the plan and timeline for the       implementation of public notice requirements for treatment       works discharging sewage into the Great Lakes as required by       the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. The Committees       remind the Agency that the bill language in the Consolidated       Appropriations Act, 2016, specifically defined the term       ``Great Lakes'' for purpose of the public notice       requirements. Additionally, the Committees note that the bill       language did not require immediate public notice. As such,       the Committees recommend the Agency give utilities       flexibility to ensure that the ratepayers are not severely       impacted by the cost of implementing this public notice       requirement.        Ecolabels for Federal Procurement.--The agreement includes       the direction in Senate Report 114-281 to provide a report on       the Agency's Ecolabel program within 60 days of enactment of       this Act. The Committees are aware that the Agency has been       developing guidelines to evaluate ecolabels that are used in       Federal purchasing for building construction and other uses       and recommend that any process be fair, transparent, and       consistent with other product requirements.        Exempt Aquifers.--The Committees are aware that EPA has       received and will be receiving exempt aquifer applications       from the State of California for processing and approval. The       Committees continue to support protecting underground sources       of drinking water and promoting robust economic development.       Accordingly, the Committees continue to urge EPA to work       expeditiously to process exempt aquifer applications and use       the existing regulatory framework to process these       applications as provided in House Report 114-170 and House       Report 114-632.        Integrated Planning.--The Committees strongly support       efforts to use an integrated planning approach to help       municipalities meet Clean Water Act obligations. The       Committees urge the Agency to work with communities in fiscal       year 2017 to develop elements of integrated plans for       municipal wastewater and stormwater management.        Lead Test Kit.--The Committees reiterate support for       activities that result in safe and proper reduction of lead       paint in homes and the protection of sensitive populations.       Such support along with concerns about implementation       challenges were expressed in House Report 114-632 and Senate       Report 114-281. Consistent with the concerns outlined in the       Committee reports, EPA should identify options to remedy       implementation challenges that have persisted since 2009.        National Ambient Air Quality Standards.--Concerns remain       about potentially overlapping implementation schedules       related to the 2008 and 2015 standards for ground-level       ozone. Because the Agency did not publish implementing       regulations for the 2008 standard of 75 parts per billion       [ppb] until February 2015, and then revised the standard to       70 ppb in October 2015, States now face the prospect of       implementing two national ambient air quality standards for       ozone simultaneously. It is likely that, based on Agency       data, a number of counties will be in non-attainment with       both the 2008 standard and the 2015 standard. Additionally,       Agency data suggests that a number of marginal non-attainment       counties will meet the 2015 standard by 2025 due to other air       regulations. In an effort to find the most sensible path to       reduce ground level ozone, some flexibility must be granted       to States that face the burden of implementing these       potentially overlapping standards. Within 90 days of the date       of enactment of this Act, the Agency is directed to provide       the Committees with a report examining the potential for       administrative options to enable States to enter into       cooperative agreements with the Agency that provide       regulatory relief and meaningfully clean up the air.        Pesticides Registration Improvement Act.--In addition to       the direction under this heading in Senate Report 114-281,--      the Agency is directed to provide the Committees with a       quarterly report detailing the amount of previously collected       maintenance fees that are currently unavailable for       obligation.        Science Advisory Board.--Regarding language under both the       Science and Technology account and the Environmental Programs       and Management account, the Committees are aware that EPA did       not fulfill the fiscal year 2016 directive to provide updated       policy statements to GAO for review.        Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) Program.--The       Committees reiterate the concern expressed in Senate Report       114-281 with respect to the proposed timeframes for       delistings. Historical experience indicates that       manufacturers often need several years to modify       manufacturing processes in order to transition between new       materials. Since EPA's deadlines are not driven by statutory       mandates, additional transition time is allowable, and       warranted, in order to avoid unintended consequences. To       allow manufacturers to fully integrate new chemicals into       their product lines following rigorous efficacy and safety       testing, EPA is directed to consider harmonizing the status       of any previously approved refrigerant or foam-blowing agent       with other domestic and international programs for       refrigeration and commercial air conditioning applications,       and corresponding deadlines for military, space- and       aeronautics-related applications.        Small and Art Glass Manufacturers.--The Committees note       there are significant concerns in the small and art glass       manufacturing industry over potential changes to the       definitions and standards for National Emission Standards for       Hazardous Air Pollutants requirements. The Committees       recommend that the Agency maintain current thresholds and       definitions particularly related to operators that produce       less than 50 tons per year or use non-continuous furnaces in       their operations.        Small Refinery Relief.--The agreement includes the       directive contained in Senate Report 114-281 related to small       refinery relief.        Spill Prevention Requirements.--The WIIN Act (P.L. 114-322)       modified the applicability of EPA's Spill Prevention, Control       and Countermeasure regulations with respect to smaller       containers on farms. The Committees urge EPA to continue to       explore options for additional flexibilities for farmers and       ranchers subject to the rule.        Toxic Substances Control Act Modernization.--The agreement       includes bill language that will enable the EPA to collect       and spend new fees to conduct additional chemical reviews, as       authorized by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the       21st Century Act (P.L. 114-182). Since collections will begin       partway through the year, the Congressional Budget Office       estimates that fee collections will total $3,000,000 for       fiscal year 2017 and are estimated to increase to $25,000,000       per year once the program is fully implemented. Finally, this       bill includes language ensuring that new fee collections will       supplement, not supplant, appropriated resources for these       activities.        Uranium.--The Committees note that EPA has decided to re-      propose the Part 192 rule and solicit additional public       comment. As the Agency works through the public comment       process, the Committees encourage EPA to work with State       regulators, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the       uranium recovery industry to collect sufficient data to       determine if any updates are needed to the existing generally       applicable standards.        Worker Protection Standards.--The Committees note that the       process for developing and providing guidance, educational       materials, and training resources to the States has not       followed the schedule originally envisioned in the rule.       Accordingly, the Agency has received petitions requesting       extensions of implementation dates until January 2018 that       would allow for a smoother transition to new requirements.       The Agency should consider extending implementation deadlines       until 2018, and whether further engagement with stakeholders       regarding implementation issues would be beneficial.               HAZARDOUS WASTE ELECTRONIC MANIFEST SYSTEM FUND         The bill provides $3,178,000 for the Hazardous Waste       Electronic Manifest System Fund.                         OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL         The bill provides $41,489,000 for the Office of Inspector       General.                           BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES         The bill provides $34,467,000 for Buildings and Facilities.                        HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE SUPERFUND                       (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)         The bill provides $1,088,769,000 for the Hazardous       Substance Superfund account and includes bill language to       transfer $8,778,000 to the Office of Inspector General       account and $15,496,000 to the Science and Technology       account. The bill provides the following additional       direction:        Financial Assurance.--The Committees are aware of concerns       raised by States, stakeholders, and the Small Business       Administration's Office of Advocacy regarding the Agency's       proposed rule on financial assurance for hardrock mining. The       Agency has extended the comment period on the proposed rule       for hardrock mining until July 11, 2017. It is expected that       the Agency will take those comments into account in       recommending its course of action to finalize the rule.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        May 3, 2017, on page H3884, the following appeared: for hard  rock mining until July      The online version has been corrected to read: for hardrock  mining until July    ========================= END NOTE =========================          Sediment Guidance.--The Committees note that the Agency       completed a report on sediment guidance in February 2017. The       Committees urge the Agency to ensure compliance with the       Agency's Contaminated Sediment Guidance.             LEAKING UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK TRUST FUND PROGRAM         The bill provides $91,941,000 for the Leaking Underground       Storage Tank Trust Fund Program.                          INLAND OIL SPILL PROGRAMS         The bill provides $18,209,000 for Inland Oil Spill       Programs.                      STATE AND TRIBAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS         The bill provides $3,527,161,000 for the State and Tribal       Assistance Grants program and includes the following specific       funding levels and direction:        Targeted Airshed Grants.--The bill provides $30,000,000 for       targeted airshed grants to reduce air pollution in non-      attainment areas. These grants shall be distributed on a       competitive basis to non-attainment areas that EPA determines       are ranked as the top five most polluted areas relative to       annual ozone or particulate matter 2.5 standards as well as       the top five areas based on the 24-hour particulate matter       2.5 standard where the design values exceed the 35 mg/      m3 standard. To determine these areas, the Agency       shall use  [[Page H3885]]       the most recent design values calculated from validated air       quality data. The Committees note that these funds are       available for emission reduction activities deemed necessary       for compliance with national ambient air quality standards       and included in a State Implementation Plan submitted to EPA.       Not later than the end of fiscal year 2017, EPA should       provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations that       includes a table showing how fiscal year 2016 and 2017 funds       were allocated. The table should also include grant       recipients and metrics for anticipated or actual results.        Animas River Spill.--The Gold King Mine spill into the       Animas River significantly impacted areas in New Mexico,       Colorado, Arizona, Utah, and the Navajo Nation. As authorized       by P.L. 114-322, the bill provides $4,000,000 for a long-term       water quality monitoring program, and EPA is directed to       continue to work in consultation with affected States and       Tribes on that effort. The Agency is strongly encouraged to       follow the requirements detailed in House report 114-632       regarding the temporary water treatment plant and in Senate       Report 114-281 regarding reimbursements for State, local and       Tribal costs related to the spill. Finally, a recent legal       decision has left many stakeholders concerned that they will       not be compensated for property damage, business losses, and       other negative financial impacts. EPA should further explore       all legal and financial recourses that could compensate       individuals for such damages and, if available, should ensure       that recourses will be extended to individuals located in all       areas impacted by the spill in New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona,       Utah, and the Navajo Nation. The Agency is required to report       to the Committees within 60 days of enactment of this Act on       the details and timeline for such efforts, including plans       for stakeholder engagement in all areas affected by the       spill.        Categorical Grants.--The bill provides $1,066,041,000 for       Categorical Grants and funding levels are specified in the       table at the end of this division. The Agency shall allocate       radon grants in fiscal year 2017 following the direction in       House Report 114-632. The amount also includes $228,219,000       for the State and Local Air Quality Management grant program,       and the Agency is directed to allocate funds for this program       using the same formula as fiscal year 2015. The Committees       understand the Office of Air and Radiation was able to       provide some additional funds to the States in fiscal year       2016 using balances. The Committees encourage the Agency to       do the same in fiscal year 2017 and to provide those       additional funds to the regions with the highest need.        Use of Iron and Steel.--The bill includes language in Title       IV General Provisions that stipulates requirements for the       use of iron and steel in State Revolving Fund projects, and       the agreement includes only the following guidance. The       Committees acknowledge that EPA may issue a waiver of said       requirements for de minimis amounts of iron and steel       building materials. The Committees emphasize that any coating       processes that are applied to the external surface of iron       and steel components that otherwise qualify under the       procurement preference shall not render such products       ineligible for the procurement preference regardless of where       the coating processes occur, provided that final assembly of       the products occurs in the United States.         WATER INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE AND INNOVATION PROGRAM ACCOUNT         This bill provides an additional $10,000,000 for the WIFIA       program. When combined with funds provided under Sec. 197 of       P.L. 114-254, the WIFIA program is funded at a total       $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2017, which has the ability to be       leveraged for a total of $3,049,000,000 in loans. Of the       amounts provided in this bill and in P.L. 114-254, EPA may       use up to $5,000,000 for administrative expenses to       administer the program and issue loans. The Committees note       that $2,200,000 had previously been provided in other       accounts for staffing and administrative needs in order to       establish the program. The agreement concurs with the budget       consolidation of those resources into this new account.    ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS--ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (INCLUDING                     TRANSFERS AND RESCISSION OF FUNDS)         The bill continues several administrative provisions from       previous years.        Rescission.--The bill rescinds $61,198,000 of unobligated       balances from the State and Tribal Assistance Grants account.       The Agency shall calculate the requisite percent reduction       necessary to rescind such amounts from new obligational       authority and apply it across program areas by formula. The       Agency is directed to submit, as part of the operating plan,       detail on the application of such rescissions by program       project area.                        TITLE III--RELATED AGENCIES                         Department of Agriculture                                FOREST SERVICE         Forest Service Directives.--The Forest Service is reminded       of the importance of the directives included in House Report       114-632 and Senate Report 114-281 not addressed herein, as       well as the new directives in this statement, including the       front matter. The Service is expected to provide the research       report, as required by the House report, within 30 days of       enactment of this Act.        Forest Service Accounting, Budgeting, and Management.--The       agreement includes bill language and directives to increase       transparency and confidence in the Service's management of       its programs and activities.        The agreement includes a new administrative provision       requiring the Service to report within 30 days after the       close of each quarter, through the Office of Budget and       Program Analysis, its current and prior year unobligated       balances to the House and Senate Committees on       Appropriations. The Service is directed to provide this       report for all mandatory and discretionary funds, including       receipts and permanent appropriations, as well as funds       subject to notification requirements and transfers of       unobligated balances.        Although the agreement does not include reprogramming       guidelines in bill language, as proposed by the House, the       Committees expect the Service to follow the letter and spirit       of the reprogramming requirements in this explanatory       statement and direct the Service to submit requests through       the Office of Budget and Program Analysis.        The agreement assigns fiscal-year limits to certain Forest       Service accounts. This modification will require funds to be       tracked by year, budget line item, and account, and encourage       the Service to expeditiously award contracts, settle       reimbursable agreements, and conduct forest management       activities. The agreement also establishes a non-recurring       expenses account that will allow certain unobligated funds to       be captured and used for fuel reduction and post-fire       rehabilitation purposes. The Committees believe that fiscal-      year limits will not impede the Service's ability to       effectively fight wildfire or meet wildfire obligations       relating to agreements with Federal, State, or other       partners.        To further support the Service's efforts in centralizing       and standardizing budgeting and accounting practices among       the Regions and program offices, the Service is directed to       improve and better manage its procurement and financial       management processes to ensure funds are spent in an       appropriate and timely manner. The Service should also make       certain that sufficient internal controls are in place to       ensure that unliquidated obligations are consistently and       systematically evaluated for validity, and that unliquidated       obligations found unnecessary are promptly adjusted to make       funds available for authorized purposes.        According to the information provided as required by Senate       Reports 114-82 and 114-70, the Service has significantly       higher costs of printing for public distribution compared to       other Department of Agriculture agencies. The Service is       directed to update the information provided in the report to       the Committees within 30 days of enactment of this Act, and       to significantly reduce its printing expenditures.                        FOREST AND RANGELAND RESEARCH         The agreement provides $288,514,000 for Forest and       Rangeland Research, including $77,000,000 for Forest       Inventory and Analysis.        Forest Products Laboratory.--Of the funds available to the       Forest Products Laboratory, no less than $1,000,000 is to       sustain funding with existing academic partners focused on       research and technology development to create new and       expanded markets and to advance high-value, high-volume wood       markets from restorative actions on the Nation's public and       private forests.        Joint Fire Science Research.--The agreement accepts the       proposal to shift the Joint Fire Science Research program       into the Forest and Rangeland Research account and provides       no less than $3,000,000 for the program.        Forest Research Priorities.--The Committees are concerned       that the research program is not well aligned with the needs       of the National Forest System. When assessing the value of       new proposals, significant weight should be given to projects       whose findings could be incorporated into management and       decision-making.                          STATE AND PRIVATE FORESTRY                      (INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)         The agreement provides $216,921,000 for State and Private       Forestry. The following directions are also provided:        Federal and Cooperative Lands.--The Committees understand       the Service has obligated $5,000,000 in prior year balances       to address the forest health crisis in Region 5.        Forest Legacy.--The bill provides $62,347,000 for the       Forest Legacy program. This includes $6,400,000 for program       administration and $55,947,000 for projects. The Service       should fund projects in priority order according to the       competitively selected national priority list submitted by       the Forest Service as part of its fiscal year 2017 budget       request. In lieu of the direction included in the House       report, the Committees expect the Forest Service to prudently       track unobligated and deobligated balances and to provide the       Committees with prompt notification of such changes to avoid       accumulating large balances within the Forest Legacy account.       The Committees include a rescission of $12,002,000 in Forest       Legacy funds. This funding rescission is from cost savings of       some projects and funds returned from failed or partially       failed projects.                            NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM                       (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)         The agreement provides $1,513,318,000 for the National       Forest System. The following directions are also provided:        The agreement accepts the proposal to consolidate the Land       Management Planning and Inventory and Monitoring accounts       into a Land Management Planning, Assessment, and Monitoring       account.        Integrated Resource Restoration (IRR).--The agreement       continues the IRR pilot in Regions 1, 3, and 4, as proposed       by the Senate.  [[Page H3886]]       The Service is directed to require standardized, integrated       planning and budgeting for all of its programs, projects, and       activities in order to improve priority-setting and       cooperation, and to continue to improve its integrated       performance measures.        Rangeland Management.--The Service is directed, to the       greatest extent practicable, to make vacant grazing       allotments available to a holder of a grazing permit or lease       when lands covered by the holder of the permit or lease are       unusable because of drought or wildfire.        Forest Products.--The additional funds provided for forest       products are directed to be used to build the timber program       capacity by facilitating the necessary planning work and the       hiring and training of timber management personnel to deliver       increased volume levels.        Forest Product Outputs.--The Service is directed to include       information on the amount of firewood removed for personal       use in its reports on the forest products program.        Recreation, Heritage and Wilderness.--The agreement       provides $264,595,000 for recreation, heritage and       wilderness. Of the funds provided for recreation management,       $750,000 shall be for the maintenance of rural airstrips.        Minerals and Geology Management.--The Committees understand       that the Service has obligated $5,500,000 in prior year       balances to address the Service's cleanup liabilities,       pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,       Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, associated with       historic uranium mining at the Ross-Adams Mine Site on Bokan       Mountain.        Bighorn and Domestic Sheep.--The Committees direct the       Forest Service to continue the quantitative, science-based       analyses of the risk of disease transmission between domestic       and bighorn sheep required in the fiscal year 2016       explanatory statement.                     CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE                       (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)         The agreement provides $364,014,000 for Capital Improvement       and Maintenance programs offset by a $16,000,000 scoring       credit related to the road and trail fund.                               LAND ACQUISITION         The agreement provides $54,415,000 for Land Acquisition.       The amounts recommended by this bill compared with the budget       estimates by activity and project are shown in the table       below, listed in priority order pursuant to the budget       request for fiscal year 2017. The Committees have provided       additional funding for the updated appraisal of projects, as       requested, for the fiscal year 2017 project list. The Service       is expected to use the Critical Inholdings/Wilderness account       to acquire high priority lands, such as wilderness and lands       of significant value in designated conservation units, to       consolidate Federal ownership. Further instructions are       contained under the Land and Water Conservation Fund heading       in the front of this explanatory statement.        The Committees continue to encourage the Forest Service to       explore all funding avenues to resolve the long-standing       management challenges related to school trust lands within       the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in Superior National Forest.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------             State                 Project        Forest Units        Budget Request             This Bill ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ID..........................

None of these       funds may be allocated to a facility until such facility has       achieved beneficial occupancy status.        Accreditation Emergencies.--The Committees consider the       loss or potential loss of a Medicare or Medicaid agreement       with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) at       any facility to be an accreditation emergency. The agreement       includes a total of $29,000,000 for accreditation emergencies       at an alarming number of facilities over the past year. Funds       may be used for personnel or other expenses essential for       sustaining operations of an affected service unit, including       but not to exceed $4,000,000 for Purchased/Referred Care.       These are not intended to be recurring base funds. The       Director should reallocate the funds annually as necessary to       ensure that agreements with CMS are reinstated, and to       restore third-party collection shortfalls.

The Committees are aware that the community of Gallup,       N.M., continues to face significant demand for substance       abuse treatment, residential services and detoxification       services to address an ongoing crisis of alcohol-related       deaths of Tribal members, and continues to depend on the non-      profit Na' Nizhoozhi Center to provide an important safety       net to help prevent these deaths. Consistent with the       guidance in Senate Report 114-281, the Committees expect the       Service to use funds provided in this Act to continue its       partnership with the Center and to work with the Center and       other Federal, State, local, and Tribal partners to develop a       sustainable model for the Center to enhance its clinical       capacity.        Purchased/Referred Care.--The agreement includes       $14,691,000 for current services. The agreement does not       include the directive in the House report regarding the       allocation of funds.        Immunization.--The agreement includes $91,000 for current       services.        Urban Indian Health.--The agreement includes $1,800,000 for       current services and a $1,137,000 program increase.        Indian Health Professions.--The agreement includes a       $500,000 program increase. The agreement does not include the       House report language pertaining to the definition of health       profession; instead the Service is urged to consider making       health administrators a higher priority for loan repayments,       in consultation with Tribes.        Direct Operations.--The agreement includes $1,282,000 for       current services, and transfers as discussed above.        Governing Board.--The agreement does not include the House       provision authorizing a pilot program for an alternate       governing board model at direct service facilities. The       accreditation crisis in the Great Plains and the subsequent       House provision have highlighted the need for IHS facilities       to be significantly more inclusive of Tribes in the decision-      making process. The Committees are encouraged by the IHS's       own recent initiative to reform its governing boards, but       reforms are limited under existing statutes. The Committees       are aware that the authorizing committees of jurisdiction are       examining this issue and support these efforts to improve the       communication and collaboration between the IHS and Tribes at       direct service facilities.                            CONTRACT SUPPORT COSTS         The bill provides an indefinite appropriation for contract       support costs, consistent with fiscal year 2016 and estimated       to be $800,000,000.                           INDIAN HEALTH FACILITIES         The agreement provides $545,424,000 for Indian Health       Facilities. In addition to the funding allocation table at       the end of this explanatory statement, the agreement includes       the following details and changes relative to fiscal year       2016 enacted levels:        Current Services.--The agreement includes $9,274,000 to       partially maintain current levels of service, of which       $1,220,000 is for pay costs and $8,054,000 is for inflation.       Except as otherwise provided, the agreement includes an       increase equal to 50 percent of pay and inflation costs       requested in the fiscal year 2017 President's Budget for each       program to cover the balance of the fiscal year remaining.        Staffing for New Facilities.--The agreement includes       $1,659,000 for staffing newly opened health facilities, which       is the full amount based upon updated estimates provided to       the Committees. The stipulations included in the ``Indian       Health Services'' account regarding the allocation of funds       pertain to this account as well.        Maintenance and Improvement.--The agreement fully funds       inflation costs and provides a program increase of $259,000       to reduce the maintenance backlog.        Sanitation Facilities.--The agreement fully funds inflation       costs.        Health Care Facilities Construction.--The agreement       includes $6,000,000 for quarters and $5,000,000 for small       ambulatory facilities. The committees encourage the Service       to give strong consideration to utilizing the new resources       provided for the small ambulatory clinic program to assist       with infrastructure improvements at remote sites such as       Gambell and Savoonga on St. Lawrence Island, Alaska.        The Committees remain dedicated to providing access to       health care for IHS patients across the system. The IHS is       expected to aggressively work down the current Health       Facilities Construction Priority System list, as well as work       with the Department and Tribes to examine alternative       financing arrangements and meritorious regional demonstration       projects authorized under the Indian Health Care Improvement       Act that that would effectively close the service gap. Within       60 days of enactment of this Act, the Service shall submit a       spending plan to the Committees that details the project-      level distribution of funds provided for healthcare       facilities construction.        The IHS has no defined benefit package and is not designed       to be comparable to the private sector health care system.       IHS does not provide the same health services in each area.       Health services provided to a community depend upon the       facilities and services available in the local area, the       facilities' financial and personnel resources (42 CFR 136.11       (c)), and the needs of the service population. In order to       determine whether IHS patients across the system have       comparable access to healthcare, the IHS is directed to       conduct and publish a gap analysis of the locations and       capacities of patient health facilities relative to the IHS       user population. The analysis should include: facilities       within the IHS system, including facilities on the Health       Facilities Construction Priority System list and the Joint       Venture Construction Program list; and where possible       facilities within private or other Federal health systems for       which arrangements with IHS exist, or should exist, to see       IHS patients.                        NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH            NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES         The agreement provides $77,349,000 for the National       Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.               AGENCY FOR TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND DISEASE REGISTRY              TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH         The agreement provides $74,691,000 for the Agency for Toxic       Substances and Disease Registry.                           Other Related Agencies                      EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT    COUNCIL ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY         The agreement provides $3,000,000 for the Council on       Environmental Quality and Office of Environmental Quality.                CHEMICAL SAFETY AND HAZARD INVESTIGATION BOARD                           SALARIES AND EXPENSES         The agreement provides $11,000,000 for the Chemical Safety       and Hazard Investigation Board and includes the direction in       the House report that funding has not been provided for       organizing an annual symposium. The Board is directed to       develop internal guidance over its annual budget process and       provide it to the Committees within 90 days of enactment of       this Act. Additionally, the Board is directed to provide a       report and briefing to the Committees dealing with the scope       of and justification for a study on land use and facility       siting prior to expending any funds on the study.        The Committees remind the Board they are to avoid any       communication with outside groups that would jeopardize their       impartiality.-- The Committees continue to closely monitor       Inspector General reports on Board activities and expect       expeditious implementation of any recommendations on internal       controls, governance, operations, and management challenges.       The Board should focus on its statutory jurisdiction and       refrain from conducting official business over personal       email.                 OFFICE OF NAVAJO AND HOPI INDIAN RELOCATION                           SALARIES AND EXPENSES                       (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)         The agreement provides $15,431,000 for the Office of Navajo       and Hopi Indian Relocation, as requested. The Committees have       directed the Office to begin to communicate with Congress,       the affected Tribes, and the Department of the Interior about       what will be required to ensure relocation benefits and       necessary support services are provided in accordance with       the specifications in Public Law 93-531 and to initiate       closure of the Office. The Committees request continuation of       the quarterly reports and a comprehensive plan for closing       the Office, as outlined in the House report. The       comprehensive plan is to be submitted with the fiscal year       2018 budget request. Legal analysis on whether any enacting       legislation is required to transfer or maintain any       identified functions to another agency or organization should       also be included. The Office should be transparent about the       path forward and should actively consult with all affected       parties and agencies.            INSTITUTE OF AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE CULTURE                            AND ARTS DEVELOPMENT                          PAYMENT TO THE INSTITUTE         The bill provides $15,212,000 for the Institute of American       Indian Arts. The increase provided shall be used to complete       the Institute's transition to forward funding during fiscal       year 2017. Amounts provided for fiscal year 2017 shall be       supplemented by $2,000,000 in prior-year carryover funds, for       a total operating level of $9,835,000. Requested increases       for fixed costs and academic program requirements are       included within the agreement.                           SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION                           SALARIES AND EXPENSES         The agreement provides a total of $863,347,000 for all       Smithsonian Institution accounts, of which $729,444,000 is       provided for salaries and expenses. The Committees maintain       their longstanding commitment to the preservation of       priceless, irreplaceable Smithsonian collections and have       provided funds as requested for collections care and       preservation. The recommendation provides sufficient funds       for staffing and maintenance needs at the National Museum of       African  [[Page H3888]]       American History and Culture in 2017. The Committees have       provided funds, as requested, to address security needs at       the Smithsonian's highest risk facilities. The Committees       provide funds as requested for the Institution's Latino       initiatives and support the Smithsonian Latino Center's goal       of promoting the inclusion of Latino contributions in       Smithsonian Institution programs, exhibitions, collections,       and public outreach. The Committees continue to urge       collaboration between the Smithsonian Latino Center and       appropriate Federal and local organizations in order to       advance these goals and expand the American Latino presence       at the Institution. Further, the Committees provide funds as       requested for the Institution's Asian Pacific American       initiatives and continue to support the Institution's efforts       of developing programs and expanding outreach to promote a       better understanding of the Asian Pacific American       experience. The Committees also include funds as requested       for the preservation of cultural heritage affected by natural       and manmade disasters in the United States and around the       world. The recommendation supplements funding from other       government partners and leverages support for cultural       recovery efforts from numerous private sources.                              FACILITIES CAPITAL         The agreement provides $133,903,000 for the Facilities       Capital account. The recommendation includes funding for the       construction of the Dulles Storage Module at the National Air       and Space Museum's Udvar-Hazy Center.        National Air and Space Museum Revitalization. The       Committees recognize the critical need to replace the facade       and the internal building systems of the National Air and       Space Museum on the National Mall.-- However, the Committees       are also deeply concerned that the multi-year cost estimates       for the revitalization project in future fiscal years are       approaching $700 million, an amount nearly five times the       size of the Institution's entire annual construction budget.       Given the scale of the project and its potential impact on       other critical funding priorities in this Act, it is       imperative that the Institution make available to the       Committees on a timely basis the most updated and       comprehensive information on project requirements. It is       essential that the Committees have sufficient, reliable       information about specific funding requirements and any       additional costs that may arise in future fiscal years.       Therefore, no later than 90 days after enactment of this Act,       the Institution is directed to provide a report to the       Committees that outlines the expected scope, scheduling,       phasing, and overall projected costs for the project. The       Government Accountability Office is also directed to review       and analyze the Institution's cost estimates and report to       the Committees on whether these estimates are comprehensive,       accurate, and credible.        The Institution is directed to submit to the House and       Senate Committees on Appropriations, within 60 days of       enactment of this Act, a detailed list and description of       projects funded within the Facilities Capital account.                           NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART                           SALARIES AND EXPENSES         The agreement provides $132,961,000 for the Salaries and       Expenses account of the National Gallery of Art, of which not       to exceed $3,620,000 is for the special exhibition program.               REPAIR, RESTORATION AND RENOVATION OF BUILDINGS         The agreement provides $22,564,000 for the Repair,       Restoration, and Renovation of Buildings account, which will       allow critical fire protection and life safety improvements       to continue.

KENNEDY CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS                         OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE         The agreement provides $22,260,000 for the Operations and       Maintenance account.

WOODROW WILSON INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR SCHOLARS                           SALARIES AND EXPENSES         The agreement provides $10,500,000 for the Woodrow Wilson       International Center for Scholars.              NATIONAL FOUNDATION ON THE ARTS AND THE HUMANITIES                      NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS                         GRANTS AND ADMINISTRATION         The agreement provides $149,849,000 for the National       Endowment for the Arts (NEA). The Committees commend the NEA       for its work through its Healing Arts Partnership program       with Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Fort       Belvoir Community Hospital, and the new clinical sites       included in the initiative to incorporate arts therapy into       the treatment of active-duty military patients and their       families. The Committees continue to support the expansion of       this successful program to assist service members and their       families in their recovery, reintegration, and transition to       civilian life. The Committees also urge State arts agencies,       which have a longstanding collaborative relationship with the       NEA, to explore providing arts therapy programs to service       members and their families at the local level. The Committees       direct that priority be given to providing services and grant       funding for projects, productions, or programs that encourage       public knowledge, education, understanding, and appreciation       of the arts. The Committees maintain support for the 40       percent allocation for State arts agencies as proposed in the       NEA's budget. Any reduction in support to the States for arts       education should be no more than proportional to other       funding decreases taken in other NEA programs.                    NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES                         GRANTS AND ADMINISTRATION         The agreement provides $149,848,000 for the National       Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). The Committees commend       the NEH for its support of grant programs to benefit wounded       warriors and to ensure educational opportunities for American       heroes transitioning to civilian life. The Committees commend       the NEH for its ongoing support to American Indian and Alaska       Native communities in preserving their cultural and       linguistic heritage through the Documenting Endangered       Languages program and a variety of preservation and access       grants that enable American Indian and Alaska Native       communities to preserve cultural artifacts and make them       broadly accessible. The Committees also commend the NEH       Federal/State partnership for its ongoing, successful       collaboration with State humanities councils in each of the       50 States as well as Washington, DC, the Commonwealth of       Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth       of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. The       Committees urge the NEH to provide program funding to support       the critical work of State humanities councils consistent       with guidance provided in the Consolidated Appropriations       Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113).

NATIONAL CAPITAL PLANNING COMMISSION                           SALARIES AND EXPENSES         The agreement provides $8,099,000 for the National Capital       Planning Commission.                   UNITED STATES HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM                         HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM         The agreement provides $57,000,000 for the United States       Holocaust Memorial Museum.                   DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER MEMORIAL COMMISSION                           SALARIES AND EXPENSES         The agreement provides $1,600,000 for the Salaries and       Expenses account. The Committees support the construction of       a permanent memorial to Dwight D. Eisenhower and are pleased       that concerns over the memorial's design have now been       addressed. It is the Committees' expectation that, following       necessary approvals from the Commission of Fine Arts and the       National Capital Planning Commission, the Commission will use       prior-year unobligated construction funds to begin site       preparation in anticipation of memorial construction       commencing in 2017. The agreement includes in Section 419 of       Title IV General Provisions bill language extending the       memorial's site authority.

The       Commission shall plan, execute, and coordinate programs and       activities in honor of the 100th anniversary of the passage       and ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S.       Constitution, which guaranteed women the right to vote.
