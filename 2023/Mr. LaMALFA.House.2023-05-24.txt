 Mr. Speaker, the Endangered Species Act was put into law  over 50 years ago. Of course, its purpose was to protect and recover  vulnerable species to save them from population decline and extinction.  That act has, to date, only recovered a couple dozen species, as there  are over 1,300 listed species in the United States. The ratio of  recovery indeed is a failure.   The ESA must be reformed to refocus the efforts of the Federal  Government to recover animal species in a timely manner without also  making it difficult for people to coexist in their habitat, as well.   We have the law now that is more likely to be used as a back door to  regulate economic activity than a pro-conservation piece of  legislation.   There are numerous examples of activist groups weaponizing the ESA to  use it as a business model. Indeed, they make money from the lawsuits.   For example, in my part of the State in the Central Valley, the  valley elderberry longhorn beetle has had a very negative effect on the  ability of Central Valley residents to maintain flood controls in the  form of levees.   The residents cannot upgrade and improve the levees in this area  because the ESA prevents them from doing so without very costly long- held permits. This is despite the fact that it has been recommended by  Fish and Wildlife that the longhorn beetle be delisted for many years  now. However, the environmental groups keep litigating on that and the  Fish and Wildlife organization has pulled back from delisting the  beetle.   So why do they do this? It is obvious.   If the beetle is delisted, it loses the ESA protections that make  levee upgrades so difficult, expensive, and time-consuming in order to  obtain the permits. The beetle has been delisted in some areas of  California, such as the southern parts, but in my district, it is still  listed as endangered, making it difficult to do needed flood-control  projects.   Another example that has devastated the forest industry, in the West  especially, is the spotted owl. It was listed many years ago. We find  that the ESA has made that a weapon against forest management, and we  have seen the results of that with million-acre fires. Year after year,  hundreds of thousands of acres of fire have been wreaking havoc on so  much of the West because we can't manage the lands because they believe  there might be a spotted owl nearby, even though it isn't really the  management of forests that is the problem. It is another larger owl  nearby that actually devastates the spotted owl, known as the barred  owl.    Also the spotted owl seems to like foresting a little closer to human  activity because it is seen as a protection from the barred owl, which  devastates their population.   What is the end result?   Over 100 sawmills in California have shut down due to these  protections that indeed make timber supply unavailable to the sawmills,  so they go away, and instead, we have to import timber.   Now the activists themselves that sue over this, they don't live in  these conditions. They live in cities far away. They don't have to live  with the conditions of their economy being devastated in a small town  in northern California or Oregon or other western States. So it is  really easy to regulate other people somewhere else and say they have  an idea about what a forest should look like when their own homes  aren't subject to the threat of fire; indeed, places like Greenville,  California, Canyondam, California, and a few years ago, a lot of us  around the country heard about Paradise, California, as well. If they  don't have to experience it, it is really easy for urban legislators to  make regulations that continue to devastate these areas.   It is actually the local people that know best how to fight fires,  how to manage the lands, and how to generate an economy that helps  those communities take care of themselves and keep the people supplied  with paper products and wood products that the country still wants.   So why in the world are we the number two importer of wood in the  United States? We have so much that we could be utilizing. We could  have managed forests that have the right ratio of trees per acre that  is actually sustainable, instead of this horrific overpopulation of  trees that really creates its own drought and creates a situation where  they become tinderboxes, million-acre fires, ruining the habitat and  killing the wildlife. Indeed, the opposite of what the Endangered  Species Act is trying to do.   Also, why do we have such high food prices in this country?   Why do we even encounter food shortages in the United States of  America?   Because it is hard to have a water supply in California that is a  steady, stable supply.   They take away the ability to build dams and enhance our water  storage, and all the water flows down the river and out to the sea. The  Endangered Species Act needs to be restored to put things back on track  for human needs.                            ____________________
