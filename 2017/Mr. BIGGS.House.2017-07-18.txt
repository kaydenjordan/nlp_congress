 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for  yielding time to me today. I applaud Congressman Olson for introducing  this very important legislation. I also thank Science Committee  Chairman Lamar Smith for holding numerous hearings to fully examine the  Environmental Protection Agency's National Ambient Air Quality  Standards.   Arizonans desperately need the reforms that Representative Olson has  offered in his legislation. Unfortunately, my constituents in the East  Valley of Maricopa County understand all too well the consequences of  onerous EPA regulations.   Arizona has high levels of background ozone in the atmosphere,  meaning that, from the EPA's perspective, we are regularly above the  attainment level. But instead of trying to fully understand my State's  intricate needs or engaging in efforts to work with State officials to  develop achievable plans and paths forward, the EPA has doubled down  time after time with new standards that are impossible to meet.   H.R. 806 will help States like mine create meaningful implementation  plans by giving us more time to work with the Federal Government and  stakeholders. It will also allow us more flexibility in how we meet new  regulations. Good, commonsense bills like this one are needed to ensure  that we do not overregulate in a way that severely disrupts our local  economies for little or no benefit.   As chairman of the Science Subcommittee on Environment, I once again  applaud Representative Olson and thank my friend from Illinois, and I  look forward to seeing this bill pass this Chamber.
