 Madam President, on May 9 of this year, Senator Johnson  and I wrote to David Weiss, the U.S. attorney for the District of  Delaware. Now, he happens to be in charge of the Hunter Biden criminal  case. In that letter, we asked Mr. Weiss a series of threshold  questions that Attorney General Garland has repeatedly failed to  answer.   First, we asked whether Nicholas McQuaid is recused from the Hunter  Biden case. As we have said publicly many times, McQuaid is conflicted  because he worked with Hunter Biden's criminal attorney before he was  hired as a top position in President Biden's Justice Department.   Second, we asked Mr. Weiss whether he or any of his employees have  had any communications with McQuaid.   Third, we asked Mr. Weiss whether any of his employees, not just Mr.  McQuaid, are recused from the Hunter Biden case.   We asked these questions because the Biden family is from Delaware  and has extensive political connections. Notably, Hunter Biden told his  business partners:         I'll bring suit in the Chancery Court in Delaware--which as       you know is my home state and I'm privileged to have worked       with and know every judge in the Chancery Court.    Does the Biden family have connections to anyone in Mr. Weiss's  office? That seems to be a very fair question.   With respect to those three questions, Mr. Weiss didn't even try to  answer. In fact, the Attorney General jumped in and answered on behalf  of U.S. Attorney Weiss. But calling the Attorney General's letter an  answer is an overstatement. It was another nonanswer--essentially just  words on a piece of paper that didn't say anything worthwhile.   So Senator Johnson and I also asked Mr. Weiss if he has received  sufficient resources and support from the Justice Department to  properly handle the Hunter Biden case.   Again, no answers.   One would think that the Department, and specifically Mr. Weiss,  would want to tell Congress and the American public that the answer to  that question is yes. The failure of Mr. Weiss to answer that very  important question adds to the growing concern and public concern that  the Justice Department is pulling the punches on the Hunter Biden case.   We also asked Mr. Weiss whether he has discussed the need for a  special counsel or an independent counsel to properly investigate the  Hunter Biden case.   Again, no answer.   The last question is more relevant today than when it was asked  because the other week a voicemail was released reportedly from Joe  Biden to Hunter Biden. In it, Joe Biden repeatedly left a message about  a New York Times article that involved Hunter Biden's dealings with Ye  Jianming. That business associate is closely connected to the communist  Chinese regime.   Joe Biden told his son: ``I think you're clear.''   Well, that message appears to show that Joe Biden was aware of Hunter  Biden's business deals and relationships. So the White House strategy  for the President to continue to deny knowledge of these business  relationships falls very flat.   On July 30, 2021, and on June 28, 2022, Senator Johnson and I wrote  to the White House counsel. We wrote about then-Vice President Biden's  use of nongovernment email to transmit government information to Hunter  Biden. The White House counsel's office refuses to answer whether  President Biden still communicates government business to Hunter Biden,  among other questions that we posed.   So what do we get? More stonewalling.   Most recently, on July 7, this year, Senator Johnson and I wrote to  the Attorney General, FBI Director, and U.S. Attorney Weiss. In our  letter, we asked again about recusals of Hunter Biden's case. We also  noted that recent reporting on Hunter Biden showed more connections  between him and foreign nationals--this time, Russians and Ukrainians.  Those additional links further support my and Senator Johnson's  conclusion in our September 2020 Biden report that Hunter Biden's  activity causes criminal, counterintelligence, and extortion concerns.   At the time, our findings were ignored or falsely labeled Russian  disinformation by Democrats and by liberal media. We gave floor  speeches on March 28, this year, March 29, this year, April 5, that  introduced bank records connecting Hunter and James Biden to the  communist Chinese regime. The same connections that we made in our 2020  report. Those bank records have proven to be authentic and, hence,  aren't Russian disinformation.   For years, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle levied  complaints against the Trump administration's Justice Department for  the lack of transparency. Now, why aren't those same Democrat  colleagues raising this concern about this administration not showing  the proper transparency?   Congress has a constitutional responsibility to ensure the proper  execution of, and compliance with, conflicts of interest laws and  regulations. The failure of the Justice Department to comply with these  rules will cause political infection to run rampant. And, of course,  that will rot the core of the Justice Department and cast a cloud over  everything that the Department of Justice does.   As I have said before, the Justice Department's failure to be  transparent with the Hunter Biden criminal case and recusals related to  it has cast a cloud over that investigation. So I ask: What is the  Justice Department trying to hide?   The American people's concern about how the case has been managed,  these concerns are very legitimate.   To Attorney General Garland, to Wray, and to Mr. Weiss, I strongly  urge you to clear the cloud sooner rather than later.    Mr. President, I would like to submit for the  record a statement of commendation to Sheila and Ronald Wetjen for  recently celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary. Sheila and Ron  were married on February 5, 1972, in Dubuque, IA, and raised five  children: Nicholas, Mark, Sean, Melissa, and Amanda. They also now have  nine grandchildren: Grace, Cullen, Xavier, Rourke, Reece, Finnegan,  Rockwell, Sophia, and Wyatt.   I would like to commend Sheila and Ron for their commitment to each  other, their children, their grandchildren, their faith, and their  country. Sheila and Ron represent so many of the ideals that gave rise  to this great country and bind it together today--the importance of  family and an enduring selflessness and faith in others that speaks to  a firm commitment to the common good. We wish Sheila and Ron our  congratulations all for this great achievement and wish them many more  years of faithful marriage.                            ____________________
