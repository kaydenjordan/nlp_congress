 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Representative  Joyce's H.R. 1435, Preserving Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act, to  prevent the EPA from imposing new regulations that would ban the sales  of new motor vehicles with gas-powered internal combustion engines.   Last year, California enacted new requirements on automakers,  effectively banning the sale of new gas-powered cars and light trucks  by 2035 and limiting consumer choice in new vehicles to electric  vehicles.   Mr. Speaker, we have a choice presented before us today. We can  expand California's failed and expensive green energy mandates to the  rest of the Nation, or we can invest in liquid fuels to restore  American energy independence, make gas affordable again, and secure our  energy future. H.R. 1435 will accomplish these goals.    Electric vehicles are not for everybody. Just ask Secretary Granholm  about her recent road trip throughout the United States. Spoiler alert:  The police were called.   When you think about the costly and ineffective proposals like those  from California and the Biden administration, they reject the proven  benefits of the liquid fuel sector. Investing in ever-cleaner liquid  fuels, like biofuels and conventional fuels, provides immediate  environmental benefits, supports our domestic economy, and bolsters  national security while keeping costs low.   When we asked the Secretary recently about how much electricity the  United States uses on an annual basis, she couldn't answer it, nor can  any administration official answer it, but yet they want to mandate  this not just in California but throughout the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 1435, and I urge a ``yes'' vote.
