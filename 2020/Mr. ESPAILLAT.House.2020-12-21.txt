 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and the  underlying COVID relief package:   Another $284 billion for PPP loans for small businesses that have  been hurting for so long, particularly restaurants that are struggling.  Finally, Main Street will get some help. We bailed out Wall Street a  long time ago and all the big guys; now we have got to bail out Main  Street.   $20 billion in EIDL grants for small businesses; another $600 in  stimulus checks for individuals and children. It should have been  $1,200, but we will take the $600 now, and we will be back after  January 20.   $300 for unemployment benefits. It should have been a little bit  more. You can't live on $300.   $13 billion for SNAP. People are starving, the lines are longer, made  up of families and children.   $14 billion for public transit, in addition to $4 billion for the  MTA. The MTA has a $12 billion gap. We will be back for the rest of  that money.   $68 billion for purchasing vaccines, and $20 billion for distributing  them.   Broadband.   And, finally, Madam Speaker, $4 billion for Gavi, an international  vaccine distribution alliance, because it is not an epidemic; it is a  pandemic.    We will not be free of COVID unless the rest of the  world is.  [[Page H7297]]
