 Mr. Speaker, today, too many Americans feel that their  own democracy doesn't respect them, that they are left out and locked  out of their own democracy.   That is why Democrats today are introducing the By the People  Resolution, a broad set of reforms, a declaration of principles that we  need to restore democracy and give people their voice back, in three  broad categories of reform:   Voter empowerment, voting rights; making sure that it is easier, not  harder, to access the ballot box and to cast your vote.  [[Page H5967]]    Ethics and accountability, because we need transparency in our  government. We need to obey the rules, observe the norms. That is  critical to have trust in government on the part of the people.   And lastly, campaign finance reform, because big money and special  interests have way too much influence up here on Capitol Hill, and we  need to do something about it.   We can do this. With a bold set of reforms, we can make sure that  Americans feel respected, and we can return, finally, to a government  of, by, and for the people.                            ____________________
