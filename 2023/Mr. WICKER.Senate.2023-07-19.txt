 What is the pending business?    Madam President, let me say that in just a few moments,  we will begin voting on amendments that are subject to unanimous  consent requests, and we hope to do five votes today and additional  votes tomorrow and following so that we can get this National Defense  Authorization Bill enacted and get to conference.   Let me say that this year's National Defense Authorization Act would  help meet the dangerous national security moment we face and would  equip our military with the tools necessary to implement the national  defense strategy.   Chairman Reed will speak later about the ways this bill will help us  deter adversaries and reinforce our defenses. It has been a pleasure to  work with him and to advance our constitutional duty to provide for the  common defense. We do this every year. This will be the 63rd time that  Congress--the House and Senate--have sent a national defense  authorization bill to the President for his signature, and I know we  will do it today. This is a testament to our commitment to our country  and also to our servicemembers.   Our threats are much greater than they were 63 years ago in 1961 when  the first NDAA was passed. Today, the United States faces the most  complex and dangerous global security situation since World War II.   China is swelling its military might. Xi Jinping has directed his  forces to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. He has actually said this  is his goal. He proclaimed it openly. A successful invasion of Taiwan  would spell the end of the global security architecture that has helped  ensure American peace and prosperity since 1945. Meanwhile, Russia is  executing the largest European land war in over half a century. But  Vladimir Putin's eyes are not only on  [[Page S3133]]  Ukraine and Europe. He seeks influence across the global south and the  Middle East.   Amid this resurgence of great power conflict, Iran and North Korea  are increasingly bellicose. Their weapons programs and missile tests  raise the specter of nuclear conflict to a higher level. The President  of Israel mentioned this very effectively in a joint speech to Congress  earlier today.   Indeed, our own homeland is no longer a sanctuary. Criminal Mexican  cartels have exploited our porous southwest border. This has created a  drug and human-trafficking crisis that is killing thousands of  Americans each year.   Moreover, two decades after 9/11, our sovereign airspace is  vulnerable. We witnessed that earlier this year when China flew a  surveillance balloon over our country without any encumbrance. Managing  such a complex threat environment requires more resources and smarter  approaches.   Senior national security officials have repeatedly told the Senate  Armed Services Committee a simple message: American defense  capabilities are spread dangerously thin. In fact, our military has not  been spread this thin in 70 years. Our industrial base began to hum on  the eve of war with the Axis powers. And since then, our worldwide  military presence has underwritten our domestic tranquility.   We have succeeded because we followed the doctrine of peace through  strength. We believe the best way to encounter today's threats is to  deter our adversaries from attacking at all. However, as today's  threats increase, our deterrence capabilities have decreased, and they  must begin to increase and do so immediately.   For the past few years, our defense industrial base has languished.  Anemic budgets created a brittle industry that cannot ramp production  to meet the needs of today. This year's NDAA is an important step  forward in our quest to rebuild our arsenal. Ideally, we would have an  annual 3- to 5-percent boost to our topline above inflation--3- to 5- percent boost above inflation to our topline. Yet even without that  budget increase, our committee has managed to advance a strong  bipartisan product that contains important provisions.   Let me summarize a few.   Our secret weapon, first of all, has always been our people. So  supporting our military personnel is key to any successful NDAA. This  bill authorizes a 5.2-percent pay raise for our servicemembers, and it  includes a host of other quality-of-life improvements for our troops  and for our families.   The bill also contains provisions that will help the military solve  its recruiting crisis. I am glad to note we include a massive expansion  of Junior ROTC--the JROTC program--an initiative that instills values  like citizenship and public service in our young people and, no doubt,  increases interest in military service.   A 19th century American Navy captain said:         Whoever rules the waves, rules the world.    Our committee agrees. This year's NDAA supports our shipbuilding  programs by fully authorizing LPD-33, the Marine Corps' top priority.  The bill decisively rejects the Biden administration's misguided  proposal to retire several ships too early. We also included support  for our submarine programs. The legislation addresses ongoing  maintenance delays. We are sending more funds to our shipyards. It  expands our deterrent capabilities with the sea-launched cruise  missile, and it allows us to make good on our commitments to the United  Kingdom and to Australia, commonly known as the AUKUS agreement.   The NDAA also delivers a host of powerful munitions. The bill makes  six more munitions eligible for multiyear procurement contracts,  including the highly regarded Tomahawk missile. This missile is one of  INDOPACOM's commander's top priorities for deterring Chinese aggression  in the western Pacific. The commander said he needed this additional  procurement, and this committee bill gives it to him.   These multiyear commitments send a clear demand signal to our  industrial base. We have to manufacture this ammunition. We have to  manufacture these weapons. They also allow us to replenish our stocks  while securing victory for Ukraine against our strategic adversary  Russia. And we will produce these arms at home, equipping American  troops with weapons made by American workers.    Our committee realizes military competition in the 21st century will  be decided also by our willingness to harness emerging technology. So  this NDAA accelerates the development of artificial intelligence-- offensive cyber, hypersonics, and unmanned platforms. We intend to lap  Beijing in the 100-year innovation marathon. We need to lap communist  China. So we are authorizing a new Pentagon authority within the Office  of Strategic Capital.   This bill also establishes investments in space launch infrastructure  to secure the high ground in the Sino-American space race.   As always, partnerships with our allies act as a force multiplier on  all the tools we are providing American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and  marines.   I am glad this bill enhances security cooperation with allies in  every part of the free world, from the Baltics to the Pacific.   The bill also addresses the crisis at the southwest border. And it is  a crisis. We do this by requiring the Department of Defense to develop  a strategy for countering fentanyl--a DOD strategy for countering the  deadly drug of fentanyl. It also authorizes the Department to act  against criminal Mexican cartels in cyber space.   Today, the Department unbelievably pays rent to store previously  purchased border wall materials. We don't put them up to protect our  border, but we pay rent to landowners to store these border wall  materials. This legislation, on a bipartisan basis, compels them to use  or transfer those materials so that wall construction can continue.  This bill focuses the Pentagon on deterring real wars, not fighting  culture wars.   Our NDAA sends a signal to the Department of Defense bureaucrats that  Congress intends to rein in divisive social policies. This year's bill  limits the amount we spend on salaries of DEI staff. It restores a  culture of meritocracy and calls our service academies to focus on  forming effective officers and not on hosting Berkeley-style seminars.   Time forbids me from listing all the provisions we have included in  the NDAA. But before I finish, I should note that we have an all-too- rare chance to return the Senate to regular order today, and it gives  us a chance to avoid a costly, wasteful continuing resolution for our  military. For the first time in years, the Senate majority leader has  put the Defense bill up for consideration with months left in the  calendar. Still, we must be mindful of the fleeting time. But we must  take this chance to avoid another self-inflicted real cut to defense.  And that is what a continuing resolution always does when we have to  retreat to that. Let's avoid that and we are doing that today.   We are going to take up five amendments that we have agreed by  unanimous consent to bring to the floor. The managers' package contains  50 amendments that have been agreed to by the committees and the  leadership--25 amendments sponsored by Democrats, 25 amendments  sponsored by my party, the Republican Party. And we have a chance to  continue this with votes tomorrow.   I think we should proceed with dispatch, working into the night, if  necessary, next week, to get this bill done after having a full debate  on ideas submitted from both sides of the aisle.   Let's work thoughtfully to deliver a bill to the President's desk  that commits this Congress to a national policy of preparedness.   Let me quote President Theodore Roosevelt who endorsed such a policy  of preparedness. Theodore Roosevelt said this:         Never in our entire history has a Nation suffered . . .       because too much care has been given to the Army, too much       prominence given it, too much money spent upon it, or because       it has been too large. But again and again, we have suffered       because enough care has not been given to it; because it had       been too small; because there has not been a sufficient       preparation in advance for a possible war.    We need to heed those words today. And what President Roosevelt was  saying is it will cost a lot to deter our enemies, but it would cost a  lot more if we do not. We cannot wait a moment longer to consider this  year's NDAA.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.  [[Page S3134]]     Madam President, to speak for a few seconds in opposition  to this amendment, it is absolutely unnecessary. I cannot think of any  currently serving elected official of significance who is calling for  suspending or withdrawing from NATO.   If I didn't know better, I would think that this amendment might be  aimed as a slap at former President Trump, but surely that is not the  case.   If it is, however, we should be reminded that the former President  was concerned about some of NATO's members not meeting their  obligations to spend 2 percent of GDP but that he was fully committed  to article 5 of NATO.   You will be pleased to know that this bill, NDAA, addresses the  concern of the 2 percent. We adopted an amendment at markup, sponsored  by Senator Sullivan, that would require the Secretary of Defense to  prioritize NATO members who are meeting or exceeding the 2 percent GDP  defense spending target when the DOD is making decisions on basing,  training, and exercises.  [[Page S3137]]    I yield the balance of my time.    Mr. President, how much time is left on this unnecessary  and extraneous amendment?    I urge a ``no'' vote for those reasons.                          Vote on Amendment No. 429     A parliamentary inquiry.    Do I understand this will be a 10-minute vote and those  Senators who arrive after 10 minutes and a brief grace period will not  be allowed to vote? Is that the position of the chair?    I appreciate the clarity.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following interns from my office be granted floor privileges until July  28, 2023: Shields Armstrong, Dia Chawla, Sykes Connell, Bobby Current,  Don Fruge, Christian Fulcher, and Barron Liston.
