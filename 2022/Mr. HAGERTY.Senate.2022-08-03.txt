 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, since last  year, I have been asking for a commitment from my Democratic colleagues  that any future reconciliation legislation in this Congress will not  incorporate policies that will reduce access to care in nonexpansion  States, such as Tennessee.   Specifically, my concern is that the reconciliation legislation that  the House of Representatives passed last fall, which is the very  vehicle for the reconciliation bill currently being discussed in the  Senate, included provisions that cut DSH and uncompensated care pool  payments for nonexpansion States. This would result in less healthcare  for vulnerable populations in my State, it would accelerate hospital  closures, and it would disadvantage rural communities. These are places  and populations for which we are trying to secure more quality  healthcare, not less.   Because I still have not received confirmation that these provisions  will not be included in the final text of the partisan reconciliation  bill, I cannot consent to expediting confirmation of this nominee and,  therefore, I object.    Mr. President, I would like to respond to my friend from  Pennsylvania.   That is a very reasonable request. We are getting ready to go through  a process of which I have not yet seen the text--an amendment process  that is hard to anticipate--and dread to think that there would be  another wraparound, that that could happen as well. But assuming that  we get to an end point and this language that I have discussed is not  in the bill--the same language that the House included is not in this  bill--I would be more than happy to lift my objection.
