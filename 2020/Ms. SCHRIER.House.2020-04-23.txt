 Madam Speaker, today's bill is critical for small  businesses in my district that are desperately waiting for this  financial lifeline.   The funding for testing is also critical as our country is woefully  behind. We need 10 to 20 times current levels of testing to know who is  infected and isolate them and to find emerging hot spots. Without that,  we are flying blind, and we will see new surges. Widespread testing is  key to moving forward.
