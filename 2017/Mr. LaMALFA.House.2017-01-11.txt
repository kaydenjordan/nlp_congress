 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sadness to honor the life  of a friend, Paul Stewart Shaner, known as ``Stu'' around Oroville. He  passed away just recently, December 13, at the age of 76.   A resident of Oroville, California, since age 5, Stu was a prominent  member of the community known for his civic engagement and a true  passion for his small town, the one I grew up in as well.   While poor eyesight prevented Stu from joining the military, he went  out of his way to serve in many other ways, serving veterans, serving  his community, and making veterans feel treasured. He served his  community in so many different ways, it is not hard to think of Stu as  the main fiber of our town of Oroville.   One of Stu's life goals was to erect a memorial park for veterans in  Oroville. He worked very hard to accomplish this, serving as co-chair  for the Veterans Memorial Park for over a decade.   When you heard from Stu, you heard from him. He was going to get this  done, and we were all determined to be helpful for him. He was  relentless. The new park is under construction this very moment.   In the words of everyone who knew Stu, he was one of the good guys  who loved his family, his town, and the veterans who served his  country.   God bless Stu Shaner's family. We will miss him.                            ____________________
