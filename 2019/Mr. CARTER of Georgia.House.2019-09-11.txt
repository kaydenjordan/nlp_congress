 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  National Security Agency police officer Ms. Karen Brown for being named  the 2019 Federal Law Enforcement Training Center Honor Graduate of the  Year. The most prestigious award for FLETC students, Ms. Brown excelled  with high marks in academics, physical fitness, and firearms training.   Originally from Ohio, Ms. Brown has worked at the NSA for the last 15  years serving in a number of roles at the agency; personal security,  polygraph examination, counterintelligence threat examination, and  more.   We thank Ms. Brown for her service to our Nation. A ceremony was held  at FLETC to reward her accomplishments on Tuesday, August 27.   In addition to Ms. Brown's great work, I want to thank all of the  students, recent graduates, and instructors at FLETC for their  commitment to our Nation in bettering their workforce training. The  Federal Law Enforcement Training Camp in Glynn County truly does an  outstanding job in getting their students the necessary skills to  thrive in any situation they may face in the field.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to this bill and the other two  natural resources bills that we will be considering this week.   Let me start by saying that it is unfortunate that we are in this  position today. One of the predominant reasons for this disappointment  is that I, like many of my colleagues, both support  [[Page H7611]]  energy development, while looking after our natural and ecological  resources.   I love my district dearly. I was born and raised there. I have lived  there all of my life and will continue to live there the rest of my  life. I value the beautiful coastline that we have in my district.   But blanket bans instituted by these bills across the Atlantic,  Pacific, Gulf, and Arctic are misguided and are, quite plainly, the  wrong approach.   In January of last year, I raised concerns with the Bureau of Ocean  Energy Management about how this plan would affect Georgia and my  constituents. In April of this year, after the Georgia General Assembly  passed a resolution opposing energy exploration in Federal waters off  of Georgia, I sent a letter to Secretary Bernhardt requesting he  exclude Georgia from consideration under this plan.   Mr. Chair, I have taken public service seriously for my entire life.  When I was elected to serve the people of the First District of  Georgia, I knew that I would be representing the will of my  constituents up here. That is why I have been firm in my stance that  Georgia be removed from consideration due to concerns from the State  legislature.   But while my request to remove Georgia from consideration under this  plan stands, I firmly believe it would be unwise and counterproductive  to move forward with this blanket ban on U.S. Federal waters.   Knowing these bills would be coming to the floor, I knew I needed to  do something to support the request I heard in the district that waters  off of Georgia be removed. That is why I, in order to abide by my  commitment to my constituents in our community, submitted three  amendments to the Rules Committee.   Unfortunately, my amendments, which would empower States to decide  what is best for them, remove Georgia from consideration, and address  undersea national security, were not accepted by my colleagues across  the aisle.   Let me be clear. This wasn't a rejection of including the amendments  in the bill. This was a rejection of the ability to even debate them.   My colleagues across the aisle who had championed the will of the  States to decide what is best for them when it comes to this topic,  would not let my amendments move forward. For those who were so opposed  to energy development offshore, I didn't even have the opportunity to  have an amendment removing Georgia from consideration debated on the  floor of this House.   Mr. Chair, it is really unfortunate that we are voting on these bills  which would sacrifice tens of thousands of jobs and millions in  economic benefits for political grandstanding.   To step back on domestic energy development is to promote foreign  energy consumption. I can still remember when the United States was  held hostage to Middle Eastern resources, and we can't allow that to  happen again.   While I believe Georgia should be removed from consideration, these  bills are not the solution. I oppose these three bills, and I hope my  colleagues will actually work with us on real solutions rather than  promoting messaging bills.
