 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I  been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 76.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss our  broken immigration system and our need to overcome partisan politics to  find a solution. The most glaring example of this broken system and the  one most endangering to American citizens is our porous southern  border. Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants bypass checkpoints and  avoid our immigration laws by using that border to gain access to  America.   But my colleagues across the aisle refuse to see the issue. They  ignore all the evidence to push their political agenda and discredit  the President at the expense of Americans' security. They now have  found a new excuse--the number of ICE's adult detention beds.   Let's be clear what this stunt is: a backdoor attempt to defund ICE,  prevent them from doing their critical mission, and attempt to appease  those demanding open borders.   I sincerely urge my colleagues across the aisle to come to the table  to negotiate in good faith for the safety and security of all  Americans. We need border security along our southern border  [[Page H1508]]  which includes a wall structure, and we need ICE to achieve its public  safety mission.   To the Democrats: Stop these last-minute games and let's do our job  for the American people                            ____________________
