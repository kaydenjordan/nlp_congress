 Mr. President, I rise today in honor of World Refugee  Day and to express my deep concern over the Trump administration's  systematic assault on refugees, asylum seekers, and the United States'  refugee resettlement program.   Manmade conflict, natural disasters, poverty, and violence have left  the world in the midst of the largest refugee crisis in recorded  history with over 25 million refugees worldwide. Tragically, less than  1 percent of these individuals will ever be resettled to a third  country.   The United States was built on the hopes and dreams of those fleeing  persecution and oppression, those seeking better lives for themselves  and their families. The values and moral compass that embraced these  individuals and shone as a beacon of freedom have made this country  great. In times of crisis, the United States traditionally asserted  global leadership through these values that have made this country so  successful. That leadership served as an important uniting and  motivating voice in the face of tremendous international challenges.   Unfortunately, instead of asserting moral and strategic leadership,  the Trump administration has chosen to retreat. The President has  traded in our proud tradition of lifting up the most vulnerable for an  agenda of degrading and insulting those who seek our support. Starting  with his assertion that Mexicans are ``rapists'' and ``drug dealers,''  this President has spent his tenure as our Nation's leader attacking  America's immigrant and refugee communities. The President said he  wanted to protect Dreamers; yet he abruptly ended the DACA program  throwing the lives of 800,000 people into great uncertainty. He imposed  a slap-dash Muslim ban that has been repeatedly struck down by the  courts. He has slowed refugee admissions to a trickle, closing  America's doors to some of the most vulnerable people on the planet,  reducing America's global leadership standing.   Driven by vitriolic voices, the President and the Attorney General  together have worked to effectively destroy the refugee resettlement  program, which traditionally received broad bipartisan support. Last  September, the President decreed that the number of refugees to be  admitted in  [[Page S4276]]  fiscal year 2018 should be 45,000--half of the historic average. Even  more concerning, it is now clear that this administration is further  rigging the admissions program to ensure that only a fraction of that  number of people will be allowed in. In the first quarter of 2018, just  6,704 refugees were resettled, compared to 25,671 in 2017 and 13,791 in  2016.   The U.S. Refugee Resettlement Program--and the faith groups,  organizations, families and individuals that assist it--supports the  most vulnerable. These are the victims of torture, people with urgent  medical needs, and desperate women and children. They are not safe in  their home country. They have gone through extensive multiagency  vetting before even reaching the United States. We are witnessing the  intentional dismantling of a program that has helped the world's most  defenseless, built our leadership abroad and here at home helped create  thriving, diverse communities across the country, including in places  like Camden and Elizabeth in my home State of New Jersey.   Despite its effort to prove the opposite by commissioning a study by  the Department of Health and Human Services, the administration's own  report found that refugees have had a net positive economic impact in  the United States over the past decade. The study concluded that  between 2005 and 2014, refugees ``contributed an estimated $269.1  billion in revenues to all levels of government'' and estimated the net  positive fiscal impact of refugees over the 10-year period to be $63  billion.   Alarming and horrifically, we have witnessed the administration's  callous and misguided approach to migrants and refugees most recently  on our southern border. American citizens and people around the world  have watched in horror as U.S. officials are forcibly pulling babies  and children out of their parents' arms, tearing families apart, and  using preposterous defenses for their actions. This is not the United  States I know. This is not the United States that has stood as a  champion for the rule of law and human rights.   The President has blamed those fleeing persecution. He has blamed  Democrats. He has taken no responsibility. His tweets have only gotten  more hysterical. His repeated demands for a ridiculous wall are not a  solution and only further fuel negative perceptions of the United  States.   The party of ``family values'' has become the part of ``family  separation.'' This ``policy'' is not required by U.S. law. This is a  choice that this administration has made. It was a policy choice to  charge asylum seekers in criminal court with illegal entry. In essence,  it seems that President Trump and Attorney General Sessions want to  turn every asylum seeker into a criminal and every child into a foster  child.   It is easy to be distracted by the President's tweets and outlandish  statements. The palace intrigue coming from the White House provide  endless fodder for the talking heads on TV, but we cannot lose focus on  the real harms being done to our fellow human beings and to our global  standing.   On this World Refugee Day, let us come together and remember that  part what makes America great is our open doors that have welcomed  people from all over the world. We have been a shining city on a hill;  a beacon of light and hope. Since 2001, the United States has settled  nearly a million refugees. They are our friends, our neighbors, our  coworkers. They sit next to your kid in school, and someday, they may  grow up to be a Secretary of State like Madeleine Albright.   What kind of a country do we want to be? A country where we rip  children from their parents? A country that keeps out refugees because  of their religion? I have seen a quote posted on Twitter, pasted on  signs at rallies, even on a church bulletin board--I don't know who  said it first--but it bears repeating here: ``Rather than a wall,  America needs to build a giant mirror to reflect on what we've  become.''                            ____________________
