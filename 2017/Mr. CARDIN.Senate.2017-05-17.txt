 Madam President, just last Wednesday, I spoke on the  Senate floor about the extremely suspicious timing of the firing of FBI  Director James Comey by President Trump.   In the past few days, President Trump's actions, statements, and  changing of his story on the Comey firing has only strengthened the  case for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate ties and  collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian Government in the  2016 Presidential election. Congress should also establish an  independent commission to get to the bottom of the Russian interference  in our election. In addition, there needs to be an independent  investigation into whether Mr. Trump abused power and played a role in  obstruction of justice in terms of the ongoing criminal investigation  at the Department of Justice.   Let me start by going back to the beginning of the Trump  administration. According to news reports, on January 27, Mr. Trump  invited Mr. Comey to a private dinner with him at the White House. Mr.  Trump then asked Mr. Comey for his ``loyalty,'' but Mr. Comey only  promised to provide his ``honesty'' or his ``honest loyalty.'' Why did  the President allegedly ask Director Comey for his loyalty?   On March 4, President Trump tweeted without evidence that ``how low  has President Obama gone to tap my phones during the very sacred  election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!'' On  March 20, Mr. Comey testified he has ``no information'' to support Mr.  Trump's claim. Why did the President try to distract the public's  attention by blaming President Obama for the Russia investigation?   On April 12, in an interview, Mr. Trump said Mr. Comey ``saved  Hillary Clinton'' during the campaign and said that ``it's not too  late'' to remove Mr. Comey. Mr. Trump continued: ``But, you know, I  have confidence in him. We'll see what happens, you know, it's going to  be interesting.''   What changed between Mr. Trump having confidence in Mr. Comey in  April and firing him in May?   On May 3, Mr. Comey testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee  and said ``it makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had  some impact on the election.''   On May 8, former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates and former  Director of National Intelligence James Clapper both testified before  the Judiciary Committee.   Ms. Yates testified about the warnings she gave to White House  Counsel Don McGahn about how National Security Adviser Michael Flynn  was compromised by the Russians and was lying to White House staff and  the Vice President about his conversations and interactions with the  Russians.   On May 9, we witnessed a series of three letters, all dated that day.  The first letter was from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to  Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The Rosenstein letter concludes that  the FBI's reputation and credibility had suffered ``substantial  damage'' due to Mr. Comey's actions during the Clinton email  investigation. Notably, Rosenstein's memo does not explicitly recommend  Mr. Comey's removal. That same day, Attorney General Sessions, who has  recused himself from the Russia-Trump campaign investigation, sent the  Rosenstein letter to the White House, along with his own letter,  concluding that ``a fresh start is needed at the leadership of the  FBI.'' Again, on the same day that Mr. Trump fired Director Comey, the  Trump letter includes a curious aside: ``I greatly appreciate you  informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under  investigation.'' Did Director Comey really give those assurances to  President Trump when the criminal and counterintelligence  investigations into the  [[Page S2981]]  Trump campaign and Russia connections are still active and ongoing?   At the same time, we heard from White House Press Secretary Sean  Spicer and we heard from the Vice President of the United States that  the reason for the firing of Mr. Comey was the recommendation of the  Department of Justice. That is what they said it was, only to find the  next day President Trump saying:         In fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I       said ``You know, this Russian thing with Trump and Russia is       a made-up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having       lost an election that they should have won.''    Then he talked about Mr. Comey and said he had decided to fire him.  So it was not the memos; it was what Mr. Trump had decided. So there is  a lot of misinformation being sent out, which raises a lot of  questions.   Over the weekend, former Director of National Intelligence James  Clapper stated:         I think in many ways our institutions are under assault       both externally--and that's the big news here is the Russian       interference in our election system--and I think as well our       institutions are under assault internally.    So we have the former Director of National Intelligence, Mr. Clapper,  saying we have some problems internally.   The only way we are going to get to the bottom of this, the only way  we are going to find out what this loyalty oath is all about or how Mr.  Trump came to the conclusion to fire Mr. Comey or, more recently, where  we hear Mr. Comey has memos of a meeting in which the President asked  him to go easy on an investigation, which could rise to obstruction of  justice--the only way we are going to get to the bottom of all this is  by having an independent special counsel prosecutor appointed by the  Department of Justice. That is what needs to be done. The facts need to  go where they take us, but we also have to have an investigation that  has the credibility that it will not be interfered with by the  President of the United States. The only way to do that is by having  special counsel appointed by the Department of Justice. It is the only  way to restore the reputation of the Department of Justice.   I might say that we also need to understand exactly what Russia was  doing here in the United States. There are so many examples of Russia  being aggressive in our campaign. We know they wanted to discredit the  American campaign. We know they took sides in favor of Mr. Trump over  Mrs. Clinton. We know they hacked information. We know they used  misinformation. We know they used cyber and social media in order to  further their advancements. We also know they met with representatives  of the Trump campaign. The American people have a right to understand  exactly what those contacts were all about. That is why I filed the  resolution, which is supported by many of my colleagues, to set up a 9/ 11 independent commission in order to get to the bottom of what is  happening. That can be done simultaneously with the work being done by  the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is important work for us to  do, but we also need to have an independent commission in order to  determine exactly what Russia was doing so we can take the necessary  steps to prevent this from occurring in the future.   There are a lot of unanswered questions. People say: Well, how can  you call for action if you don't know all the facts? I am calling for  us to know all the facts. I am calling for us to understand exactly why  on one day the White House sends out one story that the Department of  Justice recommended the firing of Mr. Comey, and then on the next day  the President said: No, I decided that before I met with the Attorney  General and the Deputy Attorney General.   We need to understand why there was a conversation in which Mr. Comey  has notes that indicate Mr. Trump wanted him to go easy in an  investigation. That is a pretty serious charge. We need to understand  this information. That is why it is impossible for the Department of  Justice to do an independent investigation. It will always be suspect  as to whether that investigation of the President of the United States  or the White House will have impact as to how that investigation is  being done because there is already evidence that they tried to do that  previously in this investigation.   The law is clear; the law is clear as to how special prosecutors and  counsel are appointed where conflicts exist. The Department of Justice  has this authority. We know that Attorney General Sessions has recused  himself from the Russia investigation. Deputy Attorney General  Rosenstein now has the authority to make that decision. He should  clearly make that decision, not because it is the right thing to do-- which it is, which it is--and we have the obligation to make sure the  American people get all the facts as to what happened here, but it is  also the reputation of the Department of Justice that is at stake.   I urge my colleagues to continue. I know we will have a chance  tomorrow in our meeting with Mr. Rosenstein, but I would urge us to  listen to what the American people are saying and recognize that we are  an independent branch of government, and one of our principal  responsibilities is oversight--and oversight of the executive branch of  government. I urge us to carry out that responsibility by  collectively--it shouldn't be partisan--collectively telling the  Department of Justice: Get all the facts, do it in an independent way,  appoint an independent prosecutor, let the facts lead us where they are  going to lead us, and let's not prejudge. But this is a serious,  serious matter.   In order to protect ourselves from an aggressive enemy--and that is  Russia, which is trying to bring down our democratic government, which  has now been acknowledged not just by the intelligence community over  and over again, but their ability to try to compromise our system is  now much better understood--we need to have that independent commission  devoted to giving us the recommendations to keep America safe.   I urge my colleagues to exercise that independent function and to set  up an independent commission.   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, April was Genocide Awareness and  Prevention Month. It commemorated some of the most horrific genocides  and atrocities of the 20th century: the siege of Sarajevo in April  1992, the Rwandan genocide in April 1992; the Cambodian genocide in  April 1975; and, the Armenian genocide in April 1915. Last, Yom Hashoah  or Holocaust Remembrance Day fell during the month of April this year.   We must remember the past. And we must also be mindful of the present  and the future. As we know all too well, criminal atrocities persist  around the globe. In South Sudan, the world's youngest nation, a  political and ethnic conflict is now in its fourth year. Tens of  thousands of civilians were killed in mass atrocities and thousands  more have fled the country fearing for their lives. In Iraq, ISIS has  committed genocide against Yezidis, Christians, and Shiite Muslims, a  determination made by former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry last  year. ISIS has killed, expelled, raped, and enslaved Yezidi men, women,  and children in northern Iraq, and has committed similar atrocities  against other groups living in areas under its control.   In Burma, the Rohingya Muslim community faces such severe violence  and dehumanization, including slaughtering and sequestration, that many  experts believe their suffering amounts to genocide. Moreover, in  Syria, repeatedly, we see a government committing atrocities against  its own people. Children are being gassed. Hospitals are being bombed.  Innocent people are being tortured to death.   Too often, we have done too little, waited too long, or been caught  unprepared by events that should not have surprised us. We continue to  forget the lessons of the past and fail to live up to the post- Holocaust pledge of ``Never Again.'' Ignoring the genocide, war crimes,  and crimes against humanity that continue to rage around the world  sends a message to the global community that criminal atrocities are  tolerable. We must do better to see that atrocities never again occur  on our watch.   On April 7, I introduced the Syrian War Crimes Accountability Act,  which expands the tools the U.S. government is using to document  atrocities in Syria and hold President Bashar al-Assad and other  perpetrators accountable. Today, under the heavy cloud of atrocities  occurring in South Sudan, Iraq, Burma, Syria, and elsewhere, I am  introducing another atrocity-related bill, the Elie Wiesel Genocide and  Atrocities Prevention Act of 2017. This bill--named in honor of the  courageous, inspiring Holocaust survivor and Nobel Laureate Elie  Wiesel--strengthens the U.S. government's infrastructure to prevent and  respond to mass atrocities, wherever they may occur.   I am here today to stress that our job, our responsibility, is to  make sure the United States has the full arsenal of tools--diplomatic,  economic, and legal--to take meaningful action before atrocities occur.  The costs--both human and economic--of addressing these atrocities too  late or after-the-fact are skyrocketing. The United States must do a  better job of responding earlier and more effectively to these crimes-- when warning signs begin to point towards possible atrocities  occurring, and when strategic investments can have a greater impact in  promoting stability and security. Essential to this effort is ensuring  that the United States Government has structures in place and  mechanisms at hand to better prevent and respond to potential  atrocities.   Atrocity prevention has long been a bipartisan cause. In 1988,  President Reagan signed implementing legislation allowing the United  States to become a party to the Convention on the Prevention and  Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. In the 2006 National Security  Strategy, President George W. Bush highlighted the ``moral imperative  that states take action to prevent and punish genocide.'' In 2008, the  bipartisan Genocide Prevention Task Force, which was co-chaired by  former Secretary of Defense William Cohen and former Secretary of State  Madeleine Albright, stated: ``Genocide and mass atrocities . . .  threaten core U.S. national interests.'' In 2010, the Senate  unanimously passed a resolution recognizing ``the United States  national interest in helping to prevent and mitigate acts of genocide  and other mass atrocities against civilians, and supporting and  encouraging efforts to develop a whole of government approach to  prevent and mitigate such acts.'' In 2011, President Obama declared:  ``Preventing mass atrocities and genocide is a core national security  interest and a core moral responsibility of the United States of  America.'' The same year, former U.S. Permanent Representative to the  United Nations Samantha Power stated that preventing genocide  ``required a degree of governmental organization that matches the kind  of methodical organization that accompanies mass-killings.''   We need to continue taking proactive steps to enhance our Nation's  capacity to quickly anticipate and address genocide and other atrocity  crimes. I am introducing the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities  Prevention Act of 2017 to ensure that we do just that. I am joined in  this effort by Senators Young, Tillis, Durbin, Rubio, Menendez,  Murkowski, Blumenthal, Warren, Whitehouse, Gillibrand, Klobuchar,  Shaheen, Franken, Peters, Coons, Stabenow, Booker, Markey, Brown,  Baldwin, and Wyden. This bill does a number of things. First, the bill  authorizes the creation of a Mass Atrocities Task Force, which is a  transparent, accountable, proactive, high-level, interagency body that  includes representatives at the assistant secretary level or higher  from departments and agencies across the U.S. Government. The Task  Force would work collaboratively with representatives of governmental  as well as nongovernmental organizations to oversee the development and  implementation of U.S. policy on atrocity prevention and response.   Second, this bill gives our Foreign Service Officers the training  they need to recognize patterns of escalation and early warning signs  of potential atrocities and conflict. With this training, we will, over  time, build atrocity prevention into the core skillset of our people on  the ground. They will be better equipped to see warning signs, analyze  events, and engage early.   Third, this bill calls on the Director of National Intelligence to  include in his or her annual testimony to Congress on threats to U.S.  national security a review of countries and regions at risk of mass  atrocities as well as, whenever possible, specific risk factors,  potential groups of perpetrators, and at-risk target groups. With this  information, Congress will be better informed and better able to  respond to mass atrocities that are brewing.   Finally, this bill authorizes the Complex Crises Fund, which is a  specifically dedicated portion of our foreign assistance budget for  mitigating conflict. The Complex Crises Fund enables  [[Page S3015]]  us to rapidly respond to emerging crises overseas, including potential  atrocities. We have already used the Complex Crises Fund to respond to  crises in the Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Kenya,  Sri Lanka, and elsewhere. Without this important tool, our ability to  effectively prevent and mitigate crises is severely constrained.   Mr. President, this is a good bill. It does good things, and places  the United States on solid moral ground. However, the moral argument is  not the only reason to support this bill. We must also remember that  America's security, and that of our allies, is impacted when civilians  are slaughtered. Our security is impacted when desperate refugees  stream across borders. Our security is affected when perpetrators of  extraordinary violence wreak havoc on regional stability, destroying  communities, families, and livelihoods. We have seen groups like ISIS  systematically targeting communities because of their ethnicity or  religious beliefs and practices, and yet, we still lack a comprehensive  framework to prevent and respond to genocide and other atrocity crimes.  So, let this bill act as our framework, and our call to action, so that  when we use the phrase ``never again,'' we know that we are taking  meaningful preventative action.                                  ______                                         By Ms. WARREN (for herself, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Murray, Ms.          Baldwin, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Booker, Mr. Brown, Mr.          Cardin, Mr. Casey, Ms. Duckworth, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Franken, Mrs.          Gillibrand, Ms. Harris, Ms. Hassan, Mr. Heinrich, Ms. Heitkamp,          Ms. Hirono, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Manchin, Mr. Markey,          Mr. Menendez, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Peters, Mr. Reed,          Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Udall, Mr. Van          Hollen, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Wyden, Ms. Cortez Masto, and Mrs.          McCaskill):   S. 1162.
