 Mr. Speaker, what this legislation does on the surface  is very clear: it makes health care more expensive. The more you need  it--the sicker or older or poorer you are--the further out of reach it  will be. That is why doctors, hospitals, nurses, the mental health  community, and patients have spoken out, and spoken out against this  bill.   But this bill doesn't just cut coverage and hike premiums all for a  tax cut for the wealthy. It codifies a worldview by this administration  that is dead set on dividing America along the lines of the god of your  prayers, whom you love, where you come from, and your fate and fortune.  We see it in their tax plan, in their budget cuts, in immigration  policy, and now in health care, a worldview that scapegoats the  struggling and the suffering, that sees fault in illness, and that  rejects the most basic universal truth of the human existence, which is  that every single one of us one day will be brought to our knees by a  diagnosis we didn't expect, a phone call we can't imagine, and a loss  we cannot endure.  [[Page H4144]]    So we take care of each other because, but for the grace of God,  there go I one day, and we hope we will be shown that mercy, too. It is  the ultimate test of the character of this country confronting our  Chamber today: not the power we give the strong, but the strength with  which we embrace the weak.
