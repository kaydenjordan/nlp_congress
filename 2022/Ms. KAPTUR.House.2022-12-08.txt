 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share a good news story from  McGregor Elementary School in Toledo, Ohio. For her fourth grade class'  end-of-the-year project, a 10-year-old student named Brooklyn dressed  up as me, read up on congressional history, and shared all she had  learned with her fellow students about Congress.   Just recently, I had the pleasure of visiting Brooklyn and her fellow  students to hear all about how their fifth-grade year is going. What a  surprise it was to open my mailbox the other day and discover so many  thoughtful, handwritten notes mailed to me by these wonderful students.  [[Page H8855]]    I saw close-up, firsthand how bright, artistic, and precocious our  aspiring generation in America really is. One young man named Henry  wrote: ``I decided to write this letter because no one is going to tell  me not to.''   This moment of winter wonderment is a good time to take stock of all  that has occurred over the past year. As we enter this holiday season,  I am reminded of so many very kind people for whom I am grateful,  particularly the joy of the children at McGregor Elementary School in  Toledo, Ohio.   Happy holidays to all, and may the upcoming year bring endless joy  and light.                            ____________________
