 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for his  friendship and his encouragement. Maybe not encouragement on this  specific bill, but I am proud to support this bill because it does help  with the maintenance backlog in the National Parks, as well as assist  with the long-term reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation  Trust, which is something I strongly support.   Since its inception over 50 years ago, the Land and Water  Conservation Trust has done very important things for my State and our  Nation in preserving access to public lands and to the great outdoors.   Also, for the maintenance backlog, I am proud to represent a piece of  the Blue Ridge Parkway, which runs through my district and was the  second most visited National Park last year. I think this year would be  the same.   In North Carolina alone, we have over 260,000 jobs that are directly  attributable to the great outdoors; and those millions of visitors that  come to the State through the Blue Ridge Parkway, they are vital for  our economy in western North Carolina.   Passage of this bill will help, both the backlog and with ensuring  that we have long-term reauthorization on the Land and Water  Conservation Trust. I encourage a ``yes'' vote.
