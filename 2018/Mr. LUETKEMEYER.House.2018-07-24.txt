 Mr. Speaker, the National Flood Insurance Program is  critical to millions of Americans who need access to affordable flood  insurance, but it is also in desperate need of reform. The current  construct of the NFIP doesn't serve anyone well. Taxpayers are left  unprotected, and the program continues to offer antiquated policies and  provides insufficient coverage. FEMA continues to hold a monopoly in  the flood insurance space, leaving policyholders with no freedom to  choose a policy that works best for them.   Mr. Speaker, last year, we came together as a body and passed  comprehensive NFIP reform. Unfortunately, the Senate has failed to do  anything with those even modest reforms that we had in that bill.  Tomorrow, we are probably going to pass another bill and kick the can  down the road. We will probably do the same thing in November.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this bill because I think it is time to make  some reforms. It is time to take a stand and do something to protect  the taxpayers who are on the hook for all of what I call the  mismanagement of this agency and for these continued risks to  individuals who are policyholders of these policies who continue to  live in dangerous areas.
