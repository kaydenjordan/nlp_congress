 Mr. President, the past 8 years have not been easy for  America's middle class. Americans labored under an economy that failed  to deliver. They have fought against redtape that threatened their jobs  and small businesses. When they looked at Washington, they saw an  administration that repeatedly put its leftwing ideology ahead of  middle-class interests.   Kentuckians understand this better than most. They watched as the  last administration launched a war on vulnerable families in coal  country. They watched as the last administration launched a direct  attack on the middle class in the form of ObamaCare.   Kentuckians were promised that health insurance premiums would go  down, but they soared by as much as 47 percent just this year.  Kentuckians were promised that health choices would increase, but they  plummeted down to just one exchange provider in nearly half of our  counties. Kentuckians were also promised they could keep their health  plans, but many continued to find themselves forced into insurance so  expensive, insurance that so few of their doctors will accept, it is  basically useless.   ObamaCare has pushed Kentucky's insurance market to the brink of  collapse, and now Democrats want to throw a victory party. I am not  sure how else to interpret their choice to respond to the President's  address tonight.   The absolute ObamaCare disaster that Governor Beshear presided over  continues to harm Kentucky today, even after he has left office.  Kentuckians have since repudiated that legacy in election after  election. They replaced him with an anti-ObamaCare Governor and  legislature. They voted for a President who listened to them and  promised to repeal and replace ObamaCare. They sent Republicans back to  the Senate and House who listened to them and promised to repeal and  replace this partisan law as well.   Former Kentucky Governor Beshear was correct to note that ``the  American people by their votes don't agree with [Democrats].'' So maybe  he will agree it is time to finally listen to Kentuckians and families  around the country and move on from this disastrous law.   What I am talking about here is, he is doing the response tonight.  The former Governor of Kentucky is the poster child for ObamaCare and  doing the response to the President tonight. We are going to move  forward. I hope that is the message Governor Beshear can find within  himself to deliver tonight, but I will not hold my breath. I am sure it  is a message President Trump will deliver, however.   In November, the American people elected a new President who offered  a new direction. He will now have an opportunity to talk about how we  can make that change. We already know what needs to be done. We need to  leave ObamaCare in the past and replace it with commonsense reform so  we can bring relief to the middle class.   We need to make regulations smarter so we can get the economy moving.  We need to make taxes simpler so we can create more jobs. I look  forward to hearing what the President has to say on all of these  matters.   I also hope he will provide more thoughts on how we can help our  veterans and strengthen our military. Getting even one of these items  achieved would be a win for our country. Getting all of them done would  be a significant undertaking.   Congress may hold the key to getting many things done, but the  executive branch has important authority as well. The President and his  Cabinet Secretaries have already taken critical action to move us  forward on many of these issues. It is another reason the rest of his  Cabinet needs to be confirmed as soon as possible. The Senate is  working hard to get that done.   The Senate is also working hard to confirm another of his nominees,  an outstanding jurist named Neil Gorsuch. He is going to make an  exceptional Supreme Court Justice. It is a sentiment  [[Page S1458]]  you hear expressed right across the political spectrum. The President  made a brilliant choice with Judge Gorsuch.   We are all looking forward to what the President has to say tonight.  It is a big moment for him. More importantly, it is a big moment for  our country. Americans are ready to move forward. They are ready to get  our economy moving. They are ready to leave the failures of the status  quo behind, such as ObamaCare, and move toward a more hopeful future.  After 8 long years, believe me, it is something we can all use.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
