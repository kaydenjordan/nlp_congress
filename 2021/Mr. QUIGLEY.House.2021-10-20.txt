 Madam Speaker, I rise today in unity with Americans  suffering from ALS and their families, who are desperate for effective  treatments and, one day, a cure.   I made it my mission to pass the ACT for ALS Act because people with  ALS deserve a chance to fight the disease. They deserve a research and  development infrastructure that is compassionate today while looking to  the future.   My friend, Brian Wallach, who was diagnosed with ALS 4 years ago,  told Congress that this fight is the closing argument for his life. I  can't look him in the eye and tell him we have to wait. None of us  should.   I am profoundly grateful to each and every one of the 325 cosponsors  of this bill, as are families impacted by ALS all around the country.  This is the most cosponsors of any bill that has not yet gotten a vote  in this Congress.   It is time for us to act. It is time to act for ALS.                            ____________________
