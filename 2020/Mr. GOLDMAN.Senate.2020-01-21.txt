 So the subsequent meeting--after both meetings       when you spoke to him and relayed to him what Ambassador       Sondland said, what did Ambassador Bolton say to you?         Right. But just in that second meeting, what       did he say?         What was that specific instruction?         What did you understand it to mean by the drug       deal that Mulvaney and Sondland were cooking up?         Did you go speak to the lawyers?         And you relayed everything that you just told       us and more?         Did you take notes of this conversation on       September 1st with Ambassador Sondland?        Ambassador TAYLOR. I did.         And did you take notes related to most of the       conversations, if not all of them, that you recited in your       opening statement?        Ambassador TAYLOR. All of them, Mr. Goldman.    . . .         And you are aware, I presume, that the State       Department has not provided those notes to the committee. Is       that right?        Ambassador TAYLOR. I am aware.         So we don't have the benefit of reviewing them       to ask you these questions.        Ambassador TAYLOR. Correct. I understand that they may be       coming, sooner or later.         Well, we would welcome that.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. The State Department never produced those  notes.   As another example, Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent testified about a  key document that he drafted on August 16, describing his concerns that  the Trump administration was attempting to pressure Ukraine into  opening politically motivated investigations.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)   [ What was that specific instruction?        Dr. HILL. The specific instruction was that I had to go to       the lawyers, to John Eisenberg, our senior counsel for the       National Security Council, to basically say,  [[Page S409]]       you tell Eisenberg, Ambassador Bolton told me that I am not       part of this whatever drug deal that Mulvaney and Sondland       are cooking up.         What did you understand him to mean by the       drug deal that Mulvaney and Sondland were cooking up?        Dr. HILL. I took it to mean investigations for a meeting.         Did you go speak to the lawyers?        Dr. HILL. I certainly did.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Sondland's testimony not only corroborates Dr.  Hill's account. He actually says that Mick Mulvaney, the subject of  this amendment, who should appear before the Senate if we are going to  have a free and fair trial--Sondland says Mick Mulvaney knew all about  it.
