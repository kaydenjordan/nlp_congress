 Mr. Chairman, I thank Representative   Mike  Thompson for his diligent work on behalf of his fire-impacted  communities and our State. It is critical that Congress ensures that  every Federal resource is made available to the States, local  governments, and all affected communities of the historic and  unprecedented 2018 wildfires.   Ensuring that Californians get the support and resources they need is  not a partisan issue. It is particularly frustrating that FEMA has the  sole discretion to adjust these cost shares and often does so after  catastrophic disasters or when multiple disasters strike the same State  in a short period of time, as we have experienced in California. The  State of California has requested the administration to adjust these  cost shares, unfortunately, to no avail.   I appreciate Mr. Thompson's diligent work on this issue. I remain  committed to working with him, our leadership, and the bipartisan  cosponsors of the amendment to provide, in the Department of Homeland  Security's full-year fiscal year 2019 funding bill, an increased cost  share of 90 percent for these additional categories of Federal disaster  funding for California communities devastated by the 2018 wildfires.    Mr. Chair, in closing, in the meantime, I will  work with him and the other members of the California delegation in  pursuing this matter with the administration on this reasonable and  much-needed adjustment within its existing authority.
