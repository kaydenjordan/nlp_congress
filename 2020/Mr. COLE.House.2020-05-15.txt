 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), my good friend, for yielding me the customary 30  minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, we are here today to consider a rule that provides for  consideration of two items.   Today's rule establishes a process for consideration of H.R. 6800,  what the majority is calling the HEROES Act, but what is better  described as an 1800-page, $3 trillion Democratic list of policy  priorities.   The rule proposes the most consequential change in the rules of the  House of Representatives during my time in Congress. The change to the  House rules covers two key areas:   First, it would impose, for the first time in our history as an  institution, a system of proxy voting on the floor of the House of  Representatives. That change also allows for the adoption of totally  remote voting upon the certification of a single Member of Congress,  Chairman Lofgren, of a technology for that use.   Second, it would also allow committees to operate remotely and  approve legislation remotely.   Madam Speaker, I said quite a bit about these rules changes at our  committee meeting yesterday, and I continue to stand by those comments.  I believe these changes will fundamentally alter the nature of the  institution, and not for the better. We must never forget that the  House is part of a Congress--literally, a physical meeting between  delegates.   When we move to acting remotely, we lose that fundamental aspect of  our character. We lose the opportunity to meet together, discuss ideas,  discuss legislation, and move forward together on bills that shape our  Nation. And we do so in a way that does not, in my view, pass  constitutional muster.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject these rules changes  today and return to the drawing board so that we can act together in a  bipartisan manner to ensure that Congress can continue to operate  during this crisis.   Not to be outdone with attempting to change the fundamental nature of  the House of Representatives, in today's rule, the majority is  proposing an enormous bill that will fundamentally change the nature of  our country.   H.R. 6800, which we saw for the first time on Tuesday afternoon, is  1800 pages long. While we do not yet have a CBO score, the majority is  purporting that the bill includes spending in excess of $3 trillion.  And to make matters worse, the bill was assembled with only Democratic  input. It is not a stretch to say that this bill is nothing more than  Democratic policy agenda masquerading as a response to the coronavirus  crisis.   Madam Speaker, it goes without saying that this bill is going  nowhere, and it is going nowhere fast. The Senate will not consider  this bill. The President will not sign it into law.   Why we are wasting what precious little time that the Speaker is  allowing us to be assembled here at the Capitol on partisan policy  priorities of one party instead of working together in a bipartisan  manner is beyond my understanding.   What is even more surprising is how quickly the majority wants to  move on a bill of this magnitude. Just 6 weeks ago, Congress passed,  and the President signed into law, the CARES Act, a bill that provided  over $2.3 billion for coronavirus relief efforts. And just 2 weeks ago,  we passed another bipartisan bill that provided an additional $500  billion in relief. Some of the money from these two bills hasn't even  been spent yet. But now, Democrats are falling all over themselves to  spend another $3 trillion on their own priorities. It is simply  astonishing.   Let me be clear of one thing, Madam Speaker: Republicans in the  House, in the Senate, and in the White House stand ready to work with  Democrats to pass another bipartisan coronavirus relief bill at the  appropriate time and after the normal give-and-take of serious  negotiation. That bill, when it comes, will be very different in scope  and detail from what we are considering here today.   Consider just a few of the provisions in H.R. 6800:   $3 trillion in spending;   Nearly $10,000 for every American;   A controversial bailout of multiemployer pension plans;   Forgiving $10,000 of student loan debt per person;   Federalizing the national election system;   Changing credit scoring models and banning debt collection;   Requiring nationwide vote by mail and same-day registration.   I could go on and on and on, but I think everyone gets the picture.  So much of what is in this bill simply has nothing at all to do with  the current crisis. It is more like a liberal Christmas card wish list.   Madam Speaker, it would make more sense, in my view, to just send it  straight to Santa Clause than to send it to the United States Senate.  It would have a better chance of becoming law that way.   Madam Speaker, this doesn't make sense. If the majority actually  wants to help Americans, there are plenty of bipartisan ways to do so.  We could be focusing our efforts on legislation to combat the pandemic,  to get people back to work, and to restore the economy, but instead we  have been handed 1800 pages and over $3 trillion in Democratic  priorities that they would be pursuing regardless of the pandemic. We  can do better than that; and, frankly, Madam Speaker, recently, we have  done better than that.   I remind my friends that we actually considered and passed, on a  bipartisan basis, four relief bills with almost no partisan dissent.  Those bills were negotiated before they ever arrived on the floor of  this body. We should return to that method and that system. It yielded  real results for the American people. What we have got today will not.    Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record two articles from  distinguished constitutional scholars at the Congressional Institute  that do raise questions about the constitutionality of the proposed  rules changes.              [From congressionalinstitute.org, May 13, 2020]   The Quorum, the Constitutional Convention, and the Coronavirus: Some                                 Questions         The coronavirus pandemic has led some to call on Congress       to continue its operations while Members are dispersed       throughout the country. H. Res. 965 authorizes the Speaker to       allow Members to vote by proxy when the Sergeant-at-Arms       notifies her that there is a public health emergency due to       the coronavirus. Conceivably, this means that a only minority       of the Members will be present in the Chamber when conducting       business. On the face of it, that would violate Article I,       Section 5, of the Constitution, which requires a majority of       Members to do business. To get insulate the votes against       constitutional challenges, H. Res. 965 stipulates that proxy       votes would count towards a quorum. This, however, would       still seem to violate the intent of the Framers of the U.S.       Constitution.          What does the Constitution say about quorums in Congress?         Article I, Section 5, of the U.S. Constitution sets forth a       requirement that a majority of the Members of either House of       Congress must be present for it to conduct business:         Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and       Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each       shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller       Number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to       compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and       under such Penalties as each House may provide.    what did the delegates to the constitutional convention say about the                                  quorum?         The current form of the quorum clause was the subject of       debate at the Constitutional Convention of 1787.        The Committee of Detail was a group of delegates entrusted       with devising a draft constitution that reflected the       delegates' agreements. On August 6, 1787, it reported a draft       that said ``a majority of members'' would ``constitute a       quorum to do business,'' though ``a smaller number may       adjourn from day to day.'' Unlike the Constitution that was       ratified, the Committee of Detail did not include a provision       allowing for the ``smaller Number'' to ``compel the       Attendance of absent Members'' or penalize those who were       missing.        On August 10, the delegates debated the Committee of       Detail's quorum requirement. Two important concerns emerged.       If the quorum were too high, it could prevent the majority       from being able to transact business. If it were too low--or       could be manipulated to be lowered--it would allow a small       group of people to impose their will upon others.        According to James Madison's Notes of Debates in the       Federal Convention of 1787, some delegates advocated granting       the Legislature complete or partial discretion in setting a       quorum:        John Francis Mercer of Maryland proposed following the       example of Great Britain, where Parliament could determine       its own quorum. There, he said, ``the requisite number is       small & no inconveniency has been experienced.''        Gouverneur Morris of New York proposed setting the quorum       at 33 Representatives and 14 Senators. This would initially       be a majority for each Chamber, though it would be less than       a majority as Members were added. Congress, he thought,       should have a relatively low quorum since it would prevent a       small group of people from withholding a quorum, which would       be a particular risk when ``a particular part of the       Continent may be in need of immediate aid.''        Rufus King of Massachusetts proposed initially setting the       quorum at 33 Representatives and 14 Senators, but allowing       Congress to increase the numbers as it saw fit. As the number       of Members increased, a majority quorum would be       ``cumbersome.''        Other delegates feared that a low quorum would allow small       groups to make laws for the rest of the country:        Elbridge Gerry, also of Massachusetts, proposed that for       the House the quorum should be no less than 33 and no more       than 50, with the Legislature free to select a number within       these bounds. A quorum of 33 in the House, Gerry said, would       allow as few as two states to make laws for the rest.        George Mason of Virginia said the majority quorum provision       was a ``valuable & necessary part of the plan.'' In fact, he       was concerned that a mere majority would allow people to       object to the plan as a whole. He reasoned that with a lower       quorum, states closer to the seat of government could make       laws favorable to themselves in the absence of more distant       states. ``If the Legislature should be able to reduce the       number at all, it might reduce it as low as it pleased & the       U. States might be governed by a Juncto,'' he said.        The delegates considered and overwhelmingly rejected King's       motion that the Constitution set a minimum of 33       Representatives and 14 Senators while the number to be       increased by law. Only the Massachusetts and Delaware       delegations favored King's plan.        James Madison and Edmund Randolph, both of Virginia, moved       to amend the draft by inserting a provision allowing for each       House to summon and penalize absent Members. All the state       delegations except for Pennsylvania supported this amendment.       In fact, the Pennsylvania delegation was divided on the       question. Then the delegations unanimously approved the       majority quorum provision, as amended, and it is this version       that made its way into the U.S. Constitution.    would proxy votes satisfy the constitutional requirement for a quorum?         It is clear that the delegates considered the possibility       of quorums of consisting of a minority of the Members and       rejected this option in favor of a majority quorum. That is       beyond dispute. What is disputed is whether proxy votes       counting towards a quorum would pass constitutional muster.       Even though the Constitution allows each House to determine       its rules of procedure (Article I, section 5), proxy votes       counting towards quorum seem to run contrary to the intent of       the delegates at the Constitutional Convention.        Proxy voting was certainly possible in the time of the       Constitutional Convention. For instance, absentee or proxy       voting was not unknown in the colonies. Yet, apparently, the       suggestion was not raised at the Convention. One should be       careful not to infer too much from silence, but one       possibility is that the delegates did not consider that the       Congress would ever ``meet'' by proxy. In fact, proxy voting       would have settled some of the problems delegates on both       sides of the issues raised. If proxy voting were permissible,       then the distant states could have more easily defended       themselves by stationing a member at the capital, armed with       proxies of their absent colleagues. By the same token, those       who feared that a small number could obstruct business by       collecting proxy votes from others who shared their concerns.       No one, apparently, raised proxy voting as a solution for       issues with the quorum; rather, both sides seemingly operated       under the assumption that a physical presence was necessary       for participation in Congress.        If proxy votes were to count towards a quorum, the       Randolph-Madison amendment would be a redundancy. Since the       amendment allows each House to ``compel the Attendance of       absent Members,'' it is predicated on the notion that a       physical presence is necessary for Congress to conduct its       business. If a physical presence were not necessary, it would       be unnecessary to ``compel the Attendance of absent       Members.'' Nor would there be any reason to penalize them for       failing to show. However, the states nearly unanimously voted       to include this provision in the Constitution, highlighting       the importance of a physical presence at the Constitutional       Convention.        The Framers' concern over the dangers of small numbers of       Members of Congress transacting business in the absence of       the majority of their colleagues is as valid today as it was       in 1787. It is true that the coronavirus pandemic presents       great difficulties to Congress, and both Chambers have shown       that they can still conduct business without violating       constitutional safeguards. As much as Congress needs to look       to  [[Page H2011]]       the here-and-now, it also must look to the future. In the       long-run, the inperson presence of Members of Congress is       absolutely vital to the strength of the Legislature, and no       amount of proxy votes may substitute for it.                                   ____           Voting Present by Proxy is an Unconstitutional Oxymoron         The Constitution leaves a great deal of leeway to the House       and Senate for establishing their own rules of procedure. But       one provision is absolutely clear: in both chambers, a quorum       is required to do business. And a quorum is defined as a       majoritiy of its members.        Article 1, section 5, of the U.S. Constitution states:         a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do       Business; but a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day,       and may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent       Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties as each       House may provide.         If a physical presence were not necessary, it would be       unnecessary to ``compel the Attendance of absent Members.''       Although proxy voting was possible at the time of the       Constitutional Convention, the participants spent long days       waiting for their colleagues to arrive to conduct business in       person. Being physically present does make for an inefficient       system, but that's what the Founders intended--they did not       intend to make it easy to reach consensus and govern. The       constitutional provision for the quorum was designed to       protect the public.        Quorums are not self-enforcing. So a quorum is assumed       unless it questioned by a Member. That is why the House       carries on non-controversial business even when it is evident       that only a few Members are on the Floor. To conduct business       such as voting, however, a quorum can be demanded by any       Member through a point of order. Once demanded, the House       cannot conduct any business--even a request to withdraw the       call to quorum--until a quorum is attained. This protects the       minority party. Once a party tries to take action beyond what       has been agreed to by consensus, the other side can quickly       shut that down by raising an objection to the lack of quorum.       If a quorum cannot be achieved, under the Constitution, the       only business allowed is a motion to adjourn.        This raises a question of whether the House can change its       rules of procedures to allow proxy votes to count towards a       quorum. Besides the oxymoronic notion that a member could       vote ``present by proxy,'' the House's precedents argue       against it.        Proxy voting has never been allowed or even considered on       the House Floor. But proxy voting has, from time to time,       been allowed in Committees. Even though it has been banned       since 1995, the House has established precedents for how       proxy voting was treated in prior Congresses.        While Members who were absent could give their proxy to       another Member on the Committee, allowing their votes to be       counted, Deschler's Precedents shows that the ``no measure is       to be reported from any committee unless a majority of the       committee was actually present when the measure was ordered       reported.'' This echoes Cannon's Precedents, a previous       compilation of the precedents, which states:         Recognition of voting proxies by standing committees is a       matter to be respectively determined by each committee for       itself, but proxies may not be counted to make a quorum.         In other words, when allowed, Committees could count proxy       votes, but they first had to have a majority of actual people       attending or none of the votes would count.        It might be possible for the House to change the rules to       allow proxy voting, but only after attaining a physical       quorum. The one thing it cannot do under the Constitution and       under the House's own precedents is to allow those proxies to       count toward a physical quorum. So it might be possible that,       consistent with the Constitution, some proxy voting might be       allowed if there is a physical majority present for a vote.        House Rules Committee Chairman McGovern has stated his view       that Members who vote by proxy must give specific       instructions on how their votes would be recorded, and those       instructions should be printed in the Congressional Record.       If done this way, where most Members were present, and only a       few were unable to make it to Washington, it would be similar       to a traditional courtesy of ``pairing votes.'' In the not-      so-distant past, ``vote pairing'' would occur when a Member       who was voting opposite of the absent Member withheld their       vote and announced a pair with the absent member, thus       offsetting each other's vote. In today's highly polarized       Congress, such courtesies are rare, which might indicate the       need for an updated system.        The one thing that Congress cannot allow is the idea of       conducting controversial business with only a small number of       Members present. It is understandable why the House       Democratic leadership wants to put this rule in place since       we are in the midst of a pandemic. At the same time,       political leaders cannot simply ignore constitutional       requirements or proper parliamentary forms to resolve the       issues. Congress is, by definition, the gathering of people       together to solve issues. This cannot--and should not--be       done remotely.        Observers of Congress agree that one of the primary causes       of divisive partisan polarization is that Members no longer       form relationships and friendships. Back when Members met       five days a week instead of three, they moved their families       to Washington DC. Their kids went to school together, and       their spouses formed friendships with other spouses. It's       human nature to be much more civil to someone whose spouse is       friends with yours or whose kid is on your kid's soccer team.        Most importantly, legislators need to legislate. There is a       give and take created by amendments and debates that require       direct human interaction. Too little of that goes on now--how       much worse will it be if members are just ``emailing it in?''       Today, leaders from the House and Senate negotiate with the       President, and the other 533 legislators vote on their       agreement. That's not legislating.        Proxy voting might be more efficient than waiting for       everyone to physically get to Washington DC. But efficiency       was not a goal of the founding fathers. They wanted the       people's representatives to get together and work out       compromise and consensus. Isolated Members voting from remote       locations will further harm civility and undermine Congress'       already weakening place in the Constitution's balance of       power.     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), my good friend, a member of both  the Rules Committee and the Committee on Energy and Commerce.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), my good friend and member of both the Rules  Committee and the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), my good friend and the distinguished  ranking member of the House Administration Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Jordan), my good friend and ranking member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to change to two-thirds the threshold required to  pass H. Res. 965, the resolution changing the rules of the House to  adopt a proxy voting procedure on the floor and to allow remote  proceedings.   Madam Speaker, changing the rule does require a two-thirds vote, and  that is what we are doing in this rule.   Madam Speaker, the rules change that H. Res. 965 contemplates has  simply never been utilized in the House of Representatives. We are  quite literally setting a new precedent that will guide us into the  future. Any change of this magnitude should only pass the House with  bipartisan consensus, and a two-thirds threshold is appropriate to  demonstrate whether or not such a drastic change and new precedent  actually meets this test.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with the extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous  question, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Just briefly, I want to thank my good friend, the distinguished  gentleman from Florida, for being here. We all know he is fighting  bravely a very deadly disease, and it says a lot about his personal  courage and his commitment to service that he is here today. Madam  Speaker, it is good to have him on the floor of the House.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the ranking member of the  Education and Labor Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall), a member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1  minute.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.  [[Page H2017]]     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank my good friend from Massachusetts for a spirited debate. We  certainly had one yesterday, and we had one again today, and I know we  will have one in a few minutes.   In closing, Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule. I oppose  both the change in House rules that is being proposed today, and I  oppose the massive and unwarranted 1,800-page, $3 trillion Democratic  wish list that the majority is proposing as well.   The rules changes that this resolution proposes will fundamentally  change the nature of the institution. I know that is not the intent of  my friends, but I think that is the impact of the rule.   I am deeply concerned with how these changes will actually work in  place, and I am concerned that we are doing so without regard to the  fact that a change like this is likely to lead to litigation and may  place in jeopardy legislation that we pass in a bipartisan manner.   After reaching a bipartisan agreement on $2.5 trillion in spending  over the last 6 weeks, the majority is now seeking to spend $3 trillion  more, regardless of the actual needs of the Nation and, frankly,  without any input from the Republican side of the aisle.   My friends talk about the urgency of the moment. I agree. This is an  urgent moment. But I also agree that we are going to have to work in a  bipartisan fashion to actually pass something. So if this makes my  friends feel better, that is fine; and if the intent is to set out a  negotiating position, I guess that is legitimate; but if you think this  is going to end up as law, you are sadly mistaken. The Senate has  already said it will not take up the bill. The President has already  said that, if it reaches his desk, he would veto it.   So let's do what we have done four times in a row: Sit down; work  together; craft a bipartisan bill. We have proven we can do it, and we  can do it again.   I am just mystified why my friends have felt the need to inject a  clearly partisan bill and think this is going to move us down the road  in the right direction. It is not. They are going to cement a lot of  Members in on both sides of the aisle to positions that will make it  more difficult to reach a common agreement when that is the appropriate  thing to do.   This really is an exercise in legislative futility. H.R. 6800 will  never become law. Democrats know that, and they are not going to be  able to jam it through.   So they can come down here and talk about it as much as they want,  and there are certainly some parts of it I could support, but as a  package, it is going nowhere, and it is not moving us toward a  solution.   I implore my colleagues to return to what they have done in the  previous four bills where we worked together, brought a product that  was bipartisan to the floor, and passed it overwhelmingly with almost  no dissent. That was the formula for success. The formula they are  pursuing now will not succeed. They know it will not succeed.   I have never been convinced as to why deliberately launching out  something you know won't pass is useful.  [[Page H2018]]  Both sides do it, by the way, from time to time. We have certainly done  it, so I don't want to suggest this is strictly a partisan exercise.   This bill will not succeed. I urge rejection of the rule.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 219,  nays 182, not voting 29, as follows:                               [Roll No. 105]                                 YEAS--219       Adams      Aguilar      Allred      Axne      Barragan      Bass      Beatty      Bera      Beyer      Bishop (GA)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Boyle, Brendan F.

Mses. BASS, PORTER, and OCASIO-CORTEZ changed their vote from ``nay''  to ``yea.''   So the previous question was ordered.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   Stated for:    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have worked long and hard together and tried to do so  cooperatively. As my friend said, there are a number of things in here  we have worked on together but, in the end, we were unable to reach an  agreement.   Mr. Speaker, we are back here to consider the resolution representing  the most consequential change to the rules of the House of  Representatives in my time in Congress, and possibly the most  consequential rules change since the establishment of the modern  committee system in the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946.   Today, Mr. Speaker, the majority is proposing, for the first time in  our history, a system of proxy voting on the floor of the House of  Representatives. That change also allows for the adoption of a totally  remote voting procedure upon the certification of a single Member of  Congress. Second, it would allow for committees to perform remote  proceedings, including markups.   Above all else, Mr. Speaker, Republicans believe that any change to  centuries-old rules of the House should only be done in a bipartisan  way that achieves consensus. Unfortunately, these proposed rules  changes do not meet that goal.   While I have no doubt of the chairman's good intentions, I believe  these changes will fundamentally alter the nature of the institution,  and not for the better. As such, I simply cannot support them.   Mr. Speaker, though this resolution is intended only to deal with the  present public health emergency, we must never forget that the  temporary changes that we make today become the precedent that we  follow tomorrow. I am deeply concerned that shifting to remote  activity, both in the form of proxy voting and the form of remote  committee work, will fundamentally change the way the House operates  and will remove the collegial environment we enjoy when we meet in  person, get  [[Page H2022]]  to know one another, and use our knowledge of each legislator as a  person to move toward bipartisan consensus. I fear that that would be  lost in remote activity.   I am also deeply concerned that these changes will not pass  constitutional muster. Why we would risk exposing important legislation  to obvious constitutional flaws does not make sense to me.   Most of all, I am concerned that we are moving forward with these  changes on a partisan basis. Any change that is this consequential  should only be done after we reach bipartisan agreement--no matter how  difficult it may be to achieve.   Mr. Speaker, I think a bipartisan agreement was possible on much of  what my friends are trying to accomplish, but today's resolution is  simply not it.   I have a modest suggestion to my friends: Let's take appropriate  cautions and go back to work. That is what the executive branch is  doing. That is what the United States Senate is doing. That is what  millions of Americans do each and every day. We should be no different.  The House should do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject these rules changes today  and return to the drawing board so that we can act together in a  bipartisan manner to ensure that Congress can continue to operate  during this crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the resolution, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Thornberry), my good friend and the distinguished ranking member  of the House Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Hagedorn), my good friend and a distinguished Member of  this body.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Womack), my very good friend, and the distinguished  Republican ranking member of the Budget Committee, and a fellow member  of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock), my very good friend.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Gohmert), my great friend and distinguished Member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. John W. Rose).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Roy), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Newhouse), my good friend and former Rules Committee  member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. Walden), my good friend and the distinguished ranking member and  former chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have been extraordinarily restrained in this debate  because I have a lot of speakers that need to have time on the floor to  express their feelings. Sometimes when the other side repeatedly says  things that are either out of context or deserve a rebuttal, you have  got to respond. To my good friends on the other side who have cited the  Senate committee, they know in negotiations we said we would be happy  to do exactly that. We just want markups to be in person. So please  don't use the Senate committee as if we somehow were opposed to that.   Second, my friend said we are intimidated by technology. We are not  intimidated by technology. Heavens.   We respect tradition and we think there is a better way to do this.  As my friends know, we moved toward them in the course of that  discussion.   Finally, my very good friend, the chairman, said this was a plot  maybe to do nothing. We have passed four bipartisan pieces of  legislation working together. We have done a lot in the last few weeks,  and to suggest that we would deliberately sabotage the operation of the  House simply because we disagree with you is wrong.   Quite frankly, doing nothing is bringing a bill to this floor--which  you are getting ready to do in H.R. 6800--that you know the Senate  won't pick up and you know the President won't sign. That is doing  nothing.   We have proven that working together we can do a lot. All we ask is,  let's return to that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Rogers), the distinguished ranking Republican Member on the Homeland  Security Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Member  from California (Mr. LaMalfa), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the  great State of Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the  great State of Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot today that the Republican  plan was simply to prioritize testing for Members of Congress.  Actually, it is a great deal more than that, as my friends know. It is  much more expansive and much more complete.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Republican plan authored by  the distinguished Republican leader, Mr. Davis of Illinois, and myself.                       A Plan for the People's House        Four Strategies to Reopen Congress and Restore America's Voice                            (By Kevin McCarthy)         Benjamin Franklin once said, ``If you fail to plan, you are       planning to fail.''        Recently, we called on Speaker Pelosi to establish a clear,       safe, and effective plan for reopening the House of       Representatives. This follows the White House and America's       governors releasing their own detailed plans for a phased       reopening of society, and now, both the United States Senate       and Democratic Speaker of the California State Assembly       calling their members back into session.        In the interim, a bipartisan taskforce has been convened--      on which we are all serving--to further explore ways in which       Congress can operate during this challenging time. While       differences remain, it has become clear through our initial       meetings that all members of our taskforce share several       fundamental beliefs.        First, the business of the People's House is ``essential       work'' that must not be sidelined or ground to a halt.        Second, there is intrinsic value in a Congress--a physical       meeting of people and ideas--that should be dutifully       guarded.        And third, any changes to centuries-old rules and       precedents of the House should be done in a deliberate and       bipartisan way.        As we enter this indeterminate period between outright       mitigation and a return to normalcy, everyone recognizes that       our typical ways of doing business will need to adjust.       Simply put, Congress will look and feel different.        However, we believe there is a pathway forward that enables       the House to fully perform its key functions without       compromising our shared values or sacrificing bedrock norms.        To that end, we offer four strategies that should form the       basis of any plan to reopen Congress and restore America's       voice. These strategies are based on the advice of public       health professionals, as well as guidance from parliamentary       experts with decades of combined House experience.        We believe embracing this approach would achieve the       necessary balance between health and institutional concerns--      and hopefully build a more resilient and productive       legislative branch in the process.             Strategy 1: Modify Existing Practices and Structures         The Rules Committee majority staff report on voting options       during the pandemic states: ``By far the best option is to       use the existing House rules and current practices'' (       emphasis original).        Already, Congress has demonstrated its ability to adapt and       to do so responsibly.        Earlier this month, the Rules Committee successfully       convened an in-person business meeting in accordance with       health guidelines developed by the Attending Physician and       Sergeant at Arms. Likewise, over 50 members participated in a       hearing on COVID-19 response efforts hosted by the Committee       on Small Business. And this week, the Labor-HHS       Appropriations Subcommittee will hold an in-person hearing on       the coronavirus pandemic.        Beyond committee business, nearly 400 members came to the       House Floor on April 23 in an orderly and physically distant       fashion to record their votes on two consecutive measures, a       process that Speaker Pelosi characterized as having been       executed ``fabulously.''        Moving forward, we should expand these protocols to reduce       density and congestion in every facet of our work.        House office buildings and individual office floor plans       should be assessed to provide new provisional occupancy       levels--with an eye towards possible reconfigurations to       accommodate physical distance.        Additionally, measures should be explored to engineer       temporary controls or barriers in locations where physical       distance is difficult to achieve, as is currently happening       in grocery stores and other places of public accommodation       across America. For example, plexiglass dividers could be       installed in high trafficked areas, like security       checkpoints, or possibly in committee hearing rooms along the       dais to provide further separation between members.              Strategy 2: Employ a Phased Return with Committees         Just as our states are employing a phased reopening       approach, Congress should do so as well--beginning with       committees and subcommittees as the engines of regular order.        Currently, the average total membership of a standing House       Committee is approximately 40 members, with average       subcommittee membership in the teens.        Each committee should present an outline to the Majority       Leader detailing their projected business meetings for the       month ahead, along with estimated attendance levels.        Working backwards, this information could be used to       generate a staggered business calendar, with rotating use of       larger committee hearing rooms where necessary. Precedence       should be given to bipartisan COVID-19 response measures and       other high-priority legislative items, such as the National       Defense Authorization Act, Water Resources Development Act,       and FY21 appropriations measures.        By directing committees to focus on legislation that has       bipartisan and bicameral appeal, we can make the most of each       member's time and effort, thereby making the House more       productive.        This system would also ensure greater transparency and       regular order for all members--as opposed to centralized       decision-making by a select group of leadership and staff       that reduces the role of representative to merely voting       ``yea'' or ``nay'' on pre-drafted proposals.        At the start, we do not envision routine recorded votes       occurring in the House every day or perhaps even every       session week. Instead, our voting schedule should be       reimagined in the near-term, with postponement authority       providing a structure to queue up bills at the end of a week       or work period.        Lastly, regular morning hour time should be restored so all       members have the opportunity give one- and five-minute       speeches from the House Floor, an essential forum that has       not been available now for over a month.     Strategy 3: Deploy Technology in a ``Crawl, Walk, Run'' Progression         The rules change proposal introduced by Chairman McGovern       would enable sweeping use of technology for every element of       committee business.        This is concerning for a variety of reasons--many of which       are catalogued in the Rules Committee majority staff report--      including untested assumptions that members have ``reliable,       connected technology, knowledge of how to use that       technology, access to round-the-clock technical support, . .       . [and] secure connectivity with the capacity to transmit       potentially large amounts of data,'' just to name a few.        From a security standpoint, the House averages 1.6 billion       unauthorized scans, probes, and malicious attempted network       cyber-connections per month. Earlier this month, our       colleagues experienced this kind of incident firsthand with       hackers interrupting a House Oversight Committee video event       multiple times.  [[Page H2040]]         In our view, technology should only be deployed in a       ``crawl, walk, run'' progression. Before we rush to discard       over 200 years of precedent, we should require that rigorous       testing standards be met, ample feedback be provided, and       bipartisan rules of the road be agreed upon and made public       to truly safeguard minority rights.        We believe ``hybrid'' hearings--an idea initially proposed       by Democrats on the taskforce--could serve as a useful proof-      of-concept to consider, similar to the model currently being       used in the United Kingdom to facilitate virtual question       time in the House of Commons.        For the purposes of these hybrid hearings, in-person quorum       requirements should remain in place (most committee rules       require only two members be present to hear testimony), with       allowances for committee and non-partisan support staff to       guide the proceedings and troubleshoot any technical       problems. For the reasons outlined above, virtual       participation should not become the default--but should       instead be reserved for members in at-risk categories or who       are otherwise unable to travel to D.C.        Under this proposal, committees that regularly handle       sensitive and classified materials, including Intelligence       and Ethics, would still be required to meet in-person.        We cannot recommend using virtual platforms for committee       markups, given the mountain of unanswered questions regarding       how more complex and involved procedural maneuvers would work       in a remote setting.           Strategy 4: Accelerate Active Risk Mitigation Practices         Thanks to the efforts of the Attending Physician, in       coordination with the House Administration Committee, the       fourth strategy has already been set in motion.        Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits--including gloves,       facemasks, and alcohol-based hand sanitizers--have been       provided to each member office and committee, with additional       supplies available on-demand.        Hand sanitizing stations are now ubiquitous around the       Capitol campus--including on the House Floor--while enhanced       cleaning procedures have become the new standard, with areas       ripe for surface contamination having been limited or       removed.        Staffing has been kept to a minimum through continued use       of teleworking procedures, while the Capitol remains open to       only members, required staff, and credentialed press.        Even so, these mitigation practices can be accelerated in       several key ways.        Measured screening procedures should be considered,       consisting of either selfreported medical diagnostic       assessments, at-home temperature monitoring, touchless       thermal temperature checks at office entry points, or any       combination thereof.        A uniform ``return-to-work'' policy--in accordance with       existing CDC guidelines--should be adopted for any staffer       experiencing signs of illness.        Finally, our ongoing and iterative testing regime should be       scaled as test availability increases nationwide. This plan       should progress to incorporate asymptomatic randomized       testing, and eventually, FDA authorized rapid antigen tests.                                  Conclusion         We fully appreciate the extraordinary nature of the       challenge before us. However, when it comes to fundamentally       altering how the House operates--in this case, potentially       abandoning the Capitol for the remainder of the 116th       Congress under the introduced Democratic proposal--every       avenue should first be explored that preserves enduring       institutional rules while prioritizing member health.        As Chairman McGovern recently wrote, ``decisions we make       today will influence the choices made in this chamber 100       years from now.''        We agree--and firmly believe it is our job as leaders of       our respective parties to ensure the most reasoned voices       prevail on this critical matter, not simply the loudest ones.        This pandemic has claimed too many lives and livelihoods       already. We must not allow the institution we are tasked with       safeguarding to be the next.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), who is the Republican leader  of the House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 6800. Not only is the  bill premature; it was crafted behind closed doors and without any  Republican input at all.   The pandemic we currently face is unlike anything we have experienced  in modern history, and so, too, has been our response. I am pleased  with how the Congress has worked together and quickly to provide urgent  aid to those on the front lines and those struggling with the economic  impacts of this disastrous scourge.   Every bill that has been enacted up to this point was ultimately the  product of cooperation and bipartisan support. Each of those bills  passed this floor with essentially no partisan division at all.   So it is very disappointing to come before you today, Mr. Speaker, on  this one-sided bill that is loaded with provisions unrelated to the  crisis that we face. This is not in the spirit of cooperation that the  American people expect from their leaders during difficult times.   Indeed, the bill before us today has $3 trillion in spending, we  think. We don't know. We don't have a CBO score yet. It provides nearly  $10,000 for every person in the United States. And the $1.5 trillion of  discretionary funding provided in this bill is more than typically  appropriated in an entire fiscal year.   This includes almost a trillion dollars in new funding for States,  cities, and counties, on top of roughly a trillion dollars we have  already provided over the last two months. These new dollars are made  available without any safeguards against funds going to jurisdictions  that had financial problems long before the crisis and are unrelated to  the crisis.   The bill gives the U.S. Postal Service a $25 billion windfall without  requiring any reforms to their operations, and it bails out  multiemployer pension plans.   There are also sweeping changes to our election system, requiring  same-day voter registration and nationwide vote by mail. This is an  incredible Federal intrusion into the election system that is operated  not by the Federal Government, but by the States.   I am concerned with this path, Mr. Speaker. It leads us in the wrong  direction. There is no reason for us to be here on the floor in this  House debating this partisan wish list.   I know what can come from Members working across the aisle together.  I have done it on many occasions with my good friend, the distinguished  chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee. It is what led to the  creation of the Infectious Disease Rapid Response Reserve Fund that  allowed the administration to respond immediately to the emerging  threat from the new coronavirus as we worked to understand where  resources were needed.   I was proud to work with my counterpart in the Labor, Health, and  Human Services Committee, Chairwoman DeLauro, on that fund, and even  more proud to see it used effectively. That is an example of the two  parties coming together, working together to pass a really good idea  that benefitted this country at a critical time.   That is the cooperative nature that has been the hallmark of our  government's response to the pandemic up till now. The American people  expect and deserve nothing less. For that reason, I urge my colleagues  to vote ``no'' on this bill, so that we can work together and on a  better product that will be a responsible use of taxpayer dollars and  truly help those in need.   Mr. Speaker, I have full faith that the leaders of the Appropriations  Committee, Chairwoman Lowey and Republican Ranking Member Granger, will  work together to come up with a bill that we all support. That  confidence is based on experience. I have seen them do it over and over  again during my time in Congress, and particularly in dealing with the  last four bills where we did work together and manage to craft a bill  that not only passed here, but passed the United States Senate as well,  essentially without dissent.   Mr. Speaker, if we continue down the path with this bill, we know  that the Senate will not pick it up, and we know the President will not  sign it. It is much more about political messaging than effective  legislating.   I would just urge my colleagues, let's return to the path that we  walked down together in these recent weeks. We bargained, we debated,  but we brought products to the floor that we knew could pass the other  chamber and that we knew the President would sign, and that we knew  would immediately go forward to help the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, while our distinguished Speaker and I may  disagree on this particular bill, we certainly agree on our opinion of  the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee and her ability to bring  us together.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Aderholt), my good friend and distinguished ranking member of the  Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee of the  Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert), my very good friend and the distinguished  ranking member of the Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Womack), my good friend, and the distinguished Republican  ranking member on the Budget Committee, as well as a valued member of  the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Arkansas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann), my very good friend and the ranking member  on the Homeland Security Committee of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rutherford), my very good friend, an esteemed member of  the Appropriations Committee, and today of all days, a career law  enforcement officer as well. Mr. Speaker, we honor him for his service  and his colleagues for their service to all of us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Brady), my very good friend, the distinguished past chairman of  the Ways and Means Committee and current ranking member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. Walden), my very good friend, and the past chairman and current  ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), my very good friend, and  the Republican ranking member on the House Administration Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Illinois an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), my friend, the past chair  and current ranking member of the Education and Labor Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan), my good friend and the Republican  ranking member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman), my good friend, a distinguished member of  both the Oversight and Reform Committee and the Education and Labor  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from the great State of Texas (Mr. Crenshaw), who is a former  Navy SEAL.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), who is a member of the  Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Comer), who is a member of the  Agriculture, Education and Labor, and Oversight and Reform Committees.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce), who is a member of the  Homeland Security and Small Business Committees.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my friend that we worked with our  friends to pass four bills, $3 trillion in the last 10 weeks. We would  work with the majority again if they would sit down and bargain with  us. Sadly, they decided not to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Arrington), who is a member of the Ways and Means Committee. My very  good friend is a great neighbor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the  great State of Mississippi (Mr. Guest), my good friend, a member of the  Committee on Ethics, Committee on Foreign Affairs, and Committee on  Homeland Security.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the  great State of Arkansas (Mr. Hill), my very good friend and a  distinguished member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser), my good friend, a member of the Committees  on Budget, Education and Labor, and Veterans' Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), my very good friend and a  member of the Committee on Financial Services.    Mr. Speaker, I just remind my friend we did join them in  four bills. It might have been nice to be asked to join in a fifth.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff), my good friend and a member of the Committee  on Financial Services.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Wenstrup), my very good friend who is a Member of the Ways and  Means Committee and who has rendered distinguished service to our  country and to our institution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. John W. Rose), my very good friend and member of the  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock), my very good friend and member of the  Judiciary Committee and Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa), my very good friend, a member of the  Agriculture Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee.  [[Page H2233]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Spano), my very good friend and member of the Small Business  Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Kevin Hern), my very good friend and colleague from my  State and member of the Budget Committee, Natural Resources Committee,  and Small Business Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have additional speakers on the way, but  they are not here. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just advise my friend, if he is worried  about tax breaks for billionaires and millionaires, he might want to  get rid of SALT deductions in this current bill.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), my very good friend and member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee and the only pharmacist in Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would advise my very good friend from the great State of Virginia  that we didn't wait. We worked with you and passed four bills. You are  wasting time. You are wasting time. You have brought a bill here you  know will not pass the Senate, that the President will not sign. You  decided not to work with us. So please don't accuse us of delay.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr.  Fulcher), a member of the Education and Labor and Natural Resources  Committees.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Alabama  (Mr. Palmer), chairman of the Republican Policy Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), my very good friend, a member of the  Agriculture and Education and Labor Committees.     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I have additional speakers on the way. They  have not yet arrived, so I am going to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Hice), a member of the Natural Resources and Oversight and Reform  Committees.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I just remind my friends we actually do hear. That is why we worked  with you to pass four straight bills. I would be willing to work with  you again. You chose not to do that. You chose to bring to the floor a  bill you know will not be taken up by the Senate, will not be signed by  the President. So let's abandon that course and go back to where we  were at. We worked together. We got a lot done in a short period of  time. I think that is what the American people want us to do.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have a great deal of respect for my very good friend  from California, but we live in a system right now of divided  government. We have a Democratic House that certainly has a voice in  anything that is done. We have a Republican Senate, and we have a  Republican President.   We have proven that we can work together. We did for four straight  bills, extraordinary amount of time, largest  [[Page H2236]]  single bill in American history. So it is not as if the two sides don't  know how to do this.   For whatever reasons, my friends chose to decide to move alone. Well,  they can certainly do that through this Chamber, and that is their  right to do. I respect that if that is what they want to do. But if  they think moving alone without Republicans will get them anywhere in  the United States Senate or at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, I  would just suggest that is probably not the case.   So again, we know how to do this. We have proven we can do it; an  extraordinary job by all concerned on both sides of the House to get  those four bills done.   Nobody works better, by the way, in a bipartisan sense than my good  friend, the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, and nobody  works with her better than my good friend, the ranking member of the  Appropriations Committee. I would suggest the rest of us probably  should clear out for a while and let those two work together. I bet you  we could actually get a bill to pass.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry), a distinguished veteran in service to this  country.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), my great friend and distinguished member of the  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   There is nobody I respect more than my good friend from California.  He is a bipartisan person by nature and instinct. All I would advise  him is to resume what they did that worked before: Go back to operating  in a bipartisan manner, sit down and negotiate, and we will actually  get something done for the American people.   What they are doing now is partisan, one-sided, no Republican input,  dead on arrival in the Senate, not going to be signed by the President.  That is not a productive use of time. It may be a political choice; it  may be smart politics--I don't know, I don't think so, but maybe--but  it certainly is not going to result in legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished Republican leader of the  House and my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), my very good friend, the Republican whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Louisiana an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I begin by thanking my good friend, the distinguished  chairwoman of the Committee on Appropriations, for the debate, and I  thank her for her very good work.   We have in front of us a product that, obviously, on this side of the  aisle, we don't agree with. We do not believe we were included in the  process. Frankly, this was unveiled without any bipartisan discussions.  The Senate has already indicated it is not going to be taken up over  there. The President has already indicated that he has a veto threat.   There are certainly elements in this bill that I can support. I want  to commend my friend. Some of their work on Tribal issues was very,  very impressive. There are other elements there; there are things we  can work on together in this bill.   But my friends understand, as I think the fundamental reality, the  Democratic House, they have every right to pass anything they want to  pass. And there is a lot in this bill I disagree with, but I respect  their right to move it across the floor.   But you have to recognize the political reality as well, Mr. Speaker.  This bill is not going to be accepted in the United States Senate. This  bill is not going to be signed by the President of the United States.   I would suggest, rather than pointing fingers at one another and  disagreeing--and we do that on both sides of the aisle on occasion-- that we do what we did recently. We worked together extremely well. My  friend, the chairwoman, had a lot to do with that. We provided  unprecedented relief to the American people in an extraordinarily short  period of time and did it with almost no partisan dissent on this  floor.   Sadly, that will not be what we see today. But because we don't do it  today doesn't mean we can't do it or begin to do it tomorrow or later.  But it will not succeed this way at the end of the day.   I have been exactly where my friends are sitting right now. I have  been in this House when we had a Republican majority in the House and a  Democratic Senate and a Democratic President, and we passed a lot of  things that weren't acceptable to that Democratic Senate and would  never have been signed by that Democratic President. Sometimes you want  to do that to make a point.   This is not the time to make a point, Mr. Speaker. We are in the  middle of a crisis. We need to work together. We have shown we can work  together. We should actually take a great deal of pride in that, and we  should go back and cooperate and move forward that way.   This vehicle will not pass. There are elements in it, working with  Republicans, that could pass. There are lots of other things in here  that aren't going to. And the reality is we don't have a lot of time.   I actually agree with my friends in the sense that we are in a crisis  situation. It is important that the country see us act, but it is  important that we act together. We have done it in a matter of weeks.  We can do it again.   Mr. Speaker, I will just end on a hopeful note.   We can have this exercise today. I do look on it as a partisan  exercise. I do look on it as a messaging exercise. I don't look on it  as a serious effort to legislate. Serious efforts to legislate in  divided government require consultation and inclusion with the other  party.   In this Chamber, that means--sadly for my friends in the majority-- you have to deal with the minority, because your ability to pass here,  if anything rolls out of this Chamber with Democrat-only votes,  essentially, is just simply not going to have any prospects in the  United States Senate. It is never going to be signed by a Republican  President.   Mr. Speaker, I commend my friend for all her hard work. I look  forward to working with her--as we have so often done in the past--in  the weeks ahead, and I hope we can come together, pass additional  relief and additional policy changes that help us through this time  that has come upon us through no one's fault in this Chamber.    Neither party wished for this to happen. Neither party had anything  to do with it happening. And, frankly, when they are at their best,  both parties work together to try and confront this crisis.   Mr. Speaker, again, we have done that in recent weeks. I don't think  we have forgotten how to do it. So I hope we put this chapter behind  us.   I urge rejection of this bill, but I also welcome my friends to the  bargaining table and look forward to working with them so that we can  come up with a product that not only meets the needs of the American  people, but a product that also shows the American people that we can  work together and put their good above all else.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
