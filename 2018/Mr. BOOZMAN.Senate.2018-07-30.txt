 Mr. President, today I wish to honor Walter  ``Boots'' Mayberry, a World War II airman from Harrison, AR, whose  military service, life, and career exemplify what it means to be a true  patriot.   Walter ``Boots'' Mayberry was born in Pine Bluff, AR, on August 11,  1923, to a large family. Mayberry's nickname, ``Boots,'' came about  during the Great Flood of 1927. His older sister, Dell, took the 4- year-old Mayberry into town and bought him a pair of rubber boots with  rubber red tops. From then on, Mayberry could always be found with his  boots on, regardless of if he was bathing, in church, or in bed. The  nickname became official when he began first grade and told the teacher  that his name was ``Boots Mayberry.''   Mayberry graduated high school in 1943 and was drafted shortly  thereafter. He reported for duty at Camp Robinson and volunteered to  join the Army Air Corps. After extensive training in several Stateside  locations, he was attached to the 560th Bomb Squadron of the 388th Bomb  Group in the 8th Air Corps. He was based at Knettishall, England, with  the mission to bomb Germany and German-held territories, something he  and the rest of the ``Mighty 8th'' did with honor.   Mayberry served as a waist gunner, defending his B-17 from enemy  fighter planes. He and his aircrew successfully completed nine missions  before being hit by enemy fire on their 10th mission. Despite the  severe damage to the plane, the pilot kept on course and dropped the  bombs on their target. Mayberry and the crew were forced to bail out of  the plane, which was a problem for Mayberry who never learned how to  use a parachute because he never thought he would have to use one.  Falling head first, he pulled the ripcord and the force broke his neck.  As he drifted to the ground, he was in the crosshairs of German ground  fire.   Paralyzed and lying in a field, German civilians brutally checked  Mayberry over before soldiers locked him up in a local jail. He was  detained with another airman from his crew in a different secure  facility for 10 days of solitary confinement. From there, he was taken  to Frankfurt for interrogation and moved to several locations before  ending up in a German POW camp,  [[Page S5451]]  Stalag 7A in Moosburg, Germany. He suffered inhumane conditions that  tested his will to survive.   Mayberry fondly remembered the American tank of the 14th Armored  Division that smashed through the gate, liberating the camp on April  29, 1945. Nearly 70 years after liberation, it was still emotional for  Mayberry to talk about the experience of seeing the Stars and Stripes  replace the Nazi flag at the camp. Two days later, Mayberry saw General  George Patton who had come to survey the conditions of the camp.   Mayberry didn't receive any treatment for his injuries until he was  examined by a flight surgeon on his way to France, a staging area for  soldiers heading home.   After the war, Staff Sergeant Walter Mayberry lived a long,  fulfilling life speaking about and writing a book on his experiences,  his faith, and his love of country. He regularly participated at  Veterans Day parades, Memorial Day programs, and many other civic  events in and around Harrison. Sadly, Boots passed away on July 25,  2018 at the age of 94.   Mayberry was a member of the Greatest Generation and a patriot  dedicated to serving his country. He was an American hero who will be  missed. I extend my sincere condolences to his family and friends, and  I hope that they find comfort in the incredible legacy of service and  patriotism that Boots leaves behind.                            ____________________
