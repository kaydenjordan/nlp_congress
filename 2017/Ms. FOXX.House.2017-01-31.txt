 Madam Speaker, every campaign season, like clockwork,  families are bombarded by an endless stream of political robocalls.  There is little voters can do to stop the annoyance, which all too  often comes right in the middle of family dinners and bedtimes, because  politicians made sure to exempt themselves from the power of the Do Not  Call Registry.   That is why I have introduced legislation, H.R. 740, to stop the  intrusion of political robocalls in homes across America.   The Robo Calls Off Phones Act, or Robo COP Act, directs the Federal  Trade Commission to revise its regulations regarding the National Do  Not Call Registry and prohibit prerecorded campaign messages from being  sent to telephone numbers on the national registry. It gives the  American people the opportunity to opt out of these bothersome  interruptions.   Removing the exemption for political robocalls is a matter of  fairness that will help bring some peace and quiet to homes throughout  the campaign season.                            ____________________
