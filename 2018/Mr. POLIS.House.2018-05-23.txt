 Mr. Speaker, last year, the Republicans passed a corporate  tax giveaway that adds $1.9 trillion to the deficit. I was proud to  join all of my fellow Democrats in voting against that.   Today I am here to talk about a new bill I introduced, the Students  Over Special Interests Act. It shows what we could have done with some  of that $1.9 trillion.   I hear from constituents every day overwhelmed by student debt. For  instance, Sam in Morrison, Colorado, a law enforcement officer, has  been making student loan payments for years. Even at the age of 51, he  has tens of thousands of dollars left.   What my Students Over Special Interests Act does is it forgives all  student debt. That costs less than the Republican tax giveaway. In  addition, it increases Pell funding and reduces the deficit.   Studies have shown that repealing student loan debt stimulates the  economy, supports job growth, and takes something that is weighing down  too many families.   After forgiving student debt and making college more affordable, my  bill still costs less than the Republican tax giveaway that they passed  into  [[Page H4593]]  law. I encourage the House to take up the Students Over Special  Interests bill.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment, which I am proud to sponsor with  Representative Blumenauer, makes a small, sensible reduction to  unnecessary nuclear weapons spending.   The National Defense Authorization that we have before us this week  authorizes hundreds of millions of dollars for our nuclear weapons  program, even $65 million to reduce an additional low-yield warhead.  While the threats that we face around the world are different than what  they were a few years ago, we cannot afford to sacrifice the fiscal  security of our Nation in the name of national security.   Spending more than we have and more than we need to on the military  makes us less secure, rather than more secure, by mortgaging our future  and that of future generations to those foreign nations which hold our  debt.   My amendment would simply make a small start by reducing the funding  for the National Security Administration's weapons account by $198  million, the exact amount that the agency itself says that it doesn't  need.   Let me be clear: This amendment will maintain all of our nuclear  capabilities and research; but for a body that should be making the  hard choices to get our budget under control, why should we be giving  the National Security Administration more money than they want, need,  or are asking for?   We need to start getting our budget under control. This is a small  step. I offered other amendments that were blocked. This one is  allowed. I hope that my Republican and Democratic colleagues can come  together to show that we are serious about cutting unnecessary spending  and reducing our deficit.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Our nuclear arsenal is capable of ending human life on the planet  five to seven times. I don't understand the need for redundancy when it  comes to the extinction of humanity. Once should be more than enough to  kill every man, woman, and child on the face of the planet. My  amendment doesn't address all of that, but it does make a cut of $198  million in unnecessary spending for nuclear weapons.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
