 Mr. President, Senate Republicans are about 24 hours away  from passing a bill that would make middle-class families in this  country pay more taxes so big corporations and millionaires can pay  less.   A bill like that would never really make sense, but it really, really  doesn't make sense right now. Since 1980, corporate profits have shot  through the roof, while wages for working people have remained pretty  much the same. With corporate profits up and family incomes flat, who  is paying the cost of running the government? Thanks to Congress, over  the past 50 years, corporations have gone from picking up about 25  percent of what it costs to run the government to picking up about 9  percent or, to say it another way, hard-working families now pick up a  much bigger share of the cost of running our government.   I don't care whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, this just  isn't fair. Corporations are wallowing in profits while hard-pressed  families are picking up the bill for our military, for our government  agencies, for homeland  [[Page S7502]]  security, for our infrastructure, and for everything else we have to  pitch in to pay for.   Here comes the Republican tax bill, which would make a bad situation  worse. The Republican tax bill would slash taxes on corporations even  further and raise taxes on millions of working families. It is hard to  comprehend how deeply unfair that is. A survey released last May by the  Federal Reserve found that 44 percent of American families--just a bit  under a half--don't have enough slack in their budget to cover a $400  emergency expense. If the transmission blows up or if a kid gets sick  or the fridge stops working, these families are just plain out of luck.  These are the same families whom the Republicans have targeted to pay  more in taxes under the Republican plan.   In trying to sell a bill that is deeply unfair, Republicans have  landed on a tried-and-true strategy--just lie about it.   The first big lie is that the plan will supercharge economic growth.  Spoiler alert: It will not. We have seen this movie before, and we know  how it ends. There is not one single credible projection that says this  plan will have any meaningful impact on the growth of the American  economy. One group of economists after another has looked at this bill  and said it will not do a darn thing to help the economy grow.   Even Wall Street banks--which stand to pocket billions of dollars in  tax giveaways from this bill--have grudgingly had to admit the bill  will not lead to any growth. Barclays Bank said: ``A permanent boost to  growth remains unlikely.'' Goldman Sachs said: ``We find a boost to GDP  growth of 0.1-0.2 [percentage points] in 2018-2019 and smaller amounts  in subsequent years.''   The second big lie is that if we just give corporations more money,  they will surely do us the favor of raising wages or creating more  jobs. We have seen that movie before too. Over the last 30 years,  corporate profits have exploded, and companies have not trickled down  those profits to workers. They didn't do it before, and they will not  do it after the Republicans give away even more money to these giant  corporations.   You don't have to take my word for it. The top executives at the  companies have already admitted as much. Bank of America and Merrill  Lynch surveyed 300 CEOs about what they would do with their tax  giveaways. What are they going to do with those tax giveaways? The top  three responses: pay down debt, buy back stock, and fund new mergers.  In other words, something for the banks, something for wealthy  investors, and nothing for workers.   The third big lie is that the plan will not increase the national  debt. That is just plain false. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget  Office says this bill will tack on $1.4 trillion to the debt in the  next 10 years, and we all know what comes next. The same Republican  Senators who will vote for this trillion-dollar budget buster tomorrow  will turn around next week and say our national debt is just too high,  and we need to cut Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, education  funding, affordable housing, and you name it. In fact, the Republican  budget they passed last month tees up more than $1 trillion in cuts to  those very programs.   This bill raises taxes on millions of middle-class families, and it  doesn't create any real economic growth. It doesn't create any real job  growth, and it explodes the national debt. So this bill clearly is not  about helping working families.   You really have to stop and ask the question, What is it about? The  answer is simple. This is about Republican Senators paying off the rich  corporate donors that helped get them elected. It is about the way that  money has corrupted Washington. It is about wealthy donors investing a  few million dollars in political contributions to secure billions of  dollars in tax giveaways.   Here is what one of my Republican colleagues said recently: If we  don't pass a tax bill, ``financial contributions will stop.'' A  Republican Member of the House was even more blunt. He said on the  record that his donors told him to pass this tax bill or ``don't ever  call them again.'' In other words, Republicans have said to each other  they need to pass a tax giveaway to give their donors money in order to  get reelected. This is a smash-and-grab job.   The Republicans are looting the U.S. Treasury so their donors will  keep funding their reelection campaigns. They don't even try to hide  the corruption, and they don't worry about how many middle-class  families get hurt in the caper. My take on this is pretty simple: I  don't think a single middle-class family in this country should pay  more in taxes so big corporations and millionaires can pay less. I  think big corporations should pay more--not less--so we can cut taxes  on working families and small businesses, so we can make investments in  fixing our roads and our bridges and our power grid, so we can help  young people reduce their student loan debt.   This is about basic fairness. We can build an America where every kid  has a shot at success, where every family has some measure of economic  security, where every senior has enough savings to retire with dignity.  We can do that, and we can start by defeating this Republican tax  giveaway.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, let me start by thanking the Senator  from Massachusetts for always telling it like it is because what we  have before us in the Senate is going to do grave harm to our country,  not just next year and the year after but for many years to come. We  still have an opportunity to stop that from happening through our votes  tomorrow.   Let me also say at the outset that we need to enact tax reform in the  United States of America. We need to simplify. We need to streamline.  We need to reform our Tax Code. We need to get rid of all of those tax  loopholes that had been put in our Tax Code by powerful special  interests that have been able to hire high-priced lobbyists and get  something in our Tax Code, not because it is good public policy, not  because it is good for the majority of Americans but because it is good  for some group of special interests.   We need real tax reform. That is not what the bill in front of us  does. What this bill does is take a Tax Code that is already stacked in  favor of the most powerful and the most wealthy and rig it even more in  favor of the most powerful and the most wealthy, and that is hard to  do. You have to work at doing that.   Our Republican colleagues have succeeded in taking something that was  already stacked in favor of those groups and making it even worse. That  is why we see this effort to jam this bill through the Senate in just a  few weeks because our Republican colleagues know the more the American  public sees this bill, the more they will hate this bill, and the more  they will realize it is going to mean their taxes are going up, in many  cases, and harm to the American economy.   We debated the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act in the  Senate, not for a long time but at least over a couple of months'  period. What happened is, as that debate went on, more and more people  around the country engaged. All the nurses, all the doctors, and all  the hospitals--I mean, rural hospitals, suburban hospitals, urban  hospitals--said that is bad for our healthcare. This Senate, at the end  of the day, did the right thing.   Unfortunately, the lesson learned was not to get the input from the  American public but try to rush something through before people can  figure out exactly what is in it, and that is what is happening in the  Senate today and tomorrow.   One example of the harm this bill will do hasn't gotten a lot of  attention. I want to talk about what this bill does in its changes to  how we tax U.S. corporations that have operations overseas. These are  big multinational corporations that have operations in the United  States but also have the ability to move their plant and equipment  overseas and hire people overseas instead of hiring Americans here at  home. There is a provision in this Senate Republican bill that is going  to dramatically increase the incentives for U.S. multinational  corporations to move operations and jobs overseas, and here is why.  Under this bill, American corporations that are doing business in the  United States will pay a 20-percent corporate tax rate. It reduces the  corporate tax rate down to 20 percent, but  [[Page S7503]]  it also says something else. If you are an American corporation and you  move your operations overseas, the profits you make on your overseas  operations pay zero percent U.S. tax rate.   Immediately, you have an incentive to move your business from  Baltimore City--or from any other city in this country or place in this  country--to another place that has a lower tax rate. For example,  Ireland has a 12.5-percent tax rate. If you move your business to  Ireland, you are going to be paying 12.5 percent on your profits  instead of the 20 percent you are paying here. If you move to Hungary,  you are going to pay 9 percent on the profits you earn in Hungary;  whereas, you would have paid 20 percent on your profits if you keep  those operations in the United States. So immediately you have an  incentive to move those operations overseas.   Even if you move those operations to a country that has a higher tax  rate than, say, Ireland or Hungary, there are easy ways to put those  profits you earn in a place like the UK or Japan and put them in lower  tax areas like the Cayman Islands or Bermuda. Right off the bat, this  creates a perverse additional incentive to put American jobs overseas.   So our Republican colleagues say: OK. Not to worry. We have a fix for  this issue. We are going to create this minimum U.S. tax on large  profits of overseas operations. In other words, if you are a U.S.  corporation, you move to Ireland, you can make a certain amount of  money there, but if you go over a certain amount, we are going to put a  minimum American tax on top of the tax you pay in Ireland.   This is a problem when you rush through a bill like this. The problem  is, the cure is worse than the disease. Here is why. Look at this  chart. First thing you say is, there is a lower tax rate in Ireland  than in Baltimore City so I am going to move some of my operations  overseas--my plant and equipment. In fact, I am going to move $10  million of investment overseas. Now, in Ireland, I am going to be  paying 12.5 percent on my profits, versus 20 percent here in the United  States. That is a pretty good move.    Now let's see if this minimum tax has any impact and what the impact  would be. Well, what the Republican tax bill says is that if your  earnings overseas exceed 10 percent of your investment in tangible  property--what is tangible property? The plant, equipment, your  factory. So if you spend $10 million and move your plant, equipment,  and factory overseas, you are going to be able to make a 10-percent  profit there with no additional U.S. tax. But if you earn more than  that--let's say you earn $1,200,000--instead of a 10-percent return,  which would have been $1 million, aha, now this minimum tax applies but  just to that excess profit. So you are now going to pay the lower tax  rate in Ireland on your first million, but you are going to pay 10  percent on the $200,000. So you are going to pay $20,000 in U.S. taxes.   What if you don't want to pay even that? Here is what is so  outrageous about this bill. I don't know if it is intentional or  unintentional. If I am a U.S. corporation, the way I fix this problem  is I move another $10 million worth of plant and equipment out of  Maryland into Ireland. So now I have got my $10 million investment that  I moved from Baltimore to Ireland, and I am going to move another one.  Now, as long as I keep my overall returns to 10 percent, I am not going  to pay that excess minimum tax. So if my first company has a 12-percent  return and the second one has an 8-percent return, together they have a  10-percent return. So I end up, by moving more plant and equipment from  the State of Maryland to Ireland, that I don't even pay that minimum  U.S. tax.   In fact, every time I get close to having to pay that minimum U.S.  tax, I can solve my problem by moving more American jobs overseas. That  is insane. I hope our colleagues will take a look at this, because this  is going to do great damage to the American economy.   You don't have to take my word for it. You have a lot of economists  who have taken a look at this provision. I am just going to read from  one. His name is Edward Kleinbard. He was the former chief of staff of  the Joint Committee on Taxation. We all know they are the  professionals. They are the nonpartisan professionals who analyze these  bills. Here is what he had to say: ``The administration's tax cut  proposal is coupled with a territorial tax system, which permanently  exempts foreign income from taxation; this will further tilt the  playing field in favor of foreign, rather than U.S., investment.''   I ask unanimous consent that the other quotations from the economists  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Jared Bernstein, senior fellow, Center on Budget and Policy       Priorities; former chief economist to Vice President Joe       Biden:        ``The Republican tax plan . . . . is likely to lead to more       outsourcing of U.S. jobs and a larger trade deficit. The tax       plan moves to what's called a territorial system of       international taxation, which means the U.S. tax rate on the       overseas earnings of U.S. foreign affiliates would become       zero.''        Rebecca Kysar, professor of law, Brooklyn Law School:        ``A pressing goal of tax reform is to reduce the incentives       for companies to move their operations overseas. This bill       does the opposite.''        Kimberly Clausing, professor of economics, Reed College:        The House and Senate Republican tax bills create a       territorial tax system that ``exempts foreign income from       U.S. taxation. This tilts the playing field even further       toward doing business abroad rather than at home, since there       will always be countries with lower rates. A territorial       system makes explicit and permanent the preference for       foreign income over domestic income. It accelerates the       profit shifting behind our corporate tax base erosion       problem.''        Carl Levin, former senator:        ``The House and Senate tax bills would be a monumental       mistake for the country for many reasons, but one compelling       reason is the disastrous way they treat foreign corporate       profits and encourage companies to shift their operations and       the economic benefits of intellectual property overseas.''        Richard Phillips, senior policy analyst, Institute on       Taxation and Economic Policy:        ``The most significant component of the Senate tax proposal       on international taxes is moving to a territorial tax system,       under which active income of U.S. companies earned offshore       will no longer be subject to U.S. taxes. By doing this, the       Senate tax plan moves in the opposite direction of real tax       reform by substantially contracting the base of the U.S.       corporate tax. According to the Joint Tax Committee, moving       to the territorial tax system would cost $215 billion over       the next decade. Exempting offshore income from U.S. taxation       would encourage further profit shifting and would also create       a tax incentive for corporations to move real operations and       jobs offshore to take advantage of lower tax rates.''        Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow, Tax Policy Center; former       counsel to Joint Tax Committee:        ``The Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) that the Senate is       debating this week would fundamentally change the way U.S.-      based multinational corporations are taxed on their overseas       income. But contrary to the claims of President Trump and       congressional supporters, the new approach may still       encourage U.S. companies to shift production overseas.''        Reuven Avi-Yonah, professor of law, University of Michigan:        Certain ``multinational corporations (for example, GE or       Intel) will pay less because they have more tangible assets       offshore. This creates an obvious incentive to move jobs (not       just profits) offshore. Moreover, the proposal standing on       its own would induce profit shifting because of the       combination of the participation exemption and the lower rate       (12.5% is less than 20%).''        Chuck Marr, director of Federal Tax Policy, Center on       Budget and Policy Priorities:        ``Another, less-noticed provision would permanently set an       even lower tax rate for U.S.-based multinationals' foreign       profits by adopting a `territorial' tax system, which would       encourage firms to shift profits and investment offshore. As       Senate Republican Ron Johnson said recently, `With a       territorial system, there will be a real incentive to keep       manufacturing overseas.' ''                              The FACT Coalition         ``This bill would create significant new tax incentives to       move U.S. jobs, profits, and operations overseas, while       exploding the deficit. The bill's complicated structure also       creates multiple new loopholes to allow for expanded tax       avoidance by large multinational companies at the expense of       small businesses and wholly domestic companies.''        Victor Fleischer, tax professor, University of San Diego:        ``The international provisions of the Senate tax bill are       worse than I thought--a very nice gift to multinationals.''   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Now, to add insult to injury, this is not the only  part of this bill that actually tips the playing field in favor of our  economic competitors overseas and against the American worker and  against the American taxpayer. If you look at the corporate tax cuts in  this bill, they are permanent. They go on forever. Year after year,  corporations will get that tax cut in the United States of America.  Whereas, if you are an individual  [[Page S7504]]  household in America, millions of middle-class taxpayers will see an  immediate increase in their taxes. Some will see a small cut in their  taxes for a period of time, but in the long run, those individual tax  cuts go away, and the corporate tax cuts go on forever.   Of course, the theory behind this is trickle-down economics; right?  You are going to give the very wealthy and big corporations the tax  cut, and the benefits of that are going to trickle down and lift  everybody up. I think we know that this theory has run aground and run  into the wall of reality many times over.   Most recently, in the early 2000s, we had the Bush tax cut. It was  the same theory--to cut taxes for the superwealthy and somehow the  benefits were going to trickle down and lift everybody up. I will tell  you who it lifted up. The wealthy did even better. The other thing that  went up is our deficit and debt, but everybody else was either running  in place or falling behind. That was our most recent experiment in  trickle down.   We also have an immediate present example of why this theory of  giving big tax cuts to corporations and the idea that it is going to  raise wages is just dead wrong. As we sit here tonight, American  corporations are making record profits. That is a great thing. But  guess what. Wages are flat. So by increasing the after-tax profits of  those corporations, they are not going to use that extra money to raise  wages. They are not doing it today. They are not doing it today.   The stock market will go up, and stockholders will definitely have  greater value, because you are a corporation. The day after this tax  bill gets passed, if it passes, your after-tax profits just went up.  The stock market is doing great. The problem is, most Americans--the  overwhelming amount of Americans--don't benefit from that rising stock  market. We know the people who benefit most are the folks at the very  top.   Here is the thing that I think many people will be surprised by. A  very large group of those stockholders are not even American citizens.  They are foreign stockholders--stockholders who have these investments  in American corporations.   In fact, 35 percent of the stock in these corporations are foreign  shares--35 percent of the value of that stock. So I can tell you that  they are going to be clicking the champagne glasses in capitals around  the world because those very wealthy foreigners are going to get a big  tax cut. In fact, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy  estimates that the value of the tax cut to foreign stockholders just in  the year 2019 will be over $30 billion. That is in 1 year for foreign  stockholders. In that same year, in 2019, taxes will go up by over $27  billion on American citizens.   There is great news for the American public. Some $27 billion are  transferred from American households into the pockets of foreign  stockholders--what a great deal for the American public. They are going  to be thrilled to see that their hard-earned dollars are going to  increase the bank accounts of foreign stockholders.   This is the kind of information that is beginning to come out as  people get a chance to look more at the consequences of this bill. This  is the exact reason that Republicans are trying to rush this through  the Senate. I can tell you, when the American public sees that their  taxes are going up to pay for foreign stockholders, I think all of us  agree that they aren't going to like it.   The problem is this is also part of a pattern. The corporate tax cuts  go on forever, and those foreign stockholders, every year--this is in  2019--keep getting a big windfall, a big bonanza. But if you are an  American taxpayer, you are on the short end of the stick because  millions of American middle-class families will see their taxes go up  right away. As I said, others may see a small tax cut originally, but  it will fizzle out.   So here is the overall impact. In 2019, you are going to see 13  million American families who earn less than $200,000 a year pay higher  taxes under this Republican bill--13 million families. It gets worse  from there because the benefits that some people will get in the short  term begin to fizzle out and then get snuffed out altogether at the end  of 10 years.   By the year 2025, it is going to go from 13 million middle-class  American families to 19 million middle-class families who are going to  be paying higher taxes. By the way, at the same time, the Republican  bill will give a tax cut of an average of $40,000 a year to people who  make more than $1 million a year.   It gets even worse for families in and after the year 2025 because  all of the individual tax cuts expire. Tax cuts for the foreign  stockholders keep going on. They go on forever. By 2027, the Republican  plan will raise taxes on 87 million American families.   Now, we actually just had some information come out. It was just  released to the public this evening. This is from the Joint Committee  on Taxation. These are the folks who are the professionals who look at  the impact of the tax bill. They analyze it, and they let people know  the facts.   Here is what they said. When this bill runs its course in the year  2027--here is the bottom line--23 percent of American households are  going to see their taxes go up, and 16 percent will see their taxes go  down. So more American households will see their taxes go up than go  down. Some 61 percent, they estimate, see virtually no change at all.  Again, these are families, not corporations. The corporations,  including those foreign stockholders, keep seeing the benefits.   Here is the other thing the Joint Committee on Taxation is telling  us. Of the people who get a cut, the largest share of any one group are  people who make $1 million and up. In fact, it says of those in that  category, that 57 percent of the households will get a tax cut. Those  are the millionaires. If you look at middle-income folks, there are  much smaller percentages in those categories.   I just have to ask my colleagues how it is that you try to sell a  plan as a middle-class tax cut when, at the end of the day, more  Americans are going to see their taxes go up than go down. I think the  American people are going to be more and more surprised if this bill  passes as to what is in it.    So we have a chance to actually step back right now. We have a chance  to step back and actually take a good look at the bill, and we can  figure out which of these consequences are intended and which of these  consequences are unintended. There is time to fix some of these issues.   The last point I wish to make is that in addition to middle-class  families--millions of them who are going to have to pay more to pay for  the big corporate tax cut--we are also going to see a number of other  groups of Americans who are going to be hit hard. We know that millions  of people who get their health insurance through the exchanges are  going to see their premiums go up to pay for big tax cuts for  corporations. We know that even after all of that--after those  Americans have to pay more in premiums and after millions of middle- class families are going to have to pay more--we still have a $1.5  trillion debt.   I am just going to ask my Republican colleagues, with whom I have  worked for many years and with whom I have agreed that we need to find  a bipartisan way to reduce our deficits and debt rather than increase  our deficits and debt, what their plan is.   Here is the secret--not really a secret, actually. I invite everybody  to look at the budget that passed the Senate and the House of  Representatives, because it tells us right there in the budget what the  plan is to reduce some of that debt that will be increased because of  tax cuts. The proposal is right there: A $1 trillion cut to Medicaid  over 10 years, a $473 billion cut to Medicare over 10 years, and cuts  to the whole category of our budget we use to invest in education.   So the bottom line is that this bill is going to provide whopping tax  cuts to corporations. It is going to have the effect of encouraging and  incentivizing more of those corporations to move jobs, plants, and  equipment overseas, and it is going to ask almost everybody else in the  country to pick up the tab. That is not the kind of tax reform the  American people bargained for.   I urge my colleagues to take a step back, to work together on a  bipartisan basis, and to come up with a plan that actually works for  the country. I hope that can happen.   I yield the floor.
