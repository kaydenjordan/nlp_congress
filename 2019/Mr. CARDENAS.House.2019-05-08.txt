 Mr. Speaker, I want to start off by thanking two  individuals who came to this country for a better life: Luis Sanchez  and Elvira Sanchez.   They were married, and they had their first daughter, Norma, and some  years later, I was fortunate to fall in love with her.   Now, some years later, we have been married, raised four beautiful  children. They look like their mother. We now have two grandchildren.   Tomorrow is the day that I get to celebrate that the love of my life  was born. No, I am not going to say how many years ago. Tomorrow is her  birthday, and here I am in Washington.   I have been doing this job, this career, for 22 years, and I must  say, sometimes I am lucky enough to be there to celebrate anniversaries  and birthdays and sometimes I am not, but I just wanted to take this  opportunity to say happy birthday to the love of my life and my number  one constituent. And, yes, my grandchildren live in my district, so  they are my constituents, too.   It is a tough call, but, Norma, you are my number one constituent.  Happy birthday.                            ____________________
