 Mr. Speaker, I am humbled to deliver my first speech on the  House floor today and discuss the future of our great Nation.   I grew up on a farm south of Quinter, Kansas, that my parents and  brother still operate. The house my parents live in, and the house I  grew up in, is the same house my great-great-grandfather ordered from a  Montgomery Ward catalog in the early 1900s.   Growing up there meant I spent thousands of hours on a tractor  working in the fields and on horseback doctoring cattle in the family  feed yard. Those hours turned into love of country and lessons about  the value of hard work.   My Kansas roots run deep, and my desire to serve our country is wider  than a country mile. I ran for Congress to advocate for agriculture and  our conservative Kansas values. Kansans are good people who carry a  pioneering spirit with them, in the same way those who settled my State  did over 160 years ago.   The people of Kansas 1, the Big First, know each other, look out for  each other, and sacrifice for each other. The district is home to more  than 60,000 farms and is made up of farmers, ranchers, feedlot  managers, nutritionists, ethanol producers, ag lenders, and  agribusiness owners who feed, fuel, and clothe the world.   As Congress becomes increasingly more urban, the distance from farm  to fork has never been greater, and the Big First depends on strong  voices for agriculture in Congress. That is why I am honored to serve  on the House Agriculture Committee.   At the very top center of the Big First sits Lebanon, Kansas, a  seemingly ordinary small town. About 2\1/2\ miles northwest of Lebanon  is the exact middle of the contiguous 48 States. A few months ago, a  group of us met in Lebanon and prayed for our Nation and that God's  will would be done and that our future would be bright.   There is something about being in the middle of the country where  farmers pray for rain, parents drive 30 miles one way to take their  kids to school, and communities shrink and grow with oil and gas prices  that gives you a great perspective. To really be in the middle of it  all, though, we must demand results.   I have received many calls from family farmers in the Big First  gravely concerned with President Biden's executive order restricting  travel from countries like South Africa, where many of our legal  farmworkers come from during harvest. I will tell you, if an issue  matters to a Kansan, it matters to me.   I worked with a number of my colleagues here to issue a letter to  President Biden, asking that he exempt essential workers, like those in  agriculture, from his travel ban. Soon after, we were told the  President would grant the exemption. But to me, an exemption to an  overreaching executive order is not enough.   After watching President Biden issue 25 executive orders in his first  10 days as President, more than the last seven Presidents combined  during their first 10 days, I decided I could no longer sit idle and  watch executive orders dictate the direction of this country with no  input from Congress. The executive branch was not created to  legislate--Congress was.   We are now up to 42 executive orders from the Biden White House. That  is why, earlier this week, I introduced the More Accountability is  Necessary Now acts, six pieces of legislation promoting accountability  and transparency to the administration's future executive orders.   The MANN acts require that the executive branch notify the American  public and Congress of its intent to issue any new executive orders  pertaining to agriculture, energy, the environment, pro-life  provisions, the Second Amendment, and immigration.   The short-term impact of legislation like this would be to hold our  elected leaders more accountable. But for the long term, we must never  forget that America is the greatest and most noble experiment that has  ever been endeavored.   When our Founding Fathers used the three words ``by their Creator''  245 years ago, they unleashed freedom on humanity, because for the  first time in history, people stood up and declared that freedoms do  not flow from a king or government; they flow from God.   The power of that truth can never be stomped out because it rings  loudly in the hearts and minds of Americans from coast to coast and  certainly in the Big First, which in many ways is the pilot light of  America. In my district, the basic values of faith, family, and freedom  are alive and well. It is our responsibility to never let that light go  out.                                time  1100    I believe that when we get into the middle of issues, roll up our  sleeves, get to work, and do the heavy lifting, we gain better  perspectives and better results. Being in the middle of it all instead  of being stapled to our desks in Washington, D.C., makes us all better  and is good for America.   Get in the middle of it. Stand face to face and engage. Spend time to  think, pray, and reflect, like I did that day in the exact center of  the country. I promise you will gain a better understanding of where we  need to go as a nation.   I did not run for Congress to be a caretaker in the slow demise of  America. I ran so I could fight and work to  [[Page H334]]  make it stronger. That is what I intend to do while believing that our  brightest days are yet to come.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   My district in Kansas has a lot of oil and gas, and a lot of ethanol  production as well, which is very important for the energy, the  backstop for the country.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss President Biden's recent  executive actions and their impacts on American energy.   Kansas-1, the Big First, is one of the most productive agricultural  areas of the country, and is also home to a flourishing energy  industry. In a rural district like the Big First, communities shrink  and grow with oil and gas prices. My district is the 11th largest  district in this country and has more than 83,000 miles of roads. We  depend on energy every day to fuel agricultural equipment and to  transport our products across the country and around the world.   Crude oil and natural gas are the foundation that fuels the Big  First. Whether it be diesel for a tractor, keeping our home and  families warm, or filling up a gas tank to drive our kids 30 miles each  way to school, my district needs energy. In addition, the Big First  also produced nearly 500 million gallons of ethanol last year.   I am gravely concerned with President Biden's mandates on oil and  gas. In my first few weeks in Congress, President Biden issued 25  executive orders in his first 10 days as President. That is more than  the last 7 Presidents combined during their first 10 days. For example,  President Biden delivered mixed messages claiming to support fossil  fuels and American jobs, and then issued an executive order dismantling  the Keystone XL pipeline.   The United States has achieved energy independence over the last  several years. That said, we cannot sit idle and watch executive orders  dictate the direction of our country with no input from Congress. The  administration will soon fundamentally impact our energy independence.  The executive branch was not created to legislate. Congress was.   Earlier this week, I introduced the More Accountability is Necessary  Now Acts, six pieces of legislation promoting accountability and  transparency to the administration's future executive orders. The MANN  Acts require the executive branch to notify the American public of its  intent to issue any new executive orders pertaining to six specific  topics that impact my district, including energy and the environment.   We must hold our elected leaders accountable for the pipeline worker  and the plant manager, for the farmer and rancher, for the millions of  lives depending on agriculture and energy every day, and for the  betterment of our democracy.
