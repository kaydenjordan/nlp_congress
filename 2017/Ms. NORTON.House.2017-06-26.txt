 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2547. This bill is  another of our efforts to help tackle the longstanding commercial  driver shortage and support veterans at the same time as they  transition from military to civilian life.   H.R. 2547 will ensure that all qualified medical professionals  employed by the Veterans Administration can perform commercial driver  physical examinations for their veteran patients.   The medical professionals that this bill addresses are already  eligible to become certified medical examiners. This bill simply allows  them to utilize the alternative certification process for VA-employed  physicians that is currently being finalized by the Federal Motor  Carrier Safety Administration.   Unfortunately, the most recent available data shows that, of the  54,000 medical professionals listed on FMCSA's national registry of  certified medical examiners, only 25 are employed by the VA. The online  training and testing system being developed by FMCSA and the VA should  help remedy this situation. This bill will allow more caregivers to use  this new resource.   This bill is consistent with the intent of the FAST Act, which was  the product of a strong bipartisan process here in the House of  Representatives. FMCSA, in consultation with the VA,  [[Page H5144]]  has done a good job creating an alternative process that will  eventually allow more VA doctors to become certified medical examiners,  while maintaining the safety and integrity of the certification system.  Allowing VA medical professionals to utilize online training and  testing will make it easier for them to obtain certification, while  ensuring they are familiar with the specific medical standards required  for commercial drivers.   Though the FAST Act used the word ``physicians,'' the process that  FMCSA has outlined should also be available for use by VA-employed  nurse practitioners, chiropractors, physician assistants, and other  qualified medical professionals. This bill ensures that they are  eligible to use that process.   Madam Speaker, I support this legislation and strongly urge its  adoption, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Seldom do we get to do two good things at one time, and that is  exactly what this bill does. Anything we can do for our veterans is not  enough. This bill focuses on them.   Remember, they have been in the armed services driving trucks. When  they come home, they probably have had the best training in the entire  universe. Our country will gain much not only by putting them to work,  but by using their training.   On our committee, we have long struggled with an issue that we still  have not, indeed, conquered, and that is the difficulty of getting  people to drive commercial trucks. This is one of the hardest jobs in  America. You are spending time away from your family. You sometimes are  gone not only overnight, but more than that.   It has been difficult to get people to do this indispensable job for  our country and for the trucking industry. Madam Speaker, I am  particularly pleased that Mr. Graves and I have been able to find this  new way to both aid the industry and help out veterans.   Madam Speaker, I do not have any more speakers, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H5145]]    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1684, the Disaster  Assistance Support for Communities and Homeowners Act of 2017,  introduced by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), my good friend  and colleague. This bill will assist common interest communities such  as condos, co-ops, and community associations after disaster strikes.   Hurricane Sandy caused severe impacts to New York City and the  surrounding areas, inflicting billions of dollars of damage.   While condominiums and cooperative associations are not common in  large parts of the country, they are common in dense areas such as New  York City and Washington, D.C.   FEMA's Individual Assistance Program does not consider these types of  housing units which share common areas such as entryways, stairwells,  and elevators. As a result, FEMA determined that disaster damage to  common areas is the responsibility of the condominium or cooperative  association board and, therefore, not eligible for disaster assistance.  That cannot be what Congress intended.   The bill also addresses another type of housing common in certain  parts of the Nation: community associations. Community associations  provide essential services of a governmental nature such as trash  collection and maintaining roads and waterways. After disaster strikes,  however, FEMA may deny reimbursement to community associations for  performing the same types of essential services that FEMA reimburses  local governments for performing.                                time  1715    In many cases, these common interest communities may have been  eligible for FEMA assistance if they had entered into agreements with  their local governments before the disaster occurred. Unfortunately,  many common interest communities are not aware of these opportunities.  This bill directs FEMA to provide technical assistance so that these  common interest communities know what actions they can take before  disaster strikes so that they may be eligible to receive reimbursement  from FEMA after the fact.   I strongly support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support  this measure.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), the author of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, my good friend is from New York, so it may be clear  why he, with a city full of condominiums and co-ops, would want this  bill. But I just want to alert Congress that increasingly what Mr.  Nadler sees in New York is what we are seeing all over the country.   After Hurricane Sandy, with climate change already here, we have to  do all we can before the fact, having seen what that disaster did to  New York City, New Jersey, and the surrounding community.   When people have gone through a disaster, they have suffered enough.  So to find that your resident is covered, but your way to get in the  residence or in the elevator is certainly not what Congress intended.   My own jurisdiction, the District of Columbia, was built with single  family homes, but that is not what we are building in the District of  Columbia and cities and counties throughout the United States now. In  our own city, there is a limited area. There is no way to go but up.   Mr. Nadler speaks not only for New York City, but his bill speaks for  what is happening in the United States of America. I think we may have  caught this problem just in time. We do not know when the next disaster  will occur. We don't want to be caught flat-footed on it.   I very much appreciate that my good friends have worked with us to  bring this bill forward.   Madam Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2258, as amended,  which will allow current servicemembers who have military experience  operating commercial motor vehicles to more easily obtain a commercial  driver's license.   In 2015, Congress included a provision in the FAST Act to allow  States to waive the written CDL knowledge test for drivers with  military commercial motor vehicle driving experience, but it restricts  the waiver to former members of the military. There are a significant  number of current reservists and members of the National Guard with  military commercial motor vehicle experience who could benefit from the  waiver. This legislation allows them to more easily use the skills they  learned serving our country to earn a decent wage and feed their  families.   These servicemen and servicewomen receive from the Federal Motor  Carrier Safety Administration, or FMCSA, what they describe as thorough  and comprehensive training, including many hours of behind-the-wheel  training--something that we have long advocated for as a requirement  for civilian drivers. There is a shortage of commercial truck drivers,  and these well-trained military drivers are exactly the type of  individuals that we would want to help enter the trucking profession.   Using its existing exemption authority, FMCSA has already taken  action to make current servicemembers eligible for the knowledge test  waiver on a temporary basis. Last October, FMCSA issued an exemption  that allows States to waive the CDL knowledge test for trained military  truck drivers, whether they are current members of the military or  veterans.   FMCSA cited the fact that training these drivers receive in the  military includes ``many hours of classroom training, practical skills  training, and on-the-road training that are essential for safe  driving.'' However, FMCSA's temporary exemption expires in October  2018. This bill would make permanent the ability for current members of  the military to utilize the FAST Act waiver.   Madam Speaker, I strongly support this legislation, and I urge its  adoption.  [[Page H5147]]    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Aguilar), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to thank Mr. Aguilar, who is the author of this bill, for his  work in filling this hole so that members of the National Guard and  reservists, indeed, are more easily able to obtain a commercial  driver's license based on exactly the kind of training that the armed  services gives.   It is certainly true that we have had trouble in committee getting  on-the-job training as a requirement.                                time  1730    Here, we have people who get on-the-job training, and on-the-job  training of just the kind that our country needs, because of the  shortage Mr. Aguilar spoke of in commercial drivers, a very difficult  job that necessitates long hours, often away from one's own home and  family.   Madam Speaker, I regard this bill as a twin of the very first bill  that we passed, the VA bill that allows the Veterans Administration to  offer physical examinations, when we were alerted that there were only  25 physicians there who could do that.   So this is a good pairing of bills that our country needs because of  the shortage of commercial drivers, and that we owe our veterans and  those who serve, even now, in our services. I am particularly pleased  that this is a jobs bill. It seems to me that it is clear that when we  enable more and more people to drive commercial trucks, we are  increasing the supply of jobs available in our country.   These are high-paying jobs for good reason, because they are  difficult jobs, so I think this bill and our first bill are bills that  the bipartisan House today can take special pride in.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
