 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning  business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes  each.    Mr. President, in my maiden floor speech on May 9, I  spoke on behalf of thousands of Mississippians suffering from  consecutive months of catastrophic flooding in the South Mississippi  Delta.   Today I rise again to speak on behalf of thousands of Mississippians  who are still suffering from catastrophic flooding, which started in  January and continues to disrupt the lives of residents in the  Mississippi Delta and my State overall.   Floodwaters must recede before damages can be fully assessed, but we  already know that more than 600 households have suffered severe damage,  nearly 400 families have been displaced since February, and  agricultural losses will likely exceed $800 million. Much of the  necessary infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and drainage  culverts are beyond repair.   In June, LaTamela Taylor--13 weeks pregnant--and Darron Wilson died  when their car lost control and sank into the floodwaters. Something  must be done.  [[Page S5255]]    My colleagues might ask: How could an area more than 11 times the  size of Washington, DC, remain underwater for nearly 7 months? How  could floodwaters swamp more than half a million acres of homes,  businesses, highways, forests, and farmlands spanning six Mississippi  counties for so long?   The answer is quite simple. Similar to New Orleans, a complex system  of levees and floodgates constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers protected the roughly 1,446-square-mile Yazoo Backwater area  in West Central Mississippi. This levee system protects the areas when  the Mississippi River is high and the floodgates are closed. However,  these same protections become the problem when the river is high,  floodgates are closed, and excess rainfall occurs. The interior creeks  and rivers have no way to drain, and the result is a bathtub-like  effect.   Unlike New Orleans and numerous Federal flood control projects up and  down the Mississippi River, there is no mechanism to remove the trapped  water from the Yazoo Backwater area. Aside from evaporation, pumping is  the only viable option for removing vast amounts of water that have no  place to go.   This year, the Mississippi River remained above flood stage longer  than anytime in recorded history. The floodgates to prevent the  Mississippi River from backing up into the Yazoo Backwater area were  closed in January. Above-average rainfall occurred in the months  thereafter, and here we are today with a disaster on our hands.   For nearly 7 months, more than a half million acres of land--866- square-mile area--has been underwater. Little attention outside of  Mississippi was paid to the lives lost, the destroyed homes, or the  displaced families.   Roughly, 225,000 acres of agricultural crops have been destroyed or  will go unplanted this year. Hundreds of thousands of acres of  Timberland ruined. Whitetail deer, black bear, turkey, and other  wildlife are starving to death and spreading the disease, as you can  see from these pictures. Wetlands have become lakes. Stagnant,  contaminated water continues to threaten human and environmental  health. The list goes on.   Paul Hartfield, an endangered species biologist with the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service, said: ``This is biblical proportion. Nothing like  this has ever been seen.''   While he is correct in that the current situation in the South  Mississippi Delta is a complete disaster--the worst backwater flood  since 1973--devastating flooding in the area has become almost an  annual occurrence.   This year marks the 10th time the Yazoo Backwater area has flooded  since 2008, each time causing hundreds of millions of dollars in  damages. The area residents cannot sustain this, and they certainly do  not deserve this.   According to U.S. census data, roughly 35 percent of the residents of  the six-county area live in poverty. The median household income is  $31,187 per year below the national average. This perpetual flooding  plagues agriculture production, which has damaged the primary economic  mainstay in this region and increased unemployment. I fear what the  2020 census will reveal.   In a 1982 environmental impact statement, the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers stated the following:         Flooding in the Yazoo Area is historic and will continue as       long as pumps are not constructed to complete the flood       control system for the area. The flooding will continue to       damage crops, homes, roads, and other improvements in the       area project.    In a 2007 Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, the Corps  stated the following:         The no-action alternative would not eliminate any of the       flood damages the area has historically experienced. Existing       Yazoo Backwater flood duration and frequency would continue       to adversely affect residential and nonresidential       structures. Flooding would also have adverse impacts on the       standard of living for residents, interrupting daily       practices and travel to work, school, and church.    The Corps of Engineers was accurate in its predictions.  Mississippians are living these predictions out in real life, and they  have for years. It is time for the people of Mississippi to receive the  level of flood protection promised to them by the Federal Government in  1941. It is time for the Corps of Engineers to complete the last  remaining unconstructed feature of a 77-year flood control effort--the  Yazoo Backwater pumps.   The people of Mississippi are beyond ready to see this crisis  resolved. They are, frankly, extremely frustrated with the Federal  Government. More than 17,000 people have signed a petition to remove an  Environmental Protection Agency 2008 regulatory veto preventing  construction of the pumps. Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant, the  Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, the  Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce, and many other  State leaders and organizations have been overwhelmingly in their  support and advocacy for the pumps.   I am grateful for this administration's responsiveness to  Mississippi's perpetual flood problems and needs, and I will continue  to work with the administration, relevant Federal Government agencies  and departments to see this through.   As I continue working to provide greater predictability and  regulatory certainty for Mississippians and the American public, I am  committed in my capacity as a U.S. Senator to proposing commonsense  reforms to the laws governing the regulation of our Nation's waters and  permitting process.   For this reason, I, along with the senior Senator from Mississippi,  have introduced the Flood Reduction, Wildlife Habitat, and Water  Quality Improvement Act of 2019. This legislation seeks to make  commonsense reforms to section 404 of the Clean Water Act.   Our bill mirrors the directives outlined in Executive Order No. 13807  issued by President Donald Trump on August 24, 2017, and would  establish greater discipline and accountability in the environmental  review and permitting process for infrastructure projects.   More specifically, it would prohibit EPA from vetoing a Corps of  Engineers flood control project specifically authorized by Congress.  This is a basic constitutional principle of separation of powers.  Further, upon enactment, it would immediately nullify any prior veto  determinations made by EPA if said actions had resulted in severe  flooding and damage to life and property.   In closing, the arguments I have heard in opposition to this project  are not valid. Pumps will save lives, property, local infrastructure,  wildlife, and the environment. As we are here going about our daily  lives, enjoying the comfort of the home we will return to today after  work, these Mississippians are just trying to get through the next 30  minutes to keep their sanity and emotions intact. The real-life  experiences Mississippians have endured over time tell the true story.   It is time for the Federal Government to make good on its promises.  It is time to construct the pumps.
