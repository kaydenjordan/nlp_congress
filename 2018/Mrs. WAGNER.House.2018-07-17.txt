 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today in support of the  JOBS and Investor Confidence Act of 2018, and I urge its immediate  passage.   This progrowth legislation is a continuation of the work that our  committee has done over the last year. We are tailoring regulations for  small and midsized companies while protecting investors by giving them  the broadest of investment opportunities. I am especially happy to see  my bill, the Modernizing Disclosures for Investors Act, included in  this package.   H.R. 5970 will go a long way in improving and simplifying disclosure  requirements for small and emerging growth companies that, for years,  have struggled with the size and the complexity of these quarterly  financial reporting forms.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the chairman and the ranking member for  their work to get this bipartisan bill to the floor. It was no small  task. Again, I urge all Members to support this bipartisan legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Elie Wiesel  Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act.   I introduced this bill to improve U.S. efforts to prevent mass  atrocity crimes. The legislation honors the legacy of Holocaust  survivor Elie Wiesel and his life's work to fight evil around the  world.   Mr. Wiesel was just 15 years old when the Nazis deported him and his  family to Auschwitz. Having witnessed the near total destruction of his  people, he spent his life defending the persecuted. As Mr. Wiesel  understood so well, the true horror of genocide is that it is  preventable.   We are haunted by repeated failures and missed opportunities to end  these tragedies before they begin. There is more the United States can  and must do to help vulnerable communities and persecuted people around  the world.   The reality is that good intentions and platitudes like ``never  again'' have not prevented the deaths of hundreds of thousands of  civilians at the hands of the Assad regime nor the ethnic cleansing of  the Rohingya Muslims in Burma.    When I introduced this legislation, I thought of the Bosnian  community in St. Louis, my hometown. This community has shaped what St.  Louis looks and feels like. It has added great cultural diversity to  the city, immense intellectual capital, thriving small businesses, and  a strong religious presence.   Two decades ago, members of our Bosnian community were refugees. In  1995, Orthodox Serbs, under the command of General Ratko Mladic,  initiated a horrific ethnic cleansing campaign against majority-Muslim  Bosniaks. The bloodshed forced 130,000 Bosnian refugees to seek new  lives in the United States.   It is fitting that today we remember the victims of the Bosnian  genocide just a few days after its 23rd anniversary. I am continually  amazed by the resilience of our Bosnian neighbors. Their courage has  inspired me to seek change.   The Elie Wiesel Act expresses Congress' strong support for better  utilization of existing resources, particularly the Atrocities  Prevention Board, which is dedicated to coordinating U.S. atrocity  prevention and response, and the Complex Crises Fund, which supports  agile, efficient responses to unforeseen crises overseas.   Additionally, we require the administration to evaluate existing  prevention efforts, report on countries at risk of genocide and mass  atrocity crimes, and recommend concrete improvements to our early  warning systems.   The bill also mandates that U.S. Foreign Service officers are trained  in atrocities recognition and response. Should this bill become law,  America's diplomats will be better equipped to act before violence  spirals out of control.   The Elie Wiesel Act establishes that it is the official policy of the  United States to regard atrocities prevention as a core national  security interest and to address root causes of conflict through our  humanitarian, development, and strategic endeavors.   Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, genocide is preventable. The United  States is the global leader in genocide and atrocities response, but we  must shift our attention towards prevention so that no one ever becomes  a victim in the first place.                                time  1645    H.R. 3030 is an important first step. I thank the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Crowley) for his cooperation on this piece of bipartisan  legislation, and I urge its support.
