 Madam Speaker, I rise here today in recognition of  National Agriculture Week.   Back home in Georgia's 12th District and across the Peach State as a  whole, agriculture is the number one industry. This week is about  recognizing farmers and ranchers nationwide who sacrifice their blood,  sweat, and tears to secure the safest, most abundant food supply in the  world.   I grew up on a farm, and since being elected to Congress, I have had  the distinct honor of serving on the House Agriculture Committee. I  could not be prouder of what we have accomplished, especially getting  the 2018 farm bill over the finish line.   It is without a doubt that agriculture touches all our lives in one  way or another.   Many farmers in my district and across Georgia are hurting from the  recent devastation caused by Hurricane Michael. I am doing all I can to  ensure that they receive necessary and adequate financial assistance  ahead of the upcoming planting season. I know my Senate colleagues are  working to get this done as well, but the urgency of this simply cannot  be overstated. Rural America needs us to act now.   Madam Speaker, again, I thank all our farmers who work hard every day  to feed and clothe this great Nation and the world.                            ____________________
