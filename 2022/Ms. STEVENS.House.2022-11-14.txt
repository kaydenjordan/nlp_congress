 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to stand before you today to  pay tribute to the heroes who have gone before us and the heroes who  walk among us, our veterans. It is also an honor to be here with my  legislation under the great leadership of the chairman of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee, who leads us so well here in the Congress.   I rise in support of my bill to designate the Department of Veterans  Affairs community-based outpatient clinic in Canton, Michigan, as the  Major General Oliver W. Dillard VA Outpatient Clinic.   Major General Dillard was a trailblazer who exemplified what it means  to be an exceptional serviceman. He began his 34-year military career  in 1945 when he was assigned to the 349th Field Artillery Group in  Germany as part of the World War II army of occupation.   Following his time in Europe, he attended the infantry Officer  Candidate School at Fort Benning, where he received a commission as  second lieutenant of infantry. In following years, he continued to  climb the ladder.   In 1958, Major General Dillard graduated from the Army Command and  [[Page H8455]]  General Staff College, where he was one of only three Black officers in  his class.   In 1965, Major General Dillard made history by becoming the first  Black officer to graduate from the National War College. He later  served in command and intelligence positions in Korea, Germany, and  Vietnam, a most remarkable career.    This includes as the first Black general officer in the Office of the  Assistant Chief of Staff of Intelligence, as deputy chief of staff to  the U.S. Army Forces Command, and as deputy chief of staff of  intelligence for the U.S. Armed Forces in Europe.   During his extraordinary 34 years of service, Major General Dillard  received nine military awards and two civilian medals, including the  Distinguished Service Medal, the Silver Star, the Purple Heart, and the  Combat Infantryman's Badge with star.   He retired from military service in 1980 and later passed away in  2015 in Canton, Michigan, where this VA outpatient clinic will reside  and where his son, Oliver, still resides.   Earlier this year, I had the privilege of touring this facility  alongside the Dillard family, with my incredible colleague and champion  for this legislation, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, who will be  representing Canton in this upcoming Congress.   The naming of the Canton VA clinic is just a small token of our  appreciation and recognition to Major General Dillard for his exemplary  service, leadership, and sacrifice to our Nation.   I know that this VA clinic will serve as a proud commemoration of the  man who dedicated his life to serving others and as an inspiration to  those who will continue to hear his name.   I thank both the Dillard family--in specific, his son, Oliver--and  Congresswoman Dingell for their work and input on this legislation.   I also thank Canton Township Supervisor Anne Marie Graham-Hudak for  her leadership in getting the VA outpatient clinic to its current  place.   I also thank our entire Michigan delegation, as well as the Michigan  American Legion, the Michigan Disabled American Veterans, and the  Michigan Veterans of Foreign Wars, for their support on this bill.   I thank my colleagues for their consideration of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1500
