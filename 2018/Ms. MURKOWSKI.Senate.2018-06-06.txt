 Mr. President, Gen. Lori J. Robinson, USAF,  will officially retire from Active Duty later this summer. This week,  General Robinson's friends and family are gathering in Crystal City to  celebrate her career. In advance of that event, I wanted to say a few  words about this exemplary military officer and honorary Alaskan who  has devoted her entire 36-year career to the security of our Nation.   General Robinson was born in Big Springs, TX. She is the oldest of  five children. Her father served over 30 years in the Air Force, so she  was not a stranger to the military lifestyle. General Robinson  completed her undergraduate work at New Hampshire University in English  and was commissioned as an Air Force officer through the ROTC Program  in 1981. Entering the Air Force, she was trained as an air battle  manager. General Robinson spent several years mastering her craft  before completing the weapons instructor course as a distinguished  graduate from the Air Force Weapons School. She served in several  locations to include Florida, Philippines, Nevada, Hawaii, Oklahoma,  Colorado, Southwest Asia, and multiple stints in the Nation's Capital.   While General Robinson served both across the Air Force and the  country, it was in 1989 when then-Captain Robinson arrived at Pacific  Air Forces, PACAF, for her first assignment at the headquarters. As the  chief of current operations and command briefer, General Robinson  gained breadth beyond her operational duties as an air battle manager.  She would return 26 years later in 2014 to assume command of PACAF,  becoming the first female Air Force officer to lead an Air Force major  component command. General Robinson met the challenges of a command  spanning 13 time zones and 100 million square miles of air space head  on, providing effective leadership to the command during a challenging  time for the Air Force.   As PACAF commander, General Robinson oversaw U.S. Air Force  operations at Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson and Eielson Air Force  Base in Alaska. She was generous in her support for Alaska's airmen and  graciously keynoted the 47th Greater Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce  Military Appreciation Banquet in 2015.   Following General Robinson's time as the PACAF commander, she took  command of North American Aerospace Defense Command, NORAD, and U.S.  Northern Command, USNORTHCOM, in May 2016. In this final assignment,  General Robinson made history again as the first female to command a  combatant command. Tasked with the defense of the North American  continent, General Robinson has faced down challenges ranging from  nuclear threats from North Korea to a series of severe natural  disasters. Managing disaster relief for 10 hurricanes while  simultaneously providing aid for the wildfires that affected over 10  million acres in 2017 strained the commands and their resources, but  General Robinson used the challenges to help expand the commands'  readiness and capabilities.   General Robinson's strong relationship with Alaska continued in that  role, as Alaskan Command is a subunified combatant command of  USNORTHCOM. During her tenure as the NORAD and USNORTHCOM commander,  General Robinson made several visits to Alaska and worked to bolster  the military's presence in the State. She advocated for the sustainment  of and funding for the Alaska Radar System, and she appreciated the  significance of joint training and exercises that take place in the  State. General Robinson's focus on these aspects of military readiness  has helped grow the capabilities of the military in Alaska and, as a  result, has increased the defense of the United States. Recognizing the  importance of excellent military-community relations, General Robinson  graciously keynoted the 2018 Salute to the Military in Anchorage,  sponsored by the Armed Services YMCA.   General Robinson has led a career in the Air Force that reflects its  core values: integrity first, service before self, and excellence in  all we do. She is an example to all who serve, especially the young  women looking for a path to success in the military. At every step  along the way, she has supported and been supported by her husband,  Maj. Gen. (retired) David Robinson. They are a truly unique pair of  military talents and a model for dual-career military families. The  impact the two of them have had on the Air Force and our country cannot  be understated.   Although retirement will pull General Robinson from the Air Force, I  understand she is looking forward to spending time with her children  and grandchildren. We Alaskans are proud of the impact General Robinson  has had on our State during her time in the service, and we are proud  of the impact we have had on her. She is an exemplary officer and a  true example for all women looking to succeed in the military. I hope  that, as General Robinson enjoys her time in retirement, she brings her  family to visit Alaska sometime soon.   On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I take this opportunity to thank  General Robinson for her service and wish her well in her  retirement.                            ____________________
