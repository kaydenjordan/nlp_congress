 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for 90 seconds.    Madam President, today is Halloween. This may sound a  little ``candy corny,'' but this Iowan wants to talk about the scary  prices of prescription drugs.   Since January, I have joined with bipartisan forces to drive a stake  in the heart of ghoulish price-gouging. Senator Wyden and I are working  to shut down the pranks poisoning the drug supply chain. We need our  fellow lawmakers to step up and nail the coffin shut on monstrous drug  price increases.   One example that can't masquerade as a next-generation drug is the  500-percent increase for insulin, which helps Americans with diabetes  regulate blood sugar. This medicine was discovered 100 years ago, about  the time the first horror movie debuted. There is no rhyme or reason  for the terrifying price hikes spooking Americans.   The real horror story this Halloween is what is preventing Congress  from doing its job. Big Pharma is spending a frightening amount of  money to kill drug-pricing reforms.   Let's fix the real injustice haunting the American people, which is  sticker shock at the pharmacy counter. Every Senator can be a superhero  for Halloween. All you have to do is join us to dig a grave for batty  prescription drug prices. Ending Big Pharma's pricing tricks would be a  real treat for Americans.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I yield back all time.   I ask unanimous consent that the vote start now.
