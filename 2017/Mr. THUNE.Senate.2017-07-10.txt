 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Sisseton,  SD. The town of Sisseton will be celebrating its quasquicentennial on  June 14 through 16, 2017. Sisseton will host quasquicentennial events,  which include food and craft vendors, various exhibits, entertainment,  parades, athletic competitions, a veterans museum display, Native  American flute music, a rodeo, and much more.   Sisseton is located on the northern edge of the Coteau des Prairies  in Roberts County. The Sisseton area has long been known as a community  enriched with Native American and immigrant history. It is home to more  than 2,450 people and almost 200 businesses with many unique cultural  and recreational opportunities. Since its founding 125 years ago, the  community of Sisseton continues to serve as a strong example of South  Dakota values and traditions.   I offer my congratulations to the citizens of Sisseton on their  quasquicentennial celebration and wish them continued prosperity in the  years to come.                            ____________________
