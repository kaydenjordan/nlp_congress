 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of Dr.  Sherif R. Zaki, an exceptional leader at the CDC who passed away on  November 21, 2021.   Dr. Zaki, who joined the CDC in 1988, was the founder and branch  chief of CDC's Infectious Disease Pathology Branch, IDPB. During his  tenure at CDC, Dr. Zaki's vision and determination took the pathology  laboratory to the forefront of the Agency's work in responding to  public health threats posed by various infectious disease agents and  established this team to be as one of the most highly respected  infectious disease pathology laboratories in the world.   Dr. Zaki was an internationally recognized expert in infectious  disease pathology, whose work over the past several decades transformed  CDC's approach to the integration of pathology  [[Page S9256]]  as a core component of outbreak investigations. The rigorous and  innovative laboratory work carried out by his team has advanced  infectious disease experts' knowledge of many pathogens and their role  in the human disease process. These included investigations of  hantavirus, leptospirosis, West Nile virus, anthrax, SARS  coronaviruses, avian and human influenza viruses, Ebola virus, Zika  virus, and numerous transplant-associated infections, to name only a  few. As an author of hundreds of publications and numerous textbook  chapters, he is widely considered to be among the most influential  infectious disease pathologists of his generation.   As chief of IDPB, Dr. Zaki is widely recognized for his personal  leadership, scientific contributions, and commitment to CDC's public  health mission. Among his many awards are the HHS Secretary's Awards  for Distinguished Service, which he received nine times and is the  highest honor at HHS. Known and respected for his humbleness, Dr. Zaki  was uncomfortable with personal accolades and always quick to point to  the efforts of his IDPB colleagues and others. Dr. Zaki was a generous  teacher and mentor of younger scientists, friends, and former  colleagues.   My prayers are with Dr. Zaki's wife Nadia, his two children, and  friends during this difficult time. I am grateful for his dedication at  the CDC, and I am honored to recognize his extraordinary contributions  today.                            ____________________
