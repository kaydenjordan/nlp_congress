 Mr. President, today I would like  to celebrate the service and achievements of Dr. Ronnie Booth of  Anderson, SC, as he approaches his retirement from his position as  president of the Tri-County Technical College. Dr. Booth, named the  third president of TCTC in 2003, has spent the last 16 years helping to  advance the college and community to its current level of unprecedented  success.   Under Dr. Booth's leadership, Tri-County Technical College launched  three community campuses, three workforce training centers, and  economic development, technology and student success centers among  different campuses. He also created and established the Bridge to  Clemson and Connect to College Programs, which both help to create  pathways for students of all backgrounds to achieve their goals. Other  notable achievements during his tenure include the Technical Career  Pathways Program, Michelin Manufacturing Scholars Program, and I-BEST  Manufacturing Pathway Program.   Just this past year, Tri-County Technical College earned the top  ranking in student success, transfer, and graduation among the 16  colleges in the SC Technical College System and also ranked in the top  1 percent nationally for successful transfers to 4-year colleges and  universities. Community support and partnerships have also grown under  Dr. Booth's leadership, truly uniting the Tri-County area for the  better.   Dr. Booth has also been an active and engaged citizen, being a member  of multiple professional associations, civic groups, and State and  national boards. His commitment to improving the lives of his students,  school, and community cannot be understated, and he has surely made a  resoundingly positive impact on countless students, faculty, staff, and  community members. His leadership will not be soon forgotten, and I  congratulate him on his successes, as well as wish him good fortune, on  this next chapter in his life.                            ____________________
