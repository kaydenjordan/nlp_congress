 Mr. President, last year Congress provided nearly $68  billion in emergency funding for schools. About 10 percent of that has  been used. This bill provides another $126 billion, with no requirement  that we get kids back to school.   We know they need to be back in school. I think this amendment  actually, if applied, almost ensures we won't get back to school this  year.   Thirty days to come up with a plan; public comment on that plan. It  is the middle of March before anybody even begins to make--have the 30  days to make that plan. We need to get kids back to school. The New  York Times understands that.   Many States are saying the suicide rates, the emergency room mental  health concerns demand that kids get back to school, and not next year  but they get back to school as quickly as they can this year.   I think this amendment, while I am sure offered in good intention,  works against that, not for it, and I would urge a ``no'' vote on the  amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1344
