 Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate my friend from  Illinois and also my friend Mr. Thompson for this bipartisan bill. I am  happy to support it and hear all of my colleagues enthusiastically  support it.   Career and technical education gives students the opportunity to get  technical experience regardless of whether their next step out of high  school is to immediately join the workforce or to go to college.   In my district, I have had the opportunity to visit many students in  programs that benefit from the inclusions of career pathways in their  high school curriculum. Mt. Diablo High School students, for example,  create a farm-to-table restaurant experience, while Pittsburg High  Schoolers design computer animations as a part of the school's Green  Engineering Academy. At De Anza High School in Richmond, California,  they run an Information Technology Academy focusing on IT career  skills, while providing their community IT services free of charge.   By enacting this bipartisan legislation, Congress will affirmatively  take steps to update our Nation's educational vision and will propel  today's students into tomorrow's workforce.
