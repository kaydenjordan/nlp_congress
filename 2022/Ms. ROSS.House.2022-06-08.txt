 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today because there is no greater moral  imperative for us as Representatives than protecting the safety of our  children and our residents.   In recent weeks, our Nation has been yet again shaken to its core by  the  [[Page H5353]]  senseless attack on our most vulnerable. Heartbreakingly, mass  shootings have become a steady drumbeat in American life, striking  community after community, and instilling fear in the American people  as we drop our kids off at school, go to the grocery store, or enter a  house of worship.   Madam Speaker, after each of these terrifying events, after the  vigils have been held and the new cycle has moved on, there is one  thing that never fades. Every person who has had a friend, neighbor,  spouse, or child taken by violence, carries with them the heartbreaking  pain of that incomprehensible loss.   So what will it take for Republican leaders to join us in taking  action? So many Republicans agree with us. How many kids need to die?  How many families need to suffer before they finally say enough is  enough?   I have spent much of my public life in public service, and I believe  in American democracy. And I still believe in the ability of men and  women in this Chamber to set their differences aside, to make  transformative change for the public good.   Madam Speaker, my plea to my colleagues across the aisle is to stand  up for what is right. Let's start the hard work of building a safer  America. I come from a southern State with plenty of law-abiding gun  owners, but people from across North Carolina have been reaching out to  me and my office, including several Republicans and gun owners.   Madam Speaker, I support the rule and commend it to this body.
