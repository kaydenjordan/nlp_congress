 Mr. President, let me assure the Senator from New York  that I am willing to listen to his stories about how people might be  affected by the health care debate that is going on in the Congress  right now if he will listen to some of the stories I have to tell. By  the middle of June, people in 94 of the 99 counties in Iowa may not be  able to buy insurance through the Obamacare exchanges.   Senator Schumer talked about the tough consequences of the House bill  on healthcare. I am coming to the Senate floor today to talk about the  tough consequences of ObamaCare.   I rise today to speak some more about the Affordable Care Act. The  law is collapsing before our eyes. After 7 years of ObamaCare, it  continues to overreach, overpromise, and overstay its welcome for the  American people. I want to tell you the history about a bridge that  relates very much to what is happening to ObamaCare today.  [[Page S2926]]    Before I dive into the details of how ObamaCare is denying people in  the State of Iowa the ability to get health insurance, I want to share  a story about a bridge in the State of Washington.   This bridge is depicted right here. This is the collapse of that  bridge. The bridge is called Tacoma Narrows Bridge. It was built in  1940. It was the world's third largest suspension bridge. It was  considered a state-of-the-art masterpiece of 20th-century engineering,  but the bridge was set to fail from the very beginning.   On July 1, 1940, the $6 million bridge opened to traffic. Just 5  months later, on November 7, 1940, the bridge collapsed. What caused  the massive steel and concrete structure to twist, turn, and drop  nearly 200 feet into Puget Sound? Importantly, there was a key  foreshadowing clue. The bridge was nicknamed ``Galloping Gertie'' for  its dancing, swaying bridge deck. On most days, it resembled a roller  coaster rolling in the wind. But on the morning of November 7, Gertie's  dance became twisted in a howling 40-mile-an-hour wind. Dramatic  footage shown here shows tons of concrete and steel cables snapping  like fishing lines before its collapse. Gertie essentially self- destructed due to design flaws that created sheer havoc in those high  winds.   Like ObamaCare, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge wasn't built to last, and  like Galloping Gertie, ObamaCare is on a self-destruction course with  destiny. Galloping Gertie collapsed by a flawed design that was unable  to withstand high winds, and every day that goes by without a  bipartisan solution to fix the flaws, ObamaCare is moving the American  people closer to a calamity.   Sooner rather than later, ObamaCare will become its own bridge to  nowhere, with no insurance plans on the exchanges. Millions of  Americans will be left twisting high and dry. The warning signs can no  longer be ignored. First, many health insurers are bailing. The  individual market is near collapse.   Just last week, another insurance company, Aetna, announced it will  quit the remaining two States it planned to sell plans in under  ObamaCare. That means in 2018, Aetna will sell zero plans on the  individual market exchanges. Just a year ago, in 2016, Aetna  participated in the individual markets in 778 counties across the  country. In 2017, that number fell to 242. In 2018, that number will be  zero.   We ought to repeat this story because everybody is talking about what  the House health care bill might do to people's health insurance and  their healthcare. The fact is that people can't buy health insurance,  or if they buy it, the deductibles are so high they can't afford it.  That is the story we ought to be telling at least with equal weight  with the stories given by people who are talking about not wanting to  do anything with healthcare.   My home State has been hit particularly hard by insurers pulling out  of the individual market. In 2016, UnitedHealth Group announced it  would leave Iowa the following year. Last month, Aetna and Wellmark  announced they would be pulling out of the individual market in Iowa.  This leaves 94 of our 99 counties in Iowa with one choice for health  insurance on the individual market.   A constituent wrote to me following the news of their departure.         My son recently turned 26 years old and is ineligible to       remain on my insurance; therefore, he signed up for his own       policy through Wellmark. My son farms with my husband, so       while my husband has coverage through me, my son may soon be       facing the fact that he will not be able to buy health       insurance. My son, a true ``beginning farmer,'' will be       forced to leave our farming operation and seek employment       solely for the purpose of health care coverage.    If Congress doesn't act, the individual market may come crashing  down, just like the Tacoma Narrows bridge. We simply can't ignore  another warning sign. Healthier, younger people are choosing the off- ramp. The toll to join ObamaCare is turning out to be unaffordable for  them. ObamaCare is unsustainable.   Remarkably, instead of joining us to fix this broken bridge, the  other side wants to leave Americans twisting in the wind. In my home  State, 70,000 Iowans are enrolled in the individual exchanges, and the  last carrier left, Medica, is on the fence about its plans for 2018.  That is why I told Senator Schumer to listen to our stories. The people  in 94 of Iowa's 99 counties may not even be able to buy insurance on  the exchange.   The day has come. It is time to cross the bridge. It is time to  repeal and replace ObamaCare before it finishes its collapse.   I yield the floor.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.
