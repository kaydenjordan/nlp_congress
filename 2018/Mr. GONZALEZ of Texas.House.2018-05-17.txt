 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in solidarity with  south Texas sugar and in opposition to the Foxx-Davis amendment.   In deep south Texas, we are proud of our sugar corporation, our sugar  mill, and the jobs they support. Our existing sugar policy levels the  playing field for American producers in the ever volatile world of the  sugar market. It works. Sugar growers in my district can attest to  that. Better yet, it has come at no cost to taxpayers for 14 of the  last 15 years.   I ask everyone to vote ``no'' on this amendment.                            Parliamentary Inquiry
