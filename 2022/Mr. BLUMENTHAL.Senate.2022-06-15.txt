 Mr. President, today, I rise to recognize  Gaylord Specialty Healthcare as it celebrates 120 years of outstanding  service in Connecticut. Throughout its existence, Gaylord has changed  with the healthcare needs of the people of Connecticut and indeed  across the Nation, while maintaining a reputation for excellence and  superior professionalism.   The health system was first founded in 1902 as a tuberculosis  sanatorium. Gaylord Sanatorium provided long-term treatment for half a  century when the disease was endemic, treating patients including  playwright Eugene O'Neill. In 1926, the U.S. Public Health Laboratory  National Research Committee selected Gaylord's facilities as the first  they used in the country. In 1948, Gaylord Farm Sanatorium was renamed  to Gaylord Hospital, restructuring to treat people with chronic  illnesses. By 1954, Gaylord Hospital became the first hospital in New  England to specialize in comprehensive rehabilitation.   Today, Gaylord Specialty Healthcare is an extensive health system  across the State of Connecticut that focuses exclusively on medical  rehabilitation. The hospital in Wallingford is a leading center for  rehabilitation, and it is one of only two long-term acute care  hospitals in the world--and the only one in the United States. Gaylord  received certification from the Commission on Accreditation of  Rehabilitation Facilities in recognition of its outstanding patient  care. They offer an extensive breadth of treatment and accreditation  opportunities. Gaylord is further certified by the Joint Commission and  the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation  thanks to its exemplary standards.   I have had the privilege of visiting Gaylord Hospital on a number of  occasions. This April, I was proud to join members of their staff to  celebrate their new physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians  residency program, made possible thanks to $1.2 million in Federal  funding. This program will be the first of its kind in Connecticut, and  it will play a critical role in ensuring our State has sufficient  resources for specialty medical professionals. Having spoken with staff  and patients at Gaylord, I can attest firsthand to the extraordinary  care, compassion, and expertise demonstrated there. Gaylord Hospital's  work is a credit to our State.   As Gaylord Hospital celebrates its anniversary this October, I  applaud them on their extraordinary record of accomplishment. I hope my  colleagues will join me in congratulating Gaylord Specialty Healthcare  on 120 years of excellence.                            ____________________
