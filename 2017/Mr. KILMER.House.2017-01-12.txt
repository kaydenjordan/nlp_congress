 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say good-bye to a dedicated  public servant and a key part of my team. Judith Morris has served the  Olympic Peninsula for a decade, first for my predecessor Norm Dicks,  and for the past 4 years in my office.   Judith's knowledge of the peninsula and her dedication is unmatched.  There are few that combine her compassion and guidance to any  constituent who had a question or who needed help with a Federal  agency. Whether at the office or at the grocery store or at an event,  Judith was available.   Mr. Speaker, Judith has served our Nation with distinction, first in  the Peace Corps, and now in the United States House of Representatives,  making equity and conservation and human rights a tenet of her time in  service. Judith's wit, thoughtfulness, and easygoing manner will be  missed.   Our entire community thanks her and her husband, David, an  outstanding public servant in his own right, who worked for the  National Park Service, for leaving a legacy of integrity, excellence,  and service.   I am humbled and honored to offer my sincere thanks to Judith Morris  for her dedication to the Sixth Congressional District, and I wish her  the best as she continues to explore her passion for travel and service  all around this world.                            ____________________
