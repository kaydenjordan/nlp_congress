 Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to take this time from the  minority leader on behalf of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. We  are doing a Special Order hour this evening on police and civilian  relations.   We are joined by the very distinguished Congressman Keith Ellison.  Before we start, though, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Sherman).                     Honoring the Life of Nadadur Vardhan     Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to take this time from the  minority leader on behalf of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. We  are doing a Special Order hour this evening on police and civilian  relations.   We are joined by the very distinguished Congressman Keith Ellison.  Before we start, though, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Sherman).                     Honoring the Life of Nadadur Vardhan     Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Sherman for his comments. And  again, the Progressive Caucus Special-Order hour tonight is on the  subject of the police power in America, and its uses, its abuses, what  has been taking place in different parts of the country, and we are  going to kick off with Keith Ellison, who has been the chair of the  Progressive Caucus. And in addition to being a distinguished member of  the Congress from Minnesota, he is the vice chairman of the Democratic  National Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Ellison very much for those very  thoughtful and insightful comments.   I want to pick up the discussion about the police power and expand  the discussion to include not just power over persons, but power over  property in America.   Our Constitution's Framers were deeply informed by the social  contract theorists of the 17th and 18th centuries, and those theorists  believed that we enter into a social contract out of a state of nature,  because we are all  [[Page H6032]]  made better off by virtue of being part of a society.   So the first incarnation of it came from Thomas Hobbes in his work on  the ``Leviathan.'' Hobbes argued that the state of nature was, in his  famous words, ``nasty, brutish, and short,'' because anybody could kill  anybody. And so we enter into society together, and we give our power  to the leviathan, the government.   Now, the problem with his view, of course, was that the leviathan,  the government, had whatever powers it wanted, unlimited, infinite  powers. And at that point, as the Framers of our Constitution would  see, you have got a real problem, because you might be saved from  criminals and bandits and thieves, but now you have got to deal with an  all-powerful government and police who can trample your rights just as  much as the thieves and the bandits could. So the Hobbesian theory was  inadequate.   John Locke, in his famous work on the social contract, improved upon  the proposition. The state of nature for him was not quite so frightful  a place. There were certain virtues to a state of nature, so people  were actually giving something up by going into it.    So in his view, entering the social contract meant that we would  surrender some of our powers to government, and certainly our powers to  commit violence and theft against other people, but in return, we would  be guaranteed rights by the government and we would also have rights  against the government, and that was the view that deeply informed the  U.S. Constitution.   The whole point of the rule of law is that the people have rights  against the government, against those who are just the agents of the  sovereign. The sovereign is the people. The people are the sleeping  sovereign who can come awake in times of constitution-making and also  in order to make law.   Now, the whole social contract becomes unraveled Hobbesian style if  we are attacked by the police. So my friend, Congressman Poe from  Texas, earlier spoke about the horrific spectacle of violence waged  against U.S. citizens and others in the streets of Washington, D.C., by  the thugs of Prime Minister Erdogan from Turkey, who were unleashed on  protesters, and we saw, as Congressman Poe said, a scene of really  savage violence take place right here in Washington.   I am glad that we have a bipartisan consensus that that kind of  police attack on freedom of expression, freedom of assembly is  unacceptable in the United States of America, whether it is on citizens  or whether it is on permanent residents or whether it is on  noncitizens.   But there is something else that is going on in the country having to  do with the police power. The police power in common law terms, in the  American vernacular, is not just the power that police officers have to  regulate public safety and public order; the police power also has to  do generally with the governmental power to regulate.   There are some very troubling things that are taking place in America  today. One of them has to do with the eminent domain power. We are  seeing rampant abuse of the eminent domain power across the country  today, where private developers use their political power and influence  in campaign contributions in order to get local governments or State  governments to condemn private property of homeowners in order to oust  them from their homes in order to build a private project.   Now, one of the chief perpetrators of this business model in the  United States of America happens to be the President of the United  States, Donald Trump, who has bragged about his use of the eminent  domain power and has been involved in a lot of litigation relating to  eminent domain power.   I will take you to Atlantic City and introduce you to a woman named  Vera Coking, who lived in a three-story house off of the Boardwalk in  Atlantic City right next door to the 22-story Trump Plaza that then- businessman Donald Trump had built. Trump had built the hotel; he built  the casino; he built a parking garage. But it wasn't enough for him. He  wanted a VIP parking garage.   He wanted a parking garage for limos and made an offer, which Ms.  Coking refused, on her house so he could demolish her house and build  his expanded garage. She said: No, thank you.   He came back with another offer. She said: No, thank you. It is not a  question of money. My family has lived in this house for generations,  and my kids went to school here, and we belong to the church here. It  is not for sale.   Well, then at that point, President Trump, in order to build his  gold-plated parking garage for the limos, went to a government agency  that he knew well called the Atlantic City Casino Redevelopment  Authority to help him take away Ms. Coking's property, and they entered  into litigation. Fortunately, she found pro bono counsel in the  Libertarian public interest group, the Institute for Justice, a  Libertarian think tank and legal action center, and they were able to  stop Donald Trump in court in a case called Atlantic City Community  Redevelopment Authority v. Banin. Unfortunately, that took place before  the famous Kelo v. New London decision in 2005.   Now, there was a very similar scenario in Kelo, in a hard-hit  working-class town in Connecticut called New London, where the Pfizer  Corporation and a local private land redevelopment authority, one of  these shadowy, mixed public-private entities, decided that they wanted  to displace a whole neighborhood in New London so they could destroy  the blight, as they called it, and put in their brand-new development.   Ms. Kelo, a very soft-spoken single woman, working-class woman,  decided to fight, and she also found the Institute for Justice, and  they organized the community to say, no, they were not blight, that  they had ties to this community and they were not going to be forced  out by these big corporations.   They won all the way up to the Supreme Court, and then a five-Justice  majority in the Supreme Court, in the Kelo decision in 2005, determined  that it is perfectly constitutional and consistent with the Takings  Clause in the Fifth Amendment of our Constitution for a public  municipal corporation to condemn a person's private home or a private  small business in order to turn it over to another private business if  it is consistent with someone's economic redevelopment plan. And this  was a decision that President Trump said he ``agrees with 100  percent.''   Because, remember, that was his business model, that everything is  for sale, and if you refuse to sell to Donald Trump and his companies,  they are just going to get public authority to come in to get you out  of the way so they can condemn your land and take it over.   Now, it turns out that in the Kelo decision, after the Supreme  Court's erroneous judgment in it, the land was condemned, Susette Kelo  was forced out of her house, and--guess what--they never even built it.  Today it is an urban wilderness taken over by wild cats.                                time  1845    Well, let's look at another example of abuse of police power in  America today.   I understand that earlier this morning, the Justice Department  announced a new Federal policy to help State and local police officers  take cash and property from anybody suspected of a crime even without  arresting them, even without charging them with a crime, and even  without an arrest warrant, reversing an Obama administration rule that  was put in place because of rampant abuse of people's rights across the  country.   This is the United States of America. The police should not be able  to stop people on the street, in their cars, or at their homes and say:  I think that the money you have doesn't really belong to you. I think  the condo you have doesn't belong to you. I think the car you have  doesn't belong to you. I think your property looks suspect. We are  going to seize it. And then we are going to hold it, and you have the  burden of coming to sue us to prove that your property is innocent-- without charging them with a crime, without arresting them, or without  using a search warrant. This is what Attorney General Sessions wants to  do with the Orwellian new order that he handed down today. He wants to  get the Federal Government back into the business of working with State  and local governments to simply declare people's property and their  money presumptively guilty. And then they have to go out,  [[Page H6033]]  hire a lawyer, and go to court to prove that their property or money is  clean within the eyes of the government.   But whatever happened to due process? Under our Constitution, we are  presumed to be innocent of crimes, and our property should be presumed  to be innocent of crimes if there is no legal process at all to condemn  our property or to cast a shadow of criminal suspicion over it.   If you look at the history of this, Attorney General Holder barred  State and local police from using the Federal legal regime to seize  cash and other property without criminal charges or without criminal  warrants, which is the right way to do it. That is the constitutional  way to think about it.   In a democratic society, the people are presumed to be innocent until  they are proven guilty. It is not as if we are walking around with the  stigma of being presumed guilty of doing something in the eyes of the  State.   Since 2008, thousands of police agencies have made more than 55,000  seizures of cash and property worth $3 billion under a Justice  Department civil asset forfeiture program, which allowed the police to  make seizures and then share the proceeds with Federal agencies. It  allowed the Federal agencies to cooperate with State and local law  enforcement.   Then the Department of Justice said they were disengaging from that  because there was a series in The Washington Post about all of the  extraordinary abuses taking place.   There was one gentleman, a small business man, a Chinese-American  citizen of the United States who was traveling with a lot of money  because he was going to purchase a building for his new Chinese  restaurant that he was going to open up, and so he had, I think it was  around $25,000 or $30,000 with him. He got stopped by the police and he  was exceedingly nervous about the whole thing. They said he was acting  nervous and they took his money from him, his life savings that he was  hanging on to in order to go and purchase a building for a Chinese  restaurant. Luckily, he found some lawyers, but it took several years  for him to get the money back. He lost the deal.   He is in the minority because most people this happens to never go to  court to try to get their money back, they are so terrified and  demoralized by the experience of having their property taken by  government agents without any due process at all.   I urge everyone to go and find that Washington Post series on the  abuses that led up to the change in policy that was put into place by  Attorney General Eric Holder.   Now, Attorney General Sessions does a U-turn. The administration,  which President Trump started by saying he wanted to give power back to  the States and back to the people of the United States, instead says  the Federal Government is going to be incentivizing more violation of  people's due process rights by allowing seizure of people's property  and money.   It goes back to what Congressman Ellison was talking about: What is  this going to do for police-civilian relations in the United States,  when people are terrified that their property can be taken away by  agents of the State without an arrest, without a criminal warrant, or  without any charges at all? That is not right in our country. That is  not right in a country that does not allow for a taking of private  property without a public purpose. It is not right in a country that is  based on due process of law, that is based on probable cause and search  warrants for people being searched.   That is where this administration is taking us with the policy that  was announced earlier today. It is going to make our communities only  more suspicious and only more dangerous.   We have to step back from this Orwellian leviathan vision of  government, an all-powerful State that can seize your home or your  small business because a big business man like Donald Trump wants your  property to build his casino garage for his VIP guests; or because some  fancy company decides it wants to redevelop your land; or because the  police decide you don't look the right way and we are just going to  take your money out of your pocket, we are going to seize what is in  your wallet, we are going to take your car, we are going to take your  boat, or we are going to take your condo or apartment without any  criminal charges at all, and you go and deal with the problem.   Mr. Speaker, in the United States of America, we are a land of laws.  The great Tom Paine said that, in the monarchies, the king is law, but  in the democracies, the law is king.   We have to abide by the rule of law here. And I am not talking about  Democrat, Republican, left, or right. We all have to be constitutional  patriots in America, to stand up for our Constitution.    I would invite the President of the United States to come join us  here to talk about the problem of eminent domain abuse and to talk  about the problem of law enforcement taking people's property and their  money without due process of law, because it is a serious threat to  everything that we believe in and why we created our social contract.  All of us have got to be constitutional patriots and stand up for the  basic principles of the country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
