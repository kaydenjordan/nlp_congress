 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment 96 that  is included in the en bloc amendment.   My amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to study how the  Department of Defense can attract and recruit students from higher  education institutions with backgrounds in science, technology,  engineering, mathematics, artificial intelligence, machine learning,  and cybersecurity.   To make sure we draw from the best and brightest of our country, this  study would consist of students from all higher education institutions,  including but not limited to Hispanic serving institutions,  Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Asian American and  Native American Pacific Islander serving institutions.   World war III is currently taking place in cyberspace, and that is  why it is important that we find our young men and women, the best and  brightest we have, to fight this battle.   Additionally, with China racing to dominate the artificial  intelligence space, we must find suitable individuals to keep up with  China's artificial intelligence advancements and massive investments in  this area.   My amendment would ensure that our Nation has the information it  needs to recruit our brightest and best.    Mr. Speaker, I take a few moments today to honor one of  my constituents, Coach Scott Glabb, for his contributions to Orange  County youth.   Mr. Glabb has been an important figure as a teacher and wrestling  coach at Santa Ana High School for about 30 years. After wrestling in  college for Eastern Washington University, Coach Glabb came to Santa  Ana High School in 1990, where he became a teacher and a head coach.   Mr. Glabb's dedication led Santa Ana High School to 26 straight CIF  championship league titles. Coach Glabb also coached two individual  national high school champs: Tony Perez in 1998 and Jose Leon in 1999.  With the girls, he was equally successful. He had two female wrestling  State champs: Lizette Tenorio in 2009 and Berenice Blanco in 2012.   Mr. Glabb was more than a coach and a teacher. He was a role model  for a lot of kids that didn't have a chance to make it out of their  neighborhoods.   Thank you, Coach Glabb. We wish you success in your retirement.                            ____________________
