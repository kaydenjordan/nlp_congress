 Mr. Speaker, my home State of New York has become the  epicenter of this terrible pandemic. This bill brings financial support  to increase the number of hospital beds and equip our brave doctors,  nurses, EMTs, and other medical providers who are our front line of  defense and should not be asked to risk their lives to save others.  [[Page H1843]]    This crisis will pass and our economy will recover, but American  families and workers who lost their jobs by the millions, through no  fault of their own, desperately need this financial support now. This  bill provides important grants and loans to small businesses which will  be critical to our economic recovery.   There is more for us to do, but this bill is an important first step  to secure American families and workers.
