Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H8473]]  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 4334, the Dignity in Aging Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4334, the Dignity in  Aging Act of 2019. I introduced this bipartisan bill to reauthorize and  update the Older Americans Act, or OAA, which was first passed in 1965  as part of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society initiative.   For more than 50 years, OAA programs have helped older Americans  maintain their independence and their dignity.   Today, the Older Americans Act serves about 11 million individuals  each year, with 3 million of those Americans relying regularly on OAA  programs to meet their basic needs. Unfortunately, funding for the  Older Americans Act lags far behind the increasing demand for its  services.   Although the population of Americans over age 60 has grown more than  60 percent since 2001, OAA funding has only grown by about 20 percent.  Adjusting for inflation, this means that OAA funding has declined by  about 16 percent.   That erosion of funding exacerbates the vast unmet need in my home  State of Oregon and across the country. It means that every day in our  communities there are seniors who do not have the care they need and  deserve.   I have heard and read too many stories about seniors rationing  medication or saving portions of their meal so they can stretch their  resources just a bit further into the week. I will never forget the  story I heard of an 80-year-old woman in Oregon who was living in her  car. She did not know where to turn for help.   Far too many Americans continue to face poverty, discrimination, and  barriers to basic necessities. This is, in part, because OAA programs  are underfunded and not fully supported.   According a 2015 GAO report, OAA services do not reach 83 percent of  the low-income, older Americans who experience food insecurity. That is  more than four out of every five seniors in need.   Today, we recommit to investing in OAA programs because we have an  obligation, a moral obligation, to take care of those who cared for us.   The Dignity in Aging Act authorizes record levels of funding for OAA  programs, which will help expand access to food assistance,  transportation, and other basic services that the growing population of  seniors needs to live independently.   Under this bill, all OAA programs are eligible to receive an  immediate 7 percent increase in funding and a 6 percent increase each  year thereafter. This will result in a more than 35 percent total  increase in program funding over the 5-year reauthorization program,  restoring OAA funding to prerecession baseline.   This is a good investment because OAA programs help seniors stay in  their homes and out of costly facilities.   The bill also recognizes the need to support family caregivers and  direct-care workers. It extends the RAISE Family Caregivers Act, which  helps develop a national strategy to recognize and support those caring  for their loved ones. My 91-year-old mother has Alzheimer's, so I know  how important caregivers are.   H.R. 4334 strengthens our focus on combating social isolation, which  greatly increases the risk of stroke, heart disease, dementia, and  premature death. It does so by incorporating social isolation screening  into the health and supportive services that seniors receive and by  empowering local organizations to evaluate solutions for social  isolation.   The Dignity in Aging Act also establishes a National Research,  Demonstration, and Evaluation Center for the Aging Network. This center  will be responsible for conducting, promoting, and coordinating  research, including evaluation and demonstration projects and related  technical assistance through the act. The center will increase the  repository of information on evidence-based programs and interventions  available to the Aging Network.   The bill improves economic opportunity and engagement for older  Americans. It includes individuals who are justice-involved as a  priority population for the Senior Community Service Employment  Program.   The bill also encourages the inclusion of arts education and cultural  experiences, among other supportive services, and further allows for  demonstration funds to be used for multigenerational collaboration  projects that provide opportunities for older individuals to  participate in multigenerational activities and civic engagement  activities.   Finally, this bipartisan legislation seeks to improve services for  historically underserved and marginalized individuals, including Native  Americans, Holocaust survivors, and LGBT seniors. For example, it will  create a National Technical Assistance Center dedicated to expanding  the Aging Network's capacity to deliver person-centered, trauma- informed services that meet the needs of aging trauma survivors.   The bill codifies the National Resource Center on Women and  Retirement to recognize the ongoing importance of their work, and it  improves data collection and outreach for all resource centers that  focus on populations needing additional or unique services.   This bill provides a rare bipartisan opportunity to help millions of  older Americans across the country spend less of their limited income  on costly care and, just as importantly, empowers every individual to  age with dignity.   I would like to thank Education and Labor Committee Chairman  Bobby  Scott and Ranking Member Virginia Foxx, as well as my coleads on the  bill--Representative Elise Stefanik; Subcommittee Ranking Member  Representative   James Comer; and Representatives Susie Lee, Susan  Wild, and Dusty Johnson--for working together to bring this bipartisan  bill to the floor.   I also want to thank the hardworking staff, especially Carrie Hughes  and Ali Hard from the committee; my personal office staff: Jack  Arriaga, Allison Smith, and Rachael Bornstein; and the staff on both  sides of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this  legislation so we can better care for those who have cared for us, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), chairman of the Education and Labor Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Underwood), a member of the Education and Labor  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Miss Rice) who, along with Representative Stefanik, were lead  sponsors of the Younger Onset Alzheimer's Act, which was included in  this legislation.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  4334, the Dignity in Aging Act of 2019, which includes key provisions  from our bill, the Younger Onset Alzheimer's Act.   This critical legislation will amend the Older Americans Act to  ensure that the hundreds of thousands of Americans living with younger- onset Alzheimer's disease receive the care and support that they  desperately need and deserve.   The Older Americans Act was originally enacted in 1965 and supports a  range of home and community-based programs for Americans age 60 and  older. These programs include nutritional services like Meals on  Wheels, in-home and adult daycare, transportation services, legal aid,  elder abuse prevention, and vital assistance and support for family  caregivers. These programs have become absolutely essential to people  living with Alzheimer's disease and their families.   However, today 5 percent of Americans living with Alzheimer's  disease, approximately 250,000 people, are living with younger-onset  Alzheimer's, a disease that has a particularly devastating effect on  families, with diagnoses coming in individual's thirties, forties, or  fifties, when they still have young children, new homes and growing  careers. They are in the prime of their lives, and they don't always  have the financial stability to leave the workforce, which is usually  inevitable.   And because of their young age, they are currently ineligible for all  OAA-funded programs. Virtually overnight, these families face  unimaginable and unforeseen financial and emotional strain; and yet  they are denied access to critical OAA programs, programs that we know  work, and that so many people with Alzheimer's rely on every day.   By including major provisions from our bill, the Dignity in Aging Act  will ensure that younger Alzheimer's patients and their families have  access to critical programs and support.   Before I conclude, Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment to  acknowledge two of my constituents who helped bring this issue to my  attention, Karen Henley and Connie Wasserman.   Karen lost her husband, Mike, to younger-onset Alzheimer's in 2012.  He was diagnosed at the age of 36 and passed away at 47.   Karen, Mike, and their two children, Brandon and Courtney,  experienced firsthand how challenging it is for people with this  disease to find affordable and quality care.   Connie Wasserman is the Associate Executive Director of Social  Services of the Sid Jacobson JCC in East Hills, New York. For years,  she has played a crucial role in supporting people and families living  with younger-onset Alzheimer's right on Long Island, families like the  Henleys, who had nowhere to go.   But because the government does not fund Alzheimer's programs for  people under the age of 60, Connie has had to start her own. And right  now, she relies almost entirely on private funding.   Connie and Karen have become tireless advocates for those living with  younger-onset Alzheimer's, and they worked closely with my office on  this bill.   As fate should have it, today is Karen and Mike Henley's wedding  anniversary and, in honor of them, I ask all of my colleagues to  support the Dignity in Aging Act of 2019.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild), a member of the Education and Labor Committee  and a passionate advocate for suicide prevention.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I include in the Record letters of support from AARP supporting H.R.  4334, a letter from the Jewish Federation of North America supporting  H.R. 4334, a letter from the Alzheimer's Association and the  Alzheimer's Impact Movement supporting the legislation, a letter from  72 national organizations representing older adults and caregivers  across the country, and a letter from Meals on Wheels supporting H.R.  4334 and its attention to the impacts of social isolation.                                                            AARP,                                                   October 25, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our nearly 38 million       members and all older Americans nationwide, AARP is pleased       to support H.R. 4334, the bipartisan Dignity in Aging Act of       2019, legislation to reauthorize the Older Americans Act       (OAA). We urge you to pass this legislation that will       maintain the critical service and information roles of OAA       programs and promote greater responsiveness to the needs of       older Americans.        Too often, advancing age and increasing frailty threaten       the ability of older Americans to live independently in their       own homes and communities. The fear of having to leave family       behind and enter a nursing home weighs heavily on the minds       of many. According to AARP's Home and Community Preferences       Survey, the vast majority of adults age 50-plus--more than       three out of four people--want to remain in their community       as long as possible. Giving Americans the support they need       to live at home with independence and dignity has always been       a bedrock goal of OAA, and it has been remarkably successful.        For many older Americans, the key to being able to stay in       their own homes is the dedication and commitment of family       caregivers. An estimated 40 million family caregivers provide       a staggering $470 billion annually in unpaid care to their       loved ones--ranging from bathing and dressing to paying bills       and transportation and assisting with medical/nursing tasks.       By supporting family caregivers, we can help people stay at       home, helping to delay or prevent more costly nursing home       care and unnecessary hospitalizations. Therefore, we are       pleased the Dignity in Aging Act addresses AARP's family       caregiving priorities, including further strengthening the       National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP) and       extending the bipartisan Recognize, Assist, Include, Support,       and Engage (RAISE) Family Caregivers Act (P.L. 115-119).        Specifically, the legislation includes H.R. 3782, the       bipartisan Supporting Family Caregivers Act sponsored by       Representatives Andy Levin and Elise Stefanik. This provision       will help make sure that more caregivers can get their needs       assessed when they turn to NFCSP for support. Understanding       the family caregiving situation is a critical step in the       process for linking the family caregiver to the most       appropriate support services, as every family's needs are       unique. Assessments of the caregiving situation provide       information to help target services more effectively. Better       targeting of support services can also help maintain the       health and well-being of the caregiver, sustain their ability       to provide care, produce better outcomes for their loved       ones, and prevent or delay nursing home placement. H.R. 4334       also provides more time for implementation of the RAISE       Family Caregivers Act. This will allow the Advisory Council       to do its work and find additional meaningful solutions to       better support the 40 million family caregivers nationwide.        Importantly, H.R. 4334 also provides increased funding       levels for OAA programs. People age 80 and older are among       the most likely to need assistance to live independently in       their homes and communities. The population of Americans in       this age group is projected to increase by 54 percent from       2019 to 2030. Additionally, over the next decade, the number       of family caregivers is not expected to keep up with the       large number of  [[Page H8477]]       older adults needing care, underscoring the need for greater       investments in OAA programs. Increased funding levels will       assist more older Americans and caregivers, thus helping more       older adults remain at home and in better health, avoiding       costlier services.        We urge you to vote for the Dignity in Aging Act. Prompt       reauthorization of this law will help ensure the       sustainability of OAA programs, and as a result, our loved       ones can continue to turn to these vital services for their       health and economic security as they age. If you have any       questions, feel free to contact me.            Sincerely,                                                   Bill Sweeney,                                              Senior Vice President,      Government Affairs.                                   ____                                           The Jewish Federations of                                                   North America,                                   Washington, DC, October 25, 2019.

JFNA represents 146 local       Jewish Federations, 300 Network communities, and thousands of       affiliated social service agencies across the continent. Our       movement protects and enhances the well-being of Jews       worldwide through the values of tikkun olam (repairing the       world), tzedakah (charity and social justice) and torah       (Jewish learning). Jewish social services provide support for       more than one million vulnerable individuals each year,       Jewish and non-Jewish alike, with our clients spanning the       age range and including approximately 100,000 older adults.        For more than 50 years, the Older Americans Act (OAA) has       been essential in developing, coordinating, and delivering       home and community-based services that help older adults age       with independence and dignity in their homes and communities.       Without these crucial services, many individuals served by       OAA-funded programs in our network are at significant risk of       hunger, isolation, and losing their ability to live with       health and independence.        The Jewish community is disproportionately older than the       general population in this country with more than 25% of       American Jews already over the age of 65, and the fastest       growing demographic in the Jewish community is those over the       age of 85. Jewish family service agencies, Jewish vocational       service agencies and Jewish community centers are a key       component of the country's Aging Services Network and, in a       classic public-private partnership, provide many services       funded through the OAA, including case management,       transportation, congregate and home-delivered meals, adult       day care, elder abuse prevention and intervention, family       caregiver support, home care, legal conservatorship, and       support groups.        This year's reauthorization process produced a bill that,       if passed by the full House of Representatives on Monday,       will significantly move the ball forward in how our country       and its Aging Services Network treat and care for seniors.       The very first provision of the Dignity in Aging Act       incorporates ``person-centered, trauma-informed care'' as a       new objective of the Older Americans Act. This principle,       which is subsequently defined in the bill, represents a new       trend in service delivery that will positively impact both       clients and agencies. It incorporates a holistic approach to       service provision that promotes the dignity, strength, and       empowerment of trauma victims by referencing knowledge about       the role of trauma in trauma victims' lives. The inclusion of       the PCTI approach in this bill is indicative of the forward       and necessary progress embedded in the Dignity in Aging Act.        The Dignity in Aging Act authorizes a technical assistance       center to serve older adults experiencing the long-term and       adverse consequences of trauma, including but not-limited to       Holocaust survivors. Holocaust survivors are also       specifically mentioned for the first time within the Older       Americans Act in the context of providing additional outreach       to older individuals ``including Holocaust survivors'' who       are at risk of institutional placement. The bill also       emphasizes cultural considerations (including religious and       ethnic requirements) in the provision of congregate and home-      delivered meals.        This Older American Act reauthorization incorporates new       support for age-friendly communities, a major new focus on       social isolation in older adults, recognition of the       emergency confronting our direct care workforce, an updating       of, recognition and support for multigenerational families,       and assistance to family caregivers with an extension of the       RAISE Family Caregivers Act. Each of these provisions and       many others contained in the bill will serve our nation well.       JFNA also commends the Education and Labor Committee for       supporting a five year reauthorization period for the Older       Americans Act, which helps safeguard support and removes       uncertainty for the growing aging population.        Finally, and very importantly, this bill provides       relatively robust funding increases of 7% for FY 2020 and 6%       for each of the next four years.        While the Older American Act formally expired on September       30, 2019, this year's process to reauthorize it was the most       efficient, transparent, bipartisan and productive of the five       similar reauthorizations that I have worked on going back to       1999. The result is a reauthorization vehicle that is very       worthy of support, and JFNA looks forward to the House of       Representatives passage of the Dignity in Aging Act and the       enactment of the reauthorization.            Sincerely,                                               Stephan O. Kline,                Associate Vice President, Public Policy, The Jewish       Federations of North America.                                   ____                                      Alzheimer's Impact Movement,                                                   October 25, 2019.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Chairman, House Education and Labor Committee, Washington DC.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Ranking Member, House Education and Labor Committee,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Scott and Ranking Member Foxx: On behalf of       the Alzheimer's Association and the Alzheimer's Impact       Movement (AIM), including our nationwide network of       advocates, thank you for your continued leadership on issues       and legislation important to Americans living with       Alzheimer's and other dementias and to their caregivers. In       addition, thank you for working together in a bipartisan       manner to reauthorize the Older Americans Act (OAA). We are       proud to support the Dignity in Aging Act of 2019 (H.R. 4334)       and are pleased to highlight several provisions that are       critical to persons living with dementia, their families and       their caregivers.        We strongly support the inclusion of language codifying       existing authority to provide services to individuals living       with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease under the National       Family Caregiver Support Program and the Long-Term Care       Ombudsman Program. We are very appreciative for the       Committee's inclusion of parts of the Younger-Onset       Alzheimer's Disease Act (S. 901/H.R. 1903).        There are approximately 5.8 million Americans living with       Alzheimer's disease. The vast majority of those individuals       are over the age of 65; however, approximately 200,000       Americans are under the age of 65 living with younger-onset       Alzheimer's disease. Individuals living with younger-onset       face unique challenges when it comes to family, work, and       finances. They may be parenting young children at home, or       may still be working as the primary income provider for their       families. Due to their young age, they may have more trouble       receiving an accurate diagnosis, and even family and friends       might question their diagnosis. The stigma associated with       younger-onset Alzheimer's can have a significant impact on       their well-being and quality of life.        Since 97 percent of all people living with Alzheimer's are       age 65 or older, current Alzheimer's support infrastructure       focuses exclusively on seniors. As a result, few supportive       services are available to those with younger-onset. With       other diseases--like heart disease, diabetes, and even       cancer--many people living with them are middle-aged and       there is a large support structure available to them. Those       same support structures are not available for the individuals       living with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease. The services       provided under the OAA are particularly helpful for       individuals with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease and       related dementias who need assistance with activities of       daily living.        The Younger-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Act is consistent       with the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The       Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services,       which is responsible for updating and implementing the Plan,       has noted that persons living with younger-onset Alzheimer's       face unique challenges in accessing care. In the 2017       National Plan, the Advisory Council recommended that Congress       amend the OAA to allow additional services to be provided to       younger adults living with dementia.        The Alzheimer's Association and AIM also deeply appreciate       the Committee's extension of the RAISE Family Caregivers Act       from 3 to 4 years. We have been strong advocates for the       RAISE Family Caregivers Act since it was introduced in       Congress. There has been a delay in the implementation of the       Act and the decision to extend the authorization allows the       Department of Health and Human Services to better develop a       national strategy for education and training, longterm       services and supports, and financial stability and security       for caregivers.        For millions of Americans caring for individuals with       Alzheimer's and other dementias the emotional, physical, and       financial costs can be overwhelming. Caregivers of people       with dementia report higher levels of stress, depression, and       worse health outcomes than those providing care to       individuals without dementia. As a result, Alzheimer's       caregivers incurred $11.8 billion in  [[Page H8478]]       additional health costs last year. We appreciate the       Committee prioritizing this important program.        We also applaud the Committee's strengthening of Caregiver       Assessments. In 2018, more than 16 million unpaid caregivers       provided 18.5 billion hours of care valued at nearly $234       billion and face the challenges noted above. Eighty-three       percent of the help provided to older adults in the United       States comes from family members, friends, or other unpaid       caregivers. Nearly half of all caregivers who provide help to       older adults do so for someone living with Alzheimer's or       another dementia. Alzheimer's takes a devastating toll on       caregivers. Compared with caregivers of people without       dementia, twice as many caregivers of those with dementia       indicate substantial emotional, financial, and physical       difficulties. Of the total lifetime cost of caring for       someone with dementia, 70 percent is borne by families--      either through out-of-pocket health and longterm care       expenses or from the value of unpaid care.        These dedicated caregivers would greatly benefit from       increased resources, training and support to help them       navigate the strain of caregiving and improve their health       and quality of life. The proposed changes would provide these       caregivers much-needed resources, increase the use of       caregiver assessments, and identify best practices relating       to the programs. These important actions will enhance support       for caregivers through skills building, increased resources       and information, respite care, counseling, and other helpful       benefits.        Finally, the Alzheimer's Association and AIM appreciate       your commitment to supporting individuals facing social       isolation. Social isolation is an issue within the aging       community as a whole, and particularly in the Alzheimer's and       related dementias community. Studies have found that support       groups can decrease social isolation and increase social       support, the ability to accept the diagnosis, cope with       symptoms, improve quality of life, and enhance family       communication. (Alzheimer's Association Dementia Care       Practice Recommendations, 2018). Support programs offered       through the National Family Caregiver Support Program can       work to decrease social isolation. We appreciate the bill's       inclusion of an advisory council dedicated to identifying the       challenges, solutions, and best practices to address social       isolation.        Again, thank you for your leadership in ensuring OAA's       reauthorization, which will improve the quality of care for       people living with Alzheimer's.            Sincerely,      Robert Egge,        Chief Public Policy Officer, Executive Vice President,       Government Affairs, Alzheimer's Association.                                   ____                                                   October 28, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi, Speaker,      Hon. Kevin McCarthy, Minority Leader,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Bobby Scott, Chairman,      Hon. Virginia Foxx, Ranking Member,      Committee on Education and Labor, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, Chairman Scott and       Ranking Member Foxx: On behalf of the undersigned 72 national       organizations with a vested interest in the well-being of       America's older adults and caregivers, we write to you today       in support of the House-proposed Dignity in Aging Act (H.R.       4334) to reauthorize the Older Americans Act (OAA). We urge       Members of the House to support this important five-year OAA       reauthorization. Reauthorization of this critical Act, which       expired on September 30, will ensure the sustainability of       vital OAA programs, as well as the health, dignity, and       independence of older Americans and their caregivers.        The OAA is essential to developing, coordinating, and       delivering home and community-based services that help older       adults age with independence and dignity. Many individuals       served by OAA-funded programs are at significant risk of       hunger, isolation, abuse, and losing their ability to live       with health and independence. OAA-supported programs are       provided to more than 11 million seniors and their caregivers       annually. These vital supports include, but are not limited       to, home-delivered and congregate nutrition services, in-home       supportive services, multipurpose senior centers,       transportation, caregiver support, disease prevention and       health promotion, community service employment, the long-term       care ombudsman program, and services to prevent the abuse,       neglect, and exploitation of older adults.        By keeping seniors healthy and in their communities for       more than 50 years, OAA programs have delayed or prevented       the need for more expensive institutional care for many older       adults, which is often paid for through Medicare or Medicaid.       OAA services can effectively save taxpayer, state, and       federal dollars. In addition to helping older adults age in       place where they most often want to be, OAA programs have       improved our country's fiscal future and promoted       efficiencies within the health care system by preventing       unnecessary hospital stays, reducing readmission rates,       coordinating care, and managing care transitions.        We appreciate that the Dignity in Aging Act, H.R. 4334       builds upon the early bipartisan Senate draft bill and       incorporates a number of important priorities articulated by       stakeholder organizations. Most importantly, the Dignity in       Aging Act calls for much-needed and necessary investments in       the OAA by increasing funding authorizations over the next       five years--a top priority of the undersigned organizations       and the most critical need of the Aging Services Network       authorized by the OAA.        Other priority areas include research innovation and       demonstrations, Native American services, local planning and       development, supports for those suffering from dementias and       social isolation, legal services, nutrition, in-home       supportive services, disease prevention and health promotion,       multigenerational collaboration, and family caregiver       supports. We appreciate that the House proposal to       reauthorize the OAA has preserved the numerous ways in which       this Act works so well at the federal, state, and local       levels, on behalf of the older adults and caregivers for whom       it is a lifeline to dignity, independence, health, safety,       and economic security.        Thank you for your commitment to this important issue. The       undersigned organizations represent a diverse set of       stakeholders, and we urge Members of the House to swiftly       advance this bill to reauthorize the Older Americans Act.

Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Chairman, Committee on Education & Labor, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education & Labor, House of           Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, Chairman Scott and       Ranking Member Foxx: On behalf of Meals on Wheels America,       the nationwide network of community-based senior nutrition       programs and the individuals they serve, we write to express       our support for H.R. 4334, the Dignity in Aging Act of 2019       and urge swift and bipartisan passage in the House of       Representatives. We commend the efforts of the Education and       Labor Committee for receiving unanimous approval following       the September markup, as well as the leadership of       Subcommittee Chairwoman Bonamici (D-OR) and Ranking Member       Comer (R-KY), and Representatives Stefanik (R-NY), Lee (D-      NV), Wild (D-PA) and Johnson (R-SD) in the introduction of       this legislation.        For over five decades, the OAA has been the primary piece       of federal legislation focused on establishing, coordinating       and  [[Page H8479]]       strengthening community and home-based social and nutrition       services for adults age 60 and older, their families and       their caregivers. OAA services like Meals on Wheels,       transportation, caregiver assistance, senior employment and       training and elder rights protection are just some of the       vital functions the OAA delivers to more than 11 million       seniors annually.        As you and many of your colleagues know firsthand, OAA       services and supports, including the three nutrition programs       authorized under Title III of the Act, help keep our nation's       most vulnerable, isolated and food insecure seniors healthier       and in their own homes and communities longer. This in turn       delays and/or prevents altogether the need for more expensive       institutional care often paid for through Medicare or       Medicaid. OAA programs are not only extremely cost-effective,       but they are longstanding examples of public-private       partnerships that help save taxpayers at the local, state and       federal levels in reduced healthcare expenditures.        We specifically want to recognize the effort undertaken to       increase authorization of appropriations in this legislation.       With nearly half of our membership having a documented       waiting list for nutrition services, the 7% increase in       authorization of funding levels in Fiscal Year 2020--and 6%       in subsequent years for all OAA programs over the five-year       reauthorization period--will significantly improve the senior       nutrition network's ability to address these gaps.        We also applaud the attention to and inclusion of       additional research and innovation established through a new       National Research, Demonstration, and Evaluation Center for       aging services research and development. We already know the       difference that OAA services and supports are making in the       lives of those served each day, and this additional support       will help identify where the greatest needs and opportunities       are to produce substantial savings to Medicare and Medicaid       and support our nation's most at-risk seniors.        Furthermore, we are grateful for the Dignity in Aging Act's       acknowledgement of the components of our network's       comprehensive service model, particularly around the areas of       social isolation and loneliness; in-home safety; screenings       and prevention; and community connections and support. This       network has been addressing the social determinants of health       (SDOH) for seniors long before it was a common definition       used among policymakers, advocates and healthcare entities.       Thanks to the foresight of this body in establishing the OAA       Nutrition Program and its goals and purposes decades ago, the       focus has transcended beyond just the meal to include an       emphasis on socialization, overall health, well-being and       safety.        As with each reauthorization, we have a new opportunity to       evolve the OAA in ways that will help it better meet the       inherent changes in our country's aging population and serve       more of those in need. We are pleased that H.R. 4334, the       Dignity in Aging Act of 2019, helps to address these shifts,       and as such, we urge your support and swift passage in the       House of Representatives. Meals on Wheels America and the       network of senior nutrition programs across the county have       appreciated contributing feedback and policy recommendations       throughout this reauthorization process and look forward to       continuing to work with you to build upon the ongoing       successes of the OAA.        Thank you again for your leadership, public service and       support for our nation's older adults.            Sincerely,                                                   Ellie Hollander,                                                 President and CEO.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I  urge all of my colleagues to support the bipartisan Dignity in Aging  Act of 2019. We know that the OAA programs--Meals on Wheels, community  meal programs, caregiver support, protection against elder abuse--help  older Americans live their lives with dignity.   Once again, I thank Representatives Stefanik, Lee, Comer, Wild, and  Johnson for joining me in leading this effort. Again, I thank Chairman  Scott and Ranking Member Foxx for supporting this legislation as it  moved through the committee process. The bipartisan engagement and the  involvement of many committee members was crucial to achieving this  legislation to successfully address many priorities and incorporate the  input of numerous stakeholders.   I am sincerely grateful for the contributions of all involved, and I  am eager to support the passage of this bill today so we can better  empower every older American to age with dignity.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  [[Page H8515]]    I rise today in support of H.R. 728, the Title VIII Nursing Workforce  Reauthorization Act and to highlight the importance of title VIII  programs, a critical lifeline for America's nursing workforce and the  patients they serve.   Demand for healthcare services provided by nurses continues to grow,  so we must expand and support these programs to maintain a highly  educated nursing workforce. Title VIII programs support more than  61,000 students in almost every State, but there are still significant  nursing shortages in northwest Oregon and across the country.   Title VIII programs increase the nursing pipeline and also create a  culturally diverse workforce to make sure that our increasingly diverse  patient population is cared for by culturally aware providers. Title  VIII programs prepare nurses to serve the most vulnerable communities  and regions, such as rural areas, that are in desperate need of  providers.   Title VIII programs also provide crucial support for our nursing  educators, greater diversity in the nursing workforce, and more  successful careers for nurses who work tirelessly on the front lines of  patient care.   Our nurses are critical to the health and well-being of our  communities. That is why I am honored to serve as a leader on the  Nursing Caucus along with several other cosponsors of this legislation,  Representatives Joyce, Davis, and Gabbard.   I thank them and the Energy and Commerce Committee for their  leadership on this bill. I look forward to our continued bipartisan  effort in advocating for the title VIII Nursing Workforce Development  programs.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this  legislation.
