 Mr. Speaker, look, first of all, this rather outrageous  Republican healthcare bill still will cost 24 million Americans their  healthcare insurance; and if you are lucky enough not to be one of  those 24 million Americans, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget  Office, the head of which was appointed by a Republican, says it will  also increase the cost by 15 or 20 percent for those who are lucky  enough to keep their insurance.  [[Page H2381]]    In addition to that, it has a crushing age tax that forces people  aged 50 to 64 to pay premiums five times higher than what other  Americans pay for health care.   As if that age tax wasn't enough, in this new amendment, which most  of us only saw for the first time at 6:30 this morning, they increased  the Medicare tax for another 5 years by 1 percent, so Americans will  have to pay even more in taxes.   The last manager's amendment, which we just got the information on,  actually would increase the deficit by over $150 billion more than  their original bill, somehow without covering even one additional  American.                                time  0945    So what is going on here?   They are creating a bill that has more taxes with this manager's  amendment, creating a bill that costs the American people more and  reduces the deficit more, and then pawns off the hard decisions to the  States, without giving them enough to maintain the essential benefits  that Americans rely on, like prescription drugs, rehabilitative care,  and mental health services.   They are not giving the States enough money to maintain those. And  then they are saying: But you, States, be the bad guys and you guys  make the cut so we in Washington can pat ourselves on the back and look  good, even while we increase the deficit by more than $150 billion more  than the original healthcare bill that was introduced last week and  even though we maintain the age tax that forces people between the age  of 50 and 64 to pay up to five times more than other Americans.   This is simply the wrong way to go. Sometimes you need to reboot,  restart, get together, look at real ideas that Democrats and  Republicans have put on the table to reduce costs and expand coverage.  That is what this discussion should be about. Yet, to do that, we need  to defeat this rule now and go back to the starting point.
