 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Military  Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill.   Providing robust funding to the VA is a step in the right direction  to ensure our veterans receive the best possible care.   This legislation increases funding to the VA to the highest level  ever. That funding will go towards providing for America's heroes. We  are increasing funding for homeless veterans' services, mental  healthcare, suicide prevention, opioid abuse, traumatic brain injury  research and treatments, and rural health initiatives, just to name a  few.   As the son of an Army family and an Army surgeon, I have seen  firsthand many issues that our veterans face. As chairman of the VA  Subcommittee on Health, I am working to instill real changes at the VA.  This means better care for our men and women who have served our  Nation.   Funding these important initiatives is a crucial part of repaying  those who fought for our freedoms. I urge all of my colleagues to  support this important legislation.                            ____________________
