 Mr. Speaker, by now, you have seen the images of  furloughed public servants lined up at food banks across our beloved  country. This is a sight seen in communities everywhere, including  throughout northern Ohio.   I rise today to call attention to the misery the Trump shutdown is  creating for millions of hardworking Americans who now have to rely on  food assistance to get by: working people who have to be degraded in  this way.   Federal workers, who rely on SNAP food assistance through the U.S.  Department of Agriculture, face daily uncertainty from the Trump  shutdown. The early distribution of benefits received last week  represents the February SNAP allocation, a sum that they will be asked  to stretch to a date not yet determined.   Mr. Speaker, this is unacceptable. President Trump should immediately  act to protect SNAP benefits, reopen the Federal Government, and bring  Federal workers back to work with paychecks they have earned.   If you are a furloughed Federal worker and face hunger issues, please  do not hesitate to reach out to your local food bank. You can locate  your local food bank through ``Feeding America'' to plan for the  uncertain.                            ____________________
