 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Johnson for yielding and for  holding this Special Order this evening.   Thanks to the success of Operation Warp Speed, we have been able to  get millions of Americans vaccinated.   Georgia has led the Nation in COVID-19 economic recovery, and I am  proud to say that Georgia's economy has reached prepandemic levels.   Now that the CDC has rolled back mask recommendations, we are finally  seeing a light at the end of the tunnel.   But there is a lot of work to be done to get this great American  economy, the greatest economy in the world, growing again.  Unfortunately, the Biden administration is asleep at the wheel when it  comes to what needs to be done to spur economic growth.   As of March, U.S. job-makers reported 8.1 million available jobs, a  record high. But I am hearing from small businesses that they can't get  their employees to go back to work. That is because President Biden and  congressional Democrats are paying people more money to stay home than  to go to work.   I am grateful that, starting next month, our Governor, Governor Kemp,  is ending the extra $300 in Federal weekly jobless payments. It is time  for all States to opt out of this Federal job supplement and quit  wasting taxpayers' money.   Let's get Americans back to work and focus on rebuilding our economy.
