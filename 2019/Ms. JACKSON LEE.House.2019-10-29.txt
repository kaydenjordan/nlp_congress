 Mr. Speaker, yesterday evening, I joined Ambassador  Etienne at the French Embassy to acknowledge the DC JazzFest. But I  also was there, more importantly, to pay tribute to the Honorable John  Conyers.   Yesterday, I took a minute on the floor to indicate that I would be  speaking about him over a period of days and weeks because his 53 years  as a mentor and beloved colleague deserve that tribute. But yesterday,  I was probably at a place John Conyers enjoyed the most. Many people  may not know that he was a jazz enthusiast and maybe prepared to become  a jazz musician in his early years as a young, young man. His father, a  strong union organizer, a UAW worker, thought that might not be the  best approach for his young son, I believe the oldest of their four  children.   John, being a dutiful son, went on to Wayne State and graduated from  its law school as well. That was our gift to the American people.   I want to take a moment to be able to highlight the very undercore,  if you will, the underpinnings of the leadership of John Conyers, a  progressive before the term could even be defined.   I don't believe that he looked at himself in that way, but I think he  looked at himself as one who would break through doors that others  could not.   Of course, he was one of the original cofounders of the Congressional  Black Caucus. But he rose to be chairman of two committees, the  Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Committee on the Judiciary,  and he became the dean of this House, this entire House of  Representatives.   I don't think that would be what his own desire of tribute would be.  I use the terminology that he not only spoke for the voiceless, but he  spoke for persons who were actually silenced. That means that they  tried to speak, but they were silenced. They were rejected. They were  pushed back. They had not the power to be heard.   How amazing it is to have found someone of the African American  heritage and tradition who had gone through life in a segregated  America to be able to speak for voices that were varied and different,  who needed to hear that someone cared about them, from Native Americans  to Latinos, to the disabled, to those in the LGBTQ community and  beyond.   He was a champion of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He got into  Congress in 1964. He understood the value of giving people, no matter  who you were, the right to vote. I will talk about that more  extensively in the days to come, but I remember when we sat and  reauthorized that legislation with a Republican President, what a  wonderful experience of coming together around voting as we wrote  legislation that George W. Bush signed enthusiastically, with an  overwhelming vote in the House and an overwhelming vote in the Senate.   We even honored many different people from around the Nation,  including naming it after the Honorable Barbara Jordan and many others  in that timeframe to reinforce the value of voting. John did that in a  bipartisan manner, a lesson that we can learn even today. He never  compromised his principles, but he stood for the idea of bipartisanship  for justice.   He was here for the Legal Services Corporation Act. Can you imagine  that if you were poor 50 years ago, you wouldn't have any  representation, not in the criminal system or sense, but in the civil  system--being evicted, having problems with healthcare and dealing with  your health insurance, or having a matter that required legal  representation so that you could have justice. The Legal Services  Corporation was something very near and dear to John Conyers.    Let me move quickly to talk about his work dealing with the PATRIOT  Act after 9/11. Yes, we wanted to be protecting ourselves against  terrorists, but John Conyers was a voice that said that civil liberties  of the American people are crucial, and we will not trample in this  committee, the Committee on the Judiciary, on their rights of privacy  and their rights of liberty. He believed in that.   Let me also say that in the bankruptcy bill, when so many people were  pushing to get a bill done that would leave out women and children,  divorcees, leave out the poor who also needed to have some way of  organizing their debt, in fact, he was a champion for that.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, a champion for the reparations bill that most  people don't understand, an idea they would understand later, he was  our champion. He spoke for those who were silenced.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and acknowledge  Mr. Schiff and my dear friend, Anna Eshoo, and all of those, Mr.  Pallone, and of all the Members who have stood tall and strong, Mr.  Smith and Mr. Engel, for this very important statement.   Let me, as a member of the Armenian Caucus, indicate that I rise with  a heavy heart, but I rise with an appreciation and an excitement that  we have come to this point.   It is important to acknowledge that as this was occurring, the United  States' record on the Armenian genocide goes back more than a century,  in fact, to July 16, 1915, when Henry Morgenthau, United States  Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1913 to 1916, organized and led  protests by officials of many countries against what he described as  the empire's campaign of race extermination. He was instructed on July  16, 1915, by United States Secretary of State Robert Lansing that the  ``department approves your procedure . . . to stop Armenian  persecution.''   I rise in support of finally having this Nation take this stand.  Bloodshed and genocide should not be tolerated no matter how long we  have come to that. And so I stand with the words that we now,  therefore, will commemorate as the United States of America the  Armenian genocide through official recognition and remembrance. We will  reject efforts to enlist, engage, or otherwise associate the United  States Government with the denial of the Armenian genocide or any other  genocide.    Mr. Speaker, I am reminded of the time both Mr.  Engel, Mr. Smith, and I traveled to the Sudanese Embassy to protest the  genocide in Darfur. We can do no less.   It is not just 10 years ago, it is more than 100 years ago, at least,  that we saw this genocide. There is no embassy that maybe will arrest  us now, but I say to Turkey: It is finally time for you to acknowledge  this genocide. Tragically, you have restarted and reignited the  dastardly acts of genocide against the Kurds.   I am glad today on this day that we are acknowledging that one  genocide can be no worse than another genocide. Silence on one genocide  is silence on all genocides.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to support H. Res. 296 to acknowledge  the Armenian genocide by the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary  and on Homeland Security, and as a sponsor of the legislation, I rise  in strong support of H. Res. 296, a resolution ``Affirminq the United  States Record on the Armenian Genocide,'' and I thank Mr. Schiff, the  gentleman from California and the Chairman of the House Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence, and Mr. Engel, the Chairman of the  House Committee on Foreign Affairs for their collaboration and hard  work in bringing this important legislation to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, the United States record on the Armenian Genocide goes  back more than a century, in fact to July 16, 1915, when Henry  Morgenthau, United States Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1913 to  1916, organized and led protests by officials of many countries against  what he described as the empire's ``campaign of race extermination'',  and was instructed on July 16, 1915, by United States Secretary of  State Robert Lansing that the ``Department approves your procedure . .  . to stop Armenian persecution.''   The United States has a proud history of recognizing and condemning  the Armenian Genocide, the killing of 1.5 million Armenians by the  Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923 and providing relief to the survivors  of the campaign of genocide against Armenians, Greeks, Assyrians,  Chaldeans, Syriacs, Arameans, Maronites, and other Christians.   Mr. Speaker, the Armenian Genocide represents the first genocide of  the 20th Century, where Ottoman Turkish authorities ordered the  systematic annihilation of more than 1.5 million Armenians, and which  Turkey carried out from 1915 to 1923 through massacres, deportations,  and death marches where hundreds of thousands were herded into the  Syrian Desert to die of thirst and starvation.   Sadly, to this day this chapter of history has yet to be admitted by  the Government of Turkey.   Many international observers, including then Ambassador and later  U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, witnessed the nightmare  firsthand and reported detailed accounts of the atrocities to their  governments.   Respected organizations and eminent scholars and historians agree and  recognize the Armenian Genocide, including the Elie Wiesel Foundation  for Humanity and the renowned International Association of Genocide  Scholars.   Their judgments are supported by 53 Nobel laureates who signed an  open letter to the Government of Turkey on April 9, 2007.   Mr. Speaker, the historical record is clear, and the Armenian  Genocide is a tragic fact.   It must be acknowledged and remembered so that it will never be  repeated.   As a member of the Congressional Caucus on Armenian Issues, I know  that the refusal of modern-day Turkey to acknowledge one of the worst  examples of man's inhumanity in the 20th Century haunts survivors of  the Armenian Genocide, as well as their families.   As a Member of Congress, I believe this is not only an affront to the  memory of the victims and to their descendants, but it does a  disservice to the United States as it seeks to stand up for the victims  of violence today.   The issue of recognizing the Armenian genocide and helping the  Armenian people is neither a partisan nor geopolitical Issue.   Rather, it is a question of giving the Armenian people the justice  they deserve.   In doing so, we affirm the dignity of humankind everywhere.   It has been said that ``all it takes for evil to triumph, is for good  men to do nothing.''   This is one of the reasons I am proud to have joined with so many of  my colleagues in cosponsoring the resolution affirming the occurrence  of the Armenian genocide throughout my career in Congress and I will  continue to do for as long as it takes.   In recognizing the Armenian Genocide, we do not seek to persecute any  person or state; we seek to build a path that will lead to  reconciliation between Armenians and Turks.   In doing so, we will remain true to our nation's highest aspirations  for justice and peace.   It was President Lincoln who called upon the ``better angels of our  nature'' when he said in his Second Inaugural Address that all  Americans should ``do all which may achieve and cherish a just and  lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.''   Mr. Speaker, the Armenian Genocide has been officially recognized by  42 states, which have gone on public record rejecting any claim or  assertion that denies the occurrence of one of history's worst crimes  against humanity.   I believe it is time for us to join these nations in that endeavor by  passing H. Res. 296, the ``Affirmation of the United States Record on  the Armenian Genocide Resolution.''   Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence in memory of the millions  of silenced voices and interrupted lives of those Armenians who  perished between 1915 and 1923 in the genocide committed by the Ottoman  Empire.   I urge all Members to join me in voting for this critically important  resolution, H. Res. 296.    Mr. Speaker, I again rise with appreciation for the  chairman of this committee and the ranking member of this committee and  echo the importance of this bipartisan resolution.   I would like us to go down memory lane, for those of us who have had  the privilege of being here, including Mr. Engel.   We are reminded of a secular Turkey, a Turkey where all were  welcomed. We remember visiting some of the beautiful and wonderful  treasures of Turkey, as we met with government officials and heard them  reinforce their commitment to democracy, to the idea of freedom of  religion, and that is appropriate for a 70-year member of NATO.   We are very grateful for their commitment to NATO. There are many who  continue to advocate for Turkey's presence in NATO so that NATO could  be comprehensive and unique. But we find ourselves now in the grips of  a single-minded individual who does not see the beauty of democracy,  does not see the beauty of diversity and the welcoming of those from  many places to Turkey, or the orderly process and the strong role they  can play in the Mideast.    Yet, on a midnight call or a late-night call on a Sunday night,  speaking to this administration, the Turkish President didn't consult  or maybe offer options. What we have gleaned from the media is that  they said: We are coming into Syria.   In the midst of them coming into Syria, they created a humanitarian  crisis with fleeing women and children, destroying homes, taking people  away from their homeland, and just doing havoc.   There must be order in the world, respect and dignity, and a respect  for the sanctity of life.   I am glad to rise in support of this legislation, to target Turkey  for sanctions that will not be lifted until Turkey withdraws from  northern Syria.   The bill requires concrete strategies from the administration for  combating ISIS and protecting Syrian Kurdish communities and an  analysis of human rights violations committed by Turkish forces, as  well as a refugee program.   It goes with my earlier designation that this is a humanitarian  crisis in response to the needs of the people.  [[Page H8574]]                                     time  1545    This is not an act of war. This is to seek peace. This bill freezes  assets and imposes a mandatory visa ban against senior officials of  Turkey, including the Minister of National Defense, who apparently  would not listen.   Additionally, the PACT Act prohibits all arms transfers that Turkey  could use in Syria--bloodshed against the people, not peace.   Finally, the PACT Act imposed targeted sanctions on Halkbank, a  Turkish bank with ties to President Erdogan.   We would have wished to be around the diplomatic table to resolve the  issues in Syria. We might have been on the verge of doing that. There  was a calmness on the border, the northern border. We had a certain  number of troops.   Great opportunities remained before Turkey, but unwise and unilateral  decisions were made. Part of that was the withdrawing of our Armed  Forces from northern Syria.   But I think it is clear to those of us who do want peace that there  was a way of doing it. These sanctions should send a very strong  message to Syria that we are, one, recognizing the Kurds.    These sanctions should send a strong message to  Syria that, one, we in the United States take seriously the intrusion  of Turkey into the Kurdish area.   It should send a strong message to President Erdogan to recognize  that he cannot bully his way through in the region.   It should also send a strong message to Iran and Russia and to our  ISIS foes that America is serious about peace, but doing it in a manner  that provides as safe a pathway for peace as possible.   I would hope and would have wanted the decision that the President  made on the phone call never to have occurred. It did occur.   Unfortunately, President Erdogan was a partner in this, and we must  make a very strong statement that the United States will not stand for  this kind of bullying and that we will ensure that we will find peace,  but in the right way.   Mr. Speaker, with that, I support H.R. 4695.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary  and on Homeland Security, and as a sponsor of the legislation, I rise  in strong support of H.R. 4695, the ``Protect Against Conflict By  Turkey'' or PACT Act, and I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of  the House Committee on Foreign Affairs for their bipartisan  collaboration and hard work in bringing this important legislation to  the floor.   I strongly support the PACT Act because it holds Turkey accountable  for its brutal invasion of northern Syria and imposes against it tough,  targeted sanctions and highlights the negative consequences of Turkey's  invasion and the President's acquiescence to this act of aggression.   Under the legislation, most of the sanctions will not be lifted until  Turkey withdraws from northern Syria and the bill requires concrete  strategies from the Administration for combatting ISIS, protecting  Syrian Kurdish communities, an analysis of human rights violations  committed by Turkish forces as well as a refugee program designation  for Syrians who partnered with or worked directly for the U.S. in  Syria.   Specifically, the PACT Act freezes assets freezes and imposes a  mandatory visa ban against senior officials of Turkey, including the  Minister of National Defense, the Chief of General Staff of Turkish  military, the Commander of Turkish 2nd Army, which has led the Syrian  incursion; the Minister of Treasury and Finance, who by the way is  Turkey President Erdogan's son-in-law); and additional senior Turkish  defense officials involved in the invasion of Syria and anyone  committing human rights abuses.   Additionally, the PACT Act prohibits all arms transfers that Turkey  could use in Syria and makes unavailable the use of the emergency  provision of Arms Export Control Act (AECA) that the President might  otherwise have used to get around congressional holds on arms sales to  Turkey.   Finally, the PACT Act imposed targeted sanctions on Halkbank, a  Turkish bank with ties to President Erdogan, and additional Turkish  banks facilitating transactions for the Turkish military's operations  in Syria.   Mr. Speaker, I have devoted my congressional career working to  advance initiatives that will bring peace to troubled regions of the  globe.   For example, I strongly supported the two-state solution to bring  peace between Palestinians and Israelis.   Similarly, I worked with my colleagues and the executive branch to  end the genocide and bloodshed in Darfur and for peace, stability, and  reconciliation in Afghanistan.   About this time two years ago, I had just returned from important  meetings in the Middle East where I was part of an eight-member  congressional delegation to the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.   Mr. Speaker, the unwise and unilateral decision to withdraw U.S.  armed forces from Northern Syria and abandon the Kurds, perhaps our  most indispensable ally in the region is a mistake of incalculable  damage.   Instead of furthering United States interests, the decision to  withdraw American troops from Northern Syria undermines them and  emboldens Russia, Iran, Syria, and ISIS, all implacable foes of the  United States.   At the same time the decision squanders the progress made to date by  the United States, working with the Kurds, to defeat ISIS and destroy  its caliphate and props up the bloody Assad regime in Syria and puts at  risk thousands of innocent men, women, and children.   Mr. Speaker, the President's decision weakens the United States  because trusted allies will no longer rely upon the commitment of our  country to defend freedom or keep its word, and worst of all, it  consigns the Kurds, our devoted and dedicated friends, to certain death  and carnage at the hands of the Turkish military under the leadership  of autocrat President Recep Erdogan.   I urge the President, as Commander-in-Chief, to reinstate and resume  the tried and true practice of orderly and systematic consultation with  national security professionals, specifically the Secretary of State,  the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  the intelligence community, our key allies and foreign policy experts.   For nearly 75 years, since the end of World War II, the United States  has been the indispensable nation in the world and because of the  leadership asserted by the United States, international peace has been  preserved and global conflagration avoided.   This task has never been easy or inexpensive, except when compared to  the alternative of violence, bloodshed, and chaos.   President Kennedy recognized this and observed in his 1961 Inaugural  Address that ``In the long history of the world, only a few generations  have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum  danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility--I welcome it.''   I urge all Members to join me in voting for this critically important  bipartisan legislation, vote to pass the PACT Act.    Madam Speaker, the State of Texas has a large number  of Active-Duty men and women and veterans. I rise today to salute  Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, who appeared in uniform today to  the United States Congress to tell the truth.   Unfortunately, there were those who wanted to analyze Lieutenant  Colonel Vindman's early beginnings. As a 3-year-old, he came from  another country. But I think it is important to say what he is: a  patriot.   I read his testimony. It was straightforward, detailed. It certainly  was without exaggeration. You could clearly see that this man cared  about his Nation.   We should respect the men and women of the United States military,  particularly a Purple Heart recipient, a wounded warrior who fought for  his country and was wounded.   I thank him for coming forward as a patriot, as a man in the United  States military, as one who has no issue with any person. He simply  wants to tell the truth.   Since we need just a little bit of expression here today, I conclude  my remarks by saying: Go Astros. I wish them well. That is what America  is about.                            ____________________
