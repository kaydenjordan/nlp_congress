 Mr. President, I am coming to the floor today to offer a  very straightforward, commonsense amendment that is noncontroversial,  that has met all of the requirements set out by the Democratic  leadership--by the majority leader--by the chair of the conference, and  by the ranking member of the conference to be accepted. This is  language that must accompany the research dollars that are part of the  CHIPS+ legislation that we are considering right now.   When you add it all up, when you add up CHIPS and the CHIPS+  language, which includes research dollars to NSF, NIH, Department of  Energy, and so on, we are talking about $200 billion of taxpayer money.   As part of this process, when we passed the underlying bill, USICA,  here  [[Page S3676]]  in the U.S. Senate, we included language that said: You know what, we  ought to protect that language. We ought to protect that research.   It is like we are buying a really expensive new car, and if we don't  protect it, it means we are not buying the insurance that goes with it.  The insurance is needed for a very simple reason: We know that for the  past two decades, that U.S. taxpayer-paid research--just like the  research that we are about to both appropriate and authorize in this  legislation--has been subject to being taken by our adversaries,  particularly China. So that is why we need to protect it.   We worked painstakingly over the last 4 years on a bipartisan basis  to come up with this legislation. Again, it has been fully vetted.   There was discussion a moment ago about the four corners. What does  that mean? That means that the chair and ranking members of the  committees of jurisdiction--the four corners--are asked to approve  anything that goes into this legislation.    Well, everything I am going to talk about today is approved by the  four corners.   By the way, everything that is in the underlying legislation--some of  the plus in the CHIPS+ Act--has not gone through the four corners  process. This has.   To my colleagues who say: Well, if we put this amendment in, how  about these other amendments? Look, I have five or six things in the  USICA bill I would love to have be part of this final agreement. I have  wonderful trade legislation that should be part of this. It is not.  That is with Senator Brown, by the way. I have wonderful legislation  that deals with worker retraining that is absolutely related to  competitiveness. That is with Senator Kaine. It should absolutely be  part of this final agreement. It is not. I get that. There are a lot of  things that had to be left out when this conference did not succeed,  even though I, like others, worked very hard to get that conference to  come to agreement--not just in my areas. I am the ranking member on the  Homeland Security Committee. We cleared all of ours but also worked  with other committees and other Members, Republican and Democrat alike.   But I said from the start that we have to have this research security  language in place if we are going to put out billions of dollars of new  taxpayer dollars in terms of research; otherwise, it is irresponsible.   So the amendment I am offering today is a skinnied-down version of  what passed in USICA already. It is a skinnied-down version of what I  was proposing because some people thought there were some concerns in  the House--actually among Republicans, interestingly--about some of  these aspects, so we have just taken those out. We have made this  totally noncontroversial. Four corners. Fits like a glove with what we  are talking about, which is the new research dollars. That is what this  is all about.   It should not be surprising that there is a lot of bipartisan support  for this. There has been from the start. Why? Because everybody knows  this is a grave threat to our national security if we do not protect  American research.   The Director of the FBI, Christopher Wray, recently warned:         The greatest long-term threat to our nation's information       and intellectual property, and to our economic vitality, is       the counterintelligence and economic espionage threat from       China. It's a threat to our economic security--and by       extension, to our national security.    He characterized China as the largest threat to ``our ideas, our  innovation, and our economic security.'' He noted that the FBI now has  over 2,000 open cases focused on China, with a new case being opened  approximately every 12 hours. This is reality. This is what is  happening right now.   After our bipartisan investigation, we had a hearing. The FBI showed  up, and we said: Do you know what? We have learned in our investigation  the shocking news that for two decades China has been systematically  targeting the best American researchers and the best American research  to be able to take that research, leapfrog us, and it has helped to  create an ascended China--the rise of their military and their economic  progress--by taking our research, taxpayer-paid.   The FBI, testifying, said: Do you know what? You are right. We have  kind of been asleep at the switch, and we are going to change that. And  they have, and that is why you have seen many, many arrests being made.  But they said to us: We need some legislation. We need a cause of  action that actually fits what is going on here because there is not  one now. We have to come up with other ways, like mail fraud or other-- tax evasion or other ways to bring people to justice. That is what this  legislation does.   We also heard from the State Department, and this was career people  at the State Department, including now in the Biden State Department.  They desperately want new authority to be able to avoid people coming  into our country to steal our technology. They desperately want it, and  that is part of this legislation today.   We found out that China uses these so-called talent recruitment  programs--the most prominent one, you have heard of, probably; it is  the Thousand Talents Plan--to target science and technology sectors  just like the ones we are funding. They target academics, scientists,  engineers, entrepreneurs, and finance experts. The plans provide  monetary benefits and other incentives to lure experts into providing  proprietary information or research to China, in violation of our laws  and conflict of interest rules.   Again, the cases go on and on.   China, in turn, exploits American research, intellectual property,  and open collaboration for their own benefit--again, often U.S.  taxpayer-funded.    In just one of many, many cases, a chemist was sentenced recently by  a Federal judge in Tennessee after being convicted of conspiracy to  commit trade secret theft, possession of stolen trade secrets, economic  espionage, and wire fraud. The chemist received millions of dollars in  Chinese Government grants, including a Thousand Talents Plan award, to  steal American innovation to fund the rise of China's economy.   This is just one of the researchers we have been able to stop. Think  of how many have slipped through the cracks since we have not yet  implemented the grant and visa reforms included in this amendment I am  offering today.   In fact, the Department of Health and Human Services' IG recently  released a report that found that more than two-thirds of the National  Institutes of Health's grant recipients failed to meet the Federal  requirements regarding foreign financial interests, including instances  of U.S. taxpayer-funded researchers failing to disclose ties to the  Chinese Government. That is NIH. We are funding NIH through this--some  of this money is going to go to the NIH. Yet we are not providing the  protection to keep this from happening.   The skinnied-down version of the amendment today goes directly to the  root of the problem. It is the minimum we have to do.   First, the amendment makes it punishable by law to knowingly fail to  disclose foreign funding on Federal grant applications.   Researchers should not be able to lie to grant-making Agencies about  the money they receive from our adversaries. Pretty simple. Who could  be against that?   Second, it allows the State Department to deny visas to foreign  researchers coming to the United States to exploit the openness of our  research enterprise.   Currently, the State Department can deny a visa to a foreign  researcher they know is coming here to steal export-controlled  technology, but what if that technology someone is coming to steal is  not export-controlled? How about artificial intelligence? How about  quantum computing? Well, if you can believe it, in that case, the State  Department's hands are tied even though they know it is happening.   This amendment gives the Biden State Department the authority they  have sought from Congress to deny visas to those seeking to come to the  United States expressly to steal our emerging technology. Sometimes  they are members of the Chinese Communist Party. Sometimes they are  members of the Chinese military. Yet they cannot stop them.   As we know, there are more provisions in the full Safeguarding  American Innovation Act, but again, after talking to my colleagues, I  agreed to  [[Page S3677]]  scale back the amendment. Doing so will ensure our research is  protected and guarantee its passage in the House.   These provisions reached four corners agreement in the conference, as  I said, and include additional changes beyond that made at the request  of everybody who had any objection, including the Congressional Asian  Pacific American Caucus. We solved their issues.   This skinny version of the Securing American Innovation Act is a  significant concession, and I urge my colleagues to respect the fact  that we spent years going through this and, more recently, hours to  deal with everybody's issues to meet them more than halfway.   I will remind many of my colleagues in this Chamber, they voted to  begin consideration of the CHIPS package last week because they  believed this language was in the bipartisan proposal. I know that  because Democrats and Republicans alike have come up to me and said  that. I thought your language was in there, they said. Why wouldn't we  want to protect this research, they said.   One reason they think it is in there is because all Republican  offices, at least, were told that it was in there. In fact, the email  sent right after the vote late on Tuesday afternoon reiterated that  these provisions were included. So the whip that we sent out--the whip  information on what was in this legislation included the Safeguarding  American Innovation Act. That is how we got the necessary Republican  votes.   Now, I support the underlying bill, and I have restrained myself and  shown respect for the process by helping to get us to the point we are  today. But my understanding was that people would work with me to  ensure that we were able, if it was four corners, to be sure that,  again, this insurance on this new car that we are buying would be  there.   It fits like a glove. This is where the legislation must be included.  If not, we find ourselves irresponsibly spending taxpayer dollars that  are not protected. So we are going to invest about 200 to 250 billion  hard-working American-taxpayer dollars in research and innovation.   Again, I support the underlying bill, but we have got to protect that  intellectual property, that taxpayer-funded research, from being stolen  by our competitors and used against us. Without these protections, I  believe this legislative package, with significant levels of Federal  funding, is a giveaway to some of our adversaries, including Beijing.  It is not like there is any secret out there. China has made no secret  of its goal to supplant the United States as the global economic leader  and to do it by getting the best research and the best researchers.   Today, we released a report on how China has also targeted the U.S.  Federal Reserve in addition to our science and innovation. Our economic  policies are in China's crosshairs now, and this body cannot stand idly  by and allow it to continue. We must act, and that means including, at  a minimum, this skinny version of the Safeguarding American Innovation  Act's provisions. Failure to do so will harm our national security and  our economic strength in the face of an ascendant China.   To my colleagues, please do not block this very simple request. We  have done everything right. We have gone through the process of a  bipartisan investigation, of bipartisan hearings, bipartisan  legislation, and four corners agreements--working with everybody to  address their concerns--and this is where this legislation must be.   Again, I have four or five other very important bills in USICA that I  am not asking for today because they don't fit perfectly with this new  research money; but this does, and it has to be there. So I ask  unanimous consent. That is all I need. With unanimous consent, the  Senate can do anything, to include what everybody says they want, what  everybody says is important.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to call up  my amendment No. 5158. I ask further that there be 30 minutes of  debate, equally divided between the two leaders or their designees, and  finally, upon the use or yielding back of that time, that the Senate  vote on the adoption of my amendment with no intervening action or  debate.
