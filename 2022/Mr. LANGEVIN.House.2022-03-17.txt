 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because my constituents, like  all Americans, are paying far too much at the pump. They are angry, and  so am I.   In response to Vladimir Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine,  President Biden rightly imposed crippling sanctions on Russia to  bankrupt Putin's war machine and sever Russia's ties to the global war  economy. That was the right move, and Russia is feeling the punishment  from those sanctions. But, unfortunately, so are the American people.   The American people are willing to do their part in support of  Ukrainians, who are fighting for their survival, fighting for their  independence. But the fact is, we are too dependent on foreign  autocrats for their oil and gas. It leaves us vulnerable to supply  chain constraints and gives tyrants like Putin too much power over our  way of life.   But with transformative investments in clean energy and electric  vehicles, we could take back control, lower energy costs, and protect  our national security.   That is why we need substantial tax credits so that all families can  afford electric vehicles. To power them, we must bolster our clean  energy production from solar wind and other renewable sources.   These investments will shake our reliance on fossil fuels, create  good-paying jobs, and shield us from energy price shocks like we are  feeling right now. We simply have no time to waste.                            ____________________
