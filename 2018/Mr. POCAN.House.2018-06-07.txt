 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the cuts to programs for  working families that House Republicans seek to pass today.   Earlier this year, Congress did something responsible when it  rejected President Trump's budget request to make devastating cuts to  programs on which many Americans rely. Congress came together to make  an investment in American communities and solve some pressing issues  with an agreement by Democrats and Republicans.   However, these cuts today suddenly go back on that agreement, with a  rescissions package that will hurt working families--all because they  are saying that government is spending too much money.   Republicans caused that problem last year when they were grossly  irresponsible and passed the GOP tax scam, a multitrillion-dollar  giveaway to their donors, billionaires, and big corporations that they  falsely sold as middle-class tax relief.   The majority's decision to blow a hole in the deficit and balloon our  Nation's debt did very little to benefit working families, with 83  percent of the benefits going to the top 1 percent.                                time  1500    The Republican rescissions package will hurt the American people and  make $7 billion in cuts to children's health insurance, $800 million in  cuts to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, and $40  million to rural housing programs, just to name a few.   While GOP donors, millionaires, billionaires, big corporations, and  members of Mar-a-Lago still get their gift of tax cuts in the GOP tax  scam, Republicans are committed to taking away what little they gave  hardworking American families. That is apparently the priority of the  majority Republican Party today. With actions like this, they will  likely be the minority party of tomorrow.
