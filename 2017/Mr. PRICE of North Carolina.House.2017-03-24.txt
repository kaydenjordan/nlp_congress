 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  opposition to this misguided and shortsighted pay-more-for-less bill,  also known as TrumpCare.   In all my time in Congress, I have never seen such blatant disregard  for the interests of the American people.   Twenty-four million hardworking Americans will lose their coverage.   TrumpCare will raise premiums, while reducing critical premium  subsidies that millions depend on. Meanwhile, deductibles and out-of- pocket expenses will go up.   Particularly hurt will be the Americans aged 50 to 64 who will have  to pay five times more than others for health coverage, no matter how  healthy they may be themselves.   TrumpCare then goes on to ransack the Medicaid funds that older  Americans rely on for long-term care, and it shortens the life of the  Medicare trust fund by 3 years.   North Carolina consumers in the insurance marketplace, many of them  insured for the first time, would face the second highest healthcare  cost increases in the entire country, an average of over $7,500. Again:  mainly older, poorer North Carolinians. For example, a 64-year-old  resident making $22,000 a year would see a premium spike of over  $14,000. That is over half of his income.   After years of trying to destroy the ACA, is this the best that  Speaker Ryan and President Trump can come up with? Defeat this bill.
