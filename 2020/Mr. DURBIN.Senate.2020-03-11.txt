 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I would like to address the issue which  will be before us at noon on the vote, but, preceding that, I would  like to say a word on a different topic that certainly is on  everybody's mind, and that is the coronavirus.   I was recently notified by my Governor, Governor Pritzker, that we  have run into a shortage in our State of the test kits that are  necessary. Some 330 Illinoisans have been tested to date, and these are  people who, on physician's orders, should be tested because of exposure  to coronavirus or because of the vulnerability of the patient and the  suspicion that they may have been exposed to the virus.   The difficulty that we have run into is that the testing process  apparently is coming to a stop. We are running out of the test kits,  and there has been contact made with the Centers for Disease Control to  determine why we are not getting responses on this need for additional  kits in our State to test people who are truly vulnerable.   I don't believe our situation could be unique. I imagine other States  are facing this same challenge.   I reached out to the Centers for Disease Control within the hour and  had a lengthy conversation about the situation that we are facing.   Originally, the coronavirus test kits faced a shortage of reagents  that were necessary to take the initial test. It turns out they are now  facing a new challenge: It is an issue of the global supply of enzymes  that are used by laboratories to analyze the test results. This is a  commercially available enzyme that is now in short supply, and CDC is  desperately looking for other commercial sources that are reliable that  can come to the rescue.   The testing process, of course, is going to stop if the laboratories  can't take the initial test results and test them to see whether they  are positive or negative. They are looking for alternative ways at the  CDC to meet this need. It is a critically important issue, and the lack  of these enzymes limits the actual tests that can be taken across the  United States.   The source at the CDC told me this situation is not unique to our  country. It is a commercially produced product, and they are looking  for other sources, either within the United States or without, as  quickly as possible. This is a market-driven problem, and the CDC is  looking across the market for sources to solve the problem.   For the time being, there is no relief in sight in Illinois or other  places that have run into this same issue, where people desperately  need to be tested to determine whether they are positive for this  virus, and the testing, even if it takes place, cannot go through the  laboratory approval.   The commercial supplies of this enzyme, apparently, are depleted at  this moment. It is an urgent issue, as I mentioned repeatedly. They are  looking for optional alternative platforms for this laboratory testing.   Now, I would say at this point I don't want to speculate on what that  means. It is far beyond my personal expertise. But it is an indication  of a desperate situation in many places. It is one that we need to  respond to and quickly.   To argue that there are enough test kits that have been distributed  is questionable to start with. But even if distributed and they cannot  be analyzed, it really doesn't give us the information necessary to  protect the Americans who may be vulnerable.   The bottom line is this. This administration is facing a challenge  over test kits that still have many unanswered questions. How did other  countries in the world--Korea and others--come up with test kits early  on in volumes that were necessary to address this problem, and the  United States did not? Why didn't we accept these test kits in other  countries that apparently do come up with results that are needed and  necessary?   I don't know those answers. Only time will provide them to us. But,  in the meantime, we have appropriated all the funds and more asked for  by the Trump administration to deal with this issue, on a bipartisan  basis, and that is exactly what we should continue to do. But we need  start-to-finish straight answers from everyone in the administration  and outside about this public health threat.   Credibility is the first step toward dealing with a public health  challenge such as the one we face today, and this test kit issue is  clearly central to our bringing this situation under control--the  sooner we get straight answers and good information and can respond to  it quickly, the better for our Nation.                                 H.J. Res. 76    Mr. President, in just a few minutes, we will see a vote on the floor  of the U.S. Senate that is fairly unique. There aren't many votes in  this Chamber. This one, actually, is meaningful, because this issue  before us on a vote at noon today relates to student borrowers who went  to colleges--primarily, for-profit colleges and universities--and ended  up attending those schools, going deeply into debt by borrowing money  from the government to go to school, only to learn at a later stage  that they were misled.   The schools didn't tell them the truth. The schools many times told  them that if they took certain courses, there was a job waiting for  them. In some cases they even told how much the jobs paid. They went on  to say that the schools themselves had certain people on the faculty  with certain qualifications, and it turned out that wasn't true. In  addition, many students were told that the hours that they took at  these for-profit schools could be transferred to other schools if they  wanted to complete someplace else. It turns out that wasn't true  either. These students were basically defrauded.   If you can understand the predicament, here is a student customer  sitting at a desk in an office at a for-profit college or university  being asked questions and being given information for the most  important contract they will sign in their early lives. Many of these  students incurred substantial student debt based on the representations  and misrepresentations of these colleges and universities.   They find out now that the schools have gone bankrupt in some cases,  and some schools that didn't go bankrupt ended up providing them with  training and education completely inadequate for them to find a job.  Here is the student deep in debt, having wasted years of their lives in  these for-profit colleges and universities with nowhere to turn. Their  lives are affected by it.   Who wouldn't be? Whether it is $20,000 or $50,000 or $100,000 in  debt, it quickly adds up, and students find themselves literally in  chains because of student debt and because of misrepresentations made  by the schools.   You might say: What is the government going to do about it? We  decided years ago exactly what we should do about it. We put in the  Higher Education Act something called the borrower defense, and here is  what it said.  [[Page S1684]]  If you went to a school and they lied to you, if they misrepresented  what you were going to receive in your education, if they deceived you  and defrauded you, and then you incurred a student debt because of it,  you can go to the U.S. Department of Education under what is known as  the borrower defense program and seek relief from some or all of your  student debt.   This borrower defense program is not new. It has been around many  years. But in the year 2014, it became a popular situation, sadly,  because these for-profit schools were defrauding so many thousands of  students. Over 200,000 students currently have a claim at the U.S.  Department of Education that they were deceived by these for-profit  schools, which are notorious for the representations and  misrepresentations they make to these students.   These 200,000 students went to the Department of Education and said:  Because there is statutory relief here, we are asking you, Secretary  Betsy DeVos, to give us relief from this debt. We were students at  these schools.   And she has refused. She has refused to take up their cases, refused  to consider the merits of them, despite the fact that President Obama,  before her and through the Department of Education, was actually using  this program and this law to help the students.   To add insult to injury, Secretary DeVos said: Incidentally, we are  going to change the standards at the Department of Education for  students who feel that they have been defrauded and that the schools  have misrepresented things to them.   How did she change the standards? She made it extremely difficult for  these students to get any relief from the student debt from the schools  that misrepresented them. Instead of the students' being able to rely,  for example, on the fact that many States have investigated these  schools and found fraudulent misconduct, she has established a new  standard that each of the students has to prove that there was, in  fact, an intentional defrauding of that student.   What does that mean? Each of these students has to lawyer up and each  of these students has to have some investigative capacity to meet the  new standard that has been established by Betsy DeVos at the Department  of Education.   It turns out that these students are up in arms over it, and I am  joining them. This measure on the floor would put an end to this new  rule by Secretary DeVos and say that you have to treat students fairly  when it comes to those who have been defrauded.   Yesterday, the Senate voted 55 to 41 on a bipartisan rollcall--fairly  unusual, but a bipartisan rollcall--where 10 Republicans joined the  Democrats to move the measure disapproving of this new rule by  Secretary DeVos. I want to thank my Republican colleagues who stood up  for these students and veterans.    We have veteran organizations coming to us saying: You can't do this.  What happens is that we have military men and women who, when they are  discharged from service, qualify for the GI bill. The GI bill pays for  their college education, as it should, and I am proud that we do that.  These very same schools not only take the GI benefits but then tell the  students they have to turn around and borrow more money to finish what  turns out to be an absolutely worthless education and training. The  American Legion and many other veterans organizations are leading the  charge with us to change this new Secretary Betsy DeVos standard. I  thank them for that.   In 1992--that is how far back it goes--we put into law in the Higher  Education Act this borrower defense so that students who were defrauded  had somewhere to turn when it came to student debt they incurred. The  schools misrepresented how many job placements would take place if they  finished the courses. They misrepresented the earning potential of  these jobs after graduation. They lied about the cost of attending  these schools. They told the students their credits would transfer  when, in fact, they did not. This kind of misrepresentation left these  students to sign up for more student loans and go more deeply in debt  because they were lied to. Those are just a few of the examples.   Congress rightly didn't want to leave the students to be left holding  the bag for the misconduct of the schools. So it created in 1992 this  statutory borrower defense. No one had ever heard of it until 2014,  when Corinthian Colleges collapsed and the lid was blown off of other  for-profit colleges and universities' fraud. We are talking about the  University of Phoenix and DeVry and others. If you look, you will find  them, and it is a long list. There are two numbers you need to know  about the for-profit colleges and universities, and this will be on the  final. One number is 8: 8 percent of all postsecondary students go to  for-profit colleges and universities--8 percent. The other is 33: 33  percent of all federal student loan defaults are students from for- profit colleges and universities. For the very reasons that we come to  the floor today, these schools are notorious for misrepresenting to  students, overcharging them in tuition, and providing them with little  or no education for the future. These schools take the money and run,  and the students are left holding the bag with massive debts.   Corinthian is a good example. It collapsed in 2014. Thousands of  students were the victims of Corinthian's misrepresentations. They  inflated job placement rates, took out loans for students without their  knowledge, and lied to the students about employers recognizing their  degrees. Corinthian was not unique. Nearly every other major for-profit  college has been the subject of multiple State and Federal  investigations and lawsuits for similar predatory practices.   Since the year 2015, nearly 300,000 student borrowers--mostly from  for-profit colleges--have applied to the Department of Education for  this discharge, and it is not going to stop. These for-profit colleges  are the coronavirus of higher education. The Department of Education  estimates that nearly 200,000 borrowers will be subject to further  illegal practices by their schools in 2021 alone. This new DeVos rule  is going to make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for  students to find relief. The best estimate is that 3 percent of the  students who are defrauded by their school will get relief, and the  other 97 percent will not under this new rule that we will have a  chance to vote against this afternoon.   The rule by Secretary DeVos makes it almost impossible for future  defrauded borrowers to receive the borrower defense discharge that  Congress intended. It eliminates all group relief. Each of the students  is supposed to lawyer up. To prove their claims under the rule, the  borrowers must provide evidence that the school intended to deceive  them, had knowledge of the deception, or acted with reckless disregard.   How many students fresh out of school are able to make that legal  proof? In addition, borrowers under the DeVos rule are required to show  financial harm above and beyond the fact that they took out the loans  that now burden them later in life.   This is a situation where we can respond as a Congress and should on  a bipartisan basis. The House has already passed this measure saying  that we reject this new Secretary Betsy DeVos rule when it comes to  this mistreatment of students who were defrauded and have a debt as a  result of it.   One of my Senate colleagues whom I respect very much yesterday used a  car analogy to defend Secretary DeVos' rule. He said:         If your car is a lemon, you don't sue the bank; you sue the       dealer. A college can be a lemon, just like a car can be.    That is what the Senator said. His point is that the students who  were defrauded by the school, sold a lemon of an education, should go  after the school and not the Department of Education--except that the  DeVos rule allows the schools to prevent students from suing them. It  eliminates a prohibition in current rules on the use of mandatory  arbitration clauses and class actions.   Under the existing rule, students of Corinthian could have come  together in a class action and ask for relief in a court of law  directly from the school. Secretary DeVos eliminates that: Go on your  own. Each one of you students stand up for yourself.   Is that fair? I don't think it is. It certainly isn't the kind of  thing that we want to see in terms of justice for these students. The  DeVos rule causes  [[Page S1685]]  the person who bought the lemon to be forced to sue the bank instead of  the car dealer. You can't have it both ways.   It is not just me who believes that the DeVos rule is bad for student  borrowers. A number of student, consumer, veteran, and other  organizations are supporting this resolution to overturn the rule: the  American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association,  the NAACP, Third Way, Bipartisan Policy Center Action, the Leadership  Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and 20 different State attorneys  general. But the groups I want to highlight as I close in these final 2  or 3 minutes are the veterans organizations.   Many of the students who have been defrauded are veterans. These men  and women have served our country in uniform, and after serving they  seek an education to provide a better life for themselves and their  families, and they deserve it. We have story after story after story of  veterans who signed up at these for-profit colleges. They were told the  GI education benefits were all they needed, only to waste the entire  benefits on a worthless degree and be forced to take tens of thousands  of dollars of student debt on top of it.   That is why our effort in this vote in just 2 minutes on the floor of  the Senate--our effort to overturn this rule--is supported by the  American Legion, the Student Veterans of America, the Iraq and  Afghanistan Veterans of America, the National Military Families  Association, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, Tragedy Assistance  Program for Survivors, VetsFirst, Veterans for Common Sense, and  Veterans Education Success.   James ``Bill'' Oxford is the national commander of the American  Legion, and he wrote to me and said: ``Thousands of student veterans  have been defrauded over the years--promised their credits would  transfer when they wouldn't, given false or misleading job placement  rates in marketing, promised one educational experience . . . but given  something completely different.   He, the American Legion commander, calls the DeVos rule  ``fundamentally rigged against defrauded borrowers'' and says that it  ``flagrantly denies defrauded veterans [fair and timely] decisions [on  their claims].''   How many speeches do each of us give as Senators about how much we  value our military and veterans? We have a chance to prove it in just 1  minute, because there will be a roll call. Are you going to stand up  for these veterans and these students and are you going to say to  Secretary DeVos you are headed the wrong way?   These students and these veterans have been defrauded. Give them a  fighting chance to rebuild their lives. Don't make it next to  impossible.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    I announce that the Senator from Minnesota (Ms.  Klobuchar), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Murphy), the Senator from  Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren),  are necessarily absent.
