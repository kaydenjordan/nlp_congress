 Mr. Speaker, the VIII Summit of the Americas was held  this past weekend, April 13 and 14. These gatherings of government  leaders in the Western Hemisphere are only held once every 3 years.  While together, they discuss common policy issues; they affirm shared  values; and they commit to address challenges facing the Americas. This  year the summit was held in Lima, Peru.   Two years ago, I cofounded the Congressional Caucus on Peru with my  colleague from New York, Mr. Meeks. I launched the caucus to not only  strengthen the U.S.-Peruvian relationship, but also because Utah has  such a special relationship with Peru. Peruvians are the second largest  immigrant group in Utah, and approximately 40,000 are living in our  State. Given that Peru is a major player in trade, education, and  technology in Latin America, I strongly believe that it is critical  that we maintain a strong connection.   As co-chair of the Peruvian Caucus and a supporter of stability in  the region, it was wonderful to see these world leaders commit to  strengthening democracy, while also fighting against corruption and  human rights violations. I look forward to continued cooperation among  American nation-states.   I was recently in the region. It is a beautiful place with beautiful  people, but they are facing severe challenges, and we want to support  them.                            ____________________
