 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge President Biden and  his administration to back off on the attacks on rural America and  rural Iowa.   The administration has proposed changes to the stepped-up basis tax  policy, which is, effectively, the death tax with a new coat of paint.   I have heard from farmers all across the Fourth District who are  concerned about these changes, and they would be financially  devastating, especially when it comes to passing on that family farm to  the next generation.   This was confirmed in a recent study by Texas A&M and the Agriculture  and Food Policy Center. It noted that the stepped-up basis changes  would impact 98 percent of family farms and impose an additional $1  million tax on farms in the Midwest.   It is simple. The hardworking men and women of the Fourth District  and those who feed the world should not have to foot the bill for the  Democrats' reckless spending agenda.   The Biden administration isn't just looking at penalizing rural  Americans with higher taxes. They are also looking at implementing  burdensome regulations that will crush rural Main Streets and our  agricultural community in the Midwest.   Administrator Regan of the EPA recently announced that the EPA would  look into undoing the 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Rule, which  replaced waters of the U.S. as a smarter, more efficient, and more  straightforward approach to defining what waters warrant Federal  regulation.   A return to WOTUS, which allowed the Federal Government to regulate  water on 97 percent of the land in Iowa, would force unnecessary and  costly government regulations on the backs of Iowa farmers. There are  many places the Federal Government bureaucrats just don't belong, and  specifically, they don't belong on our family farms.   When the executive branch's power exploded under the Obama  administration, we saw ridiculous rules implemented and enforced,  leading to rising costs in the ag industry and snuffing out economic  growth on our rural Main Streets and in our rural communities.   This attempted power grab ultimately proved why water regulation is  best left to States and localities.   Put simply, the Biden administration's Big Government agenda for  rural America includes higher taxes and more regulation, but this  administration isn't stopping at this one-two gut punch. President  Biden is also looking to undermine the RFS and lowering biofuel  blending requirements. This will hurt both crop growers and biofuel  producers, two industries that are so critical to our economic activity  in rural Iowa.   At the same time, the administration is laughing as they propose  spending $174 billion on electric vehicles and charging stations. A  study by Biden's own Department of Energy found that four out of every  five vehicles will still require liquid fuels by 2050. Think about  that. Four out of every five cars in 2050 will still need liquid fuels.   Why is President Biden taking aim at this critical industry? It seems  the Democrats are shrugging their shoulders, comfortable with turning  their backs on the rural Midwest, farmers, our rural Main Streets. I  say enough is enough.   Rural Iowans are already suffering from high gas taxes and grocery  prices due to this incredible inflation, which is a direct result of  Democrats' massive and reckless spending. Gas prices are over 50  percent higher than they were a year ago. Our food and energy prices  continue to rise because of inflation.    In May 2021, the Consumer Price Index increased at a rate that has  not been seen since the 2008 recession. On top of the Biden inflation  tax, our farmers can't afford additional taxes, more regulations, and  other policies that will hinder the most important industries and will  stifle growth in the rural Midwest, creating a disaster for rural Main  Streets, our producers, and our family farmers.   Iowa is the breadbasket to the world. That is why President Biden  must back off rural America. Please back off agriculture.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking  Member Lucas for all the work they have done on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the National Science  Foundation for the Future Act. This legislation contains several  provisions that would help ensure the United States continues to be a  global leader in science and technology. It invests in critical STEM  programs and research that will pave the way for new and exciting  technological developments.   I am pleased that this legislation also includes a proposal that I  introduced to protect American intellectual property from falling into  the wrong hands. My proposal, which passed the Science Committee with  unanimous support, prevents government-funded researchers from  participating in projects that are run by so-called foreign countries  of concern, including China, North Korea, Russia, Iran, and others  defined by the State Department.   Taxpayer dollars should not be spent on research that could end up in  the hands of our competitors or our adversaries. This is especially  true when it comes to China. My bipartisan proposal stands up to the  Chinese Communist Party and ensures that our taxpayer dollars are spent  wisely.   The NSF for the Future Act also contains language that I have worked  on with Congressman McNerney to advance precision agriculture  technology. These provisions aim to bolster research and development in  precision farming practices, which will help our producers improve  their efficiency and increase their bottom line.   In sum, the National Science Foundation for the Future Act includes  important provisions that will protect American interests and help  empower our agricultural community.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
