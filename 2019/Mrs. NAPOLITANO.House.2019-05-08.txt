 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I bring to the floor a topic very near  and dear to my heart, and I rise today to recognize the entire month of  May as Mental Health Awareness Month.   I cochair the Congressional Mental Health Caucus along with my  Republican colleague, Mr.   John Katko from New York, and we work to  educate Members of Congress and their staff on the work still needed to  expand mental health access and protections, and also to reduce the  ever-present stigma.   The topic of mental health in Congress has and is building momentum,  and it is spurring action to increase delivery of mental health  services, something I have worked to do for over 2 decades.   This year alone, our House Mental Health Caucus has grown from 47  Members of Congress to 92. However, mental health still affects  millions of Americans of all ages, genders, races, and remains woefully  underfunded and misunderstood.   Suicide currently plagues our veteran community. Roughly 20 veterans  per day take their own lives, according to the VA.   A 2005 to 2016 Department of Veterans Affairs' Suicide Data Report  found that the veteran suicide rate is 1.5 times greater than the  nonveteran population, with over 6,000 veterans dying by suicide each  year.   In the Hispanic community, my own community, approximately one in ten  individuals with mental illness use  [[Page H3494]]  mental health services from a general health provider, while only one  in 20 receive such services from a mental health specialist.   Machismo and other cultural tendencies are preventing our loved ones  from being open and honest about what might be troubling them. The  stigma ranks high.   We must continue to let our loved ones know that there is absolutely  zero, I reiterate, zero shame in asking for help and that seeking  support is a sign of strength.   We also have seen that one in four Latina adolescent children, I say  children because they are still children, report contemplating suicide,  a rate higher than any other demographic.   The increasing diversity of our country underlines both the need and  the importance of assessing culturally and linguistically appropriate  services.   The 2018 election focused on healthcare and the future of the  Affordable Care Act, ACA.   One of ACA's most critical successes was increasing mental health  service and delivery. Insurance companies for decades denied coverage  for patients needing mental health services.   We inserted provisions to end this appalling practice and made mental  health an essential part of basic coverage, including screenings and  other preventive services.   Together, we made sure that no American is discriminated against when  seeking mental health care, and that mental health and substance abuse,  these disorders, are covered equal to physical illnesses like diabetes,  asthma, high blood pressure, and other illnesses.   As we head into 2019, these reforms and the ACA must be strengthened  so more Americans seek the lifesaving care they need.   We must also continue to look at what is being done locally to  support access to mental health services.   In 2001, Pacific Clinics, a nonprofit, and I started a school-based  mental health program with $500,000 seed money from SAMSHA, Substance  Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.   The program began in three middle schools and one high school. The  schools were very reluctant at first, because of the stigma connected  to it and the fear of being labeled ``crazy schools.''                                time  1430    We kept pushing forward, and the program has now grown to 35 schools,  with a waiting list.   The program serves as a model for H.R. 1109, the Mental Health  Services for Students Act, which would provide $200 million for 100  school-based mental health programs nationwide.   Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota has also introduced a Senate  companion, S. 1122, and we are very grateful for her support.   We knew that if we started early with children, we could help them  succeed and save lives. But stigma remains a big barrier preventing  many parents from getting their children the care they need.   We all need to continue sharing the message that it is always okay to  seek help. If we address issues early, we can help students and their  families succeed in and out of the classroom.   The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and the County Department  of Mental Health have been instrumental in the success of this program.  The Department of Mental Health for Los Angeles County took on funding  the program when SAMHSA funding ended in 2009.   Seeing the success of this program, Supervisors Barger and Hahn, in  January 2019, directed the Department of Mental Health to identify  funding and to develop a countywide plan to provide school-based mental  health services. Countywide means to 14 million people.   In April 2019, the board of supervisors formally adopted a plan to  funding for pilot sites, to hire additional mental health  professionals, and to develop a Mental Health First Aid pilot program  that would educate students.   Beyond stigma reduction and educating loved ones of warning signs and  symptoms, we need to ensure that we have a reliable workforce to be  able to deliver lifesaving services to all in need, regardless of their  ZIP Code. There is a national shortage of trained mental health  professionals, and the California Future Health Workforce Commission  has stated that, without dramatic policy changes, California will have  41 percent fewer psychiatrists and 11 percent fewer psychologists,  marriage and family therapists, clinical counselors, and social workers  than needed by 2030.   Recognizing this, I, along with my colleague, Mr. Katko, reintroduced  H.R. 2431, the Mental Health Professionals Workforce Shortage Loan  Repayment Act of 2019.   My Mental Health Caucus co-chair is wonderful in this sense, and I  thank him for that.   This bill would expand the mental health workforce by providing loan  reimbursement to mental health professionals who commit to working in  underserved areas.   Our work continues, but it can't be limited to this Congress or any  other Congress. I encourage all to get involved, educate yourselves,  and share resources with friends and family. If you see somebody who  has fallen on hard times, reach out, help them out, and, if needed,  refer them to a mental health services provider. Together, we can  continue to build a movement and eventually live in a world where there  is no stigma, or it is very much reduced.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko), my  friend.    Mr. Speaker, it is wonderful to hear all the work  that Mr. Katko has done on mental health. He has been exceptional in  this field, and I thank him for all his support. Working together is a  pleasure.   What is mental health? If somebody says you belong in a crazy house,  not so. It could be a child in school, a middle school, suffering the  effects of bullying, or somebody who has had trauma, a shooting or  something that affects them, and it won't go away and it festers when  they grow older.   Forty percent of the incarcerated need mental health services. Foster  children, who are unaware of what their next step will be after they  are emancipated, need mental health support.   That can just go on and on. It is something that is needed. Somehow,  we are not doing our job.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
