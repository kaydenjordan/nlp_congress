 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this  legislation.   In 1990, President George H.W. Bush declared a long overdue  ``independence day'' for people with disabilities as he signed the  historic Americans with Disabilities Act into law. As the House sponsor  of the ADA, I shared the President's optimism and hope that every man,  woman, and child with a disability can now pass through once-closed  doors into a bright new era of equality, independence, and freedom.   I was proud to work across the aisle on the ADA and on the ADA  Amendments Act of 2008, the only time the ADA has ever been amended. We  brought together outside groups from a broad range of affiliations to  create a framework for policy that would vastly improve accessibility  and be agreeable to all.   Unfortunately, people with disabilities still face stubborn barriers  to full inclusion. In the last year, people with differing abilities  have had to fight for access to healthcare and the services they need  to live independently and with dignity.   Now we have on the floor a bill that would undermine the central  tenet of the ADA: the right of victims of discrimination to seek  redress for exclusion. Requiring victims of discrimination to provide  notice of a violation before bringing a lawsuit is an improper shift of  the burden of compliance onto victims, one not required of any other  group by any other civil rights law. Not a single civil rights law  gives this kind of provision.   As the Paralyzed Veterans of America wrote in its letter of  opposition: ``Veterans with disabilities who honorably served their  country should not bear the burden of ensuring that businesses in their  communities are meeting their ADA obligations. Instead, it is the  responsibility of businessowners and their associations to educate  themselves about the law's requirements.''   Now, this law was passed some 27 years ago. There is no excuse for  not knowing the obligations. Our laws do not require such notice for  women, African Americans, Latinos, religious minorities, or any other  groups protected against discrimination.   I acknowledge that there are issues in States that have added  compensatory damages to their State laws. There are no damages in this  national ADA law, which was a compromise. A problem with State law,  however, should be fixed at the State level and not with a retreat in  the Federal law. Lawyers who file vexatious suits may well be in  violation of their ethical obligations.   Sadly, we are seeing that almost 28 years after its passage and  decades of notice as to what is required, tax credits so that you can  make changes necessary to make your place accessible, there are still  those who have barriers to full accommodation for Americans with  differing abilities, contrary to law. In fact, when we adopted the law,  we didn't have it go into effect for 24 months--2 years--so that people  could educate themselves on their responsibilities.   People with differing abilities still have to fight day in and day  out for the access and inclusion to which they should already be  entitled under the law as businesses continue to dismiss their  obligations.   We have a colleague, Senator Tammy Duckworth. She was a helicopter  pilot. Her legs were shot off. She now serves in the United States  Senate. She is a disabled veteran and an American hero. She wrote the  following in The Washington Post about this bill: ``This offensive  legislation would segregate the disability community, making it the  only protected class under civil rights law that must rely on  `education'--rather than strong enforcement--to guarantee access to  public spaces.''   I will be voting ``no'' on this legislation in the name of upholding  the bedrock principles of civil rights law in this country and the  integrity of the ADA that many of us worked together to enact on a  bipartisan basis, an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis, 400 votes-plus,  for this legislation. Let us not retreat this day. Let us not say to  those with disabilities: You have got to wait 180 days.   What if we said: If you are an African American and you try to go  into a place of public accommodations and they wouldn't admit you, and  you said, ``Well, I have got a complaint,'' and you had to wait 180  days to have that right redressed, that is not right.   Let us not treat those with disabilities as second-rate citizens.  Defeat this bill.    Madam Speaker, we have 4 legislative days before those  protected by DACA will be at risk. The Speaker has said he was going to  address this issue. He has not at this point in time.   The Speaker said on 9/23/2010: We will advance major legislation one  issue at a time.   He said: We will not duck the tough issues. We will take them head- on.   In that light, I urge the Speaker to put on the floor the three bills  that are pending in this House: a clean Dream Act; the USA Act,  sponsored by Representatives Aguilar and Hurd, a bipartisan bill; and a  Republican bill, the Securing America's Future Act, sponsored by  Representative Goodlatte.   Madam Speaker, let the people's House speak. Let them vote. Put these  three bills on the floor, and let the majority rule. That is democracy.  Let democracy prevail in this House.                            ____________________
