 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  incredible life and contributions of the Honorable Paul Elizondo, Jr.,  of San Antonio.   Paul's dedication to service was a lifelong commitment, beginning  with his time in the United States Marine Corps.   Following his military service, he attended St. Mary's University in  San Antonio, graduating with a degree in music education in 1957. He  then spent 16 years in the public school system, encouraging the  musical talents of countless young people, before being elected to the  Texas State Legislature in 1978.   Paul first assumed the role of Bexar County commissioner for precinct  2 in 1983 and has been a fixture and force in the Bexar County  government ever since.   Paul Elizondo, Jr., passed away on December 27, 2018, leaving behind  an extraordinary legacy and an amazing family. While we mourn the loss  of this great man, his dedication to fiercely advocating for the West  Side has made an incredible impact that will continue for generations  to come.   I would like to extend my most sincere condolences to Commissioner  Elizondo's family during this difficult time, and I am proud to  recognize all that he did for the great State of Texas and our hometown  of San Antonio.                            ____________________
