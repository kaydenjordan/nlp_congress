 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to call on President Biden to  immediately approve the Major Disaster Declaration requested by New  York Governor Kathy Hochul.   The Hudson Valley was ravaged by storms and flooding on July 8, with  a young woman tragically losing her life.   Thanks to the heroic efforts of our first responders, including the  Piermont Fire Department's Dive Team and High Angle Rescue Team, Carmel  Police Department, Putnam County Sheriff's Office, the Yorktown Police  Department, among many, many more, thankfully no other lives were lost.   My office has been working in tandem with State and local elected  officials to ensure that our region receives the Federal aid it needs  to get back on its feet, which is why I am calling on President Biden  to immediately approve the major disaster declaration requested by New  York State.   We need FEMA to help our hard-hit Hudson Valley communities recover  in full, and provide much-needed resources and aid to impacted  homeowners and municipalities alike with the damage in the tens of  millions of dollars.                            ____________________
