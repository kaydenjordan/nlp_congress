 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of  Specialist Derrick Ameli, a member of the Minnesota National Guard from  Savage, Minnesota.   Derrick was a husband, a brother, a friend and Guardsman whose  service honored our community. Tragically, Derrick died by suicide last  month, falling victim to the sometimes fatal disease of depression.   Like any ailment, no one is immune. Depression can and does take the  very best of us. Addressing this epidemic is one of the Nation's most  urgent challenges. But in order to combat this disease, we must first  destigmatize mental health treatment.   In order to give our neighbors and our families the help they  deserve, they need to feel safe and supported asking for treatment. We  must begin treating mental health as the chronic illnesses they can be,  for Derrick and for so many others who we have lost.                            ____________________
