 Mr. Speaker, today, thousands of students across the  Nation are walking out of their schools to demand real action to end  the tragedy of gun violence. Young men and women across the country-- children, really--from coast to coast and in the heartland of America  are standing up and speaking out for change. Members of Congress will  meet some of them on the west front lawn to join them in saying this:  Enough is enough.   Mr. Speaker, I thank our distinguished colleague from Florida (Mr.  Deutch) for his extraordinary leadership, whether it is with the  students, with legislation on the floor, or in the community at large  to help make the difference.                                time  1015    Here we are, community after community, reeling from the horror of  gun violence, perpetrated against our children, our families.   Our hearts ache for those in Orlando, San Bernardino, Mother Emanuel  Church, Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, Parkland, Newtown. The list is a  very long one, and it is, in addition, on the streets and in the homes  across our country.   There has been too much violence and too much pain. This should not  be a political issue. The American people overwhelmingly want action. A  full 97 percent of Americans support requiring background checks for  all gun buys, including 97 percent of gun owners. There is a  commonsense, bipartisan path forward in the Congress. We can take  action today on comprehensive background checks without the dangerous  Concealed Carry Reciprocity bill, allowing the CDC to study gun  violence, and gun violence restraining orders that empower law  enforcement to intervene when someone is a threat to themselves or  others.   We should all be listening to the American people on both sides of  the aisle, and we should allow the House to vote on bipartisan gun  violence solutions. The families and students suffering from the  heartbreak of gun violence deserve real leadership in this body, not a  Republican White House and Congress that are saying one thing and doing  another. It is deeply disappointing that, just days after embracing the  need for commonsense, bipartisan gun violence prevention, still we have  nothing coming forward.   House Democrats have filed discharge petitions to force votes on the  Thompson-King bipartisan background check bill with 200 cosponsors. Two  hundred cosponsors for a background check bill. That is a start. That  is remarkable. And also the Background Check Completion Act. Democrats  will continue to press for bipartisan progress to reduce the epidemic  of gun violence in our Nation.   Let me say, as we go out in a little bit to join the students who are  doing their walkout across the country, an enormous thank-you to them.  An enormous thank-you to them. While we have sympathy for everyone who  has loss of life because of gun violence across the country--they are  always in our prayers, in our thoughts, and in our determination to  make a difference--the eloquence, the courage, the determination of  these young people in Florida to come forward in such  [[Page H1548]]  an eloquent and articulate way. They have been on the other side of a  gun. That shouldn't happen to our children.   So while we all respect the Second Amendment and what that means for  our country, and while we all want to do something very important, we  must listen. And what the kids are doing is on top of a lot of positive  action taken by the Bradys, taken by every town, taken by our former  colleague Gabby Giffords and her initiative, The Promise of Newtown,  and all over the country. So much activity has happened, and now it has  hopefully culminated at a place where the children, with how savvy they  are about social media and the rest, identifying with each other across  the country, will be the tipping point that will make the difference to  make our country safer.   We thank them for what they are doing, for their leadership. We also  thank them for taking their grief and turning it into action to save  lives. And to remember how important, in all of this, the vote is.   And so I say to my colleagues, there isn't one of us in here whose  political survival compares in the slightest bit to the survival of our  children. These kids have the courage to come forward. We have to have  the courage to vote and take action to save lives. Ninety-five percent  of the American people support us supporting legislation to do just  that.   As we pray and have our moments of silence, let's act upon those  sentiments with real action, again, to make a difference. Again, I  salute the kids, the young people. I look forward to seeing them on the  steps outside on the west lawn. We will gather in the rotunda. All  Members are invited to gather in the rotunda, to go outside and  associate ourselves and sing the praises of these young people for  their courage.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today, we in Congress have the honor of  recognizing an outstanding leader and an esteemed colleague,  Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur. We have the esteemed honor of recognizing  Marcy Kaptur as she becomes the longest serving woman in the history of  the House of Representatives. And it is not just about the longevity of  her service, but the quality of her leadership in the House of  Representatives in so many ways.   It is fitting that we should recognize her outstanding leadership  during Women's History Month. Thank you for giving us the privilege of  doing that.   I know that the people of Ohio and our colleagues from Ohio here take  great pride in their association with Marcy Kaptur, as with the rest of  us, and are honored to call her ``colleague.''   She has left her mark in so many ways. She is the first woman ever to  be assigned to serve on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. In  addition to protecting the American people, honoring our first  responsibility to protect and defend, she is the champion for the World  War II Memorial and a determined defender of all who served there and  their legacy.   Thank you, Marcy Kaptur, for that.   Marcy Kaptur has taken great pride, serving as a constant, unwavering  voice for the American heartland in the U.S. Congress.   Her faith is important to her: her faith in God, her faith in her  community, and her faith in our country. As a leader on the Joint  Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans, for  example, she is a strong champion for retirees and their endangered  pensions.   The list goes on and on. From childhood to pensions, Marcy has been  there in the lead on the Appropriations Committee.   By the way, she is the longest serving woman on the Appropriations  Committee, as well.   Later today, at a reception to which you are all invited in the  Rayburn Room, I will read a letter of congratulations from Barbara  Mikulski, the longest serving woman in the Congress and Marcy in the  House.   It is really important to know the impact that Marcy has had on all  of us. She is a person of the greatest integrity and sincerity. She  knows her purpose. She knows her subjects. Her judgment is respected,  and she always has a plan. Therefore, as I have said so many times, if  you want to save yourself some time, just do what Marcy asks you to do  the first time around.   As a granddaughter of Polish immigrants, she takes great pride in her  heritage, and as with most families taking pride in their heritage, she  is fiercely patriotic and loves America and works every day for all  families pursuing economic opportunity and the American Dream.   Marcy, thank you for your outstanding leadership on behalf of Ohioans  for sure, for all Americans, and on behalf of women, girls, and  families across the country and across the world. It is an honor to  serve with you, a privilege to call you ``colleague,'' and a joy to  call you ``friend.'' Thank you, Marcy Kaptur.                            ____________________
