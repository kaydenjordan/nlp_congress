 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  leadership, alongside Chairman Schiff, on this very important  legislation.   Madam Speaker, the previous administration played fast and loose with  the American people's hard-earned tax dollars. And just as seriously,  it exposed dangerous faults in our democratic institutions that, if  left unaddressed, will erode the American people's trust in our  democracy.   That is why I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Protecting Our  Democracy Act, which restrains Presidents from abusing the public  trust.   Of particular importance to me as chair of the Appropriations  Committee, this bill will ensure that every President, regardless of  party, will be subject to the Congress' constitutional power of the  purse.   It will strengthen congressional control and review over funding to  ensure that Federal dollars are being used as directed by the Congress.   It will require the Office of Management and Budget to publish how it  apportions the appropriations provided by the Congress to executive  agencies.   Finally, the Protecting Our Democracy Act will increase reporting to  Congress on the executive branch's compliance with the Impoundment  Control Act and the Antideficiency Act, two bedrock laws that were  enacted to protect Congress' appropriations power.   The American people deserve a voice in how their money is spent.  Through their duly elected Representatives in the Congress, the  Protecting Our Democracy Act gives the American people that voice.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge support for this important piece of  legislation.
