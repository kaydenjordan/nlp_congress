 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  this ObamaCare wish list legislation.   I want to start off by saying, Madam Speaker, how disappointed I am.  How disappointed I am that this comes--this partisan healthcare  legislation is being moved at such a serious time in our Nation's  response to the pandemic.   This bill was developed and written without Republican input, which  seems to be the thing to do these days. I was up here last week talking  about the policing bill, same thing, no Republican input. Now we are  talking about the healthcare bill. No Republican input. Partisan  legislation, at a time when our country needs bipartisan solutions.   You know, when a bill is developed and written without Republican  input, that is usually a good sign that there is no real intention of  moving this legislation; and there is not. The other side, Madam  Speaker, knows that this is not going to move.   Unfortunately, Americans are suffering right now, they are suffering  from COVID-19. We should be working together, Republicans and  Democrats, to create solutions that benefit every American.  Unfortunately, this bill has many issues, it is a big government- controlled healthcare agenda.   Once again, Democrats are trying to mandate the price of drugs, or  tax manufacturers out of the U.S. market if they don't comply, at a  time when we need to be bringing back manufacturing to the United  States. Now we are doing just the opposite with this partisan  legislation.   My colleagues across the aisle want fewer cures during the pandemic.  Fewer cures during the pandemic. Are you kidding me? That is the last  thing America needs right now.   This legislation also expands ObamaCare subsidies, allowing some of  the wealthiest Americans to get subsidies for insurance paid for by the  hard-earned taxpayers' dollars.   This is not the time to be partisan, Madam Speaker, this is a time  for us to work together. I hope my colleagues across the aisle can set  aside these efforts and work with us to pass meaningful, bipartisan  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Bishop Gregory Hartmayer for being named the seventh archbishop of  Atlanta by Holy Father Pope Francis.   Bishop Hartmayer has remarkably served several roles in the church  for over 40 years, including as a guidance counselor, teacher, and  eventually school principal for Catholic high schools.   After spending many years in New York and Massachusetts, Bishop  Hartmayer moved to Georgia to serve as a pastor and then bishop.   He has been recognized by his community, family, and friends as a  kind, faithful, and humble servant of the Lord.   Bishop Hartmayer was appointed the 14th bishop of the Diocese of  Savannah by Pope Benedict the 16th in 2011. I was honored to have him  as my guest at Pope Francis' speech to a joint session of Congress in  2015.   His life has been marked by graciously sharing wisdom, peace, and  clarity with everyone he encounters and freely giving his resources for  the good of others.   I thank Bishop Hartmayer for his service to the people of the Diocese  of Savannah and to Georgia's First Congressional District. I know God  will continue to use him in amazing ways as he serves as the seventh  archbishop of Atlanta, and I wish him all the best.                            ____________________
