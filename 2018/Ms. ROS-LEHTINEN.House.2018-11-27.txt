 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, Chairman Royce,  and I commend both the Speaker and Ranking Member Engel. I am going to  miss serving with you, Eliot, as Chairman Royce and I say bye-bye in  just a few weeks. But I thank them for always bringing to the floor  bipartisan bills that make America a stronger place.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Mr. Kinzinger's bill, H.R.  4591, the Preventing Destabilization of Iraq Act of 2018. This timely  bill will impose sanctions against a multitude of Iranian militias,  proxies, terrorist groups, and other nefarious entities that are  operating in Iraq. And it makes it clear that the United States will  not allow Iran to continue undermining the stability of Iraq.   This bill also includes important language authored by our presiding  officer, Judge Poe, ensuring that the State Department determines that  if certain Iranian-affiliated individuals are operating as terrorists,  then they should be designated as terrorists.   It further includes language by our great friend Congressman Joe  Wilson of South Carolina, requiring a determination on whether Afghan  and Pakistani brigades, under the control of the Iranian Revolutionary  Guard Corps, should also be designated.   This is common sense, Mr. Speaker. As Adam Kinzinger knows firsthand,  Iran has been working against U.S. interests in Iraq for years, and it  is directly responsible for American casualties and is intent on  continuing to destabilize Iraq for its own purposes.   We have to ensure that there are penalties for Iran's activities by  doing everything that we can to block their proxies' assets, to cut off  their funding, and to restrict their travel.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Royce and Mr. Engel. As we know, Iraq is a  very important partner. This bill prioritizes its stability, and I  thank the sponsor, Mr. Kinzinger, for authoring this bill. I encourage  all of my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to rise in support of  Chris Smith's bill, the Iraq and Syria Genocide Relief and  Accountability Act of 2018.   I again thank Chairman Royce and our esteemed ranking member, Eliot  Engel, for their efforts in bringing this important and bipartisan bill  to the floor.   This commonsense bill authorizes Federal agencies to provide  assistance to entities that are working to hold accountable those  responsible for genocide, for crimes against humanity, and for war  crimes in Iraq and Syria.   Over the last 7 years, sadly, ISIS has explicitly targeted and  murdered tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of religious and ethnic  minorities, mostly Christians and Yazidis in Iraq and Syria.    We need to ensure that the proper people are being held accountable  by giving the administration all of the tools that it needs to  coordinate with and support the organizations that can identify and can  prosecute those responsible.   In addition, Mr. Smith's bill prioritizes emergency assistance to  these religious and ethnic minority groups that are targeted by ISIS  and continue to face persecution.   Syrians remain in desperate need of humanitarian assistance, of  stabilization assistance. We must ensure that these religious and  ethnic minorities are getting the help they desperately need.   I thank my colleague, Chris Smith, such a strong human rights  defender, for authoring this important bill and giving this authority  to the administration. I urge all of my colleagues to give it their  strong bipartisan support.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  congratulate Lieutenant Commander Victoria Marum on her separation from  the United States Navy after 11 years of faithful service to our  country.   An esteemed member of the United States Navy, Lieutenant Commander  Marum most recently served as the liaison in the Navy's U.S. House of  Representatives Liaison Office.   I was so grateful for Victoria's guidance during delegations that I  was so proud to lead abroad, as she always handled stressful situations  and difficult individuals--I won't name names--with poise, humor, and  resourcefulness.   The talent she exhibited on Capitol Hill will serve her well on every  path upon which she finds herself in the future.   As Lieutenant Commander Marum embarks on a new chapter in her life,  it is my hope that she may recall with a deep sense of pride and  accomplishment the outstanding contributions she has made to the United  States Navy, to the United States Congress, and to our great Nation,  even though she is a Florida Gator.                            ____________________
