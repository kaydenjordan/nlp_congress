 Mr. Chair, I urge opposition to H.J.  Res. 37, directing the removal of U.S. Armed Forces from the  hostilities in Yemen. Actually, the U.S. is not directly engaged in any  hostilities in Yemen. This is not my independent assessment, but the  determination of the Department of Defense.   The U.S. is currently supporting the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen by  providing targeting assistance, intelligence sharing, and joint  planning to defeat the Houthi rebels who are armed by Iran, with  missiles that they have directed at civilian airports in Saudi Arabia.   There is no doubt that the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen has made  terrible targeting mistakes. But what would happen if the U.S. were to  pull the plug on our intelligence-sharing and targeting cooperation?                                time  1430    Would this improve the coalition's targeting or possibly make it  worse, increasing the chances for collateral damage and civilian  casualties?   I am concerned that, if we walk away now, these terrible tragedies  will simply multiply.   The United States must be at the table so that we can insist on and  respect international law. This does not mean that the coalition will  always do the right thing, but it does mean that we will have leverage  and influence to promote the right direction.   Instead of this resolution, I hope that our colleagues, Foreign  Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel and Ranking Member, Republican  leader,   Mike McCaul, will work together on a bipartisan initiative  that can address these important concerns in Yemen.   We can all agree that the humanitarian crisis in Yemen must be  addressed and that the ongoing conflict must come to an end. Let's work  together as we have always done on the Foreign Affairs Committee to  address this issue and end the suffering of the Yemeni people.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to  be removed as a cosponsor of H.R. 940.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        February 13, 2019, on page H1558, the following appeared:  REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 490 Mr. WILSON of  South Carolina.
