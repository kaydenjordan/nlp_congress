 Madam President, I would ask unanimous consent to speak as  if in morning business.    Madam President, I rise, as so many of us have of late, to  talk about the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. This invasion, as we  know, started on February 24, and it is now, I guess, in its 21st or  22nd day.   At the time of the invasion--I think it was the day after or 2 days  after--I was reading in a newspaper the reference to one resident of  Ukraine who said the following about the onset of the hostilities by  Vladimir Putin and Russia:         It was the worst sunrise in my life.    I can't even begin to imagine what that individual in Ukraine or tens  of thousands of families were feeling on that day, and hundreds of  thousands throughout the country--millions, even.   This attack, which is ongoing, was both unprovoked and unjustified.  It is an attack on a sovereign nation by a murderous dictator who has  no regard for human life and no regard for the rules-based  international order. I think a lot of people knew that before the  invasion, but now it is abundantly clear to the world what Vladimir  Putin's intentions are and what his practices are when it comes to  attacking a sovereign nation.   The New York Times told us last Friday, March 11, about Putin. I am  quoting here from the New York Times, and they made reference in this  story to his actions in Syria, as well as Chechnya:         [H]e has demonstrated in [the] past . . . a willingness not       only to bomb heavily populated areas indiscriminately but       also to use civilian casualties as leverage against his       enemies.    ``[U]se civilian casualties as leverage''--that is the dictator that  the people of Ukraine are dealing with right now. And I think it is  clear from the reporting, and so many Americans have read the stories  and have seen the coverage of the bombings. It is clear that he is  bombing indiscriminately. It is clear that he and his army, his  military, are targeting civilians.   All you have to do is look at the list of locations. And the list  would be hundreds if we read all of them, but here are just a couple  examples. Maybe the most graphic in the last couple of days was the  bombing of a maternity ward and that footage of a stretcher coming out  of that rubble with a pregnant woman, who has since died, as did her  child. That is an example of that kind of indiscriminate bombing.   But in addition to a maternity ward, he has bombed a shoe factory, a  psychiatric hospital, apartment buildings, cafes, homes, parking lots  near a shopping center, bombing near a kindergarten, bombing of a  mosque, bombing--we are told, the most recent number--34 medical  facilities, damaged in Ukraine. And that number, of course, will grow.  Most recently, just in the last day or so, a supermarket, and, I think,  at least a 12-story residential tower.   And then, just today, another reference to just one example of the  brutality of Putin: 10 people killed waiting in line for bread in  Ukraine. The adviser to the mayor of one of the most besieged cities,  Mariupol, said the following. This adviser said:         Humanity has not yet invented a word to describe what       Russia is doing to us.    I think that says it all. There is no way to describe what is  happening. The world has never seen this, in recent history. Maybe the  closest example would be what happened in Syria, which, of course, was  also paid for and led by the Russian military, Mr. Putin.   Despite all that horror and all that bloodshed and all that is to  follow, despite all of that grim reminder of the brutality of Mr.  Putin, the Ukrainian people have inspired so many of us. When I say  ``us,'' I don't mean just voting Members of Congress or people  throughout the country. They have inspired people the world over. I  have never seen anything in my lifetime that equates to the inspiration  that they have generated; their courage--the raw physical courage of  the people, of the military, and all the contributions they are making  to their country--their resolute determination to protect their  freedom, to protect their families, to protect their nation, and,  really, when you think about it in a larger sense, to protect democracy  itself, because that is really very much on the line in Ukraine.    The Ukrainian people's stubborn refusal to be intimidated by a  ruthless autocrat and his military has inspired so many people every  single day. I just saw another example this morning. Women who have  left Ukraine with their children, to bring their children to safety,  coming back into Ukraine to join the fight or, in some cases, I guess,  to rejoin the fight--women putting their lives at risk for their  country.   This morning the Presiding Officer and all of us, the Members of  Congress, had the honor to listen to President Zelenskyy's address to  the Congress, and I know the Nation saw it as well. His address this  morning was also inspiring, every bit as inspiring as that engendered  by his people. But his address was also a call to action for us to do  more. We have got to do more. And we have got to provide additional  support.   President Zelenskyy thanked our President, President Biden, and the  American people for all the support that we have provided, especially  in the last couple of weeks since the invasion began but also before  that.   And President Biden responded just 2 or 3 hours later when he  announced even more military assistance or security assistance, which,  if you add up just that part of the support, just since he took office,  is now at about $2 billion. That doesn't include other support like  humanitarian support.   But here is just a quick list of what that security assistance is. I  will just itemize a few. This isn't exhaustive, but it is just some  examples: Stinger anti-aircraft systems--we provided many hundreds of  them, and now we are providing a lot more than that--the Javelin anti- armor systems that have had such success against the Russian military,  Russian tanks; helicopters; patrol boats; grenade launchers; guns and  ammunition; grenades; mortar and artillery rounds; secure  communications; military medical equipment; on and on and on.   And, as I mentioned, the President responded specifically today by  announcing that the United States will add $800 million just on  security assistance, bringing that total, as I said, to $2 billion  since he began his administration. It was noteworthy that two of the  component parts of that--the Stinger systems and the Javelins--both are  being used with great skill by the Ukrainian fighters. The increase in  those numbers is not just a few hundred. In both cases it is either  doubling or tripling what we have already done. And we will do more. We  will continue to do more.   Congress has passed a spending bill just a couple of days ago, at the  end of last week, and the President signed it this week, which allowed  that $800 million to be available.   So that is the good news: more money for weapons and other security  assistance, more money for humanitarian support. That number is growing  all the time because of the need that the Ukrainian people have.   The sanctions--the crushing, unprecedented sanctions--that already  are having effect. I had a briefing today just on that topic of the  impact of the sanctions, and it is substantial, and it will only grow  as time goes by. We will have more time later to talk about that. And,  of course, the contribution, as well--all of these are contributions of  not just our government but our people. The American people made these  contributions of military assistance and humanitarian support and our  [[Page S1213]]  ability to impose sanctions with our allies, with our NATO partners.   But at the same time, what gets lost sometimes in the discussion  about Ukraine is the intelligence support we have provided--all kinds  of offices throughout our intelligence community providing actionable  intelligence or intelligence that the Ukrainians can use if they fight  the battle, fight the war. That is probably incalculable in terms of  the advantages given on the battlefield and beyond. So that bears  emphasis as well.   I think one area of positive development in the last couple of months  is the unity, not just the unity of NATO, which has never been  stronger, probably never stronger since the 1960s or even more so, but  the unity here at home--unity in the Senate, unity in the House, unity  throughout the country to support the people of Ukraine--the people but  also to support the military.   I have to say, though, as much as we have that unity with our NATO  partners and here in the Congress, there are voices here in Washington  and around the country that are not as unified. We know the voice of  our former President and his continued approval of Putin's ``genius.''   Why would you ever say that about a murderous dictator? He is not a  genius. He is, I believe, a war criminal, but that kind of language and  that kind of support for Putin, at least by way of laudatory words, has  tarnished that unity, has undermined that unity here at home and around  the world. But it is not enough to break that unity.   I just hope that Republican Members of Congress, when someone in  their party, especially a leader of their party or a Member of Congress  or any other Republican official--I hope that when they say things  about Vladimir Putin that are positive or in any way supportive that  they would call it out and condemn it.   When you are supporting the people of Ukraine at a time of war, you  have to use every tool in your toolbox: military assistance, diplomacy,  sanctions, humanitarian support, but also your words as leaders. And we  should be condemning any American leader who supports or says positive  things about Mr. Putin.   I hope the Republican Members of Congress who have stood up and been  very supportive of the Ukrainian people in this fight would also call  out Members of their party and condemn such statements because that  didn't happen in July of 2018, when the former President--in my  judgment, this is my view of it--was genuflecting before Vladimir Putin  on the world stage in Helsinki, Finland, in probably what I believe is  maybe the worst day for an American President on the world stage ever  when he took the side of Mr. Putin, a murderous dictator, over the  determinations made by our intelligence community about the previous  election. That was a low moment for America, for our democracy, and for  our country.   We now have, I think, very clearly a choice. It is not a choice of  three or four options or five options. There are only two options here:  You can choose Mr. Putin or choose Mr. Zelenskyy. You can choose a  dictator who has no regard for human life and all of the enablers  around him, or you can choose the President who is standing up for  freedom, Mr. Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine.   It is really a simple choice. It is a choice between the incarnation  of evil and the personification of freedom. That is the choice. There  is not a third option here. Every American has to make this choice, but  especially Members of Congress, elected officials. That is part of our  job. You have to make a choice, and it is very simple.   The good news is Republicans, Democrats, and Independents--House and  Senate, the two branches of government--have made a choice, and the  American people have made a choice. They made a choice for freedom to  support that personification of freedom by supporting Mr. Zelenskyy and  his government in this war, by supporting the Ukrainian people, who are  literally putting their lives on the line for freedom itself.   I will conclude with these thoughts. Like our Constitution that we  turn to for both--not just guidance and inspiration, but we turn to, to  remind ourselves of our duty, so, too, are the people of Ukraine  turning to their Constitution for that guidance and that inspiration  and that call to action.   Here is what that Constitution says in pertinent part, and it sounds  very familiar:         The people are the bearers of sovereignty and the only       sources of power in Ukraine . . . To affirm and ensure human       rights and freedoms is the main duty of the State.    That is what the Ukrainian Constitution says, a mandate that freedom  must be the goal and the work of the State. Wow, are they doing that  now. President Zelenskyy and his government and the people of Ukraine  are standing up for freedom.   When we are at our best here at home, we do the same. We have a great  anthem for our Nation: ``O beautiful''--and you know the rest of that  great anthem. One of the verses of that great anthem says:         O beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years.    The dream of a patriot isn't just to stand up in the moment and  fight, but that patriot is standing up for freedom, fighting and  willing to put their lives on the line--or his or her life on the  line--for freedom because they are seeing beyond the years. They are  standing up for freedom, not just for themselves and their families and  their nation, but for the future--for the future of that nation. That  is what the people of Ukraine are doing right now, and that is why we  have to continue to support them in that great fight.   I think most Americans have already made the choice. We just have to  back them up and stand for freedom--not to stand for the incarnation of  evil, Mr. Putin and his government right now, but to stand for the  personification of freedom. We saw that this morning with President  Zelenskyy.   I yield the floor.
