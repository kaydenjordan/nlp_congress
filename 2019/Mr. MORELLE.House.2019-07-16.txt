 Mr. Speaker, I often reflect on the wise words of  Margaret Mead: ``Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful,  committed citizens can change the world: Indeed, it is the only thing  that ever has.''   Never has this proven more true than when women of all ages and  circumstances gathered in Seneca Falls in upstate New York 161 years  ago this week and changed forever the course of history.   These thoughtful, dedicated, passionate women stood up and declared  to the world that all men and women are created equal.   The convention sparked a fire in women across the country, formally  birthing the women's rights movement and eventually paving the way for  women's suffrage.   We hear the echoes of their voices today as we continue the fight  they began so long ago. Let this anniversary reinvigorate us as we  carry on its legacy, fearlessly committed to securing equal rights,  equal pay, and the fundamental right of every woman to choose what  happens to her body.                            ____________________
