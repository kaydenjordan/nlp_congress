 Mr. Speaker, this morning I make a personal plea to  my fellow Texans.   I recognize that there has been an overload of tiredness and desire  to go back to work and maybe a desire to party.   Unfortunately, with bad advice and political emphasis, the mask order  will be lifted today on March 10 in our State.   Our State is being plagued by the United Kingdom variant. We are  still on the hot list for the number of deaths. We have not reached a  certain number in terms of lowering the infection rate, and we haven't  reached any kind of level in terms of vaccination.   Removing the restrictions and having remove-mask parties is going to  be a disaster.   I make this plea: Wear your mask, socially distance. Restaurants and  other businesses be responsible.   We are on the way with a rescue, but I beg of my fellow Texans, let  us not go backwards to create more deaths, to create more  hospitalizations, more loved ones that we will not have at the dinner  table.   This is not a time to go backwards. This is a time to go forward.  Wear your mask. Let's be responsible.   I ask my constituents on Washington Avenue: Do not have a remove-mask  party tonight because you will be walking into a destiny of death.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the January 6 insurrectionists did not  win. The American Government, the people of the United States, won with  a Democratic government that has come to the rescue with the American  Rescue Plan.   The long lines will stop. $20 billion for vaccines. Cash-strapped  Americans will get $1,400 and extended unemployment. We will recognize  that our children will get back to school with $130 billion. They will  be able to stay in school. They will be able to regain lost learning.  They will be safely in school.   And, yes, a working family, who my friends do not know, a single- parent working full time and making minimum wage of $15,000 will get  $9,525, with children under 6, and a child tax credit of $3,600.   Houston will get $650 million; Harris County, $914 million.   This is a rescue. The insurrectionists did not win, but democracy  did. The Democrats are on the way to give you help.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on  the Judiciary, on Homeland Security, on the Budget, and as the Member  of Congress for a congressional district that has experienced the worst  of COVID-19 as a public health emergency and economic catastrophe, I  rise in strong support of the Senate Amendment to H.R. 1319, the  ``American Rescue Plan Act of 2021,'' which provides $1.9 trillion to  take immediate and decisive action to crush the virus and vaccinate our  people, build the economy back better, reopen schools, and provide  needed support and assistance to state and local governments that have  been asked to do too much with too little for far too long.   To be clear, I would have preferred the version of the American  Rescue Plan passed on February 26, 2021 by the House, without a single  Republican vote, but the amended version of the legislation is  infinitely better than the feeble and disinterested efforts, and  callous disregard of the previous Administration to this deadly  pandemic.   Mr Speaker, I support the legislation before us because it will put  money directly in the pockets of hard-pressed and weary Americans,  vaccination shots in their arms, and help put them back to work and  their children back in school.   The key differences between the bills passed by the House and Senate  are:   1. The Senate-passed bill does not include the $15 an hour minimum  wage provisions that were included in the bill passed by the House.   2. The Senate-passed bill reduces to $80,000 the phase-out range for  qualification of an individual to receive direct payments under the  legislation.   3. The Senate-passed bill extends the Federal Pandemic Unemployment  Compensation (FPUC) only through September 6, but it retains the weekly  benefit at the current $300 per week, and it also exempts up to $10,200  in unemployment benefits received in 2020 from federal income taxes for  households making less than $150,000.   Like the House bill, the Senate-passed bill finishes the job on the  President's promise to provide $2,000 per person in direct assistance  to households across America with checks of $1,400 per person,  following the $600 down payment enacted in December.   The bill will also provide direct housing assistance and nutrition  assistance for 40 million Americans, expand access to safe and reliable  child care and affordable health care, extend unemployment insurance so  that 18 million American workers can pay their bills and support 27  million children with an expanded Child Tax Credit and more than 17  million low-wage childless workers through an improved Earned Income  Tax Credit.   The bill supports communities struggling with the economic fallout by  providing, like the House bill, crucial support for the hardest-hit  small businesses, especially those owned by entrepreneurs from racial  and ethnic backgrounds that have experienced systemic discrimination,  with economic injury disaster loans (EIDL) grants, expanded PPP  eligibility and more.   This legislation provides crucial resources to protect the jobs of  first responders, frontline public health workers, and other essential  workers.   Finally, and very important, the American Rescue Plan Act establishes  the Coronavirus Local Fiscal Recovery Fund and provides $45.570 billion  in direct funding to major metropolitan cities and local governments.   With our vote today in support of the American Rescue Plan,  congressional Democrats and President Biden are making good on our  commitment to the American people that help is on the way to crush the  virus, open our schools safely, and build back better.   Mr. Speaker, by an overwhelming margin (72 percent), the public wants  and is demanding that we act to provide more economic relief to address  the damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.   Nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of Republicans and Republican-leaning  independents believe an additional relief package is necessary, while  more than nine in ten (92 percent) Democrats and Democratic leaders say  more coronavirus aid will be needed.   Even the most conservative Republicans favor more relief by a 56  percent-44 percent margin.   Nearly nine-in-ten of all adults (88 percent) in lower-income  households say an additional package is necessary, while 81 percent of  Republicans in lower-income households (81 percent) say additional aid  is needed now.   The American Rescue Plan Act will put food on the table, by expanding  the SNAP program and respecting Black family farmers.   The American Rescue Plan Act will put people back to work by  prioritizing funding for transit, airlines and airports, and the  disaster relief fund.   The American Rescue Plan Act will put a priority on protecting  renters and homeowners, preventing homelessness, and providing $10  billion for the Defense Production Act to procure essential medical  supplies and equipment.   The American Rescue Plan Act will put money in people's pockets with  direct payments, Unemployment Insurance, Child Tax Credit, the Earned  Income Tax Credit, and includes pension security and expanded  Affordable Care Act coverage.   The American Rescue Plan Act will provide $17 billion in critical  funding to help the VA meet the health and economic security of  veterans, especially as relates to the benefits claims and appeals  backlog caused by COVID-19.   The American Rescue Plan Act will produce and distribute the vaccine  and test, treat and protect all Americans, including communities of  color.   The American Rescue Plan Act will provides desperately needed funding  for our heroes--health care workers, first responders, sanitation,  transportation and food workers, and teachers--in states, localities,  tribes, and territories.   Let me speak briefly about another crucially important feature of the  legislation we will pass today.   The American Rescue Plan Act establishes the Coronavirus Local Fiscal  Recovery Fund and provides $45.570 billion in direct funding to major  metropolitan cities and local governments.   In my home state of Texas, metropolitan cities are estimated to  receive $10.327 billion in direct coronavirus relief funding, while the  state of Texas is slated to receive $16.824 billion, for an estimated  $27.152 billion total to the state of Texas.   During the Budget Committee markup, I proposed, and the Committee  agreed that any effort to strip or reduce this vital funding is to be  rejected so major metropolitan cities, like Houston, receive the direct  COVID-19 relief funding desperately needed to battle the coronavirus,  restore critical services to struggling families, and help save the  jobs of essential public servants like teachers, firefighters, and  other first responders.   Let me discuss briefly why direct funding to major metropolitan  cities and counties is so critical.   The purpose of providing for direct payment to major metropolitan  cities like Houston and counties like Harris County, as opposed to the  County having to receive an allocation from the State, is so that the  local governments, who are in the best position to identify and  respond, will be able to tailor the funding to meet the urgent needs of  their communities.   For example, under the direct payment provisions in the CARES Act,  Harris County received more federal funding relative to the amount that  would have been received through the State program and had the  flexibility needed for more efficient use of this funding, which was a  concern voiced even by State leaders over the restrictive way that the  State of Texas distributed CARES Act funding.   By directly allocating funding to metropolitan cities and areas like  Houston and Harris County, local authorities can work with the  community to determine the specific needs of Harris County residents.   As a result, Harris County Commissioners Court approved, for example,  the following  [[Page H1263]]  programs to directly address community needs, and to get money into the  hands of residents quickly:   1. Commissioners Court funded Community Programs   2. Census Services   3. Childcare Assistance Program   4. Court Evictions Services   5. COVID 19 Workforce Development Program   6. Direct Assistance Programs   7. Domestic Violence Assistance Fund   8. Rental Assistance Programs   9. Small Business Loan Program (LEAP)   10. Small Business Relief Fund   11. Small Cities Support   12. Student Digital Services   13. UT Health Community Spread Survey Program   Without direct payments to major metropolitan cities, state  governments--as we saw here in Texas--would not have permitted CARES  Act funding to be used to create or support any of these programs.   In addition, without direct payments to major metropolitan cities and  government units, states invariably will succumb to the temptation to  place onerous conditions on funding over and above those required by  the Federal government.   For example, in Texas, only $55 per capita was allocated to nondirect  allocation entities, instead of the $174.49 per capita that was  allocated to them by Congress.   Additionally, only 20% of the allocation was made available  immediately to local entities instead of making 100 percent of the  allocation available immediately.   Third, direct funding is necessary to prevent state governments from  creating specific categories limiting eligibility for medical expenses,  public health expenses, payroll expenses for employees in the fields of  public safety, public health, health care, human services, or whose  services are substantially dedicated to mitigating or responding to the  COVID-19 public health emergency.   Without direct payments to major metropolitan cities, state  governments, again as we have seen in Texas, will limit recovery for  expenditures to support actions to facilitate compliance with COVID-19  related public health measures or associated with the provision of  economic support in connection with the COVID-19, or other COVID-19  related expenses reasonably necessary to the function of government  that satisfy the fund's eligibility criteria.   I would urge my Republican colleagues to heed the words of Republican  Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia who said colorfully just a few  days ago, ``At this point in time in this nation, we need to go big. We  need to quit counting the egg-sucking legs on the cows and count the  cows and just move. And move forward and move right now.''   The same sentiment was expressed more eloquently by Abraham Lincoln  in 1862 when he memorably wrote:   ``The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present.  The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the  occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We  must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.''   Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan action we took last December was a step  in the right direction but only a long-delayed down payment; we cannot  afford any more delays, especially since Republican stalling already  caused a painful lapse in critical unemployment assistance last year,  and additional unemployment assistance is set to expire on March 14,  2021.   That is why the American Rescue Plan Act is absolutely crucial and  the right thing to do and to do right now.   The American Rescue Plan Act proposed by President Biden takes a  multiprong approach to tackling the public health and economic crises  stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.   No one is better prepared or more experienced to lead the American  rescue than President Biden, who as Vice-President oversaw the  implementation of the Recovery Act, which saved millions of jobs and  rescued our economy from the Great Recession the Obama Administration  and the nation inherited from a previous Republican administration.   And let us not forget that President Obama also placed his confidence  in his vice-president to oversee the rescue of the automotive industry,  which he did so well that the American car industry fully recovered its  status as the world leader.   Mr. Speaker, to crush the virus and safely reopen schools, the  American Rescue Plan Act will mount a national vaccination program that  includes setting up community vaccination sites nationwide and makes  the investments necessary to safely reopen schools.   It will also take complementary measures to combat the virus,  including scaling up testing and tracing, addressing shortages of  personal protective equipment and other critical supplies, investing in  high-quality treatments, and addressing health care disparities.   The American Rescue Plan Act delivers immediate relief to working  families bearing the brunt of the crisis by providing $1,400 per person  in direct cash assistance to households across America, bringing the  total (including the $600 down payment enacted in December) to $2,000.   Additionally, the plan will also provide direct housing and nutrition  assistance to families struggling to get by, expand access to safe and  reliable child care and affordable health care, extend and expand  unemployment insurance so American workers can pay their bills, and  give families with children as well as childless workers a boost  through enhanced tax credits.   Mr. Speaker, the American Rescue Plan Act provides much needed  support for communities struggling with the economic fallout, including  hard-hit small businesses, especially those owned by entrepreneurs from  racial and ethnic backgrounds that have experienced systemic  discrimination.   Finally, the plan also provides crucial resources to protect the jobs  of first responders, frontline public health workers, teachers, transit  workers, and other essential workers that all Americans depend on.   Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic, as did the videos of the  unjustified killings of George Floyd, Breanna Taylor, Ahmed Arbrey, and  so many others, laid bare for the nation to see the stark racial and  ethnic inequalities exacerbated by the virus.   In my home state of Texas, as of the end of September 2020, there  have been more than 760,000 cases of COVID-19 and 16,000 deaths.   According to the Texas Department of State Health Care Services, 70  percent of the confirmed fatalities were people of color.   In Texas, COVID-19 mortality rates are 30 percent higher for African  Americans and 80 percent higher for Hispanics overall.   The differences become much larger when accounting for age; for  example, in the 25 to 44-year-old age group, African American mortality  rates are more than four times higher than White rates, and the  Hispanic rates are more than seven times higher.   One factor in Hispanic and African American populations being more  likely to contract COVID-19 is employment in occupations associated  with public contact and that cannot be done remotely.   The sad fact is that most workers in these occupations are less able  to be absent from their job or to have paid time off.   In Texas, people of color make up more than 40 percent of cashiers,  retail salespersons, child care workers, licensed practical nurses,  more than 50 percent of bus drivers and transit workers, medical and  nursing assistants, personal care aides, and home health aides, and  more than 60 percent of building cleaners and housekeepers.   In addition, Hispanic and African American populations in Texas are  less likely to have health insurance and to have a regular health care  provider, so less likely to seek or receive early care for symptoms,  especially in the first months of the epidemic.   And African American and Hispanic populations are also more likely to  have an underlying health condition that makes them more vulnerable to  the effects of COVID-19.   To respond and mitigate the devastation wrought by COVID-19 on  Americans, and especially marginal and vulnerable communities of color,  I have introduced H.R. 330, the ``Delivering Covid-19 Vaccinations to  All Regions and Vulnerable Communities Act'' or ``COVID-19 Delivery  Act,'' which I invite all Members to join as sponsors.   Under the COVID-19 Delivery Act, FEMA will be authorized and directed  to lead the effort for vaccine delivery from the receipt from  manufacturing facilities to delivery to designated inoculation sites  (hospital, clinic, doctors' offices, school, places of worship,  community centers, parks, or neighborhood gathering locations).   The legislation directs FEMA to develop and deploy a fully staffed  and resourced 24-7 advanced real-time tracking system that allows FEMA  to monitor shipments of vaccine units that can provide end-to-end  transparency on the temperature, real-time location, origin, and  destination data, anticipated time of arrival, and report on changes  and update recipients on the progress of their delivery and report on  changes that may impact expected delivery or the viability of the  vaccine while in transit.   FEMA will provide an advanced communication system that allows public  health departments to communicate their vaccine readiness, capability  of receiving vaccines, delivery locations, details of facility  capability of storing, securing, personnel authorized to receive  deliveries, logistics for delivering vaccines to patients, report on  vaccine receipts, condition of vaccines, patient reactions, feedback on  how to improve the process.   H.R. 330 authorizes FEMA to secure transportation for delivery or use  of vaccines, and, when requested, security for the vaccine delivery  sites or inoculation locations to ensure the life and safety of  personnel and patients who seek to provide or receive vaccinations are  free of interference or threat.  [[Page H1264]]    Finally, the COVID-19 Delivery Act directs FEMA to conduct public  education and patient engagement through the provision of inoculations  of persons in areas and locations where vulnerable populations are  under performing in getting vaccinations.   Mr. Speaker, I see the disparities in the lives of so many of my  constituents who suffer disproportionately from medical conditions that  make COVID-19 deadly.   They work low wage or no wage jobs to make ends meet, and they have  no health insurance and rely on community health centers or public  health services for routine care.   I call them friends and neighbors because they are that to me.   No one is benefiting from the COVID-19 economy.   The U.S. poverty rate has grown at a historic rate over the past five  months, with 7.8 million Americans falling into poverty after the  expanded $600 a week in unemployment assistance expired at the end of  July.   This represents the greatest increase since the government began  tracking poverty sixty years ago.   In the city of Houston, nine key service sectors, accounting for 70  percent of all jobs, hemorrhaged more 1,343,600 jobs, which to average  folks is another way of saying that more than 1.34 million persons lost  their livelihoods.   Houston workers lost jobs in the following areas:   Healthcare: 391,000;   Retail: 303,600;   Food services: 267,000;   Finance: 166,000;   Private Education: 63,400;   Arts and Entertainment: 37,400;   Accommodations: 28,700;   Air Transportation: 20,200;   Other Services: 115,800.   In addition to these positions, jobs were also lost in other areas,  the largest of which was the construction industry, which shut down  30,700 jobs.   Professional and business services followed, with 25,300 jobs lost,  although 13,900 were in temporary and provisional jobs in employment  services; upstream oil lost 12,300 in March/April; and non-oil  manufacturing lost 7,700 jobs.   Americans out of work due to COVID-19 have generated 86 million  jobless claims, with new claims being filed in recent weeks topping  800,000.   Millions of Americans who lost their jobs during the pandemic have  fallen thousands of dollars behind on rent and utility bills, a clear  warning sign that people are running out of money for basic needs.   If this is not enough evidence of what is happening just look at the  miles of vehicles lined up outside of food distribution centers for  assistance, as we see nightly on our television screens and in our  communities.   Moody's Analytics warned in November 2020 that 9 million renters said  they were behind on rent, according to a Census Bureau survey.   The Bureau of the Census reports that twenty-one percent of all  renters are behind on their rent, of which twenty-nine percent are  African American families and seventeen percent are Hispanic  households.   According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's analysis of  persons who were employed prior to the pandemic, 1.3 million of these  households are now, on average of $5,400 in debt on rent and utilities,  after the family breadwinners lost their jobs.   The new COVID-19 relief legislation passed last week by Congress and  reluctantly but finally signed by the Senate restores unemployment  assistance, but cuts that assistance from $600 a week to $300 a week  without consideration of the facts on the ground, which are that  millions of Americans remain out of work due to COVID-19 public health  policy, and have been without sufficient income since August 1, 2020.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that as  of February 23, 2021, 28.3 million cases of COVID-19, resulting in more  than 503,000 deaths, had been reported in the United States.   What the costs will be to our nation from this destruction of lives  and livelihoods have yet to be fully calculated.   It is a tragedy that too many households who have lost a member to  COVID-19 are struggling to accept these deaths, but it is also the  friends, co-workers, business owners, professionals, students,  teachers, wives, husbands, brothers, sisters, aunts, cousins, and  grandparents who also are feeling these losses because someone that  mattered to them is no longer here.   Each of these lives impacted dozens of other lives, too many of whom  were not allowed to be present with them during their final moments on  this earth, but whose suffering is too often overlooked because we  unduly preoccupy ourselves with only the immediate family.   I strongly support the Senate Amendment to H.R. 1319, the American  Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and urge all Members to join me in voting for  its passage and to send the message to the American people that their  voices have been heard, their request for assistance answered, and that  help is on the way.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   You know, our friends on the other side of the aisle are deadly  wrong. That is the tragedy of their argument, because the Second  Amendment does not prohibit regulation. It never did. And our Founding  Fathers regulated guns as early as the beginning of this Nation.   And so I rise in support of H.R. 8, and indicate while the COVID-19  pandemic dominated news headlines in 2020, the number of shootings  surged in many communities across America.   Our public health and emergency resources have been straining to  recover from the coronavirus, and budgets are crunched nationwide, and,  as well, gun violence is rising. It is important to note because  approximately 80 percent of firearms used for criminal purposes are  obtained without a background check.   We must strengthen our firearms background checks and close dangerous  gaps, such as the online sale and gun show loopholes.   In the data that we were able to secure, there was nearly one mass  shooting per day in the United States: 355 mass shootings in 2018. We  realize that since December 2012 there have been at least 1,518 mass  shootings with at least 1,715 people killed.   Each day an average of 92 Americans are victims of gun violence,  resulting in more than 33,000 deaths. And I wonder why our friends  could not feel the pain of the loss of guns being transferred illegally  or improperly?   I was here for Columbine. That happened on April 20, 1999. High  school students losing their lives. I was here when babies were killed  in Newtown, Connecticut, on December 12, 2012. I was here in the United  States Congress each moment we tried to pass sensible gun legislation  like H.R. 8.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Thompson for his leadership and  Chairman Nadler.   On February 14, 2018 I was here for Parkland and looked at these  photographs. And as well I was here on May 18 when in San Jose, Texas,  people died. It is time to pass H.R. 8. Stop seeing our children die.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan  Background Checks Act of 2021'' and H.R. 1446, the ``Enhanced  Background Check Act of 2021,'' which would make it illegal for any  person who is not a licensed firearm importer, manufacturer, or dealer  to transfer a firearm to any other person who is not so licensed  without a background check.   A 2013 study found that approximately 80 percent of all firearms  acquired for criminal purposes were obtained from sources who were not  required to run a background check, and that 96 percent of inmates who  were not prohibited from possessing a firearm at the time they  committed their crime obtained their gun this way.   This loophole exists largely because unlicensed sellers need not  conduct any background check under current law, even if the seller  sells a large number of guns.   Under H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021,''  individuals seeking to transfer a firearm under this measure would be  required to visit a licensed firearms dealer to run the necessary  background check before the transfer could be finalized.   H.R. 8 is intended to provide an accurate and speedy manner to ensure  firearms do not end up in the wrong hands.   An internal assessment by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  demonstrated that NICS background checks are approximately 99.3 percent  to 99.8 percent accurate, and in 90 percent of cases, are processed  within 90 seconds.   I am particularly pleased that the rule reported by Rules Committee  makes in order Jackson Lee Amendment No. 12 to H.R. 8, which makes  clear that a gun owner who realizes that he or she is at risk of  suicide may transfer the gun to someone else, if the risk is imminent,  without a background check to prevent self-harm.   The Jackson Lee Amendment will help ensure that no person who is  experiencing a suicidal crisis will feel compelled to retain their gun  when it would be better for them to temporarily transfer it to someone  else.   Mr. Speaker, the American people are demanding effective action to  reduce, if not prevent altogether, the countless mass shootings and gun  violence in our country that continue to claim so many innocent lives.   Newly released data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and  Prevention found firearm-related deaths rose for the second-straight  year in 2016, largely due to spikes in gun violence.   In 2016, the new CDC report on preliminary mortality data shows that  there were more than 38,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S.--4,000 more  than 2015.   An Associated Press analysis of FBI data shows there were about  11,000 gun-related homicides in 2016, up from 9,600 in 2015.   Congress must act to keep our country safe through gun safety and  violence deterrence.   There is nearly one mass shooting per day in the United States--355  mass shootings in 2018.   In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School  in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, 6 adults, and himself.   Since December 2012, there have been at least 1,518 mass shootings,  with at least 1,715 people killed and 6,089 wounded.  [[Page H1294]]    On the night of October 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire on a large  crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las  Vegas Strip, leaving 58 people dead and 527 injured.   And on November 5, 2017, a mass shooting occurred at the First  Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where the gunman, 26-year- old Devin Patrick Kelley, killed 26 and injured 20 others.   Every day, on average, 92 Americans are victims of gun violence,  resulting in more than 33,000 deaths annually.   States with higher gun ownership rates have higher gun murder rates-- as much as 114 percent higher than other States.   A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  looking at 30 years of homicide data, found that for every 1 percent  increase in a State's gun ownership rate, there is a nearly 1 percent  increase in its firearm homicide rate.   Gun death rates are generally lower in States with restrictions such  as safe storage requirements or assault weapons bans.   Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians in the past 33 years: 0.   Because more than 75 percent of the weapons used in mass shootings  between 1982 and 2012 were obtained legally, stronger legislation is  needed to prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands.   Mr. Speaker, enhancing the gun transfer background check system has  consistently garnered broad public support, as high as 92 percent,  because the American people know that the status quo is simply  intolerable and action must be taken to reduce gun violence by keeping  dangerous persons from obtaining deadly weapons.   That begins with passing H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act  of 2021,'' and H.R. 1446, the ``Enhanced Background Check Act of  2021,'' and I urge all members to join me in voting for its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan  Background Checks Act of 2021,'' and urge its quick adoption.   While the COVID-19 pandemic dominated news headlines in 2020, the  number of shootings surged in many communities across America.   Our public health and emergency resources have been straining to  respond to the coronavirus crisis. Budgets are being crunched  nationwide. Across the country, cities and states are struggling to  find the resources to simultaneously address the pandemic and rising  rates of gun violence.   We must take the steps that we know will make us safer.   Because approximately 80 percent of firearms used for criminal  purposes are obtained without a background check, we must strengthen  our firearms background check system and close dangerous gaps, such as  the online sale and gun show loopholes.   Reducing gun violence starts with making sure that individuals who  may not lawfully possess guns do not get their hands on them.   Our citizens overwhelmingly support this measure, and it is critical  we pass it today and enact it into law.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   As indicated, the Jackson Lee amendment is a simple, important, and  straightforward amendment, and it is, frankly, to save lives.   Specifically, the amendment makes clear that a gun owner who realizes  that he or she is at risk of suicide may transfer the gun to someone  else if the risk is imminent, without a background check, to prevent  self-harm.   This amendment will help ensure that no person who is experiencing a  suicidal crisis will feel compelled to retain their gun when it would  be better for them to temporarily transfer it to someone else.   Contrary to what my friends on the other side have said, H.R. 8 does  already exempt from the requirement of a background check ``a temporary  transfer that is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily  harm, including harm to self, family, household members, or others, if  the possession by the transferee lasts only as long as immediately  necessary to prevent the imminent death or great bodily harm, including  the harm of domestic violence, dating partner violence, sexual assault,  stalking, and domestic abuse.''   This amendment, however, clarifies that this last option is available  to someone who is at risk for suicide.   I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment to protect  those who may be a danger to themselves.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Jackson Lee Amendment No. 9  included in the Chairman En Bloc Amendment to H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan  Background Checks Act of 2021,'' which would require a background check  on every gun sale or transfer with limited exceptions, such as gifts to  family members and transfers for hunting, target shooting, and self- defense.   The Jackson Lee Amendment No. 9 makes a simple common-sense  improvement to the bill.   Specifically, the amendment makes clear that a gun owner who realizes  that he or she is at risk of suicide may transfer the gun to someone  else, if the risk is imminent, without a background check to prevent  self-harm.   This amendment will help ensure that no person who is experiencing a  suicidal crisis will feel compelled to retain their gun when it would  be better for them to temporarily transfer it to someone else.   H.R. 8 already exempts from the requirement of a background check ``a  temporary transfer that is necessary to prevent imminent death or great  bodily harm, including harm to self, family, household members, or  others, if the possession by the transferee lasts only as long as  immediately necessary to prevent the imminent death or great bodily  harm, including the harm of domestic violence, dating partner violence,  sexual assault, stalking, and domestic abuse.''   A gun owner who realizes that they are at risk of suicide would have  several options under this bill.   They may loan the gun to a family member pursuant to the family  member exception.   They may ask a gun dealer to store the gun temporarily.   And if the risk is imminent, they may transfer it to someone else,  pursuant to this exception.   This amendment clarifies that this last option is available to  someone who is at risk for suicide.   As Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and  Homeland Security, I urge all members to join me in supporting Jackson  Lee Amendment No. 9 by voting for the En Bloc Amendment to H.R. 8, the  Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8 is a strong bill to expand the federal firearms  background check requirement as our citizens have demanded. To make the  bill even stronger, I offer an amendment that will help save even more  lives.   My amendment would make clear that a gun owner who realizes that he  or she is at risk of suicide may transfer the gun to someone else,  without a background check--if the risk is imminent to prevent self- harm.   The largest number of gun deaths each year are suicides. Studies have  shown that the prevalence of suicide in the United States is directly  linked to the easy availability of guns.   Roughly sixty percent of gun deaths are suicides. Tragically, an  average of 63 people, die by gun suicide every day in the U.S.   The notion that suicides are inevitable, that people will just find  another way, is wrong.   Suicide attempts are often impulsive acts, and forty-eight percent of  people harm themselves within 10 minutes of deciding to attempt  suicide. Seventy-one percent do so within one hour.   But those who reach for a gun during suicidal crises rarely have a  second chance. Eighty-four percent of suicide attempts with a firearm  are fatal. Think about this sad fact.   Temporarily reducing access to guns significantly increases the  likelihood of surviving a suicide attempt.   That is why I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the bloc of  amendments that includes my proposed revision to H.R. 8.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 1 minute to the  distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson), the chairman of  our task force.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Garcia), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Crist).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Lamb).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as has been said over and over again on the floor of the  House, H.R. 8 provides for the legal access to guns. It does not take  away guns from any American.   In addition, the Second Amendment is truly preserved with H.R. 8, and  it is in compliance with the law which allows the regulation of guns,  even with the Second Amendment.   We ask our colleagues to support H.R. 8 and the en bloc amendments  included therein.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want us to be very quiet in this  Chamber, almost to the extent of hearing a pin drop. That is what  happens when you are in prayer: Muslims, Catholics, those of the Jewish  faith, Christians.  [[Page H1309]]  Prayer is the most sacred moment in many faiths, in all faiths.   Imagine that moment in Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal  Church, friends of ours across the Nation. That weekday prayer service  for some is a lifeline for their survival. They are huddled in prayer,  maybe taking care of what they call a broken heart, a bad day at the  office, a need to take care of a wayward child, and in comes this young  man that they saw only as a person in need of prayer.   That is a song we sing. That we are in need of prayer. Just imagine  this pristine, white, old church symbolizing the freedom of slaves,  just imagine these precious souls who were doing nothing but praying.   I want to acknowledge the pain that Whip Clyburn experienced. I saw  him in the aftermath of those days. These were not just his fellow  Americans, they were his neighbors and his friends and interns.   How many remember when the commander in healing, the commander of  bringing people together, President Obama, sang the song Amazing Grace?   That is what life in the midst of a storm is about, and that is what  we are in, in the proliferation of guns.   And my friends on the other side keep throwing darts and bombs about  undermining the Second Amendment. I say it again. From the early stages  of the Founding Fathers in the Bill of Rights, gun usage in America was  regulated. The Heller case does not deny regulation. In fact, there are  aspects that allow it.   So this is a legitimate regulation for safety, not control. Because  Dylann, who went to a gun store and manipulated a gun owner to go and  give him the gun after 3 days because there was something funny about  his information, this will save lives. Ten days is not too long to stop  the loss of life and the bloodshed that was in Mother Emanuel.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 1446 to save lives.    Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for his  leadership, and I thank Whip Clyburn for letting us fix the problem of  criminals getting guns.   Do my friends on the other side of the aisle not understand that  Dylann Roof had a criminal background? What happened is that the  storekeeper, in essence, violated the law. He viewed it as not  violating the law because, after 3 days, there was no answer.   Dylann Roof took a gun and became a mass shooter in America. Yes, if  he had not gotten a gun illegally, these souls would be alive today.   In 2018, there were 355 mass shootings. We have evidence that people  with guns have not stopped a mass shooting. So if there was a person  armed with a gun inside Mother Emanuel praying with a gun, I don't  believe that lives could have been saved.   What I do know is that if this bill, H.R. 1446, had been in place,  that would have allowed a 10-day window to be able to determine whether  Dylann Roof needed to have a gun. It is a simple context, simple facts,  and it should be done to save lives.   I rise in enthusiastic support of H.R. 1446. I thank Whip Clyburn for  his long years of persistence. And our sympathy goes to those who lost  their lives at Mother Emanuel in 2015.   We have come now to be able to say no, criminals should not have  guns, and we should have a NICS system that allowed the full review  background check so that he could not have had a gun. What is wrong  with that?   Are we interested in saving lives the right way?   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1446, the ``Enhanced  Background Check Act of 2021,'' which strengthens the background check  procedures federal firearms licensees or dealers follow before selling  or transferring a firearm.   Under current law, firearms dealers are required to run a background  check on prospective buyers using the NICS.   Over 90 percent of checks are completed within 90 seconds so if the  NICS system has not returned an answer to the licensed firearms dealer  within ten days, the prospective firearms purchaser may file a petition  with the Attorney General for review.   After another 10-day period has expired, the licensed firearms dealer  may sell or transfer the firearm to the prospective purchaser if it has  not received a response through the NICS system and the dealer has no  reason to believe that the purchaser is prohibited from obtaining a  firearm under Federal, state, or local law.   Thus, under this measure, licensed firearms dealers could not sell or  transfer under the ``default proceed'' provision until at least 20 days  have passed since the initial background check.   Madam Speaker, the American people are demanding effective action to  reduce, if not prevent altogether, the countless mass shootings and gun  violence in our country that continue to claim so many innocent lives.   Newly released data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and  Prevention found firearm-related deaths rose for the second-straight  year in 2016, largely due to spikes in gun violence.   In 2016, the new CDC report on preliminary mortality data shows that  there were more than 38,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S.--4,000 more  than 2015.   An Associated Press analysis of FBI data shows there were about  11,000 gun-related homicides in 2016, up from 9,600 in 2015.   Congress must act to keep our country safe through gun safety and  violence deterrence.   There was nearly one mass shooting per day in the United States--355  mass shootings in 2018.   In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School  in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, 6 adults, and himself.   Since December 2012, there have been at least 1,518 mass shootings,  with at least 1,715 people killed and 6,089 wounded.   On the night of October 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire on a large  crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las  Vegas Strip, leaving 58 people dead and 527 injured.   And on November 5, 2017, a mass shooting occurred at the First  Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where the gunman, 26-year- old Devin Patrick Kelley, killed 26 and injured 20 others.   Every day, on average, 92 Americans are victims of gun violence,  resulting in more than 33,000 deaths annually.   States with higher gun ownership rates have higher gun murder rates-- as much as 114 percent higher than other States.   A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  looking at 30 years of homicide data found that for every 1 percent  increase in a State's gun ownership rate, there is a nearly 1 percent  increase in its firearm homicide rate.   Gun death rates are generally lower in States with restrictions such  as safe storage requirements or assault weapons bans.   Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians in the past 33 years: 0.   Because more than 75 percent of the weapons used in mass shootings  between 1982 and 2012 were obtained legally, stronger legislation is  needed to prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands.   Madam Speaker, enhancing the gun transfer background check system has  consistently garnered broad public support, as high as 92 percent,  because the American people know that the status quo is simply  intolerable and action must be taken to reduce gun violence by keeping  dangerous persons from obtaining deadly weapons.   That begins with passing H.R. 1446, the ``Enhanced Background Check  Act of 2021,'' and I urge all members to join me in voting for its  passage.
