 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Family  and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act.   This bill defends American taxpayers against an unchecked,  supercharged IRS and prioritizes customer service and tax return  processing, two of the agency's most important functions.   Included in the Democrats' reckless Inflation Reduction Act this past  summer, the IRS received an additional $80 billion in funding, with  over half directed toward enforcement.   What is worse, the Democrats' bill failed to include any safeguards  to protect low- and middle-income taxpayers from being unfairly  targeted for tax audits.   While the IRS continues to beef up their audit division, the agency  still has 3.7 million unprocessed tax returns and a total of 11.1  million returns awaiting action. This is simply unacceptable. The IRS  should focus on processing these returns, along with addressing the  awful level of customer service currently available to taxpayers.   Law-abiding families and small businesses in Illinois need their tax  returns processed and phone calls answered, not more IRS agents  knocking on their doors with burdensome audits.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this bill.
