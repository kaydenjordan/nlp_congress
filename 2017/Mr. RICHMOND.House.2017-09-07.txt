 Mr. Speaker, I stand here today, as a Member of the  United States House of Representatives, embarrassed. At the same time  that I am embarrassed, I am also dumbfounded.   I know that there are people at home that are thinking: Why would a  Member of Congress, the most prestigious body in the world, be  embarrassed, dumbfounded?   Well, I was always taught that if you show me your budget or if you  show me your legislation, then you are showing me your values.   Representative Scott, my good friend from Virginia, had an amendment  that would strike the prohibition that Federal funds could be used to  desegregate our public schools in this country.   If you look at the GAO study, there are more schools now that are  desegregated than in 1968. We can talk eloquently about the history of  the House and what the Democrats did when they were in control and how  many amendments were made in order. I am not talking about how many  amendments. I am talking about a specifi amendment, a specific issue.    We are perpetuating segregation in the United States of America in  our  [[Page H7112]]  public schools. We are not allowing the States to use funds to promote  integration and diversity among our schools.   My State--and I will own this--is still the only State under a  Federal desegregation order, because we have not completely  desegregated our schools. We still have that ugly history.   With everything going on in this country and school kids probably  huddled around a TV right now watching this institution work and they  are saying: These are our leaders? We elected them to run this country?  Why wouldn't they want me to go to school with other kids of other  races?   That is why I am embarrassed. It is wrong. I don't think we should  just hide behind procedure, but address the issue and the moral failure  and the message that we are sending to our children.
