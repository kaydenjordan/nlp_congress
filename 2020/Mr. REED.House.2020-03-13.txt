 Madam Speaker, I came down this morning, after hearing  Father Conroy give his opening speech, to address this House and to  address this Nation today in these hallowed Halls to send the message  that today is not a day to engage in partisan politics.   As a Republican, my hand is open to my fellow Americans, for us to  come together, to stand with our Nation as we face this coronavirus  crisis across the country.   Madam Speaker, the people of America are who we represent. They are  not Democrat and Republican; they are American. Now is the time to lead  with smart, targeted decisionmaking proposals that will improve their  lives for the better.   God bless.                            ____________________
