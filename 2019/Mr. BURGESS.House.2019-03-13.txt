 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in opposition to the rule providing for  consideration of H. Con. Res. 24 to release the special counsel's  investigation report, a report that, I may note, has not yet been  issued.   The resolution we are considering here today will not change the law;  it will not increase transparency; and it will provide no new benefit  to the American people. Quite simply, this resolution merely  states current law. This resolution simply restates current Department  of Justice protocol.    We had a Member here in this House who was also a physician and who  was a member of the other party, former Congressman McDermott of  Washington State. I remember one time Republicans offered a sense of  Congress resolution that had something to do with taxes. The gentleman  took to the floor of the House and said, if you want to do something  about taxes, do something about taxes, but a sense of Congress  resolution, why you might as well be sending a get-well card to the  IRS.   That is the force with which we are exercising our congressional time  today. Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leadership have decided to use  valuable legislative time to consider a resolution that changes nothing  and does not serve the American people.   In the time that we have spent debating this resolution, we could  have been discussing more serious matters before this body. Let's just  run through a few of them.   The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act has been brought to  the floor 17 times, yet the current Democratic leadership refuses to  bring up this legislation for a vote. I might remind the body that this  bill is not about abortion but saving the lives of children who are, in  fact, born alive.                                time  1230    You know, I don't make it a habit of watching ``60 Minutes'' on  television, but last Sunday night, ``60 Minutes'' had a news story on  the dramatic advances in the treatment and perhaps--perhaps--inching  towards a cure for sickle cell disease.   Sickle cell disease is a painful condition I witnessed many times as  a resident at Parkland Hospital back in the 1970s.   For years, sickle cell received very little attention. Now, I am  happy to say in the last Congress, under the leadership of   Danny  Davis of Illinois, our subcommittee worked on and passed his bill  dealing with sickle cell. It finally was passed by the Senate in  October of last year, and it was signed into law by the President last  December.   As a consequence, the push for sickle cell research has continued.  The 21st Century Cures Act, which this Congress worked on at the end of  the previous administration, certainly can be given some credit for  that. But, I have to tell you, it was dramatic to have the Director of  the NIH interviewed on ``60 Minutes'' talking about a cure for sickle  cell.   So our work that we do here is important. It does impact the lives of  real people, and I think that is just one dramatic example.   Well, another example was the first tax reform, 31 years, that was  signed into law last year, and here we are a month out from tax day. We  could use this time to strengthen the progress we made on the tax  reform that was passed last year.   In the last Congress, we helped American people keep more of their  hard-earned money. We should be working to continue that momentum,  perhaps make those tax cuts permanent for the middle class.   We could be discussing the Democrats' government-run, bureaucratic,  top-down healthcare plan that would strip hardworking Americans of  their private health insurance and offer less coverage at more expense  to American taxpayers, but we are not.   Today, we could be talking about patent abuse entities, so-called  patent trolls, particularly troublesome in the eastern district of  Texas, where most of those cases are litigated.   The House could be considering the Troll Act, legislation that I have  introduced for three terms of Congress to limit patent assertion  entities and protect Americans' intellectual property.   We could be using this time to discuss our Nation's critical need for  border security to protect the American people and defend our borders.   In February of 2019, the shortest month of the year, only 28 days,  more than 75,000 people that we know of crossed the border without  legal status, in excess of a 100 percent increase from the same period  last year. People argue whether that is an emergency. I believe that it  is, but we could be talking about that.   In a week in which more than 150 lost their lives, we could be using  this time to discuss aviation safety and does Congress need to do  anything further to ensure the continued safety of the American  traveling public.   So time and again, we found that Members on the other side of the  dais are far more interested in discrediting the President than working  on policy that will help the American people, this President who, in  the first 2 years and 2 months of this administration, has probably  been more productive than any Presidency in the last 50 years.   And, finally, Mr. Speaker, we could be using this time to address the  false and misleading comments that a member of the Judiciary Committee  made about the Department of Health and Human Services.   Last month, a Member of this House grossly mischaracterized the work  being done by the Department of Health and Human Services to care for  unaccompanied alien children by stating that the Office of Refugee  Resettlement created ``an environment of systemic sexual assaults by  Health and Human Services staff on unaccompanied alien children.''   Mr. Speaker, that accusation is false, and it was made without that  Member ever having visited an ORR facility. Those comments are a  discredit to the effort by dedicated personnel of the Office of Refugee  Resettlement, those employees who deal with a problem that dates back  to the Obama administration when the Office of Refugee Resettlement was  unprepared for the task.    If Democrats don't like the work that the Office of  Refugee Settlement is doing, you are in the majority. You have the  ability to introduce legislation and pass legislation to do something  different.   Instead of standing here today discussing this superfluous  resolution, the Democrats could be using this time to change a law that  they clearly don't like.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the agency's  Administration for Children and Families regarding this issue.                                                  Administration for                                             Children & Families,                                  Washington, DC, February 28, 2019.      Representative Ted Deutch,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Deutch: At the February 26th House       Judiciary Committee hearing, you stated that ORR created ``an       environment of systemic sexual assaults by staff on       unaccompanied alien children'' and went on to conclude that       you have seen ``thousands of cases of sexual assault, if not       by  [[Page H2693]]       HHS staff, then by staff HHS oversees.'' (emphasis added).       However, this is unsupported by the data you provided and       none of the allegations involve HHS employees. By       mischaracterizing the data during a televised hearing, you       impugned the integrity of hundreds of federal civil servants       who, like Commander White, work tirelessly to ensure the       well-being of the nearly 50,000 unaccompanied alien children       who they have been charged by federal law to protect       annually. On behalf of these dedicated employees of HHS       assigned to the UAC program, we request that you apologize to       these career civil servants for your untoward and unfounded       comments. Acknowledging that you were wrong is the moral,       decent and right thing to do.        Child safety is our top priority in managing the UAC       program. All but one of our care facilities are licensed by       the authorizing state residential child care agency, and       operate under intense state and federal oversight. Because       ORR care facilities diligently track all allegations of a       wide range of sexually inappropriate conduct, ranging from       name calling or use of vulgar language to more serious       claims, the data given to Congress by our agency reflects       allegations much broader than just `sexual abuse' (as defined       in 34 U.S.C. Sec. 20341 and in ORR regulations at 45 C.F.R.       Sec. 411.6), to also include `sexual harassment' (as defined       in ORR regulations at 45 C.F.R. Sec. 411.6) and       `inappropriate sexual behavior' (a catch-all category for       sexual behaviors that do not rise to the level of sexual       abuse or sexual harassment).        The total number of sexual conduct allegations reported to       ORR decreased in FY2017 (1,069 total) but otherwise has       generally remained relatively stable each year (FY2015: 1,000       total, FY2016: 1,226 total, FY2018 (through July): 1,261       total). The vast majority of the allegations reported to ORR       are `inappropriate sexual behaviors' involving solely UAC,       and not staff or any other adults. Facilities can often       resolve these allegations by, for example, counseling the       minors about more appropriate behaviors.        More serious allegations rising to the level of `sexual       abuse' are reported to both ORR and the Department of Justice       (DOJ). Of these, the vast majority involve `UAC-on-UAC'       allegations; the distinct minority involve adults. In FY2015,       279 allegations of sexual abuse were reported. Of these, 8.6%       (24 instances) involved allegations of facility-staff-on-      minor sexual abuse. These metrics fluctuated in subsequent       years but remained relatively consistent. In FY2016, ORR and       DOJ received 348 allegations of sexual abuse, and 16.1% (56       instances) involved facility-staff-on-minor allegations; in       FY2017, ORR and DOJ received 264 allegations of sexual abuse,       and 18.6% involved facility-staff-on-minor allegations (49       instances); in FY2018 (through July), ORR and DOJ received       412 allegations of sexual abuse, and 11.9% involved facility-      staff-on-minor allegations (49 instances). Thus, the total       number of incidents of alleged `sexual abuse' involving       facility-staff-on-minor misconduct across a four-year period       spanning the previous administration and this administration       was 178 out of approximately 182,806 children under UAC care       or about 0.10% of all children placed in ORR custody during       that period. None of the allegations involved ORR or other       HHS federal staff. These allegations were all fully       investigated and remedial action was taken where appropriate.        Your office staff requests an additional briefing from ORR       program officials on these allegations. ORR will be happy to       meet with you once you correct the hearing record and provide       an apology to the dedicated men and women working tirelessly       to protect and improve the lives of unaccompanied alien       children in our care.            Sincerely,                                              Jonathan H. Hayes,                                                    Acting Director,                                    Office of Refugee Resettlement.     So here is the bottom line: House Democrats do not like  the President of the United States, and we know that.   Less than 3 months into the 116th Congress, the Democrats have shown  that they will work against President Trump to the detriment of the  American people.   We are here in the United States House of Representatives to serve  the American people, and the legislation we are considering here today  will not do that.   President Trump has urged us at the State of the Union, asked all the  Members present, to reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and  retribution and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation,  compromise, and the common good. I also believe this is possible, and I  recommend we get on with the task.
