 Madam President, I am pleased to rise in support of the  nomination of Rex Tillerson to serve as our next Secretary of State.  The proceedings in the Foreign Relations Committee for his nomination  were fair, exhaustive, and in the best traditions of our committee and  the Senate. Mr. Tillerson completed all of his required paperwork  expeditiously, having met or exceeded the pace set by former Secretary  Hillary Clinton after she was nominated in 2008. He testified in a  public hearing for more than 8 hours and afterward responded to over  1,000 additional questions for the record from committee members.   Opinions and votes today on Mr. Tillerson may differ, but there is no  question that the committee and the Senate have fulfilled their  constitutional responsibility in carefully reviewing his nomination.   As we proceed in ensuring that the new administration has the leaders  it needs to implement our Nation's foreign policy going forward, I have  great confidence that Rex Tillerson will serve the United States well.   In both my private meetings with him and in the hours of public  testimony he offered before the Foreign Relations Committee, it has  become clear that he will be an effective leader at the State  Department. Mr. Tillerson has led an exemplary and honorable life. He  has been at the same company for over 40 years. As an Eagle Scout, he  served as the national president of the Boy Scouts of America.   Furthermore, the nonpartisan Director of the Office of Government  Ethics recently stated that Mr. Tillerson is making a clean break from  Exxon and has even gone so far as to say that Tillerson's ethics  agreement serves as a sterling model for what we would like to see with  other nominees.   Having managed one of the world's largest companies by revenue, with  over 75,000 employees, there is no doubt in my mind that Rex Tillerson  is well qualified to lead the State Department. I encourage all of my  colleagues to support his confirmation and look forward to his service  as our next Secretary of State.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.                            ____________________
