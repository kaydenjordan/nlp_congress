 Madam President, history was made today with the release  of a document by the U.S. Supreme Court. Today, for the first time in  the history of the United States, the Supreme Court has issued a code  of conduct for Supreme Court Justices. Most Americans will be surprised  to learn that this was the first time this code of conduct has been  issued, but that is a fact.   I know this issue better than most because 11 years ago, I wrote to  the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts--along with  several of my colleagues--and told him that the establishment of a code  of conduct for the Supreme Court Justices was long overdue.   After years of refusing to act, a series of scandalous disclosures  involving several Justices on the Court, and the Senate Judiciary  Committee passing legislation sponsored by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse  on ethical reform, the Supreme Court has finally responded. Today, for  the first time in history, the Supreme Court of the United States is at  least saying to the American people: We hear you and understand that  the nine Justices on the Supreme Court are members of a democratic form  of government, not royalty, and that they should be held accountable as  all public servants in the Federal Government are held accountable.   At a glance, this Code of Conduct for Justices of the Supreme Court  is similar to the standards that apply to all other lower court Federal  judges. The Court's code of conduct sets forth several important canons  of conduct, including canons on upholding the integrity and  independence of the judiciary and avoiding impropriety and the  appearance of impropriety.   All of these are important steps, but they fall short of what we  could and should expect when the Supreme Court issues a code of  conduct. The Court's statement on the code specifically notes:         For the most part these rules and principles are not new.    That is a problem because the Court's previous practices were plainly  inadequate. The Court's new code of conduct does not appear to contain  any meaningful enforcement mechanism to hold Justices accountable for  any violations of the code. It also leaves a wide range of decisions up  to the discretion of individual Justices, including decisions on  recusal from sitting on cases.   I am still reviewing the Court's new code of conduct. For now, I  would note that the Court's adoption of this code marks a step in the  right direction. It may fall short of the ethical standards which other  Federal judges are held to, and that is unacceptable. And if it falls  [[Page S5468]]  short, the American people will ultimately have the last word, and the  integrity of the Court is at issue.   We are going to carefully review this proposed code of conduct to  evaluate whether it complies with our goal that the highest court in  the land not languish with the lowest standard of ethics in our Federal  Government. But this release today, long overdue, begins a dialogue  which could end in restoring the integrity of the Court, and that is  long overdue.    Madam President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Judge Ana de Alba to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  Born and raised in California's San Joaquin Valley, Judge de Alba  attended the University of California, Berkeley as an undergraduate and  law student, receiving her B.A. with highest honors in 2002 and her  J.D. in 2007.   Judge de Alba began her legal career as an associate at Lang, Richert  & Patch, PC. There, her practice spanned business, employment,  construction, and personal injury law. Within just 5 years, she became  a partner. While at the firm and in honor of the challenges her own  family faced while working as migrant farmworkers, Judge de Alba  established a monthly worker's rights clinic to help low-wage workers  understand their employment rights.   In 2018, she began her service on the bench as a superior court judge  for the Fresno County Superior Court. Last year, after this body  confirmed her by a vote of 53-45, Judge de Alba joined the Federal  bench as a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of  California.   The American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge de Alba as  ``qualified,'' to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The late  Senator Feinstein strongly supported her nomination, as does Senator  Padilla. With significant judicial experience and an unwavering  dedication to equal justice under law, Judge de Alba will serve  honorably on the Ninth Circuit.   I am proud to support her nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do  the same.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders)  and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Welch) are necessarily absent.
