 Mr. President, I was absent for Senate vote No. 447, the  vote on the motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 471,  Beth Robinson, of Vermont, to be United States Circuit Judge for the  Second Circuit. I would like the record to reflect that had I been  present, I would have voted yes.                            ____________________
