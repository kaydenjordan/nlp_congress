 Mr. President, we have all seen the headlines. We have  all heard the heartbreaking stories. We have all watched as health  insurance markets have edged closer to collapse, and we have noticed a  common theme. ObamaCare is failing in Kentucky and around the country.   In my home State, insurance premiums increased by up to 47 percent.  As insurers flee the market, nearly half of the counties in my State  have only one option for an insurer on the exchange.   Many families' deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses have  skyrocketed to a point that their plans are too expensive to actually  use. In other words, they have health insurance but not necessarily  healthcare. The legacy of ObamaCare is one of increased costs,  diminishing choices, and broken promises.   In four elections in a row, Kentuckians have overwhelmingly rejected  this failed law. The pain caused by ObamaCare is real for millions of  Americans. Listen to this small business owner from Versailles. She  wrote to my office asking for relief. Here is what she said: ``The  first year of ObamaCare, our monthly premiums tripled,'' she wrote, and  now, ``our current plan will be discontinued . . . at the end of the  year.''   ``This is prohibitive for us. We are getting desperate and  discouraged.''   Unfortunately, stories like hers are hardly unique--not in Kentucky  and not across America--because too many are suffering under ObamaCare.  ObamaCare is a direct assault on the middle class, and it will continue  to get worse unless we act.   Both in Congress and in the administration, we are working to fulfill  our commitment to the American people. We remain committed to the  repeal and replacement of ObamaCare with healthcare policies that  actually work. When the House finishes its work on ObamaCare repeal  legislation, I look forward to taking it up here in the Senate. The  administration will continue working to deliver relief and stabilize  health markets, as well. Americans are ready for a better way forward  after the failure of ObamaCare, and I would urge all of my colleagues  to work together so we can deliver it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, as day 2 of the Neil  Gorsuch Supreme Court confirmation hearings continued, Senators and the  American people were able to learn more about his experience as a  jurist and his aptitude to serve on the High Court. We heard directly  from Judge Gorsuch about his views on the role of a judge--to be fair  and impartial, independent, and not beholden to one party over another.  We heard directly from Judge Gorsuch about his views on the role of the  Court to uphold the Constitution and interpret the laws as written, not  legislating from the bench.   We saw him display a masterful knowledge of the law, along with  independence, thoughtfulness, and just the kind of judicial temperament  we expect in a Supreme Court Justice. News outlets across the country  took notice. This is from a CNN report:   [[Page S1900]]              Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch came to the Senate       Judiciary Committee Tuesday prepared to deliver a clear       message: I'm a judge, not a politician. . . . Sitting at a       small table, he turned to listen to each Senator as they       spoke, hour after hour, carefully writing notes before       launching into his replies.    As CNN noted, the questions ``never rattled him'' and ``he showed  command of the law.''   NPR took note of Judge Gorsuch's temperament saying: ``He kept an  even keel throughout the day, rarely betraying more than a hint of  impatience or pique.''   Here is one take from the Washington Post. It said:         Gorsuch is not easily flustered.        Gorsuch presented himself as the picture of a cool, calm,       self-assured justice.        His face often broke into a relaxed smile. He appeared to       be listening to every word every Senator said, and he rarely       stumbled.    And here is another take from the Post:         After more than 10 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for       the 10th Circuit, [Judge Neil] Gorsuch was prepared for how       to respond to questions about judicial independence and how a       judge should consider a decision outside his personal       political ideology.    These are observations made from outside viewers. Their insights  reflect what we have been saying for weeks--that Judge Gorsuch is  exceptionally qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.   I hope our Democratic friends take notice and give him the fair  consideration he deserves, not invent more excuses not to. Because  Judge Gorsuch has performed exceedingly well, some Democrats are  desperately trying to come up with a reason to delay the process, just  as they have done all year on other nominations.   The Judiciary Committee is continuing its work today. As it does so,  I am confident we will continue to see support grow for Judge Gorsuch.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on one final matter, last night  the Senate voted to overturn a harmful regulation that undermines  Alaska's authority to manage its wildlife resources and shifts more  power toward Washington.   Today, we will have yet another opportunity to bring Americans relief  from heavyhanded regulations using a legislative tool provided by the  Congressional Review Act.   That proposal would undo the so-called Volks rule, which is named for  the 2012 Federal court case overturning an ill-advised Obama  administration regulatory action on the same subject. It is a  regulation that purports to look out for the workers' best interests,  but it actually does little to achieve that outcome. The Volks rule  merely empowers Washington bureaucrats and increases paperwork burdens  instead.   As the Coalition for Workplace Safety pointed out, this regulation  does ``nothing to improve worker health and safety,'' it ``directly  contradicts both clear statutory language and two U.S. Court of Appeals  rulings,'' and it also represents ``one of the most egregious end runs  around Congress' power to write the laws.''   I heard from Kentuckians who are simply concerned by this  overreaching regulation and called for Congress to end it. In one  recent letter to my office, the Kentucky Roofing Contractors  Association called for the repeal of the Volks rule because it ``does  nothing to improve workplace safety and could be used to impose costs  on employers for inadvertent paperwork violations.''   In fact, as they point out, it could even ``divert resources away  from efforts to improve work place safety and create jobs.''   In another letter I recently received, a Lexington construction  contractor said he needs his safety supervisors ``constantly walking  jobsites, identifying hazards and making sure our coworkers go home  safely every night,'' but this regulation ``forces me to choose  allocating sources to preventing future accidents or auditing old  paperwork.   That is our decision today: focusing on actual safety of employees or  on more bureaucratic paper pushing.   Senator Cassidy of Louisiana understands the challenges this  regulation presents, and he has been a leader in working to protect  American businesses from these consequences. I appreciate his efforts  and look forward to the Senate passing it soon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk that is due a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.J. Res. 83.    Mr. President, I move that the Senate proceed to  executive session to consider Calendar No. 20, David Friedman to be  Ambassador to Israel.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call with respect to the nomination be waived.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.  [[Page S1925]]     Mr. President, I move to proceed to S.J. Res. 34.
