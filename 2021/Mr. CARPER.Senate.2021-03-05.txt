 Mr. President, this may be the only bipartisan amendment  that we will have the chance to vote on today. The really good news is  that there will be a voice vote.   For the past decade, our Nation's veterans service organizations have  called on Congress to protect our military veteran students and close  the 90-10 loophole that you have heard about. Today, at long last,  Congress heeds that call by harnessing market forces to ensure better  educational opportunities and outcomes for our millions of veterans.  Those millions of veterans and veteran students use their hard-earned  educational benefits at a variety of educational institutions in our  States, including the types of trade and vocational schools that my own  father--maybe your relatives as well--used in World War II and Korea  and Vietnam using the original GI bill.   Let me be clear. Some for-profit schools in this country do a very  good job working with our veterans, preparing them for lives and  careers. Unfortunately, we have seen way too many that do not, and what  we want to do with this legislation is to make sure that the veterans  are protected from the bad actors in the for-profit college sector,  places like ITT Tech and Corinthian, places that no longer exist.   While the American Rescue Plan closes the 90-10 loophole, we  understand the need to make sure we get this right. I am grateful to  our colleagues, for Jerry Moran, and am proud to be joining him, along  with Senators Cassidy and Lankford, in the thoughtful, bipartisan  approach to a contentious issue.   By providing a 6-month delay before the start of the negotiated  rulemaking process, our amendment gives Congress time to work together  with our veterans service organizations on a bipartisan plan to  strengthen these protections for our veterans and taxpayers.   We invite you all to join us in supporting this amendment.
