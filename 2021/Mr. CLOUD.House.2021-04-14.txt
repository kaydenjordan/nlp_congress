 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Corpus Christi, Texas  Police Chief Mike Markle on his career of public service, and to  congratulate him on his upcoming retirement.   From his service in the United States Navy as a hospital corpsman to  his 31-year career service at the Corpus Christi Police Department,  Chief Markle has consistently placed the needs of others before  himself. Enlisting in the police academy in 1989, he protected the  streets for many years with courage and determination. He has served as  a field training officer, on the Honor Guard, and on the SWAT team.   Corpus Christi turned to him to lead during the Police Department's  transition in 2015. As head of the Corpus Christi PD, he pursued  excellence in leadership and a commitment to learning. His priority was  to improve community outreach and address the modern challenges of  policing.   His legacy of helping others stretches beyond his police work, as he  currently serves on the board of directors for the Wesley Community  Center. There is no question that Chief Markle left a lasting impact on  the Coastal Bend region, and he will be sorely missed.   I thank him for his commitment to protecting the citizens of Corpus  Christi, and I wish him well in his future endeavors.                            ____________________
