 Madam Speaker, given all of the talk that is going on  and the investigations and questions about deficits and the like, I  thought it would be useful today to start this discussion, which I will  spend most of the evening talking about American manufacturing, but I  often want to start these discussions with some sense of value: What is  our goal? What are we trying to accomplish here?   I keep going back to FDR. At the height of the Great Depression, he  said: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the  abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for  those who have too little.''   And so, last week, the House of Representatives--the Democrats, that  is, and maybe just a few Republicans--voted to increase the minimum  wage across this Nation so that, over the next 5 years, the minimum  wage would rise from, I guess, just over $7 an hour to $15 dollars an  hour--not a jump immediately, but over time increase it.   Why do we do that? Well, we are for the people.   That is our goal: for the people; and keeping in mind what FDR said:  It is not about whether we add more to those who have much, but,  rather, what we do for those who have little.   And so we raise the minimum wage. Why? Because those people who are  making $7 an hour across this Nation, they have very, very little, in  fact, so little that they cannot have both food and shelter.   And, of course, we talk about healthcare and our goal to expand  healthcare to every American so they have insurance, so that the  worrying about how they would be paying for their hospital visit or  their doctor is set aside and they are able to get the care that they  need to lead a healthy and productive life.   That is our goal. We are for the people, and we are going to address  this in so many, many ways.                                time  2000    One of the ways that we want to address it is to make sure that  America remains a strong manufacturing country.   Many, many years ago in California, I was looking at how to keep the  California economy going, and we hit upon the five keys for a  successful economy:   First of all, a great education system so that your workers are well  educated and can handle the questions of the day and the tasks of  tomorrow;   Secondly, that there be strong research, and, from that research, you  build tomorrow's things. Sometimes that is an app. Sometimes it is a  computer. Sometimes it is a ship or perhaps a car, an autonomous  vehicle, a drone, whatever, so that your research then moves on into  things that you make, and, that is, the manufacturing. That is the  creation of wealth.   Some time ago, I was visiting one of the wineries in my district in  California, and I was talking about this Make It In America Agenda in  manufacturing. And, finally, the owner got up from behind the desk, and  he said: Come. I want to talk to you.   We walked outside and out to his winery, and he said: You know what  this is?   I said: Yeah. It is a winery.   He said: No. This is a manufacturing facility. I take grapes, and I  turn them into some of the finest wine in the world. So, when you talk  about Make It In America, guess what. I am making it in America.   So, it includes all of these things, putting a tomato into a can,  into a bottle of ketchup. But what we are going to talk about tonight  is something far more than that.   I want to really not so much talk about these gentlemen and ladies,  but to use them as an example of what America used to make. These  gentlemen, three of them, are World War II merchant mariners.   This is an effort we have now under way to provide these mariners,  who had the highest death rate of any unit in the armed services during  World War II, a Congressional Gold Medal. We now have nearly 300  Members of this House who are signed on to that so that they will get a  Congressional Gold Medal.   But this is not about their gold medal; it is about what they were  able to do.   America, during the World War II period, was the manufacturing center  of the world. And we made ships--literally, thousands and thousands of  ships--that these gentlemen and so many like them sailed the oceans,  provided the material, the personnel to fight that war.   When we met and took this picture, they asked me: Why is it that  America doesn't build ships anymore?   I said: Oh, but we build naval ships; we build aircraft carriers; we  build destroyers; we build many other kinds of naval ships.   They said: No. No. That is not what we are talking about. We are  talking about the ships that sail the high seas. Why doesn't America  make those ships?   And I said: We can. We can if we write the laws in the proper way to  encourage the shipbuilding industry and, just as important, the cargo  to go on those ships.   Now, it happens that America is in the midst of a great energy  revolution--the green energy, no doubt about it. We are talking about  every kind of green energy, from wind to solar, biofuel and biomass,  and on and on. And we are doing that.   But, simultaneously, America, over the last decade, has become a  major developer and supplier of petroleum products: oil, as a result of  fracking in the Bakken area and Texas, California, onshore, offshore.  We are a major oil producer.   And, simultaneously, we are also a major producer of natural gas. All  of these energy supplies, whether they are the green energy or the  petroleum energy, are a strategic national asset.   And, as these gentlemen told me: Our ships, during World War II, were  a strategic national asset. We had oil tankers, we had cargo vessels,  all of them built in America and with American mariners.  [[Page H7228]]    We, the mariners, we were a strategic asset. And a lot of us died.  Our ships were a strategic asset, and the oil that we sent around the  world was also a strategic asset.   So, where are we today? Are we making ships? Nope. We are not. But we  could.   So, this last week, Senator Roger Wicker--my colleague in the Senate,  a Republican from the Gulf Coast--and I introduced, for the second  Congress, the Energizing the American Shipbuilding Act, taking a  strategic national asset, our petroleum and natural gas, and welding it  together with the shipbuilding industry, which gives us the strategic  ships that we need to move our military around the world and to provide  the energy that they need.   So, the Energizing the American Shipbuilding Act is now introduced in  the Senate, for the second session, last year and again this time  around with the new session of Congress.   What we will do is to address this problem: We could buy ships that  are made in China, Japan, and Korea, or we can make them in America. If  we make the ships in America, we will provide thousands of jobs, not  only in the shipyards and the steel industry and the aluminum industry,  but also the maritime suppliers, the men, the factories here in the  United States that build the pumps, build the engines--the electrical  engines, the big diesel engines--that are in these ships or the LNG  engines that are in these ships, and all of the electronics.   That entire array of equipment that goes into a ship could be built  in America if the Energizing the American Shipbuilding Act were to  become law.   So, how does it work? Pretty simple. It simply requires that our  strategic national asset, the petroleum and the natural gas, be  exported on American-built ships with American mariners--not all of it,  just a small percentage of it, 15 percent of the oil and 10 percent of  the natural gas, which will be liquified natural gas on American-built  ships.   What does that mean? That means that American shipyards that are now  producing zero commercial oil tankers and zero LNG carriers would, over  the next 13 to 15 years, build upwards of 40 ships: 25 to 30 LNG  tankers and 10 to 15 oil tankers.    Thousands of jobs would be created in American shipyards, and that  strategic national asset, the shipyards themselves, would be able to  continue to operate here in the United States. They would continue to  be able to have the skilled workforce and, simultaneously, be better  prepared to compete for the U.S. naval ships, giving the American  taxpayer a strategic advantage, more competition in the shipyards, more  competition when it comes time to build our naval vessels.   There is another aspect of this that I want to bring to your  attention. Beyond the shipbuilding and the Energizing the American  Shipbuilding Act, there is the rest of manufacturing here in the United  States.   About 8 years ago, when I first came to Congress, we were looking at  this issue based upon my time in California, and we decided, together  with Steny Hoyer, who is now our majority leader, that we should  establish the Make It In America program. We have been working on this  for 8 years now, and we are looking at different pieces of legislation  over time to encourage the manufacturing here in the United States.   One of the ways we can do this--and we are not going to go into the  President's tariffs right now, but we are going to go at it in a little  different way. Here is just an example of about what happened almost a  decade ago.   In California, it was time to build the new San Francisco Bay Bridge.  The bid went out. The State of California went out to bid on this thing  for the steel in the bridge.   At that time, a Chinese company decided that they wanted to enter the  market. Very specialized steel in this bridge in the San Francisco  area, so they wanted to enter the market, and they produced a bid that  was 10 percent lower than an American steel company.   China got the bid. What did they get? Not only did they get the job;  they got a new steel mill, one of the most advanced in the world, and  they also had some over 3,000 jobs in China.   At the very same time, New York was building the Tappan Zee Bridge.  They said, no, we are only going to buy American steel, and so they  did, total cost, $3.9 billion.   In California, total cost, $3.9 billion over the estimated cost. Why?  Because the Chinese steel had problems, the welds and other problems  with the steel.   Not in New York. They came in on the bid, and there were 7,700  American jobs in the steel industry and in the manufacturing and  engineering--just.   An example, not current today, but certainly current nearly a decade  ago.   But this is what happens when our laws or our governments decide that  we are going to make it in America, we are going to produce the steel,  we are going to build the bridges here in the United States.   So, building on this idea, we have now introduced in both the Senate  and the House another Make It In America piece of legislation. This  legislation is authored in the Senate by Senator Tammy Baldwin and here  in the House by me.   It basically says that all of this talk about infrastructure, which  is critically important, that that infrastructure, if it is an American  taxpayer dollar that is being used to build that infrastructure-- whether that is a power line or a highway or a sanitation system or a  water system or an airport--if there is a Federal dollar involved, that  we make it in America.   It simply applies to all types of infrastructure. When American  taxpayer dollars are being used, that that infrastructure--the steel,  the pipe, the electronics, the other elements that are in that  infrastructure--that they be made in America.   So it is part of our Make It In America agenda that we have been  working on all these years, and we are going to apply it wherever we  see an opportunity. If it is in the steel industry for bridges and  infrastructure, you bet. You bet, we are going to make sure that it is  made in America.   Many of these laws already exist. A couple of years ago, we were able  to raise the percentage of American content by a couple of percentage  points to about, if I recall, about 65 percent on certain  infrastructure projects. But we want to extend that beyond.   And why not go the whole way? Let's make it all in America. If it is  a taxpayer dollar, 100 percent American made. That is our goal. So our  Make It in America agenda goes forward from here.   I am going to end with putting this one back up again because this  has an opportunity to be a very, very important part. The steel in the  ships, the pumps, the pipes, the electronics, the propellers, the drive  shaft, the engines--all of those things--can be made in America if we  have a national policy that simply says the export of a strategic  national asset, oil and gas, that that be on American-built ships. Not  all of it, 10 percent, 15 percent, 40 ships over the next 15 years or  so when the Energizing the American Shipbuilding Act becomes law.                                time  2015    We are looking for support. We have broad support right now, both  Republican and Democratic, with Senator Wicker from Mississippi and  Senator Casey from Pennsylvania. On this side, about 30 of my  colleagues, Democratic and Republican, have signed up in support of  this legislation.   It has great potential. It has great potential, but not so much for  these mariners. They are all in their nineties right now. Hopefully, we  will be able to get them a Congressional Gold Medal.   For tomorrow's mariners, for those men and women who will be on ships  that will supply the necessary material, oil, gas, or whatever for our  military around the world, and will participate in the annual commerce  of goods and services that are being transported in and out of America,  that next generation of mariners will have the ships, jobs, and cargo.   For the People, once again, we are constantly looking for different  laws, different ways in which we can advance the well-being of the  American public. If it is healthcare, we are looking to lower costs. If  it is education, we want to make sure that the cost of college  education is affordable. If it has to do with jobs, we are looking for  ways to make that happen by requiring that your tax dollars be spent on  American-made equipment, by requiring that a  [[Page H7229]]  small percentage of the export of a precious national resource be on  American-built ships with American sailors.   I want all of us to keep in mind that there are things that public  policy can do to improve the well-being of every American. Our For the  People policy includes all of these elements, and we draw your  attention to that.   I am looking to my colleagues for continued support on these two  pieces of legislation that we will be working on in this session.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
