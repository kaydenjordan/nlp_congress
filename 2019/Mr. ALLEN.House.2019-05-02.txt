 Mr. Speaker, today we observe the 68th annual National Day  of Prayer, a day dedicated to bringing men and women of all faiths  together in prayer for this great Nation.   Statistically, only about 14 percent of Americans read the Bible and  pray on a daily basis. That is why this year's theme focuses on our  love for one another, just as we learned in the teachings of Jesus in  John 13:34: Love one another just as I have loved you.   This theme is just as important in our Nation today as it has been  throughout our history. Right now,  [[Page H3410]]  America is a divided nation, and we are fighting for the values that  this great country was founded upon. More than anything else we need  unity.   Mark 3:24 says: If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom  cannot stand. But to find unity, we must put our faith before our  politics. We must do what is right for the American people. Why?  Because our faith unites us in Christ.   Jesus prayed for us, in John 21:17, that: All of them may be one,  Father, just as You are in me and I am in You. May they also be in us,  so that the world may believe that You have sent me.   I encourage all Americans to join me in celebrating the National Day  of Prayer and humbly come before God to seek his guidance on how we may  become one America.                            ____________________
