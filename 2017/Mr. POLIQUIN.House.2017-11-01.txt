 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and the  underlying bill, Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017.   I do thank the gentleman from Washington State for this time. I urge  all Members, Republicans and Democrats, to support the rule and the  underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I want to focus my remarks on one specific and very  important section of the underlying bill. This pertains to allowing  young men and young women the opportunity to work and to learn the  family trade of logging.   Now, logging is a very big business in the State of Maine. About 90  percent of our State, Mr. Speaker, is forested, and we have generations  and traditions of logging in the State of Maine. Logging is often a  family-run business where the practice and the technique of harvesting  and then transporting saw logs to mills are passed down from one  generation to another.   Now, H.R. 2936 brings Federal regulations in line with this new  technology and new standards of safety by allowing family-owned logging  businesses  [[Page H8312]]  the ability to train 16- and 17-year-olds under very close supervision  of their parents.   We need to make certain, Mr. Speaker, that the next generation of  loggers are able to learn what they need to know, how to run these  family-run businesses, including the operation and maintenance of their  equipment. We do this, please, by supporting the Resilient Federal  Forests Act of 2017.   This bill, Mr. Speaker, will ensure that the long-term health of the  logging business industry is supported and can continue from one  generation to another.
