 Mr. Speaker, last week, I had the  opportunity to visit every county in the district I represent on an  annual agenda day tour. I shared with local media and constituents the  legislative agenda for 2018, as well as my appreciation for the  Republican tax reform bill, which has already created jobs.   While walking through Walgreens 2 weeks ago, the owner of Mooneyhan's  Auto Service, Bill Mooneyhan, told me that, as a direct result of  Republican tax cuts, he is adding a new bay to his shop.   Nephron Pharmaceuticals of Cayce, led by Lou and Bill Kennedy,  announced an annual $1,000 pay increase and is adding 125 jobs in  Lexington County.   American Airlines and Aflac are adding jobs, while countless other  businesses are providing pay increases and bonuses for their employees.   I am grateful for the leadership of President Donald Trump, Speaker  Paul Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Republican Whip Steve  Scalise, and Chairman Kevin Brady. I thank them for providing much- needed tax relief for citizens to create jobs.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Best wishes to Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed and Marie Royce  on their decision to conclude service in Congress.                            ____________________
