 Mr. President, today I would like to  congratulate Randall ``Randy'' C. Gordon on his retirement from the  National Grain and Feed Association, NGFA, after nearly 43 years of  service.   A native Nebraskan, Randy graduated from the University of Nebraska- Lincoln, UNL, with undergraduate degrees in journalism, history, and  political science. After college, Randy worked at UNL's Agricultural  Communications Department and freelanced for the Omaha World-Herald.   Randy's NGFA story began on July 1, 1978, when he was hired as the  director of information services. In 1987, he was promoted as NGFA's  vice president for communications and government relations. A voracious  reader and writer, in 1996, Randy authored a history of the first 100  years of the NGFA for its centennial celebration, entitled ``A Century  of Agricultural Abundance Through Free Enterprise.'' In 2005, the Food  and Drug Administration awarded Randy for his contributions to  preventing the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, in the  United States. In 2012, Randy became president and CEO of NGFA. Through  more than four decades of NGFA service, Randy has made countless  contributions to the U.S. agricultural industry.   As the senior senator from Nebraska, I congratulate Randy on a  successful and impactful career representing crucial aspects of the  agricultural value chain. Randy, I wish you, your wife Barbara, and  your children and grandchildren good health as you enter retirement.  You have done Nebraska proud.                            ____________________
