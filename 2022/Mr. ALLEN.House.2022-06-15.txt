 Mr. Speaker, with inflation at a 40-year high and a  sluggish economy, attacking workers' freedoms should be the furthest  thing from the President's mind.   President Biden's Department of Labor is in the process of changing  the definition of an employee to include independent contractors. This  would be devastating for the 19 million Americans who currently enjoy  the flexibility that comes with building wealth by participating in the  American Dream.   Under this change, workers classified as independent contractors  would be subject to the same employment-related restrictions as  traditional employees. This is an assault on the modern American  worker.   Independent contractors were responsible for over 70 percent of the  job growth during the last economic expansion before COVID. If we want  to spur economic growth, we must remove barriers and allow our  workforce to flourish.   Fortunately, my legislation, the Employee Rights Act, would codify  protections for independent contractors, shielding them from these  overreaching classifications.                            ____________________
