 Mr. Speaker, sharing a jail cell with John Lewis was  one of the greatest privileges of my life.   When we were arrested for protesting the genocide in Darfur a few  years back, we were put into a police van, booked, and fingerprinted.  John had been arrested over 40 times for peaceful protests by that  point, so let's just say he had some advice.   John made trouble like this because he knew that words aren't enough  and that real change requires action. He called it the struggle of a  lifetime, but it was never his struggle alone. He challenged all of us  to fight injustice and oppression and to stand up for civil rights and  for human rights.   Mr. Speaker, John was a great man. He was an American hero who called  our country to a higher standard. But perhaps more importantly, he was  a very good man. He treated every single person he met, no matter who  they were, with dignity and respect. When he saw wrong in this world,  he did his best to make it right.   Lisa, Patrick, Molly, and I miss you already, John. We love you, and  we will never stop making good trouble in your name.
