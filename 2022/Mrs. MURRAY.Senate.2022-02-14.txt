 Madam President, I come to the floor tonight to urge my  colleagues to vote here in a minute to confirm Dr. Robert Califf to  serve as Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. He was  confirmed to this role previously with strong bipartisan support. I  hope to see that again this evening.   At this critical moment, we need a trusted hand to lead the FDA, and  Dr. Califf's previous service in this role, his career as one of the  Nation's leading research scientists, give him the experience to take  on this challenge.   Families across the country count on the Food and Drug Administration  every day to follow the science and the data to keep them safe, and  COVID-19 has put its work in the spotlight like never before.   This pandemic has been incredibly hard on our Nation. It has killed  over 900,000 Americans. And throughout this crisis, as people have  sought to keep their families safe, they have looked to the FDA and  depended on the tireless work of FDA scientists to confirm the safety  and effectiveness of treatments and vaccines, ensure we have high- quality masks, and review tests to make sure they give us accurate  results and more.   Parents across the country are continuing to wait anxiously for the  FDA to greenlight safe, effective vaccines for kids under 5--something  I know we all want to see as quickly as the science allows.   But while the COVID-19 pandemic remains one of the most urgent  challenges we face, there are countless other ways the FDA works that  matters to families.   Every day, people put the well-being of themselves, their families,  and even their pets in the FDA's hands. When we sit down for a meal, we  count on the FDA's efforts to ensure the safety of our food supply and  provide us with the information we need to make healthy choices. When  we get our prescriptions filled or rely on medical devices to stay  healthy, we count on the FDA's work to uphold the gold standard of  safety and effectiveness.   The FDA needs strong leadership to continue that work and to address  other pressing challenges: challenges like the opioid crisis, which  recently claimed over 100,000 lives in a year--that is a new record;  challenges like youth tobacco use--according to the CDC, 2 million of  our youth use e-cigarettes; challenges like antimicrobial  [[Page S666]]  resistance, which could make common procedures more dangerous by making  current infection treatments ineffective; challenges like skyrocketing  drug costs and pharmaceutical companies who game the FDA approval  system to keep more affordable drugs off the market; and challenges  like improving health equity.   I have repeatedly raised the need for the FDA to improve diversity in  clinical trials because, when women or people of color or others are  left out of the clinical trials, this undermines people's health by  delaying information they and their healthcare providers need to  understand how a treatment will affect them specifically--for example,  whether it is safe during pregnancy--and by making it hard to identify  differences in the safety and effectiveness of treatments for those  populations.    As the hard-working staff at the FDA continues to tackle these  challenges, they deserve a Senate-confirmed leader with experience on  these issues to lead those efforts. Dr. Califf worked on these  challenges before, when he was previously confirmed to lead FDA in an  overwhelming bipartisan vote, and he demonstrated in his hearing with  the HELP Committee that he is ready to take them on again and return as  Commissioner.   So I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm Dr.  Califf and working with him to ensure that the FDA continues to protect  our families, uphold the gold standard of safety and effectiveness, and  put science and data first.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
