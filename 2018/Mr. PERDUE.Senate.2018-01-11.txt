 Mr. President, today I was honored to be invited to the  White House and included in a small meeting with President Trump, and  it was very clear that I was invited to the White House to stand firm  with President Trump today. We talked about immigration, and today I  was proud to stand with our President.   We have been crystal clear. Chain migration must end, period. Any  solution to our current immigration crisis that the U.S. Senate will  consider must include ending chain migration. Before I talk about the  details of what chain migration is, I want to put it in perspective.   Our immigration crisis today has been longstanding. We had a law  written in 1965 and other changes in 1986, but it has really not been  since 1991 that there has been any meaningful immigration change.   Three times in the last 11 years, well-intended people in this body  and in the House have done a yeoman's job of trying to solve the  comprehensive problem of immigration in the United States--without  success. Here we are, again, right now, facing a deadline that the  President has put on, and rightfully so. We have a sense of urgency.  [[Page S160]]  The President has done a couple of things. He has defined the scope of  the problem, and he has defined a sense of urgency for the people in  Congress.   The legal immigration system right now is broken, but to deal with  that, we have to deal with our entire immigration system in pieces. The  reason I believe most past efforts have failed is that they tried to do  a comprehensive solution.   Today, we are breaking it into three areas. One is our legal  immigration system, and the next step might be our temporary work  visas. Today, we bring in about 1.1 million legal immigrants a year,  and I will talk about how that relates historically. But we issue about  2.2 million temporary work visas a year. Then the third issue is, of  course, the people who are in the United States illegally.   President Trump had a meeting 2 days ago at the White House. In that  meeting, he had Democrats, Republicans, Members of the House, and  Members of this body, the Senate, and he drove consensus in that  meeting.   It was very interesting that he had the media in there for almost 60  minutes for an open dialogue, and we heard from all people in that room  about their position on these topics. I thought it was very interesting  that the President had the courage to put this issue in front of the  American people and create an air of transparency that we have not had  on this issue in decades. In that meeting, he drove two conclusions:  one, a scope of the problem and, two, a sense of urgency.   The scope is very simply defined as this: We have to address the DACA  situation. The President has given Congress the date of March 5 to come  up with a solution for these individuals who are in the country  illegally--but not of their doing.   The second issue is border security. We know that border security is  a national security issue as much as it is an immigration issue. The  good news is that we know that illegal crossings of our southern border  are down dramatically this year just because of a couple of reasons.  One is the enforcement of current law, and the second is an  understanding around the world that we are going to deal with this  issue.   The third piece of the scope is chain migration. Any solution to the  DACA situation or the legal immigration situation must include  addressing the chain migration issue.   Then the last is this archaic diversity visa lottery we have in the  United States that was related to at least one of the terrorist  attacks, and chain migration was involved in both of the terrorist  attacks we have recently experienced here in the United States.   With regard to DACA, the first item on the scope is that we know we  have a March 5 deadline. There is a growing consensus in this body of  how to deal with that, and there is great latitude on the part of  Republicans in this body to deal with that in a way, with our  Democratic partners here, to get a consensus bill that solves this once  and for all.   The second is border security. Here, with the President's leadership  and in these recent meetings with Democrats and Members of the House,  there is a growing consensus that we can deal with the national  security issues related to our southern border. We don't need a 2,000- mile wall, as even the President of the United States has said just  this week. But there are things we need to do, and we need to do them  quickly.   The President today said that his goal is to get this done this year.  Coming from the real world, I know that is possible. This President,  who comes from the real world and is an outsider to this community here  in Washington, knows that is possible, and I think he is going to hold  us accountable to that.   The third area I mentioned before is chain migration. I will say more  about that in a minute.   The fourth is the diversity lottery. This diversity lottery has not  served us well. It is not the number; it is the way it is being  handled. We know there is fraud, and we know this is a loophole  terrorists are now using to put people in their chain inside the United  States.   There is a growing consensus on these four items of this scope that  the President has defined, and we had a consensus in that room 2 days  ago in the White House. There is consensus that we can get to a  solution within the timeframe here, but let me be very clear. Any  deal--whether it is in business, sports, or certainly in politics--has  to have some symmetry. Therefore, any solution for the DACA situation  must include a solution for our chain migration crisis.   We must continue working with the President. He is holding us  accountable. He is moving at a business pace, but to do that, we really  have to talk about chain migration. I understand there are other areas  that we have to talk about, as well, but there is a lot of  disinformation about what it really is.   Chain migration is nothing more than a law put in place in 1965 to  allow legal permanent residents and U.S. citizens to sponsor people for  U.S. citizenship. It was put in place in 1965. It has been updated a  little bit. But today, a legal permanent resident--for the most part,  this is someone who has come in qualified in our legal immigration  system, who goes through a 5-year waiting period, who eventually can  apply for U.S. citizenship. While they are a legal permanent resident,  almost immediately they can sponsor spouses, minor children, and  unmarried adult children. That is current law.   Once they become a citizen--and this is true of any U.S. citizen,  whether they were a recent immigrant or were born here; a U.S. citizen  can sponsor their parents, their spouses, minor children, unmarried  adult children, married adult children, and siblings   The issue around this is pretty simple. We have a chart here which  shows that in 1965, when this law was put in place, approximately  300,000 U.S. citizens were brought into the United States in that year  under this system. Last year, we had, roughly, about 1.1 million. We  had a high of somewhere close to 1.3 million. But we can see, this is a  geometric progression that increases unbounded. It is not really the  number here, but it is the balance that we have lost.   What happens, and the criticism I have as a business guy looking at  this, is that the individuals who determine who future immigrants are  going to be are current and recent immigrants.   We don't have many guidelines. We have a country cap system which  says that most countries have a percentage of the total they have to  have, and they can't exceed that. But there is no real cap here, such  that if all these numbers were maximized, then over time you would see  this number go up geometrically.   We have a second chart that shows this and demonstrates that over a  very short period of time, the numbers can increase dramatically, as we  have seen in the last 40 or so years.   There have been studies on this. Princeton has a study which says  that right now, based on recent history, any immigrant who comes in  sponsors somewhere around 3.5 future immigrants within a short period  of time. We don't know what the 3.5 immigrants do when they get  sponsored and become citizens or legal permanent residents, but if you  extrapolate this out--let's say we start with 2 million as a starting  point. They become citizens and they sponsor--let's just say the number  is 3. In the first iteration, now we have 6 million people sponsored by  the original 2 million; then the second iteration goes from 6 to 18;  and in the fourth iteration we are at 54 million people. So all of a  sudden, as you can see, there is no limit here, other than the country  caps, and the country caps do not limit the total number. They limit  the mix.   What is wrong with this system? The problem, as I said just now, is  that future immigrants are determined by current immigrants without any  regard to their ability to participate in the system.   The second one is that because you can bring parents in, immigrants  who come in under this system and become U.S. citizens can bring their  parents in, and all of a sudden, now we have an aged population coming  in--not a younger population--and they then draw social services on an  already bankrupt system.   Chain migration is not based on skill or the ability to participate  in the current economic situation in the United States. Last year, we  brought in 1.1 million immigrants. Of that, 140,000 were immigrants who  were related to the worker; 70,000 were the workers, and the other  70,000 were their immediate family. So we can see that over 950,000  people were derivative iterations of what I am talking about.  [[Page S161]]    The third thing is that if chain migration is not stopped, it  continues to incentivize future illegal immigration because of what you  can do once you get here.   Chain migration is another problem with the DACA situation because if  you permit a pathway to some sort of legalized situation in the United  States for the DACA population, you end up with a situation where those  people who are then legalized can sponsor their parents. The problem  with that is, the DACA population is not violating fair law, but their  parents have.    The last issue I will bring up is, the national security issues are  profound. We have seen two national security incidents just this past  year related to chain migration and the diversity visa lottery. There  is more than enough evidence to show this has to be addressed.   Again, any symmetric deal on immigration has to include, I believe,  the four points the President talked about the other day. We have to  deal with the DACA situation. We have to deal with our border security,  and that means building a wall. We have to deal with the chain  migration issues, and we have to deal with this diversity visa lottery.  The President demands it. The American people demand it. Today, as a  matter of fact, over 80 percent of America believes we need to deal  with the DACA situation. Likewise, 72 percent of people in America  believe the immigration law should be the worker, the spouse, and their  immediate minor children only--72 percent. I can't think of another  issue that has come before this body where we had those sorts of  agreements in the American population.   The President wants results. He has charged leadership in this body  and the House and those of us who have been involved in this for some  time to get to it. There is a March 5 deadline looming. Some people say  there is a January 19 date that has to do with funding the government.  I personally believe the two have nothing to do with each other, but we  want a sense of urgency. The President has demanded it. We need it.   We know there are going to be other steps. This is not the last step  to this problem. We know we have to deal with how we bring people to  the United States. We need a balance. Of course, we want to continue to  be the open arms of the world today in terms of welcoming people to our  shores. Just look at what is written on the Statue of Liberty. Who can  argue with that? At the same time, we have to have a balance. Right  now, we don't bring in people who are contributing to the economy, for  the most part, and we are eliminating--we are not bringing in people  who can contribute. All we are asking for is a dialogue to bring  balance back to that system.   I am excited to be a part of this dialogue because I believe we have  a unique, historic opportunity with people on the other side and people  on this side who generally have hearts that are not that dissimilar  with regard to how to deal with the DACA population, how to deal with  the Dreamers population, how to deal with future immigrant populations  that are coming to the United States. We can have those debates, and we  are having them now. I welcome input from all points. I am anxious to  get to the bottom line of this.   I will close with this. It is exciting to have leadership from the  executive branch on this issue that has put the responsibility back on  this body to come up with something that will not allow us to be back  here in the next 3, 5, or 20 years dealing with this same problem. We  have a historic opportunity. It is time to get to it.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.                             Judicial Nominations
