 Mr. Speaker, we awoke this morning to daunting news  in this Nation, and I know that the Nation prays.   I want to thank the gentlewoman from Washington for her distinguished  service, and our fellow coleaders and cosponsors, Congresswomen Kuster,  Garcia, and Frankel, and, really, all of those who rose in the  immediacy of our visit to be able to sign on to H. Res. 1153.   In the spirit of our late friend and colleague, America is better  than this. America is better than this.   First, to my Republican friends, I hope that they will rise today and  vote for this legislation. If they read it, they will understand there  is no condemnation of ICE. There is accountability that each and every  one of us who serves the people of the United States is obligated to  do. We are obligated to be accountable. We are obligated to treat every  human being with decency.   Though this is a circumstance that pained my heart, am I reminded of  the man that killed nine at Mother Emanuel Church and was taken to get  a burger before he was taken to jail because he said he was hungry.   No one seems to condemn that. It certainly hurt my heart. Nine people  of faith praying were killed, murdered in their church, and left lying  in blood. But he was taken to get a burger.   Why should these women be treated any less?   This resolution, why is it so intimidating? All we say is, condemning  the performance of ``unwanted, unnecessary medical procedures on  individuals without their full, informed consent,'' recognizing that  ``everyone deserves to control their own reproductive choices and make  informed choices about their bodies.'' We have been saying that all  along.   My friends on the other side of the aisle, I hope they join in that.  They want a singular path. We say people with their God, women with  their God, their family, and their medical professional.   Acknowledges that ``further accountability, oversight, and  transparency is necessary to protect people in the custody'' of DHS and  ICE, to make sure these women are not deported as we are in the midst  of an inspector general's report.   Thankful to the Judiciary Committee, the chairman, and the colleagues  who led this letter of over 180-plus Members. That IG's investigation  is proceeding, but they need to have those witnesses, and this  resolution is crucial because it lays out intimate facts that we heard  personally from women.   I don't know whenever--I know that I was here for debates on partial- birth abortion. That is obviously not what it was. It was a medical  procedure to save the mother's life. But when have we ever discussed  the private examinations of women, how private we are in order to get  America to understand how this was?   Women should rise up, not respecting their party. They should rise up  when they know that procedures were done without consent--physically  touched, could not speak English. All women seemed to get the same  diagnosis: remove the Fallopian tube.   Pauline--I will not call her last name--I sat with her for an hour  and a half, and she described what happened: sedated, did not know,  told after she came out of the sedation, broke down in tears. I pay  tribute to her. And almost about to be on the verge of deportation, a  witness.   The whistleblower, a mother of five children, single mother of five  children, she needed her job. Demoted because she had the courage to  talk about examinations, surgeries.   Only women would understand examinations without lubricant, young  women in the prime of fertility, crying.   Beds--this is a private center contracted by the government. Beds  that looked like they had been there since the 1800s. These were metal  beds. I have never seen a bunk bed this thin. This is a place waiting  for COVID-19 because they are so close. The beds themselves are 2 feet  to 4 feet away.   You know what their COVID-19 practice is for protection? It is to  have one head this way and one head that way.   There are no masks. The air is going.    You have no way to protect these women in this  crowded scenario.   There is a men's site. By the way, this is a for-profit center, so  they take U.S. Marshals individuals. They take county individuals. It  is just a potpourri of persons.   They have women who have been there for 3-plus years.   I don't blame the workers or even the agencies, the subagency. It is  the policies of this administration dealing with immigrants who are  human beings and have due process rights accordingly, as being in the  United States.   I leave you with this: Please pass H. Res. 1153 because this is drawn  by this woman who says liberty because we are daughters, we are  mothers, we are human beings. The Nation is better than this.   Vote for H. Res. 1153 to stop these procedures and stop these prisons  from taking advantage of us.   Mr. Speaker, as a leader of this resolution and a senior member of  the House Judiciary and Homeland Committees, I rise in strong support  of H. Res. 1153, ``Condemning Unwanted, Unnecessary Medical Procedures  on Individuals Without Their Full, Informed Consent''.   First and foremost, I would like to thank my fellow co-leads of this  resolution, Representatives Jayapal, Kuster, Garcia, and Frankel as  well as all 224 members who have supported this resolution.   H. Res. 1153 addresses the recent allegations of improper medical  care of detained women in the Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla,  Georgia by: condemning the performance of unwanted, unnecessary medical  procedures on individuals without their full, informed consent;  recognizing that everyone deserves to control their own reproductive  choices and make informed choices about their bodies; and acknowledges  that further accountability, oversight, and transparency is necessary  to protect people in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs.   The resolution also calls on the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) to pause the removal of any individual who has received any  medical procedure at the Irwin County Detention Center as well as allow  individuals who may have experienced an unnecessary or nonconsensual  procedure to have immediate access to adequate, safe, and consensual  medical treatment.   By passing this resolution today, DHS must also comply with all  investigations and records request related to investigations about the  Irwin County Detention Center, ensure affected individuals are able to  freely participate in any investigations, and hold all individuals  involved in perpetrating these instances of medical impropriety  accountable.   On September 14, 2020, Project South filed an explosive complaint to  the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General.   The complaint alleged unsafe, unsanitary conditions, as well as cited  significant numbers of full and partial hysterectomies performed on  detainees at the Irwin County Detention Center without the full and  informed consent of the patients.   On September 16, 2020, I was alerted to the DHS' decision to fast- track the deportation of a young woman, Pauline Binam, who was a victim  of improper medical care at the Irwin County Detention Center.   Pauline is a strong, kind, and lovely young woman who has lived in  the United States since she was two years old.   Since 2017, Pauline had been held in DHS custody and was scheduled to  be deported to Cameroon.   That is three years of not being able to hold her child, embrace her  family, or celebrate milestones and holidays with loved ones.   In August 2019, while being detained at the Irwin County Detention  Center, Pauline underwent a procedure commonly known as a D&C, which  she had been told that it was for the purpose of getting rid of the  cysts on her ovaries.  [[Page H5652]]    According to the Mayo Clinic, a D&C procedure is used for the  following medical reasons: Clearing out tissues that remain in the  uterus after a miscarriage or abortion to prevent infection or heavy  bleeding; Removing a tumor that forms instead of a normal pregnancy;  Treating excessive bleeding after delivery by clearing out any placenta  that remains in the uterus; or Removing cervical or uterine polyps,  which are usually benign.   However, when Pauline woke up from the anesthesia, she was informed  that the doctor had removed her fallopian tube during the surgery.   This medical procedure, which substantially impacts Pauline's  potential to have more children, was performed without her consent and  has forever altered Pauline's life.   And Pauline is not the only victim.   Numerous allegations of medical abuse at the Irwin County Detention  Center have come to light over the past few days and weeks.   These shocking claims of medical malpractice reflect widespread  medical neglect in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)  detention system.   It is imperative that we, as Members of Congress, fulfill our duty to  the American people and get to the bottom of what happened to the women  being held at the Irwin County Detention Center.   We cannot wait.   The women in this facility cannot wait.   We must seek out justice for these women immediately, and that starts  by voting to pass this resolution.   Furthermore, Pauline and the other women who have shared their  stories of these violating and nonconsensual medical procedures must  have the ability to contribute to this investigation.   Had I not intervened and stopped Pauline's deportation when I did, we  would have lost a key witness to the investigation; someone who is  vital to shining a light on these cruel, and immoral medical procedures  performed without full and informed consent.   We cannot be known as a country that violates our own laws.   Just because someone is an immigrant, is undocumented, or being  detained for deportation, it does not mean that they can be denied  their due process rights under the laws of this land and under the  constitution of the United States of America.   Last weekend, I, along with several other Members of Congress, had  the opportunity to visit the Irwin County Detention Center.   During that trip, I was able to speak with multiple detainees and  hear about the living circumstances and quality of care surrounding  their detention at the facility.   It is no secret that the United States has had a long history of  women being denied reproductive rights and being violated medically,  especially women of color.   When you perform procedures that disallow a woman from making her own  choices or deny her from making a choice, you are violating her very  humanity, and I will not stand idly by and allow it to continue.   As a woman and a mother, I am appalled and horrified by what has been  happening to these women at the Irwin County Detention Center, and I  believe that we owe it to them to investigate their claims fully.   I urge my colleagues to vote with their conscience and pass H. Res.  1153 today.                                time  1000     Mr. Speaker, thank you to the gentlewoman who is  managing this resolution, and thank you very much to Mr. Malinowski for  bringing us together.   I think I started out earlier this morning by saying the Nation is  better than this. It is not because people do not have the right to  espouse views that I may disagree with. But not when those views become  detrimental to innocent Americans; when those views take the very  hostile and historically violent form of anti-Semitism; when they begin  to attack and marginalize groups; when they evidence themselves as we  saw--although not claiming to be part of QAnon--that scene in  Charlottesville, with tiki torches, saying that part of the Nation did  not belong here, in essence threatening people of color, Jewish people.   I believe this resolution is crucial. It is crucial because it is  dangerous to remain silent. As we have looked at QAnon, it is  attempting to speak of fringe beliefs that can be enormously dangerous.  It can actually motivate domestic extremists, which may result in harm  to innocent persons.   The FBI has made an assessment, with high confidence, that the fringe  political conspiracy theories, including QAnon, are motivating domestic  extremists, and where QAnon adherents have been implicated in one  particular case of a man arrested in 2018 for plotting to plant a bomb  in the Illinois Capitol rotunda to make Americans aware of pizzagate.   I think we are also aware of, during the last Presidential election,  someone driving and rushing to a restaurant in Washington, D.C., and  going in the basement, suggesting that pedophiles and the then- Presidential candidate were involved in it.    These are dangerous positions. They are not just that I disagree  because a philosophy is different from Sheila Jackson Lee. It is that  we must not be silent, for there have been atrocities perpetrated  around the world historically because people remained silent. The  atrocities in Germany come to mind; we remained silent. Or the genocide  in Sudan; we remained silent.   So this resolution is crucial. It is as crucial as the work we will  do in addressing the sin, the original sin, of this Nation, and that  was slavery.   But I rise today to support H. Res. 1154 that condemns QAnon and  rejects conspiracy theories. I ask my colleagues to support this. And I  thank the author of this legislation for his courage and leadership.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on  the Judiciary and on Homeland Security, I rise in strong support of H.  Res. 1154, a resolution condemning QAnon and rejecting the conspiracy  theories it promotes.   QAnon is a movement promoting a collection of unfounded conspiracy  theories that have spread widely on the internet since 2017.   Whereas, throughout history, conspiracy theories that falsely blame  secret cabals or marginalized groups for society's ills have fueled  prejudice, genocide, and acts of terrorism.    QAnon first gained notoriety with its unfounded, outrageous, and  bizarre conspiracy theory alleging that prominent Americans are engaged  in a secret plot to control the world, while using their power to  exploit children.   Qanon has gone on to embrace virtually every popular conspiracy  theory of the last several decades, from questioning the truth about  the September 11th terrorist attacks, to believing in alien landings,  to denying the safety of vaccines.   Many QAnon followers express anti-Semitic views, and the Anti- Defamation League has said that the movement's central conspiracy  theory includes anti-Semitic elements;   Mr. Speaker, history records that conspiracy theories have been a  central driver of anti-Semitism for centuries, and QAnon conspiracy  theories are fanning the flames as anti-Semitism is on the rise in the  United States and around the world.   The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has assessed with high  confidence that ``fringe political conspiracy theories'', including  QAnon, ``very likely motivate some domestic extremists, wholly or in  part, to engage in criminal or violent activity'', and that these  conspiracy theories ``very likely encourage the targeting of specific  people, places and organizations, thereby increasing the likelihood of  violence against these targets.''   This assessment is supported by an alarming number of ``events in  which individuals committed crimes, plotted attacks, or successfully  carried out deadly violence, and who--either before or after their  arrests--attributed their actions to their conspiratorial beliefs.''   For example, QAnon adherents have been implicated in crimes that they  claim their QAnon beliefs inspired, including--   1. A man arrested in 2018 for plotting to plant a bomb in the  Illinois Capitol rotunda to make Americans aware of the ``Pizzagate''  conspiracy theory;   2. A man arrested in 2018 for using an armored car to block traffic  on the Hoover Dam Bypass Bridge;    3. A man in Arizona arrested in 2019 for vandalizing a Catholic  church; and    4. A woman arrested in New York with a car full of knives after  posting a video accusing Joe Biden of participating in child sex  trafficking and threatening to kill him.   According to the Combating Terrorism Center at the United States  Military Academy at West Point, ``QAnon is arguably no longer simply a  fringe conspiracy theory but an ideology that has demonstrated its  capacity to radicalize to violence individuals at an alarming speed.''   The conspiracy theories promoted by QAnon undermine trust in  America's democratic institutions, encourage rejection of objective  reality, and further deepen our Nation's political polarization.   It is therefore timely and appropriate that the People's House  support this resolution, which puts it on record clearly condemning  QAnon and rejecting the false conspiracy theories it promotes and  spread.   In the highly charged political climate we find ourselves in it is  also appropriate that this body condemns any and all other groups and  ideologies, from the far left to the far right, that contribute to the  spread of unfounded conspiracy theories or that encourage Americans to  destroy public and private property and attack lawful authority.   Mr. Speaker, in addition to condemning QAnon and its false and  dangerous conspiracy theories, I support the resolution because it  calls upon the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as all Federal  law enforcement and homeland security agencies, to continue  strengthening their focus on preventing violence, threats, harassment,  and other criminal activity by extremists motivated by fringe political  conspiracy theories and urges all Americans, regardless of our beliefs  or partisan affiliation, to seek information from authoritative sources  and to engage in political debate from a common factual foundation.                                time  1045
