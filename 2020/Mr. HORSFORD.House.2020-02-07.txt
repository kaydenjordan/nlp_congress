 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Gun Violence  Survivors Week.   Every Nevadan was affected by the October 1 shooting that claimed 59  lives, injured more than 800, and shattered the lives of countless  more. Gun violence has touched too many of our lives, both on that day,  2 years ago, and daily. In Nevada, someone is killed by gun violence  every 19 hours.  [[Page H967]]    I personally lost my father to gun violence when I was 19 years of  age. And these deaths are preventable.   My bill, H.R. 4836, the Break the Cycle of Violence Act, is an  important step forward to get ahead of the senseless violence.   I am also proud that nearly a year ago, the House passed H.R. 8 for  meaningful gun background checks.   I know the cruelty of suffering a loss at the hands of a gun; knowing  your loved one won't come home because someone was armed with a weapon  they should not have had access to.   I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote on H.R. 8, and for this  body to take up H.R. 4836.                            ____________________
