 Mr. Speaker, 12 days ago, the eyes of the world were  focused on the beaches of Normandy, France, to observe the 75th  anniversary of the D-day invasion. It was a solemn moment to rightly  honor the sacrifice and courage of the combined Armed Forces of the  Allied Powers, who, from that moment, launched the final, decisive  assault that eventually destroyed the Axis Powers' murderous  stranglehold on Europe and Asia.   Mr. Speaker, another 75th anniversary surrounding the epic effort to  save democracy will occur in 4 days, this Saturday, June 22. On that  day 75 years ago, President Franklin Roosevelt signed into law the  Servicemen's Readjustment Act, more commonly known as the GI Bill. That  landmark measure would provide both college tuition and a stipend for  returning servicemembers who, as FDR said at the time, ``have been  compelled to make greater economic sacrifice and every other kind of  sacrifice than the rest of us.''   Even though the war would rage on for another year, leaders in  Washington wisely recognized that millions of young soldiers, sailors,  and airmen would soon be returning back into civilian life; and for  their sake and for the sake of a healthy postwar economy, creating this  educational pathway made tremendous sense.   In the 75 years since the GI Bill was signed into law, it is now  recognized as one of the most successful pieces of domestic legislation  ever enacted. The postwar economic boom and the blossoming of the  American middle class have both been attributed, in part, to the GI  Bill.   Many renown Americans, including Bob Dole, Johnny Carson, Harry  Belafonte, William Rehnquist, and Clint Eastwood, were beneficiaries of  the GI Bill.   Economic studies have shown that, for every dollar the government  spent on the GI Bill, our economy saw nearly $7 in return of additional  economic output in tax revenues from income growth.   Despite its stellar performance, the relative strength of the GI Bill  deteriorated in the late 20th century. By 2008, it was clear that  tuition assistance and living stipends had not kept pace with the  rising cost of a college education.   As a freshman Congressman in the House Armed Services Committee at  the time, I heard from returning Iraq and Afghan vets who were forced  to choose between dropping out of school or shouldering the burden of  daunting student loans. To fix this decline, we passed the Post-9/11 GI  Bill, which was signed into law by George Bush on June 30, 2008.   The updated law boosted tuition to match the cost of a 4-year public  university in servicemembers' home States and increased the living  stipend to keep faith with the original law. It also allowed GI  benefits to be transferred to a spouse or dependent child, a  groundbreaking change which transformed the value of military service  for families.   After the bill signing, I flew to Iraq in late 2008 for a committee  visit and vividly recall being surrounded by soldiers bursting with  questions about when and how the new law would be implemented. Since  then, it has become clear that the transferability of the GI Bill has  been an enormous morale booster and a valuable incentive to enlist and  remain in service.   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the Trump Department of Defense announced  a new policy last July which would arbitrarily cut off servicemembers  with more than 16 years of service from transferring their Post-9/11 GI  benefits to eligible family members. We were told at the time that the  Department viewed this as a shrewd cost-cutting measure.   However, revoking transferability breaks our commitment to our most  dedicated and seasoned servicemembers and their families. In addition,  in a tight, lean labor market, it remains  [[Page H4704]]  critically important to attract and retain the best qualified  individuals for military service.   I believe it sends exactly the wrong message to some of our most  seasoned servicemembers who may have married late in life or started  their families later, to make them ineligible for incentives, to  continue their service to our Nation.   Two weeks after the Pentagon released this policy, 83 of my  colleagues in the House joined me in a letter that I wrote to Secretary  Mattis objecting to this change and calling for its reversal. So far,  DOD has refused to budge.   Mr. Speaker, I have some good news to report today. With the cutoff  due to go into effect next month, the House Armed Services Committee  last week unanimously passed my amendment to the 2020 National Defense  Authorization Act, which would block the Secretary of Defense from  restricting GI Bill transferability based on a maximum number of years  of service.   As Congress took action 75 years ago to create the GI Bill benefit,  today it is our job to restore the hard-fought modernized GI Bill of  2008. That is even more the case today at a time of an All-Volunteer  Force. If a servicemember demonstrates that they are ready, able, and  willing to continue their service to our Nation, we should uphold our  end of the commitment.    To paraphrase President Roosevelt's words 75 years ago when he signed  the Servicemen's Readjustment Act, protecting transferability today  ``gives emphatic notice to the men and women in our Armed Forces that  the American people do not intend to let them down.''                            ____________________
