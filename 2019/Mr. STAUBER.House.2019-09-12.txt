 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my gratitude for  the St. Louis County Volunteer Rescue Squad, located in northern  Minnesota, and their quick response to an emergency that took place in  my district a little over a month ago.  [[Page H7670]]    At the end of July, a group of Girl Scouts traveled to northern  Minnesota to experience the beauty and magnificence of the Boundary  Waters Canoe Area. Their trip unexpectedly hit a rough patch when  severe thunderstorms rolled in and lightning struck close to their  campsite. A few of the girls reported feeling something from the  ground, potentially a ground current, and needing precautionary medical  attention.   The Boundary Waters Canoe Area is very remote, making any rescue  attempt more complex and rigorous. Nevertheless, the St. Louis County  Volunteer Rescue Squad members immediately sprang into action,  navigating five portages by motorboat and then canoe, escorting the  girls back to safety.   Mr. Speaker, I am thankful that the Northland has such a capable and  well-trained group of individuals dedicated to the safety of our  neighbors and visitors. Due to their hard work over the years, many  emergencies have been averted and lives have been saved.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Young for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to this Democratic messaging  bill, H.R. 1146, a harmful attempt to undermine responsible energy  development.   Throughout the history of our country, we have observed a pattern of  politicians in Washington and the East and West Coasts legislating  based on what they think is best for the folks in the rest of the  country. As we have listened to debate today, we can clearly see that  this Washingtonian habit is alive and well.   My good friends on the other side of this issue think they know  better than the Alaska Natives living within ANWR; they think they know  better than those who would benefit from job growth; they think they  know better than the unions; and they think they know better than the  people closest to the project.   I urge my colleagues to take a step back and look at the unsettling  trend that is occurring throughout this country of outsiders with a  tenuous grip on the truth imposing their will on the people really  impacted by these local projects.   For instance, in my home State of Minnesota, the same thing is  happening with the replacement of Line 3. People from the Twin Cities  who are unimpacted by this project are launching efforts right here in  this Chamber to stop the replacement and stop the job growth and  economic development that would accompany it. Instead of putting our  laborers, operating engineers, teamsters, and construction workers to  work, they support legislation that is undermining these jobs.   These projects are meant to develop our natural resources to ensure  our energy independence and not reduce our reliance on foreign and  hostile nations to this country. We responsibly develop our energy with  the strongest environmental standards and labor standards in the world.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. Let's listen  to those affected directly by these projects and do what is right.
