 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 147, I call  up  [[Page H634]]  the bill (H.R. 5) to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex,  gender identity, and sexual orientation, and for other purposes, and  ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 5.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5, the Equality  Act, which amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other core civil  rights statutes to explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of  sexual orientation and gender identity. The bill would also strengthen  nondiscrimination protections for women and others.   In short, this long overdue legislation will provide millions of  LGBTQ Americans explicit protections from being denied medical care,  fired from their jobs, or thrown out of their homes simply because of  who they are.   Much of the history of the United States is about expanding the  definition of who is understood to be included when the Declaration of  Independence says ``all men are created equal.'' When these words were  first written, that phrase did not include Black and Latino men; it did  not include Native Americans; it did not include women; and it did not  include LGBTQ individuals.   Once again, we have an opportunity to continue our march toward  justice and to enshrine in our Nation's laws protections for  marginalized communities to ensure that everyone can fully participate  in key areas of life and to provide them resources in the face of  discrimination.   Today, I expect we will hear arguments asking us to pick and choose  which of our Nation's children deserve our support, to pick which of  our children are valuable enough to have a right to live their lives to  the fullest. But that is a false choice and one designed to pit rights  for some against rights for all. There is no question that all our  children, including those who are transgender, deserve the freedom to  choose their own path.   Many of the protections codified by this bill already exist  throughout the country, whether through court decisions or in State  laws. In those places, women still have rights, religious freedom is  still protected, parents are still involved in their children's  healthcare, and doctors are still free to exercise their professional  medical judgment. And trans athletes from high schools to the Olympic  trials sometimes win and sometimes lose, just like everyone else.   But the ability to have a job, to receive medical care, or to rent a  home should not depend on who someone is, where they happen to live, or  who represents them. LGBTQ people should not have to worry that a  future Supreme Court could rip away their existing protections. They  deserve the same protections as other communities that have  historically faced discrimination, and that requires action from  Congress.   For decades, the LGBTQ community has been telling us their stories of  outrageous discrimination. Madam Speaker, to my colleagues, I say that  it is far past time we stop asking them to come to the Capitol just to  defend their existence.   To the LGBTQ community and, in particular, the trans youth and  athletes who I expect will hear themselves demonized on the floor  today: We see you, we appreciate you, we value you, and we will  continue to fight for you.   I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), for his  tireless leadership in introducing this bill and helping to shepherd it  through the legislative process.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this landmark  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5, the  ``Equality Act,'' which amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and other  core civil rights statutes, to explicitly prohibit discrimination on  the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The bill would  also strengthen non-discrimination protections for women and others.   In short, this long overdue legislation will provide millions of  LGBTQ Americans explicit protections from being denied medical care,  fired from their jobs, or thrown out of their homes simply because of  who they are.   Much of the history of the United States has been about expanding the  definition of who is understood to be included when the Declaration of  Independence says, ``all men are created equal.'' When these words were  first written, that phrase did not include black and Latino men; it did  not include Native Americans; it did not include women; and it did not  include LGBTQ individuals.   Once again, we have an opportunity before us to continue our march  toward justice--to enshrine in our nation's laws protections for  marginalized communities to ensure that everyone can fully participate  in key areas of life, and to provide them recourse in the face of  discrimination.   Today, I expect we will hear arguments that will ask us to pick and  choose which of our nation's children deserve our support--to pick  which of our children are valuable enough to have a right to live their  lives to the fullest.   Despite what we will hear, that is a false choice--one designed to  pit rights for some against rights for all. There is no question that  all our children--including those that are transgender--deserve to have  the freedom to choose their own path.   The Equality Act seeks to make our civil rights laws inclusive of all  people who have historically faced discrimination. Not only does it  provide explicit protections for the LGBTQ community, it also expands  protections for women and people of color.   Under the Equality Act, women will finally be protected from  discrimination in public accommodations and federally funded programs.  By expanding the existing definition of public accommodations under the  Civil Rights Act, the Equality Act also increases protections for  people on the basis of race, color, religion, and national origin.   People of color should not need to fear being targeted and  discriminated against while shopping, just because of the color of  their skin. Muslim people should not need to fear being targeted while  flying, just because of their religion. And LGBTQ people and women  should not need to fear being denied services in public spaces and  services simply because of who they are. At long last, this legislation  provides them with legal recourse if they face such discrimination.   Many of the protections being codified by this bill already exist  across all 50 states following the Supreme Court's ruling in Bostock v.  Clayton County in 2020, and we know that more than 20 states have had  some version of the protections before us today even before the Supreme  Court's ruling. In those places women still have rights, religious  freedom is still protected, parents are still involved in their  children's healthcare, and doctors are still free to exercise their  professional medical judgment. And trans athletes, from high schools to  the Olympic trials, sometimes win and sometimes lose, just like  everyone else.   Opponents of the Equality Act argue that it undermines women's  rights. That assertion is false. The Equality Act simply ensures that  all women, including trans women, are included in female institutions  and programs.  [[Page H638]]    When it comes to athletics, the Equality Act ensures that LGBTQ  students--including women and girls who are lesbian, bisexual, or  transgender--will have the same opportunity to participate in sports as  their peers. Trans women and girls have been participating in sports  consistent with their gender at all levels for years, and we have not  seen any dominance by trans athletes.   Young people who are trans are competing in sports for the same  reasons as their peers who are not transgender--including to be part of  a team and to challenge themselves--and they deserve the same  opportunities as their cisgender peers.   That is why the Women's Sports Foundation, National Women's Law  Center, and hundreds of athletes in women's sports and other women's  rights groups have consistently voiced their strong support for  inclusion of transgender women and girls in women's sports and have  opposed efforts to exclude them. Women's sports can play a critical  role in women's development and equality and including all women and  girls in women's sports strengthens women's sports.   Similarly, single-sex institutions like women's and men's colleges  have played an important and historic role in making our nation's  higher education system the strongest and most diverse in the world. To  be clear, nothing in the Equality Act should be construed to prohibit  or otherwise limit or affect the ability of single-sex colleges to  maintain their single-sex status. Moreover, it is not Congress's  intention to alter in any way Title IX or the scope or availability of  its exemptions as they currently stand.   In addition, the Equality Act will not undermine services like  single-sex homeless shelters or single sex-facilities. It will simply  ensure that these facilities do not discriminate on the basis of sexual  orientation or gender identity. Arguments that providing transgender  people access to facilities consistent with their gender identity will  undermine women's safety have no basis in reality. Laws protecting  LGBTQ people from discrimination do not authorize anyone to engage in  abusive or harassing behavior.   That is why over 300 domestic violence and sexual assault  organizations, including the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence,  the National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence, and the National  Center for Victims of Crime, have signed onto a National Consensus  Statement of Anti-Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence Organizations in  Support of Full and Equal Access for the Transgender Community.   Transgender people experience shockingly high rates of sexual and  physical violence, and the real risk of violence occurs when  transgender people are barred from using the appropriate facilities.   The idea that transgender people need explicit protections from  discrimination is not new. Dozens of states provide nondiscrimination  protections in public accommodations on the basis of gender identity,  and in those states we have not seen the parade of horribles that  Equality Act opponents raise.   The request to pit people's rights against each other is not based on  the real-world outcomes--for which ample evidence exists to the  contrary--but a continued resistance to advancing rights for those  different from so many of us here in Congress. The ability to have a  job, to receive medical care, or to rent a home should not depend on  who someone is, where they happen to live, or who represents then  politically. LGBTQ people should not have to worry that a future  Supreme Court could rip away their existing protections, and they  deserve the same protections as other communities that have  historically faced discrimination. And that requires action from  Congress.   For decades, the LGBTQ community has been coming here over and over  to tell us their stories of outrageous discrimination. To my  colleagues, I say, it is far past time we stop asking them to come to  the Capitol just to defend their existence.   To the LGBTQ community--and in particular the trans youth and  athletes who I expect will hear themselves demonized on the floor  today--we see you, we appreciate you, we value you, and we will  continue to fight for you.   I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island, Representative David  Cicilline, for his tireless leadership in introducing this bill and  helping to shepherd it through the legislative process. I urge my  colleagues to support this landmark legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I object.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), who is a distinguished sponsor of this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Madam Speaker, this bill does not affect Title IX and,  consequently, religious freedom at all.   I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Garcia).    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a number of  documents.                                Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights                                 Washington, DC, February 25, 2021.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the Lawyers' Committee       for Civil Rights Under Law (hereinafter ``Lawyers''       Committee''), a nonpartisan civil rights organization formed       at the request of President John F. Kennedy to enlist the       private bar in providing legal services to address racial       discrimination, we urge you to vote for the Equality Act       (H.R. 5). The Equality Act would clarify that LGBTQ+ people       are protected against discrimination in access to credit.       housing, education, and employment under federal law, as well       as to strengthen public accommodation antidiscrimination for       all people.        The Lawyers' Committee strongly believes that the Equality       Act is an essential step in fulfilling our nation's       commitment to civil rights for all people. Unfortunately,       discrimination is a persistent problem for millions of people       in the LGBTQ+ community, particularly for those who also       identify as people of color. Everyone in America, regardless       of who they are, is entitled to equal rights and should be       free to pursue career and educational opportunities and live       their daily lives free from discrimination.        Black Americans and other people of color continue to face       persistent discrimination while engaging in commonplace       transactions, errands, and tasks, such as shopping and       accessing transportation like taxis and car services. The       Equality Act would finally make this discrimination illegal,       as it strengthens the public accommodations provision in the       1964 Civil Rights Act. Congress must act now to pass the       Equality Act to clarify and strengthen federal civil rights       protections so everyone across the country can engage in       public life without the fear of harassment or discrimination       because of who they are.        As Congress considers this important bill, we are committed       to ensuring the Equality Act does solely what it was intended       to do: clarify and strengthen existing federal civil rights       protections for everyone in America. We strongly oppose any       effort to weaken any existing federal civil rights law the       Equality Act would amend.        We urge you to vote for final passage of the Equality Act       because no one in our country should be discriminated against       for who they are. It is time for Congress to clarify and       strengthen federal civil rights protections for all       Americans.            Respectfully submitted,      Damon T. Hewitt,          Acting President & Executive Director, Executive Vice             President, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under             Law.        Erinn D. Martin,          Policy Counsel, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under             Law.                                   ____                                         American Bar Association,                                     Chicago, IL, February 23, 2021.      RE: ABA Support for H.R. 5, The Equality Act of 2021.       Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: On behalf       of the American Bar Association and its over 400.000 members.       I am writing to voice our support for H.R. 5. The Equality       Act of 2021. which addresses the need to protect every       American regardless of their sexual orientation or gender       identity. We offer the following comments in support of the       legislation and request that this letter be made part of the       hearing record.        The Equality Act will include LGBTQ+ people in the Civil       Rights Act of 1964. Over 50 years ago, when this landmark       civil rights legislation was enacted, a minority group was       omitted; this needs to be rectified. Currently, the rights of       LGBTQ+ individuals depend on the state where they reside, and       in close to 30 states, LGBTQ+ people are at risk of being       denied housing, credit. services, public accommodations,       education, employment, access to their children, access to       federally funded programs, or jury service simply because of       their sexual orientation or gender identity.        There is bipartisan support for the Equality Act, and 70       percent of Americans support equal rights for LGBTQ+. When       the Equality Act was introduced in the last Congress, it       received unprecedented support from businesses and more than       500 national and statewide organizations.        In 2018, the ABA adopted a resolution specifically       supporting enactment of the Equality Act. Let me elaborate on       our reasons for supporting this important legislation:        1. The Equality Act will protect LGBTQ+ people from       workplace discrimination because of their sexual orientation,       gender identity, or gender expression.        The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based       on race, color, religion, or national origin. The Government       Employee Rights Act of 1991 prohibits discrimination based on       race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or       disability. They will both be amended to include, ``sex,       (including sexual orientation, and gender identity).''        Every day LGBTQ+ employees, co-workers, and job applicants       are subjected to discrimination in the workplace. Other       social groups have been protected by legislation, yet the       LGBTQ+ community has not been included even though their       livelihood, careers, and quality of life are equally       affected.        The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces       federal laws that protect job applicants or employees from       discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national       origin, age, disability, or genetic information. In EEOC v.       R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, the EEOC filed a lawsuit       against Harris Family Funeral Homes on behalf of Aimee       Stephens, a transgender woman who was fired shortly after       telling her employer she was transgender. The Sixth Circuit       Court of Appeals concluded that Title VII prohibits       discrimination based on gender identity, thus applying to       businesses claiming exemption based on anti-LGBTQ+ religious       beliefs. In 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States       heard Harris consolidated with Bostock v. Clayton County, and       in a landmark ruling, upheld the Sixth Circuit decision       affirming that LGBTQ+ employees are entitled to legal       protections against discrimination on the basis of gender       identity and sexual orientation under Title VII of the Civil       Rights Act of 1964.        The Equality Act will codify this case law making       discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in the workplace       unlawful by explicitly stating that sexual orientation and       gender identity are protected traits.        2. The Equality Act will prevent LGBTQ+ people from being       denied services and public accommodations because of their       sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.        Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits       discrimination in public accommodations based on race, color,       religion, or national origin. However, it is currently legal       in almost 30 states to deny LGBTQ+ people services without       cause and bar them from public accommodations such as hotels,       restaurants, and libraries.        In Grimm v. Gloucester County School Board, school board       policy prohibited plaintiff from using the restrooms that       aligned with his gender identity. In 2015, Grimm filed a       lawsuit challenging the policy, on the grounds that it       violates his rights under Title IX and the Fourteenth       Amendment. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the       school board's restroom policy constitutes sex-based       discrimination, and that transgender individuals constitute a       quasi-suspect class. Applying heightened scrutiny, the court       held that the school board's policy is not substantially       related to its important interest in protecting students'       privacy and that, in regard to the Title IX claims, the       restroom policy discriminated against plaintiff on the basis       of sex, and that he suffered legally cognizable harm based on       the unlawful discrimination. The Equality Act is necessary to       codify this ruling for the entire  [[Page H643]]       country. Denying public accommodations to LGBTQ+ individuals       is harmful to their health and dignity, and precludes them       from fully participating in public life.        In addition to places of public accommodation already       included in the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Equality Act will       revise the law to ensure that other providers of products,       services, and public accommodations, such as stores,       accountant firms, transportation, and banks, may not       discriminate against a protected social group.        3. The Equality Act will prevent LGBTQ+ people from being       denied or evicted from housing based on their sexual       orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.        The Fair Housing Act, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of       1968, prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, or       financing of housing by landlords, real estate agents,       municipalities, banks, other lending institutions, and       homeowner's insurance companies based on race, color,       national origin, religion, sex, family status, or disability.        LGBTQ+ individuals may be rejected when trying to purchase       or rent a home. LGBTQ+ people can face eviction, which may       have financial and legal consequences. A partner's request to       be added to the insurance of a homeowner may be rejected       which could affect the property title.        In Smith v. Avanti, a landlord in Colorado refused to rent       to a same-sex couple, one of whom was also transgender. The       United States District Court stated that the property owner       violated the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act. This was the       first time a federal court, placing sexual orientation and       gender identity under the umbrella of sex discrimination, has       ruled that anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination violated the Fair       Housing Act.        Since homelessness is more prevalent in the LGBTQ+       community than in the general population, enactment of the       Equality Act can help lower rates of housing insecurity.        4. The Equality Act will ensure that LGBTQ+ individuals are       not denied credit based on their sexual orientation, gender       identity, or gender expression.        The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits       discrimination based on race, color, religion, national       origin, sex, marital status, or age with respect to credit       transactions. The Equality Act will amend ECOA to include       ``sexual orientation'' and ``gender identity'' as protected       classes.        LGBTQ+ individuals are often denied credit and mortgages.       The negative financial impact can mean that they are often       unable to become homeowners, pursue higher education or       vocational training, build assets, or purchase a car. By       amending ECOA, the Equality Act will allow for equal access       to credit, financial improvements, education, and affordable       housing.        5. The Equality Act will protect LGBTQ+ people from       discrimination in jury service.        The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment       protects the right of a criminal defendant to a jury       selection process free from racial, ethnic, or gender       discrimination. When LGBTQ+ people are unfairly dismissed       from jury service, there is no recourse in the justice       system.        The Equality Act will protect the integrity of the jury       selection process for the defendant, as well as the rights of       the LGBTQ+ jurors.        The American Bar Association believes that everyone       deserves equal protection under the law. Nearly two-thirds of       LGBTQ+ Americans reported that they have experienced       discrimination in their everyday lives. We urge Congress to       pass legislation explicitly affirming that discrimination due       to sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or sex       stereotyping, is sex discrimination prohibited by the Civil       Rights Act of 1964, among other federal statutes, and to       include sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity or       expression protections in those statutes.        Thank you for this opportunity to convey the ABA's position       on this important legislation.            Sincerely,      Patricia Lee Refo.                                   ____                 The Business Coalition for the Equality Act  The Business Coalition for the Equality Act is a group of leading U.S.  employers that support the Equality Act, which would finally guarantee      explicit, permanent protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and          transgender people under our existing civil rights laws.

NCJW believes in kavod habriyot, individual dignity. To that       end, we are committed to the enactment, enforcement, and       preservation of laws and regulations that protect civil       rights and individual liberties for all.        The Equality Act, which passed the House of Representatives       in the last Congress, would add explicit protections against       discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender       identity to our civil rights laws. The bill would also add       and expand legal protections for women, people of color, and       many other communities. Congress must pass the Equality Act       to protect all individuals from discrimination regardless of       sexual orientation and gender identity.        A majority of LGBTQ people have experienced harassment or       discrimination due to their sexual orientation or gender       identity. A 2020 study by the University of Chicago found       that one in three LGBTQ Americans faced identity-based       discrimination of some kind in the past year, with that       number increasing to three in five for transgender people.       Discrimination happens in the spheres of employment,       education, housing, public accommodations, and health care--      every part of a person's life. LGBTQ people of color,       immigrants, legal minors, and those with disabilities face       even more barriers and biases.        NCJW supports the Equality Act not in spite of our       religious beliefs, but because of them. We believe in the       inherent dignity and worth of all people, including       religiously and non-religiously affiliated people. Civil       rights protections go hand in hand with religious freedom,       and the bill does not require any person to change their       religious beliefs nor does it compel religious institutions       to participate in activities that violate the tenets of their       faith.        All people deserve to live free from discrimination and       fear regardless of their sex, sexual orientation, and gender       identity. I urge you to vote for final passage of the       Equality Act.            Sincerely,                                                    Jody Rabhan,                                               Chief Policy Officer,      National Council of Jewish Women.                                   ____                                                  February 24, 2021.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: The undersigned       trade and professional associations write in support of H.R.       5, the Equality Act. Equality of opportunity is a key pillar       of our great democracy--one that allows all people to pursue       their American Dream--and part of what makes our nation       exceptional. Our industries, representing and employing tens       of millions of Americans, understand this basic fact and have       been at the forefront of efforts to combat discrimination       based on sexual orientation and gender identity in the       workplace.        H.R. 5 would amend several provisions of the Civil Rights       Act of 1964 to provide affirmative, statutory non-      discrimination protections for LGBTQ Americans both in the       workplace and in the community. These protections remain       vitally important even after the Supreme Court's decision in       Bostock v. Clayton County. Only legislative action can       forestall endless litigation, alleviate the untenable       patchwork of state laws governing this form of       discrimination, and make clear that discrimination because of       sexual orientation or gender identity is unwelcome and       unlawful in our society.        In 2019, the Equality Act was introduced on a bipartisan       basis in both the House and Senate, and it passed the House       with a bipartisan majority. We urge you again to support the       passage of H.R. 5.            Sincerely,        Accessories Council, AAHOAAsian American Hotel Owners       Association, ACTThe App Association, AdvaMed, Aerospace       Industries Association, Alliance for Automotive Innovation,       American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA), American       Benefits Council, American Chemistry Council, American       Cleaning Institute.

Madam Speaker, I now yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Stanton).    Madam Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney).    Madam Speaker, I now yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, I now yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I now yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean), and I ask unanimous consent  that she may control that balance.    Mr. Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters).    Mr. Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Takano).    Mr. Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Torres).    Mr. Steube, what any religious tradition ascribes as  God's will is no concern of this Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I now yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the distinguished  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from the State of Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Auchincloss).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. Williams).    Madam Speaker, how much time do we have left?    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Quigley).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I have listened to this debate in amazement. I have  been involved in this struggle for equality for many, many years. I was  the chief author in the House of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,  and to hear it suggested that I would turn my back on religious freedom  is just ridiculous.   This bill enshrines equality. It enshrines equality for everyone.  That is its purpose. It does not contradict the Religious Freedom  Restoration Act which, as a number of people have mentioned, I was the  chief author of. But it does enshrine equality, and that is what our  friends on the other side of the aisle seem to be afraid of, equality.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have the right to close. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is precisely because this bill enshrines equality; it is precisely  because of the nonsensical nature of the arguments from the other side  of the aisle that the Equality Act has been endorsed by more than 500  civil rights, women's rights, religious, medical, and other national  and State organizations, including the American Medical Association,  the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Episcopal Church, the  Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Leadership  Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the NAACP, the National Alliance  to End Sexual Violence--to end sexual violence--the National Coalition  of Anti-Violence Programs, the National Women's Law Center, the Network  Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, the Rabbinical Assembly, and the  United Methodist Church General Board of Church and Society, all of  whom obviously would not endorse this bill if it had anything to do  with destroying religious liberty.   It has also been endorsed by dozens of business associations,  including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of  Manufacturers, and the Sports and Fitness Industry Association, and  hundreds of other businesses.   I urge all Members to support this important legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
