 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 75th  anniversary of the Thomas-Fields Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 7814,  which was founded on July 11, 1946.   When African-American veterans of World War II returned to their  homes in the Staunton-Augusta area, they were, unfortunately, excluded  from their local VFW Post. Following their denied admittance, a group  of 42 veterans then applied for a charter to organize their own post,  which would carry the namesakes of Charles Thomas and Glenwood Fields,  two African Americans from Staunton who died while serving their  country in World War II.   Since its formation, the Thomas-Fields Post has been an active civic  organization in the African-American community of Staunton and Augusta  County, as well as playing an active and significant role in local area  veterans' activities.   While the post welcomes all veterans, it continues to highlight the  heritage of African-American and minority veterans who have served our  Nation.   Recently, Post 7814 was recognized as a Meritorious Post by the State  VFW Federation for its outstanding work over the last 5 years and was  also named an All-American Post by the National VFW Council for the  first time in its history.   The Thomas-Fields VFW Post is to be commended for its work in our  community and their efforts to aid those who served. I congratulate  them on this historic milestone and wish them another successful 75  years.                                time  1100                          Support the People of Cuba     Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer my support for the Cuban  people who have taken to the streets to protest the oppressive  Communist regime there, a regime that has stripped them of their basic  human rights.   Since its inception 62 years ago, the Communist Party has caused  immeasurable harm and created unbearable conditions in Cuba.   Cuba's people want freedom. They want to provide for their families  and know that their kids will be safe and healthy--and Cuba is not that  place, and it hasn't been that place for far too long.   Right now, its people are facing widespread power outages, the most  severe food shortage since the 1990s and inflation rates nearing 500  percent.   In an effort to contain the truth about what is really going on, the  government cut off its citizens' access to the internet to silence the  dissent.   Instead of trying to address the issues plaguing the island nation,  they have, instead, decided to suppress those voicing concern. Since  the protest began, more than 100 people have been detained or have gone  missing, including artists, peace activists, and priests. It should be  no surprise that Cubans are marching in the streets demanding their  rights.   We have all seen the images of people waving American flags and  fleeing in makeshift boats overflowing with folks willing to risk their  lives to experience freedom. They want what we are so blessed to have,  and, yet, there is a segment of our society bent on pushing the United  States toward the failed notion of communism and socialism. It is mind- boggling.   We must stand strongly for freedom, stand firmly with the people, and  stand boldly with a free Cuba.                            ____________________
