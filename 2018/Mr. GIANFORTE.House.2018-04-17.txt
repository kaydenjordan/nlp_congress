 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark tax day 2018.   I do not make it a habit of celebrating tax day, but this year is  different. Tax day 2018 is the last time the American people will have  to file their taxes under a complex, outdated Tax Code.   The new Tax Code lowers the tax rate for every Montanan. The reduced  rates are creating larger paychecks. A teacher in Billings told me her  take-home pay has gone up $1,500 a year.   The new Tax Code provides relief to Montana families by doubling the  child tax credit. Parents will have more money to buy their children  clothes, diapers, and food.   Today, I am celebrating tax day 2018 because we are putting that old  antigrowth Tax Code out to pasture. In its place is a new, simpler Tax  Code that cuts rates for all Montanans, helps families, and is growing  our economy, leading to more jobs and higher wages.                            ____________________
