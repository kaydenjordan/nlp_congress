 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my  constituent, Mr. Marvin Arrington, Sr., a giant in the Atlanta  community, where he served as one of the city's longest running  councilmembers, a father, a friend, and a judge.   An Atlanta native, Judge Arrington graduated from Henry McNeal Turner  High School and went on to graduate from what was at that time Clark  College on a football scholarship. He began his legal studies at Howard  University School of Law before returning home to Atlanta and  integrating Emory University School of Law, where he was one of the  first two Black students to graduate from the law school.   At age 28, Judge Arrington was elected to the Atlanta Board of  Aldermen and continued serving after the city charter amendment changed  the board into a city council. In 1980, he became Atlanta City Council  president, a position he held for nearly two decades. In 2002, he was  appointed judge in the Fulton County Superior Court, where he sat on  the bench until his retirement in 2012.   During Judge Arrington's trailblazing tenure in public service, he  helped build and shape Atlanta into the great city that it is today. He  left his imprint on the city's public transportation system and  expanded Zoo Atlanta into the award-winning attraction that it is  today.   In the early 1990s, Judge Arrington was one of the driving forces on  the team who brought the 1996 Summer Olympic Games to the city of  Atlanta. While he was at it, he used the lead up to the summer games to  convert run-down public housing projects to quality, affordable  housing.   Mr. Speaker, we have a saying in Atlanta, ``Atlanta Influences  Everything,'' and that is true in part because of Marvin Arrington,  Sr.'s, great work to influence the growth of Atlanta. In fact, in 2019,  the city council chambers were named after him to honor the tremendous  impact that he had on our city.   Judge Arrington was a member of Big Bethel AME Church, the Gate City  Bar Association Hall of Fame, and Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity,  Incorporated. For 16 years, he was a member of the board of trustees  for Emory University. He served in many roles--elected, appointed, and,  yes, volunteer--but in all things he demonstrated a deep commitment to  equity, justice, and empowering young people.   Marvin Arrington, Sr.'s, life of service and sacrifice is a reminder  for everyone of the rent we pay for living in this society. Atlanta is  the city that I chose to call home, and it was the work of leaders like  Marvin Arrington, Sr., that made it the city to choose.   I send my deepest condolences to his daughter, Michelle Arrington;  his son, Fulton County Commissioner, Marvin Arrington, Jr.; and his  entire family. Marvin Arrington, Sr.'s, legacy will inspire future  leaders for generations to come.  [[Page H3964]]                                ____________________
