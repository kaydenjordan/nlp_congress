 Mr. Speaker, I am excited to support this legislation.  It is bipartisan.   Minnesotans and those who are on the front lines of the opioid crisis  will be helped, and it will aid the millions of American families who  are affected by this epidemic.   It includes a bipartisan measure that I authored that will help  prevent opioid addiction among seniors by educating them on alternative  pain management treatments, and the proper, safe disposal of  prescription painkillers. It will help more than 90,000 at-risk seniors  from descending into a deadly spiral of addiction.   The end result will be less addiction, fewer overdoses, and safer  Minnesota communities.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding time.
