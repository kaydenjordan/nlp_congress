 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter), my friend,  for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   We had to hustle over here today, Mr. Speaker. You were already here,  and I appreciate your timely beginning of the House, but this is a  different kind of day. Ordinarily, we have more 1 minutes, more folks  celebrating high school teachers, local newspaper folks, and local  philanthropic efforts, but as you might imagine, there are other things  going on on the Hill today.   That is unfortunate because I come down here today not with a heavy  heart that I often come with, from a Rules Committee perspective. Mr.  Speaker, the Rules Committee is in charge of deciding whether or not to  allow amendments, what to schedule for the floor. As a member of the  minority, there are four of us up there on the Rules Committee with  nine members in the majority, so we lose a lot. The time for bipartisan  partnership happens before a bill gets to the Rules Committee.   Yesterday, what we saw transpire in the Rules Committee, Mr. Speaker,  was not at all unprecedented. It is just not as common as I wish it  were. That is that the committees of jurisdiction were working all the  way up until the eleventh hour to come together on a bipartisan  solution so that we wouldn't have to jam something through the Rules  Committee.   I see my friend from Connecticut has come down to the floor. Mr.  Himes, representing the majority on the Financial Services Committee,  and Mr.  [[Page H9232]]  Huizenga, representing the minority, talked about the partnership that  came together, not to create the perfect bill, not to create the bill  that I would have written, and, candidly, not to create the bill that  my friend from Colorado would have written, but to have crafted a bill  with give-and-take so that instead of spending time on this floor  making statements, we are going to spend time on this floor making  legislation.   We are going to have an actual opportunity, Mr. Speaker. I don't want  to upset anybody's applecart here because so often we do spend more  time trying to make a point than make a difference. This is a  bill about making a difference today.    Not at all common, there were no Democratic amendments made in order  to this bill. The two Republican amendments that were made in order are  the perfecting amendments to seal that bipartisan compromise. I think  we are going to end up with a big bipartisan vote on the board.   The only thing that gives me a heavy heart today, Mr. Speaker, is  that I offered an amendment last night to add suspension authority for  the Speaker of the House, Speaker Pelosi, to bring up a bill dealing  with the widows and widowers of American servicemen and -women killed  in action and the benefits that they are not receiving today. This is  also a bipartisan bill. I offered an amendment to make that suspension  authority in order. It was rejected on a party-line vote, so I am going  to be opposing the rule today because I would like to be able to  include those things.   But we did get a motion to recommit that will be made in order today,  so I will have an opportunity, if we defeat the previous question, to  bring up the NDAA bill, the National Defense Authorization Act, which  does contain the widow's tax repeal and gives us an opportunity to do  even more things together.   I see my friend from Georgia (Mr.   David Scott) on the floor today.  He serves on the Financial Services Committee with my friend Mr.  Loudermilk from Georgia. We have two Georgians who serve on the  committee of jurisdiction for this bill.   I always enjoy the Financial Services Committee because,  historically, in my 9 years here, it has not been led by shrinking  violets on either side of the aisle. There are those milquetoast  committees on Capitol Hill, Mr. Speaker, that never make the news.  Nobody ever gets a one-liner. Not so with the committee that my friend  from Colorado and my friend from Georgia serve on.   But I like watching the vote tally because so often my friend Mr.  Scott from Georgia and my friend Mr. Loudermilk from Georgia end up on  the same side of the issue because, sadly, the only Financial Services  Committee bills that make the headlines are those that highlight our  strident differences here. But time and time again, the Financial  Services Committee has had a record of producing bills that can go to  the President's desk. They could go to President Obama's desk for his  signature, and they can go to President Trump's desk for his signature.   I hope this turns out to be one of those exercises today, again, not  an exercise in making a point but an exercise in making a difference.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to share with my friend from Colorado that  his expertise on the Financial Services Committee is valued by all of  us on the minority side of the aisle.   It is a special kind of pain being in the minority on the Rules  Committee, Mr. Speaker, because minority members have wonderful ideas,  and friends on the other side of the aisle are constrained from how  many of those ideas they can support, but we always get a word of  encouragement from our friend from Colorado.   I know if he were sitting on the minority side, I would be feeling  his pain, and he feels ours. He is always a voice for encouragement on  that committee. We see that come back from the witnesses who have a  chance to serve with the gentleman from Colorado, talking about how  much they enjoy that partnership.   That is why I am particularly pleased I was assigned this rule today,  because it exemplifies the kind of work that we want out of all of our  committees, that we have gotten out of the Financial Services Committee  this day and that my friend from Colorado works each and every day to  bring forward, sometimes with more success than others, but  nonetheless, it is appreciated.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H9233]]    Mr. Speaker, I want to associate myself with my friend from  Connecticut. It has been true that we have spent too much time making  policy statements and not enough time making policy. That has been true  under leadership of both parties here. Though, the truth is, Mr.  Speaker--and because I take great pride in this institution, I want to  say it--we do spend more time making policy than we get credit for.   You can't see behind you, Mr. Speaker, but I am looking at the press  gallery today, all the folks who are covering us reclaiming our Article  I responsibilities today. We are not going to let the courts legislate  in this area; we are going to legislate in this area. There is  approximately one outlet there covering this today; others are  elsewhere.   Again, we worked until the eleventh hour to put something together, a  bipartisan compromise between the chairman and ranking member on the  Financial Services Committee. The collective national presence to  highlight that partnership is, again, one.   I don't know what we can do here to try to let success beget success.  So often, these kinds of successes go right underneath the radar  screen, and, thus, it makes it harder to accomplish these things. If I  could make it clear to America that the tag team of Waters and McHenry  can come together to get good things done, that certainly sends a  message that there is hope for all of us in this space.   I want to go back to what my friend from Colorado said, though. He is  absolutely right about the widow's tax. We did incorporate that bill in  the NDAA. It has been sitting in the Senate doing nothing.   I wish we would have passed it as a stand-alone bill. That is a  different conversation for a different day.   But it is sitting in the Senate, and there is nothing I can do, Mr.  Speaker, to move the Senate along any faster. I can't get their  conferees to work any harder.   But what I can do is I can get the House to take up the Senate-passed  NDAA, and we can take back the authority in this institution to move  the NDAA forward. It is important for the widow's tax, but, Mr.  Speaker, it is important for so many other things absolutely essential  to the defense of this country.   It has been one of those bills that we have come together in a  bipartisan way to be successful on decade after decade after decade,  and it is a stain on the success of the House and the Senate this cycle  that we have not been able to move that forward in a bipartisan way.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, in the same way that I can't speak to  insider trading in that legislation any better than the gentleman from  Connecticut does as a member of jurisdiction, I also cannot speak to  the NDAA in any better words than my friend from Wyoming (Ms. Cheney),  a former member of the Rules Committee, the Conference chairman for the  House Republicans here, and an unabashed defender of providing the very  best for our men and women in uniform.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms.  Cheney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I was walking down the hall one day between the Capitol  and the Budget Committee room, and I was walking with the now-chairman  of the Budget Committee, Mr. Yarmuth from Kentucky. We were arguing  because he is a committed budgeteer and I am a committed budgeteer. We  were arguing about process and how it was that we were going to deliver  the results that our constituents are demanding and that the Nation  expects.   We were about halfway down that tunnel, past all that brilliant  artwork that high schoolers send in, when we realized that we were  saying exactly the same thing. I was just saying it in Republican  terms; he was saying it in Democrat terms. We had been arguing then for  about 5 minutes on what should have been bringing us together.   We end up in that space a lot here. Because my friend from Colorado  does work so hard to reach out and be collaborative, I want to make  sure that he didn't misunderstand my friend from Wyoming.                                time  1245    I could hear the frustration in her voice. My friend did not have the  pleasure of serving with her on the Rules Committee, but when national  security issues came up, she has been living this commitment as a  member of the committee. When we do a continuing resolution, for my  friend and me it is about an extra 2 weeks to solve disagreements. For  her it is 2 weeks of lost ability to plan for national security.   When we get things done by December 31 and a deadline, we think of  this as a great success. For her, it is an entire quarter that we  couldn't plan for new threats and new challenges that are confronting  the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment.   It is not just personal, it is truly life and death in a national  security way.   If we defeat the previous question, what the gentlewoman from Wyoming  was proposing is that we take up the Senate bill and amend it with all  of those ideas that our conferees have already gotten together on.   Now, my friend is correct. The Senate has some challenges. I would  argue it is a challenge that nobody has 60 votes over there, and so  whether Republicans are leading the Senate or Democrats are leading the  Senate, there is still no ability to move things past the filibuster  threshold. But we can take up that bill, because I would say it is  Democrats in the Senate holding it up. My friend from Colorado might  say it is Republicans in the Senate holding it up. But we all agree  that it is critically important that we get it done. So I don't want to  slow down the insider trading bill, Mr. Speaker, and that is not what I  am suggesting.   What I am suggesting is: If we defeat the previous question, we have  already got section 1 and section 2 of the rule that covers the insider  trading bill. Let's add a section 3 to the rule. In the same way the  insider trading bill reclaims Article I responsibility from Article III  courts, section 3 is going to reclaim from the Senate the House  prerogative to move forward on legislation. We will bring up the Senate  bill, we will add in all of the amendments that the Democratic chairman  of the Armed Services Committee and the Republican ranking member want  to include, and then we will move that bill forward.   Mr. Speaker, the insider trading bill is important, and we are going  to get that done together. National security is even more important.   Again, while it is not the subject of national news coverage, this is  something we have gotten done in a bipartisan collaborative way no  matter who runs the U.S. House, no matter who runs the U.S. Senate, and  no matter who sits in the White House for almost 60 years. Every single  year bills fail, bills succeed, Presidents come, and Presidents go. We  have gotten this done because it is important to 330 million Americans.   Keep section 1 of the rule and keep section 2 of the rule. Let's move  forward on the bipartisan product of the Financial Services Committee.  Let's add section 3. Let's defeat the previous question, let's reclaim  from the Senate the NDAA papers, let's move forward with a House  amendment, and let's send the Senate a bill that they can pass  tomorrow.   Mr. Speaker, I don't see any other speakers, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I have got my Mars 2033 bumper sticker here  if we are prepared to talk about other collaborative things moving  forward, but I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
