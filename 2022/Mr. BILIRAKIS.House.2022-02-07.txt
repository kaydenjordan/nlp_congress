 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the brave men  and women who serve in law enforcement throughout our great Nation.   New statistics indicate that intentional killings of law enforcement  officers in 2021 reached a 20-year high--this is tragic--excluding 9/ 11.   Tragically, two of those officers killed in the line of duty during  2021 have been my constituents: Deputy Michael Magli of the Pinellas  County Sheriff's Office and Master Patrol Officer Jesse Madsen of Tampa  Police Department. I went to the funeral services of those two heroes  and shared the anguish of their grieving families and colleagues.   Additionally, in 2014, Officer Charlie K. Kondek from my hometown of  Tarpon Springs, Florida, who was part of the Tarpon Springs Police  Department, was killed in the line of duty.   These fallen heroes leave behind a distinguished legacy of service  and sacrifice that deserves to be honored.   I am proud to cosponsor, along with my great friend, Kat Cammack,  from Gainesville, Florida--so we are Floridians and Florida Gators--the  Back the Blue Act and the Protect and Serve Act of 2021. Both of those  bills will increase the Federal penalties for crimes targeting members  of the law enforcement community and strengthen funding for programs to  improve relations  [[Page H1009]]  between law enforcement and the communities they serve.   Law enforcement agencies around the country have faced undeserved  political attacks by the defund the police movement. This is  unacceptable as far as I am concerned. This is a dangerous and  destructive proposition and has only increased violence.   We should, in fact, be increasing support and funding for our law  enforcement. I respect the service and sacrifice of our first  responders and their families, and I will continue to do everything I  can to support them.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for having this Special Order  which is so very important. I appreciate it.
