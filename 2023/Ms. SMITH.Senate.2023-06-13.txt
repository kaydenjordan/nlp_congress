 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the career  of Chancellor Devinder Malhotra. Devinder is retiring this summer from  his role as chancellor of the Minnesota State Colleges and  Universities.   Devinder has served as chancellor or interim chancellor since 2017.  During that time, the system of 26 colleges, 7 universities, and 54  campuses has advanced its strategic priorities towards building a  systemwide identity and leveraging the advantages that come from its  scale and scope as one of the largest higher education systems in the  country.   Under his leadership, Minnesota State launched Equity 2030, a key  strategic initiative that set a critical goal of eliminating  educational equity gaps, including by race and ethnicity, socioeconomic  background, and first-generation status at every Minnesota State  college and university by the year 2030. This work is currently  underway and has received broad support throughout the system,  including from presidents, bargaining units, faculty, staff, and  students.   Chancellor Malhotra led the system through the uncertainty of the  pandemic. His commitment and dedication has helped thousands create a  better future for themselves, their families, and their communities,  all while working to address Minnesota's workforce needs.   I have had the pleasure of knowing and working with Devinder for  years. I thank him for his service to our State. On behalf of the State  of Minnesota, I wish him all the best as he enjoys all that retirement  has to offer.                            ____________________
