 Mr. Speaker, on Monday, after a year of battling the  coronavirus pandemic, my home Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ended its  mask mandate.   I am proud of Pennsylvania for exceeding President Biden's goal for  vaccinations by the Fourth of July. With over 75 percent of adults with  one dose and 60 percent with both doses, we are safely lifting our mask  mandate.   I salute my State's leadership in putting health and science first as  we sought to get the virus under control.   When this pandemic started, no one knew how long it would take to get  past these precautions. At times, it was difficult to see any return to  normalcy, but we got there together.   I thank my constituents for their sacrifice. Pennsylvania families,  teachers, students, workers, and businesses saved lives, jobs, and  businesses.   As we are on our way to beating this pandemic, I look forward to  seeing their smiling faces again on Independence Day.   Let's take lessons from this pandemic. American workers need higher  wages. Healthcare is a right. School and childcare funding is vital. It  is time to upgrade our infrastructure.                            ____________________
