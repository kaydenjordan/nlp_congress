 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Jackson for  convening this Special Order and Representatives Cori Bush and Ayanna  Pressley for their leadership in creating the Congressional ERA Caucus.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the first Black woman to represent  Virginia, the birthplace of American democracy and the birthplace of  American slavery.   I rise as a former State legislator who led Virginia to become the  38th and final State necessary to ratify the equal rights amendment. It  is poetic justice that Virginia was the final State necessary for  ratification.   It has been a long march toward equality in Virginia's history. In  1619, when the first women were recruited to Jamestown, it was to make  wives to the inhabitants, and their rights were surrendered to their  husbands. They couldn't vote, they couldn't hold public office, they  couldn't control their own property.   African-American women who arrived in 1619 were considered property  and had fewer rights, if any at all.   In 1776, the Declaration of Independence established the principle  that all men were created equal with inalienable rights. They didn't  mean me.   When the Constitution was developed for we the people in order to  form a more perfect Union, it didn't include me.   The Constitution purported to create a government by, of, and for the  people, but not for me. Only for White men.  [[Page H1463]]    For the past centuries, we have made major progress to secure the  blessings of liberty for every American.   We have made that progress thanks to the struggle and sacrifice of  Black women who were in the fight from the beginning but were the last  to benefit from our work. We were there in the fight to abolish  slavery. As you heard, we were there in the fight for women's suffrage,  even when we were told to march in the back.                                time  2030    We marched for civil rights in the 1960s, even though we weren't  given a speaking role. We have fought, organized, and marched for  ratification of the equal rights amendment for over a hundred years.   It is absurd that, a hundred years after the ERA's introduction,  women still do not have the same constitutional rights as men.   That is why I am not only committed but honored to carry on this  fight in Congress with my sisters in this fight, with Representatives  Bush and Pressley in the Congressional ERA Caucus.   Women across our Nation have waited too long for equality. It is our  time. Publish the ERA today so that, tomorrow, our daughters don't have  to fight the same fight.
