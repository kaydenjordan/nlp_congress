 Madam President, today I honor one of the most dedicated,  selfless, and accomplished leaders I have known, my late classmate, COL  Jeff Jones.   Jeff passed away in 2010 after a heroic battle with brain cancer, but  his legacy will be engraved in steel this November when the Army names  its new Psychological Operations Headquarters Building in Fort Bragg,  NC, for him. Colonel Jones dedicated his life and career to our  national defense, and this tribute could not be more fitting.   Jeff and I were classmates at West Point. When you first met Jeff,  you knew he had special talents. While my other classmates and I were  struggling just to pass inspection, Jeff was leading rifle drill and  ceremony to perfection, honed by his years of military academy  upbringing in Georgia. He was a natural, inspiring leader, and we all  looked up to him. As cadets and later as officers, Jeff exemplified  everything we strived to be as members of the Long Grey Line, always  representing what was best and most noble about West Point, the Army,  and America. He was the epitome of ``Duty, Honor, Country.''   We graduated together in 1971, and Jeff began his career as an  infantry officer in the 509th Airborne in Germany, where he climbed the  Matterhorn and trained with British and French airborne troops. He  later commanded an infantry company at Fort Ord, CA, and met his  wonderful wife Pamela along the way. His career moved swiftly, serving  as aide-de-camp to some of the top generals of the day and earning  advanced degrees from prestigious institutions. Presciently, while  serving on the staff of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  International Security Affairs, he authored the study recommending the  creation of U.S. Central Command.   Jeff also embarked on several international tours, including with the  U.N. Truce Supervision Organization in Lebanon following the Beirut  bombings and working with the U.S.-Soviet Nuclear Arms Control and  Space Negotiations in Geneva in the 1980s.   He especially imparted his leadership through his command of the 8th  Psychological Operations Battalion and later the 4th PSYOP Group, both  at Fort Bragg. Under his command, military and civilian teams deployed  across more than 60 countries on six continents, gathering key  intelligence throughout peacetime, crisis, war, humanitarian, refugee,  and counterdrug operations.   Jeff finally retired from Active Duty in 2001, after his final  assignment as a defense attache in Paris, but his retirement was short- lived as 9/11 struck just months later. He was requested to serve on  the NSC in a civilian capacity in the Office of Combating Terrorism and  subsequently in the Defense Policy and Arms Control Directorate, and he  served with distinction.   In 2006, Jeff was diagnosed with brain cancer. He battled for years,  even as he continued to work and contribute to our national security.  With Pam by his side, he passed away in 2010 and was posthumously  inducted into the Special Operations Command's Commando Hall of Honor  in 2013.   Jeff had a quiet, fearless strength that was powerful when you were  in his presence. I consider myself extremely fortunate to have served  alongside him and to have learned from his intellect, skill, character,  and his love and devotion to Pam. And I am proud to have known him as  my friend.   The Army's new ``Colonel Jeffrey Jones Psychological Operations  Headquarters'' bears the name of a great man, and I know great things  will be achieved there.   I am proud to honor the legacy of Colonel Jones, and I know the  Members of the Senate will join me in recognizing the incredible  contributions he made for our Nation.                            ____________________
