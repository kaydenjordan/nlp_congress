 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  constitutional balanced budget amendment. My constituents sent me to  Washington to lower taxes, strengthen our economy, and to cut Federal  spending. We have made some progress on the first two, but we have a  lot of work to do on the third.   We have passed historic tax cut legislation, which is stimulating job  creation and economic growth, raising wages, and allowing the American  people to keep more of what is in their paycheck. The unemployment rate  has remained low, and over 200,000 new manufacturing jobs have been  created in the past 15 months. That is all good news for America's  future.   Unfortunately, Washington has an addiction to spending money that it  doesn't have, accumulating a national debt of now more than $20  trillion. That is four times more debt than in 1995 when Washington  fell one vote short of passing a balanced budget amendment. Politicians  in Washington told the American people that Congress could balance the  budget on their own and they didn't need a constitutional amendment.  That was flat out wrong.   Unless Washington is forced to rein in spending through the  discipline of a constitutional amendment, it will never balance the  budget. If there is any doubt, simply look at last month's omnibus  spending bill, which I voted against. That bill is exhibit A in the  case for a balanced budget amendment.   Our national debt undermines our economy and our national security.  Washington has a moral obligation to balance its budget. Our amendment  gives Washington the discipline that it lacks by ensuring that Congress  cannot spend more money than it takes in.   This resolution asks Congress to make the same tough questions and  decisions about its budget that the American households and small  businesses make every single day. We owe it to  [[Page H3166]]  our children and our grandchildren, so let's pass this resolution as a  first step toward financial discipline.
