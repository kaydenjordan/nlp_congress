 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate several businesses  and issues essential to Georgia's Fifth Congressional District and to  greater metro Atlanta.   As many in this Chamber likely know, my district is home to  Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. As many also know,  the coronavirus pandemic has ravaged air travel, an industry critical  to my district.   Which is why this morning I am proud to celebrate Delta Airlines and  Hartsfield-Jackson for the inaugural quarantine-free, COVID-free flight  from Atlanta to Rome, Italy.   As former chair of the international committee in the Atlanta City  Council, I challenge the House Foreign Affairs Committee to facilitate  measures that encourage more of this.   My responsibilities attendant to the Fifth Congressional District  prevented me from joining this group on this delegation, but I hope to  be on later flights.   I also rise to raise attention to the need for renewed support of the  former OPIC-like activities via the DFC, the Development Finance  Corporation. Attention to developing nations in Africa, like Nigeria,  Ghana, and Ethiopia; the Caribbean; South and Latin American countries,  such as Brazil and Colombia; Central Asia and Asia are in need of  support.   This morning, I also want to celebrate Home Depot, the world's  largest home improvement store, with more than 2,200 stores, employing  400,000 individuals. Under the vision of Arthur Blank, the Home Depot  supports countless lives and families and continues their unwavering  support of veterans.   We know that the COVID pandemic has affected many industries,  including home improvement. Many employees in industries all across the  country have been deeply affected by the economic toll caused by the  pandemic, which is why the stimulus discussions occurring in the  Capitol, if reports are to be believed, are still somewhat  insufficient. We simply cannot be content with $600 payments. $600 per  person is not enough. Frankly, my flights  [[Page H7237]]  here are about $300. So I am sure we can do better.   Mr. Speaker, as we enter the holiday season, I also want to spotlight  other Atlanta organizations for their support of those in need. I want  to celebrate Tyler Perry Studios for telling uplifting and inspiring  stories and using their state-of-the-art facilities to support 5,000  families with food this past Thanksgiving.   I also want to acknowledge two nonprofit organizations--Caring for  Others and Hosea Feed the Hungry--that are both helping to fill the  gaps during this pandemic.   We, in Congress, also need to do our part. As I stated earlier, we  can do better than the $600 being discussed in this stimulus proposal.  It is a good start, but it is not enough.   There are other Atlanta-based companies that are doing notable work  that merit recognition: UPS, which has been critical in the  disbursement of the COVID vaccine; and other companies, like Global  Payments and Equifax.   Later this week, I also plan to introduce legislation to advocate for  the continuation of the John Lewis Loop and Campbellton Road. Also in  need of inclusion is Old National Highway, Fulton Industrial Boulevard,  Candler Road, Camp Creek, and Martin Luther King Drive. They all need  relief now. They are critical to job creation in our community and need  investment.                            ____________________
