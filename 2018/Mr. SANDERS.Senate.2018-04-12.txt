 Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to  recognize the extraordinary work of Julie Nadeau of Waterford, VT.  Julie, a mother of five, has been a volunteer for the St. Johnsbury  Meals on Wheels program for the past 4 years, delivering meals to area  seniors 3 days a week.   Julie brings freshly cooked nutritious meals to 42 seniors in their  homes, many of whom otherwise might not have enough to eat. She plays a  critically important role helping ensure that older Vermonters in the  most rural and lowest income region of our State have access to  adequate nutrition. That, in and of itself, is no small matter.   Julie understands that she is doing much more than just delivering a  meal. She is also providing invaluable social interaction and  companionship for the seniors she visits. She takes pride in finding  time to have meaningful conversations with each senior, which goes a  long way to combat the effects of isolation that many older Vermonters  face, especially in rural areas.   The regular visits serve another purpose as well. Julie routinely  checks to make sure that the seniors are safe, secure, and warm. She  knows each person she visits and recognizes immediately if something  doesn't seem right. It is no exaggeration to say that Julie has saved  Vermonters' lives by checking when no one answers the door, taking the  time to discover that someone had fallen and been injured.   Julie Nadeau has my sincere appreciation for her remarkable work. Of  course, Julie is but one of many regular volunteers who give their time  to ensure that seniors receive nutritious meals and conversation. Each  and every one of those volunteers deserves to be recognized for their  efforts.   Moreover, the St. Johnsbury Meals on Wheels program is run by caring  and dedicated professionals. Chefs Ashley Coburn and Amy Garfield  prepare the nutritious meals that Julie delivers, and program director  Diane Coburn ensures that everything runs smoothly, as the organization  provides close to 36,000 meals this year, for a mere $6.64 per meal.   The St. Johnsbury Meals on Wheels program is but one of many such  programs that are doing incredible work all across the State. Together,  those programs served more than 1 million meals in Vermont last year  alone. This is an indispensable component of our social safety net for  older Vermonters.   Last month was ``March for Meals,'' when Meals on Wheels programs  across the country expand their outreach to draw attention to the  growing need for the services these agencies provide. I am enormously  pleased that many of my Vermont staff rode along with Meals on Wheels  volunteers across the State, including with Julie Nadeau, to see the  wonderful work they are doing.                            ____________________
