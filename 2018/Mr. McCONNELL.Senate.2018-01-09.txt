 Mr. President, yesterday, I mentioned that, already, 1  million Americans and counting will receive raises or special bonuses,  thanks to the incentives created by the historic tax reform law that  Congress passed and the President signed just last month.   For example, Darden Restaurants, Inc., which employs 175,000 people,  announced it is preparing to invest $20 million in its most important  asset--its employees. AT&T announced that 200,000 employees would  receive $1,000 bonuses. In Kentucky, Turning Point Brands announced  that their workers would also receive $1,000 bonuses. So far, more than  100 companies have announced similar plans.   Across the country and a variety of different industries, workers are  receiving significant one-time bonuses, permanent pay raises, more  generous retirement contributions, or other benefits. And their  employers confirm that it was tax reform that made this possible.   How is all this happening? How is it happening? After all, those who  were intent on opposing tax reform painted an apocalyptic picture. Over  in the House, the minority leader said tax reform was ``Armageddon.''  Here in the Senate, my friend the Democratic leader said there was  ``nothing about this bill that suits the needs of the American  worker.''   Fortunately, a majority in the House and a majority in the Senate  knew better. We know that the economy is not a zero-sum game. We know  it is completely backward to think that American businesses need to  lose in order for American workers to win. To the contrary, in the 21st  century economy, Americans are all in this together.   When our economy grows stagnant and when taxes and regulations make  it harder for companies to compete with foreign ones, that is when  wages fall flat and job opportunities dry up. But when Washington gets  out of the way, cuts back regulations, and modernizes the Tax Code,  when we give businesses more flexibility to invest and expand, then, as  we are already seeing, workers reap the benefits.   This is not some partisan talking point. As one economist wrote just  before we passed tax reform, ``It's the consensus view of professional  economists'' that ``lowering corporate income taxes would increase the  wages of workers.''   Tax reform became law less than 1 month ago--1 month ago--and thanks  to tax reform, as this chart points out, 1 million American workers and  counting are getting a bonus or a raise. That is what is happening, and  this is just the beginning.   Raises and bonuses are not the only way tax reform is providing a big  help to middle-class families, like the Kentuckians I represent. The  law also cuts taxes substantially for individuals and families, so they  can keep more of their own money and send less to Washington.   We reduced marginal rates. We doubled the standard deduction,  effectively creating a new zero tax bracket  [[Page S82]]  for the first $24,000 a family earns--zero taxes on the first $24,000 a  family earns. We significantly increased the child tax credit. We  expanded the deduction for medical expenses, and the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act repealed the punitive individual mandate tax penalty at the heart  of ObamaCare. That law penalized hard-working Americans twice--first by  failing to create health insurance options that met the needs of  working families and then by imposing a heavy fine on the families who  didn't want or couldn't afford the coverage. By zeroing out that unfair  penalty, we have repealed a core piece of ObamaCare and restored  families' flexibility to choose the health insurance that works for  them.   The result of all this is significant savings for middle-class  American families. A typical family of four earning a median family  income will keep more than $2,000 this year that they would have  otherwise sent to the government. Workers will begin to see the  difference in their paychecks as soon as February. Less of their money  will be deducted and sent to the IRS. More will be deposited into their  own bank accounts.   So the early impact of this historic tax reform legislation is quite  clear. Job creators and entrepreneurs are more optimistic, more than 1  million Americans are already getting raises and bonuses, and the  groundwork is being laid for a more powerful and more competitive U.S.  economy that attracts more investment and creates more homegrown jobs.   It is no surprise that, historically, tax cuts have enjoyed  bipartisan support. This time, unfortunately, none of our Democratic  colleagues chose to vote for this once-in-a-generation tax relief--not  a one in the House or in the Senate. But I am proud that the majorities  in Congress were able to pass this bill so that the President could  sign it into law. One million Americans, and soon to be many more, will  be grateful.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of the following resolutions en bloc: S.  Res. 369 and S. Res. 370.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed  to and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m.,  Wednesday, January 10; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that  following  [[Page S112]]  leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Parker nomination; further, that all time during  adjournment, recess, morning business, and leader remarks count  postcloture on the Parker nomination; further, that all postcloture  time on the Parker nomination be considered expired at 2:30 p.m.  tomorrow and the Senate vote on confirmation of the Parker nomination  with no intervening action or debate; finally, that if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:27 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, January 10, 2018, at 9:30 a.m.                            ____________________
