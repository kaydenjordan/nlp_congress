 Mr. Speaker, I also want to sincerely thank  Chairman Kevin Brady and the members of the Ways and Means Committee  for their continued and invaluable work to protect America's children  and strengthening our child welfare policy, as is in evidence in these  five bills we are considering today.   Mr. Speaker, foster care issues rarely drive our national media  headlines, yet, to the children who are in the child welfare system,  the importance of finding solutions and eliminating the barriers that  would ensure better futures, better outcomes, and a permanent  connection to a loving family can make fundamental, lifelong  differences to those who are some of America's most vulnerable  children.   The goal of the Family First legislation, of which these bills are  components, is to respond to the devastating data pertaining to the  outcomes for foster youth who age out of care, often without any  permanent connection and without the life skills and support systems  necessary to thrive as independent adults.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard so many times from the States that there  is a need to make our Federal child welfare funding flexible enough so  that we never incentivize the placement of children into foster care  who would safely receive care in their homes or with safe, loving  relatives. This bipartisan package of child welfare system improvements  makes important steps toward improving our child welfare system to  better protect children and families, and I am certainly delighted to  support its passage.   I want to thank, Mr. Speaker, again, those colleagues that have  worked on this for their invaluable work on this critically important  legislation.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell).
