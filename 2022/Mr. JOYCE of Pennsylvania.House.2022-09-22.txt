 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  this bill.   The crime rates that we have seen skyrocket across the United States  can be traced directly back to calls from far-left Members of Congress  to defund the police.  [[Page H8084]]    In my own district, we have seen more violent crimes than ever  before. In the city of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, a community of just  20,000 people, we have already seen 10 murders so far this year.   Instead of confronting this issue head-on, this legislative package  hands out over $2 billion to far-left programs while only funding $60  million worth of grants for police officers, and that $60 million would  be spread out over 50 States.   This bill is deeply misguided and will not address the root issues of  the crisis that we are facing. Instead, it spends Federal tax dollars  funding social workers under the guise of supporting law enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on these  bills, and I myself will vote ``no.''
