 Mr. President, the Securing the U.S. Organ Procurement  and Transplantation Network Act is an opportunity for Congress to make  history, an opportunity to change the lives of the more than 100,000  Americans waiting for an organ transplant.   Organ donation has always been a bipartisan issue. In 1984, Congress  passed the National Organ Transplant Act. That bill was cosponsored by  Senator Al Gore and Senator Orrin Hatch. I would like to thank the  bipartisan group of Senate colleagues who cosponsored our bill. I would  like to give special thanks to Senator Cassidy, who championed the bill  in the HELP Committee. I would also like to recognize Senators Wyden,  Cardin, and Young, who have worked with me for years to shine a light  on the deadly failures of the Nation's organ donation system.   Thank you all for your leadership. Our bipartisan work will continue.  The organ donation system has failed patients and generous donor  families from all walks of life. After years of bipartisan work in the  House and Senate, we have finally passed this bill. Success with this  bill means patients are the winners.   For almost two decades, Congress, government watchdogs, and the media  have questioned the United Network for Organ Sharing's ability to carry  out its responsibilities. I have written about these issues since 2005.  Since then, 200,000 Americans have died on the organ waiting list.   Those aren't numbers; those are lives. To put it in perspective, that  is the population of Des Moines, IA. There is a reason I call the  United Network for Organ Sharing the fox guarding the hen house.   In August of 2022, the Senate Finance Committee issued a bipartisan  report that detailed vast disparities in how Organ Procurement  Organizations serve their communities. Based on the findings, the organ  network has worse outcomes for people of color and rural residents.  This bipartisan investigation, which started when I was chairman of the  Senate Finance Committee, uncovered fraud, waste, abuse, criminality,  deadly patient safety issues, failure to recover organs, and  retaliation against whistleblowers. The Senate Finance Committee's  bipartisan report was clear: ``From the top down, the U.S. transplant  network is not working, putting Americans' lives at risk.''   We must break up the monopoly that has held the U.S organ donation  system hostage since 1986. Patients deserve the best possible care; it  is the difference between life and death. Our bipartisan bill will help  ensure they get the best care.   Earlier this week, our colleagues in the House passed this same  legislation to break up the organ monopoly and serve patients instead  of special interests. Today, by passing this bill, we have accomplished  a major milestone in saving lives and taking care of those who need it  most.    Mr. President, today is National Whistleblower  Appreciation Day on the Hill. So today we celebrate and recognize the  contributions and sacrifices that whistleblowers make every day for our  country.   I have said this many times before, whistleblowers get treated like  skunks at a picnic. It shouldn't be that way. Whistleblowers are  patriots. This year is special because it marks the 10th anniversary of  National Whistleblower Appreciation Day. And I am proud to introduce  the National Whistleblower Appreciation Day resolution for the 10th  year in a row along with Senator Wyden and the rest of the Senate  Whistleblower Protection Caucus.   As early as the Revolutionary War, the first whistleblower reported  fraud and misconduct. On July 30, 1778, the Founding Fathers passed the  first piece of legislation to protect whistleblowers in our country.  Whistleblowers are critical to the operation of good government.  Whistleblowers risk their jobs, livelihoods, and reputations when they  blow the whistle on government waste, fraud, and abuse.   Recently, VA whistleblowers approached my office and alerted me of  the Agency's failure to secure veterans' sensitive, private  information. They also exposed how the failure in security allows for  staff to learn the identities of whistleblowers, leaving them  vulnerable to retaliation. DEA whistleblowers also have provided  important details about alleged contract irregularities and the DEA's  failure to root out corruption in its foreign operations. The oversight  that flows from this kind of crucial information can help clean house  at DEA and save taxpayer money. It can also improve international drug  interdiction and save lives. Let's also not forget about the IRS  whistleblowers who have recently testified before Congress regarding  wrongdoing at the IRS and Justice Department.   As many know, I have had my fair share of Justice Department  whistleblowers over the years. Most recently, my public oversight  activities regarding the Justice Department and FBI shows that more  have come my way. God bless them all.   The information that I have made public, whether it is the VA, DEA,  DOJ, or IRS, it is only because of whistleblowers that I am able to do  the work. The government hides information that the American people  ought to know about. Simply put, that is wrong and we must ensure that  all whistleblowers are fully protected from retaliation and championed  for their work.   Accordingly, it is critically important that all Federal Agencies  promote openness and transparency. They must also ensure Federal  employees know their rights to blow the whistle on wrongdoing,  including to Congress. Federal Agencies must protect their employees  from retaliation and take appropriate corrective actions against those  who retaliate against whistleblowers. For me, there is no middle ground  when it comes to whistleblowers. They must be protected and fought for.  Full stop.   This year, I introduced the SEC Whistleblower Reform Act to expand  protections for whistleblowers and ensure SEC whistleblower awards are  made in a timely manner. This bill ensures that these whistleblowers  would be fully protected if they report wrongdoing to a supervisor.  Since we created the SEC's Whistleblower Program in 2010, it has been a  massive success. The SEC reported receiving a record number of  whistleblower tips in 2022--over 12,000.   This year, I also introduced the IRS Whistleblower Program  Improvement Act. And this week, I have introduced the False Claims  Amendments Act and the CFTC Whistleblower Fund Improvement Act.   There is still a lot of work to be done. In April, I wrote to  President Biden requesting him to honor whistleblowers by hosting a  Rose Garden ceremony on Whistleblower Appreciation Day. I have asked  every President since President Reagan to hold a Rose Garden ceremony  to honor whistleblowers. No President has done so.   The task of supporting whistleblowers doesn't start and stop on  Whistleblower Appreciation Day. It is a year-round job. Whistleblowers  are brave men and women who perform an invaluable public service.  Again, they are patriots.   Together, one day we are going to get that Rose Garden ceremony.                            ____________________
