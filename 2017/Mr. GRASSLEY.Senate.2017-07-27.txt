 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 17  minutes.    It is my understanding that if the managers need time  to break into my speech, I will be glad to accommodate that.   I rise today to inject a dose of badly needed reality into this very  important debate. Healthcare is a profoundly personal issue that  matters to every single American. In fact, every single Senator in this  body ought to agree on this point. Healthcare hits home for each and  every constituent we represent from our home States. From standard  wellness checks to lifesaving cancer treatments, each of us wants the  best, most effective and affordable medical care for the people we love  and for ourselves.   As policymakers, it is our job to solve problems. It goes without  saying that we are facing a big problem right now. Access to affordable  healthcare is out of touch for millions of Americans. That is despite  the promises made over and over. Remember that ObamaCare was rammed  through on a last-ditch Christmas Eve party-line vote.   Look at what that got us. Health insurance markets are collapsing  around the country. Since 2013, the average premium increase on the  individual market has jumped 105 percent.   Remember when President Obama promised affordable healthcare for all?  He promised we could keep our doctor. He promised that Americans could  keep their healthcare plan, and he promised all Americans that their  premiums would go down by $2,500.   We all know ObamaCare did not uphold these promises. Instead, we got  higher taxes, costly penalties, double-digit premium increases,  unaffordable copays, job-crushing and wage-crushing employer mandates,  and thickets of Federal regulations.   Now ObamaCare is collapsing. No one on the other side of the aisle  has made an attempt to legislate remedies to the law despite its grave  condition.   At this very moment, 72,000 Iowans in my home State are gripped with  uncertainty. Two insurance carriers have dropped out of the exchanges,  leaving only one to offer individual plans starting in January. The  policies offered by that insurance company will go up over 40 percent  next year, on top of huge increases this year, making it still  unaffordable.   ObamaCare is unsustainable, unaffordable, and unacceptable. This  brings me to the reality check that I mentioned when I started. As I  listen to some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I am,  frankly, astounded that they can deliver their talking points with a  straight face.   They would like the American people to believe that Republicans are  dead set on ripping healthcare away from children, the elderly, and the  disabled. Despite their red hot rhetoric, we have neither horns nor  tails, but we are dead set on working out the devilish details to get  to yes.   Democrats' hyperbole and fearmongering are standing in the way of  getting the job done for the American people. Fear is easy to achieve.  Legislating in good faith is hard work. ObamaCare defenders would  rather disparage than engage. They would rather obstruct a path forward  than to construct a path forward. They are standing in the way of  solving problems.   In the process, they are scaring the living daylights out of hard- working Americans who aren't able to stretch their paychecks to afford  health insurance for their families. If there is one job the defenders  of the big government have mastered, it is the role of Chicken Little.  They squawk, cluck, and crow at every opportunity to grow the size,  scope, and reach of government into our daily lives. To their way of  thinking, ObamaCare was a step toward single payer.   They will say and do whatever it takes to secure sweeping, universal  government control of the healthcare system, no matter how much it  costs the taxpaying public, the toll it takes on the U.S. economy, or  the loss of personal freedom.   Their message is dead wrong. Our reform efforts are not making the  sky fall. The Democrats' rhetoric reminds me of a similar situation.  The debate 20-some years ago was to reform welfare by reining in  runaway Federal spending and increasing the independence of  individuals. Just like now, that debate was full of dire predictions.   Some of my colleagues will remember the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan  of New York, then-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. He strongly  opposed efforts to reform the welfare system. He predicted that the  bipartisan proposals would result in an apocalypse and said:         If, in 10 years' time, we find children sleeping on grates,       picked up in the morning frozen, and ask, why are they here,       scavenging, awful to themselves, awful to one another, will       anyone remember how it began? It will have begun on the House       floor this spring and the Senate chamber this autumn.    That is the end of the quote from Senator Moynihan 20 years ago. The  facts will show that welfare reform was, in fact, not ``legislative  child abuse,'' as the former Senator of Massachusetts Ted Kennedy  predicted. Quite the contrary.   In the two decades since historic, bipartisan welfare reform was  enacted, reality shatters this doomsday prophesy of 20 years ago. The  reality is that the number of African-American children living in  poverty has fallen to the lowest level in history. The problem still  exists and deserves our attention, of course, but 1.5 million fewer  children are in poverty today, and 3.4 million more families are  independent from assistance.   At the time of welfare reform, the Chicken Littles forecasted  homelessness, poverty, and despair. Senator Moynihan also said that  requiring welfare recipients to work and limiting the length of time  that they could collect benefits added up to ``the most brutal act of  social policy since Reconstruction. Those involved will take this  disgrace to their graves.''   With all due respect to the memories of my former colleagues, their  rhetoric simply does not square with reality. The 1996 welfare reform  law lifted millions out of generational poverty, replacing lifelong  impoverishment and lifestyles of dependency with livelihoods restored  with hope and opportunity. These facts separate Democratic rhetoric  from reality.  [[Page S4385]]    In the absence of a credible reason to continue with ObamaCare's  failure, the only defense tactic left to the Democrats is fear. In a  vein similar to that of her predecessor from New York, former Senator  and Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said: ``If  Republicans pass this bill, they're the death party.''   In another vein similar to her predecessor, another Senator from  Massachusetts said that ``I've read the Republican `health care' bill.  This is blood money. They're paying for tax cuts with American lives.''   They are not alone in their obstructionism. The minority leader has  said that Republican-led efforts to reform ObamaCare are ``heartless.  It is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It brings shame on the body of the  Senate.''   Another Democrat chimed in that the Senate bill is ``downright  diabolical'' and would be ``one of the blackest marks on our national  history.''   Still another Democrat said his constituents are ``scared for their  children, they are scared for their spouses, they are scared for their  aging parents. . . . And . . . scared . . . for their own health and  well-being.''   Another one chimed in that ``our emergency rooms would be  overwhelmed. They would be unable to deal with the scope of that kind  of humanitarian need.''   Not surprisingly, the law's champion-in-chief, President Obama, has  fueled the fear factor, saying that the Republican efforts to reform  the healthcare law would put pregnant mothers, addicts, children with  disabilities, and poor adults in harm's way.   Such overheated rhetoric shows Democrats have abandoned rhyme,  reason, and reality. Too often, the arguments from the other side are  based on what Medicare was supposed to do, not what it actually did,  which fell far short of projections from the experts. Defenders of  ObamaCare are relying on a phantom rather than the reality of the law.   Democrats are refusing to work with us toward a better solution that  truly works. After years of neglecting consequential problems with a  partisan-passed law now on the books, they say that they have a better  deal. Let me tell you, thousands of Iowa families and small business  owners have contacted me with their personal stories of hardships. To  them, ObamaCare has been nothing but a raw deal, rather than a better  deal. What good is having insurance, they say, if it is too expensive  to use?   After more than 7 years of ObamaCare, the chickens have come home to  roost. And in less than 10 years, look what happens when government  gets in the way of the free market and consumer choice. Well, it is  obvious: higher premiums, bigger copays, fewer choices, less freedom.  Health insurance that costs too much to use is just not working for  hard-working American families.   I will end my speech today with an appeal from an Iowan from Avoca,  IA. She has contacted me many times about the hardships her family has  experienced since ObamaCare was enacted. She pays more than $25,000 a  year to insure her family on the individual market. If that sounds like  chicken feed to some of ObamaCare's defenders, I urge you with all  sincerity to get your heads out of the clouds and join us to fix this  flawed law. Republicans and Democrats can work together for the greater  good of the country.   It is said that when there is a will, there is a way. Many of us  recognize that ObamaCare isn't working as promised. Half of us voted  this week to move ahead to fix this problem. The other half is blocking  any effort put forward to reform the broken law. They are digging in  their heels and pulling out all stops of any solution and stopping it  dead in its tracks. Again, it reminds me of those who fought tooth and  nail to stop welfare reform 20 years ago. I quoted those people from 20  years ago. At the time, they predicted the most dire consequences would  befall our most vulnerable citizens. Thank goodness, the pessimists  back then did not prevail in their obstruction against welfare reform.  While welfare reform has not been perfect, it has restored hope and  opportunity to millions of Americans.   We can't afford to let the pessimists and obstructionists prevail  today against healthcare reform, and they seem to be acting like the  very same people that opposed welfare reform 20 years ago. The American  people deserve high-quality, affordable healthcare. ObamaCare has not  lived up to its promises, so it is time for elected leaders to live up  to the promise we made to the American people. Let's worry less about  who wins and worry more about who will lose when Congress fails to  restore the collapsing Federal law.   I yield the floor.
