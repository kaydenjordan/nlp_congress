 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my longtime  chief of staff, Clay Phillips, who is retiring at the end of this  Congress. I thank him for his tremendous career of public service,  including 16 years of service in the chief of staff role.   There are few people in the Tampa area who have not worked with Clay,  and I am grateful for all the work that he has done to ensure that  veterans receive the benefits that they have earned to ensure that our  neighbors were able to stay in their house during the foreclosure  crisis, all of his work on affordable healthcare, and for social  justice.   He was also instrumental in Florida's new statue, the Dr. Mary McLeod  Bethune statue that all Americans will enjoy seeing. She is the first  African American in history to represent a State in the National  Statuary Hall Collection.   He has always stood up for the voiceless, and as President Kennedy  encouraged, let public service be a proud and lively career.   Clay's career was proud and lively. I am grateful he has provided  selfless service, and I am grateful for his friendship and his devotion  to our neighbors.                            ____________________
