 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, we will vote today on the confirmation  of Ryan Bounds to the Ninth Circuit. He has been nominated to fill the  vacancy left by Judge O'Scannlain. Mr. Bounds once served as a law  clerk to Ninth Circuit Judge O'Scannlain.   Mr. Bounds is highly qualified to serve on the Ninth Circuit. A  native of Oregon, he attended Stanford University and Yale Law School.  He has dedicated his career to public service and has served in  government for the past 14 years. The last 8 years were as an assistant  U.S. attorney in Oregon.   I have listened to my colleagues on the other side voice their  opposition to Mr. Bounds. Interestingly, none of them cite anything Mr.  Bounds has done in his legal career as a reason for opposing his  nomination. Instead, they focus on two things. First, they say we  shouldn't confirm Mr. Bounds because his home State Senators didn't  return their blue slips. Second, they say some of Mr. Bounds' college  writings were insensitive. So I am going to start with point No. 1 on  which they base their opposition to him.   As I have explained so many times on the floor of the U.S. Senate and  in the Senate Judiciary Committee--and I don't know how many times to  the multitudes of journalists who are on the Hill--my blue-slip policy  is the same as all but 2 of my 18 predecessors who were chairmen of the  Judiciary Committee over the 100-year history of blue slips. Like  Chairmen Ted Kennedy, Joe Biden, and Orrin Hatch, I will hold hearings  for circuit court nominees who have negative or unreported blue slips  if the White House has consulted with the home State Senators, and I  will not allow Senators to abuse the blue-slip courtesy for political  or ideological reasons.   In the case of Mr. Bounds, the White House sought the Oregon  Senators' input, seriously considered the one candidate suggested by  the Oregon Senators, and waited several months for the Senators from  Oregon to establish their judicial selection committee, which is quite  a tradition in that State. The selection committee itself even  recommended Mr. Bounds. Yet the Oregon Senators still didn't return  their blue slips.   They say it was because Mr. Bounds didn't disclose some of his  college writings to the selection committee. There is a very good  reason he didn't--the selection committee never asked for his college  writings. In fact, Senator Wyden's staff instructed Mr. Bounds not to  disclose them. Moreover, the Oregon Senators refused to ever meet with  Mr. Bounds during this whole process.   It has been misleadingly said this will be the first time in modern  history we will have confirmed a judge without there having been at  least one positive blue slip from the two State Senators. My Democratic  colleagues have only themselves to blame. The way the blue slip used to  be enforced was through the 60-vote filibuster, and that was done away  with in November 2013, led by the then-Democratic majority and Senator  Reid.   For example, Chairman Hatch held hearings for five nominees in 2003  and 2004, despite there being the lack of a positive blue slip from  either home State Senator. These nominees were voted out of  committee. Then Senate Democrats blocked these nominees on the floor by  using the 60-vote filibuster. But my Democratic colleagues abolished  that filibuster, as I said, in 2013 for the reason that they needed the  votes and the freedom to pack the DC Circuit with liberal judges who  would uphold Obama's regulatory schemes.    Leading this effort was none other than Senator Merkley of Oregon,  who argued that 41 Senators shouldn't be able to block a Senate  majority from confirming judges. Now they have a different point of  view. Now he argues that he alone should have the right to block Mr.  Bounds from even getting a hearing in the Judiciary Committee.   In November of 2013, I told my Democratic colleagues that they would  regret abolishing the filibuster just to stack the DC Circuit Court of  Appeals with their friends. Now, obviously, today, as they consider the  Bounds nomination, they know they made a mistake.   Turning to the only other criticism my colleagues have made about Mr.  Bounds, which is in regard to his college writings, I don't believe  that misguided statements made in a college newspaper 25 years ago  should disqualify Mr. Bounds. I hope we don't live in a world where  controversial things that we write in college end our careers forever.  This is especially true with our kids and grandkids now in the era of  social media.   For example, a few years ago, just when the same thing came up on  Justice Wright going to the Minnesota  [[Page S5090]]  District Court, I voted and supported her despite very controversial  writings she had in law school. We shouldn't assume that views  expressed years ago during college and law school represent the nominee  today.   Mr. Bounds testified that he regretted much of what he wrote in those  op-eds.   We received numerous letters in support of Mr. Bounds' nomination  from people who have known him personally throughout his life. We  received a letter from some of his classmates at Stanford. And before I  quote, it is kind of like--these sound like they were his friends in  the dormitories. I never was a dormitory student, but I imagine you  really get acquainted with people there. This is what they had to say  about Mr. Bounds:         We have become aware of a handful of controversial op-eds       and articles Ryan wrote for The Stanford Review during that       time. None of us believes that these writings reflect Ryan's       character, either then or now. All of us remember our dorm-      mate fondly.        We are a diverse bunch. Yet Ryan never failed to treat all       of us with courtesy, respect, and civility, regardless of our       respective genders, sexual orientations, skin colors,       religions, ethnicity, or any other characteristics.        There is not, and never has been, a racist, sexist,       homophobic, or bigoted bone in Ryan Bounds's body.    Mr. Bounds has also been a community leader, promoting diversity and  equality. As a member of the Multnomah Bar Association's Equity,  Diversity, and Inclusion Committee, Mr. Bounds spearheaded programs to  expose underprivileged young people to the legal profession. He  mentored young scholarship recipients and helped those same people  navigate law school admissions and law school. He expanded low-cost CLE  offerings and organized anti-harassment and anti-discrimination  training.   Mr. Bounds is imminently qualified to serve on the Ninth Circuit. His  college writings do not represent who he is today. His professional  accomplishments and exemplary public service speak much more loudly to  his character and integrity.   I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  Mr. Bounds' confirmation today.    Madam President, I wish to recognize a friend, an  agricultural innovator, an inventor with I think about 80 patents. His  name is Eugene Sukup.   If you travel around the Midwest, you will see there are grain  operations on a lot of family farms. If you go to Haiti, as a result of  the catastrophe down there a few years ago, you will see how smaller  buildings that we would call grain storage facilities in Iowa serve as  homes for homeless people. That resulted from that catastrophe.   Eugene Sukup is a quintessential bootstrap American success story.  After settling in Iowa during the Dust Bowl and serving his Nation as a  sergeant in the National Guard, Eugene made his living as a farmer,  earning the title of ``Franklin County Outstanding Farmer'' in his  younger years, in 1962.   While working on his farm, like a lot of farmers, he tried to think  of easier ways to do things. He observed that pockets of grain-- particularly corn--housed in storage bins could overheat and, as a  result, spoil. Understanding the depth and breadth of the problem for  farmers across the country, he was determined to find a solution, and  he did. Through trial and error, along with gritty determination and  ingenuity, Eugene came up with something he entitled the ``Stirway  Stirring Machine.'' The innovative technology automated the process of  stirring stored grain and corn and became an instant success among his  fellow farmers. Eugene patented his invention and founded the Sukup  Manufacturing Company in 1963.   Through my years holding annual meetings in each of Iowa's 99  counties, Sukup Manufacturing from time to time has hosted the meetings  I have in Franklin County. After a tour of the factory, I always  enjoyed Eugene's allowing his employees to have an open Q&A session  with me so that I could hear what is on the minds of my constituents,  because these constituents can't afford to leave their jobs and come to  the courthouse to ask me questions. I try to go to people like them to  make the process of a representative government work, and the best way  to do that is face-to-face with your constituents.   Getting back to Sukup Manufacturing, by words and deeds, it is very  clear that Sukup Manufacturing is a great place to work and a devoted  contributor to the local community and global philanthropy. Fifty-five  years later, the Sukup Manufacturing Company--which was the idea of a  small family farmer--holds over 80 patents and sells its products in  more than 85 countries. It remains the largest family-owned, full-line  grain system manufacturer, employing more than 700 employees in the  community of Sheffield, IA, and if I had to guess its population, I  would say it is around 1,500.   Eugene's pioneering invention contributed to the success of tens of  thousands of farming operations, allowing farmers to safely store their  grain on their farms to capture the best market price. We have Sukup  grain bins on my own family farm near Waterloo, IA; more specifically,  the little village in New Hartford, IA. His ingenuity is a perfect  example of the opportunity America's economic system gives people with  ideas and drive.   Eugene's legacy spans Iowa's landscape from the Mississippi River to  the Missouri River and reaches beyond the borders of our State and the  borders of the United States. Sukup Manufacturing stepped up to  reconfigure grain bins into housing units, as I previously said, for  hurricane-ravaged Haiti. The units withstand 140-mile-per-hour winds,  providing a safe habitat for residents.   In 2006, Eugene was inducted into Iowa's Inventors Hall of Fame and  received the Outstanding Innovation Award by the American Society of  Agricultural and Biological Engineers. He was inducted into Iowa's  Business Hall of Fame in 2011 and was named a Legend in Manufacturing  by Elevate Advanced Manufacturing in 2015.   Through Eugene and its leaders, the Sukup family business has been a  constant voice for job creation and opportunity. His contribution to  manufacturing, agriculture, and the entire rural community and our  economy will be an asset to farmers and the agriculture community for  generations to come. It is amazing to think of what can happen in rural  and small towns throughout our country thanks to the successful  enterprise that Eugene Sukup represents.   Throughout our decades-long friendship, I have admired his relentless  work ethic and unwavering commitment to community and family. His  civil, political, and community leadership sets a very high bar for the  rest of us in America.   Eugene was an American inventor, innovator, and a great friend. He  will be greatly missed. May God bless him and his beloved family.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, last week, the Senate Judiciary  Committee marked up and passed by voice vote S. 2946, the Anti- Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018.   I was proud to introduce this bipartisan bill and to lead it through  the Judiciary Committee. I am proud to have Senators Nelson, Rubio,  Whitehouse, Cruz, Blumenthal, Tillis, Coons, Cornyn, Hatch, and Kennedy  as cosponsors.   It is not always easy to find common ground here in the Senate, but  there is one issue where there is no doubt we can all agree: Those who  aid or carry out terrorist attacks that kill or injure Americans should  be held fully accountable.   Those who have been impacted should have a meaningful avenue to seek  justice.   For over 25 years, the Anti-Terrorism Act has empowered American  victims of international terrorism to bring civil lawsuits in Federal  courts to vindicate their rights and obtain compensation for their  injuries.   Just as important, these lawsuits disrupt and discourage the  financing and material support of terrorist organizations. By cutting  terrorists' financial lifelines, the ATA helps to reduce global  terrorism, protecting Americans both here and abroad.   In short, the ATA puts terrorists on notice to keep their hands off  Americans.   I was proud to be the lead sponsor of the ATA back in 1992, which  removed the jurisdictional hurdles that, for too long, had frustrated  or outright prevented American victims' ability to seek redress.   Since then, terrorists and those who financially support them have  tried to blow holes in the law and stretch its exceptions beyond what  Congress ever intended.   The Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018--and its additional  improvements adopted in the Judiciary Committee last week--strengthens  the ATA and reiterates Congress's original intent that terrorist groups  and their supporters be brought to justice in U.S. Courts, regardless  of where the attacks occurred.   It is a carefully considered and deliberately crafted response to  efforts to undermine the ATA. It represents Congress's considered  judgment in responding to acts of international terrorism that kill or  injure Americans overseas.   The bill clarifies the ATA's so-called ``act of war'' exception.  Congress never intended that designated terrorist organizations could  dodge liability for attacks that kill or injure Americans by simply  claiming this exception.   Some, however, have twisted the exception to get away scot-free. The  ``act of war'' exception should not be a liability shield for  designated terrorist organizations or their supporters.   This bill makes clear that the exception doesn't apply to those  designated by the U.S. Government as foreign terrorist organizations or  specially designated global terrorists.   This is common sense. As one Federal judge put it, ``To find that a  terrorist organization can be a military force under the ATA would  defeat the purpose of the Act, 'which was enacted to deter terrorist  activity and hold liable those who engage in it.' ''   Outside of that, the bill keeps in place the current analysis that  courts conduct when determining who is and is not a military force.   Second, the bill permits victims of narco-terrorism to satisfy court- awarded ATA judgments with the assets of foreign drug kingpins. Assets  blocked by the Federal Government under the Kingpin Designation Act are  not currently available to victims to satisfy their judgments.   This bill fixes that.   Finally, the bill responds to recent Federal court decisions that  severely undermined the ability of American victims to bring terrorists  to justice. The ATA was specifically designed to provide  extraterritorial jurisdiction over terrorists who attack Americans  overseas. Last year, I led an amicus brief, with 22 bipartisan  Senators, to the Supreme Court in Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation  Organization, reiterating the purpose and scope of the 1992 law.   I was stunned when the Justice Department failed to stand up in that  case for American victims of terrorism.   Despite broad bipartisan support in Congress for the ATA and the  victims it protects, the Justice Department, in fact, actively opposed  those victims and their right to seek redress against terrorists.   Inconceivably, instead of standing up for American victims of  terrorism, the administration urged the Court to not even consider the  Sokolow decision.   Congress can act where the administration chose not to. Accordingly,  this bill makes crystal clear that defendants who take advantage of  certain benefits from the U.S. Government following 120 days after the  bill's enactment--such as foreign assistance--will be deemed to have  consented to personal jurisdiction in ATA cases.   Based on further improvements in a substitute amendment adopted by  unanimous consent in the Judiciary Committee, the bill also restores  jurisdiction in cases pending at the time of the bill's enactment. No  defendant, after all, should be able to enjoy privileges under U.S.  law, while simultaneously dodging responsibility for supporting  terrorists that injure or kill Americans.   The Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act is supported by thousands of  veterans and Gold Star families   It is supported by groups like AIPAC, the Anti-Defamation League,  American Jewish Committee, Christians United for Israel, the Endowment  for Middle East Truth, the Jewish Institute for National Security of  America, the National Council of Young Israel, the Union of Orthodox  Jewish Congregations of America, the Rabbinical Council of America, and  the Zionist Organization of America.   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have joined me  on this bill and whose staffs are working tirelessly to help us move it  forward.   I also want to thank Senators Nelson and Blumenthal for their  support.   Finally, I want to thank House Judiciary Chairman Goodlatte and  Ranking Member Nadler for introducing and moving the companion bill in  the House of Representatives.   Now that the bill has been reported to the floor, I ask for all of my  Senate colleagues' support and look forward to Congress sending this  bill to the President's desk very soon.                            ____________________
