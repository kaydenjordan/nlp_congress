 Mr. Speaker, the Trump administration  supports killing the only law that protects Americans from pre-existing  [[Page H4724]]  medical conditions. Fifty-four million Americans could lose health  insurance coverage without this important patient protection, including  nearly 7 million people stuck with COVID-19, the newest pre-existing  condition.   COVID-19 has killed 200,000 Americans in less than 8 months, and  288,000 new COVID-19 cases were diagnosed in the last 7 days alone. The  United States has 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of  COVID-19 cases because the White House's response to COVID-19 was slow,  sloppy, and chaotic. Now that same White House wants to kill the only  law that protects Americans from COVID-19, the newest pre-existing  condition.   We need a White House that protects American families and sides with  the American people, keeping them and their families healthy and safe.                            ____________________
