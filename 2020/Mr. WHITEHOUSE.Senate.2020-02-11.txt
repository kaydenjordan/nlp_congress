 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am here again, as the Senate returns  to regular business, to call us again to respond to the threat of  climate change. Here on the floor today, things seem back to normal.  The floor is empty. We have a Senator instead of a Chief Justice in the  chair. The quorum calls descend between the speeches. Our new pages are  figuring out the nonimpeachment routines of the floor.   Outside of the Senate, things are anything but normal. The threat of  climate change worsens by the minute. Carbon emissions continue to rise  globally. We hurtle toward calamity. Yet we do not act. What is  stopping us? The biggest, most powerful, most motivated force  preventing climate action is the fossil fuel industry, and, of course,  it would be. The fossil fuel industry reaps the biggest subsidy in the  history of the planet. The International Monetary Fund estimates the  global subsidy for fossil fuel in the trillions of dollars every year.  In the United States alone, the fossil fuel industry got a $650 billion  subsidy in 2015, according to the most recent report from the IMF. That  is about $2,000 from every woman, man, and child in the country.   You wrote the check, and they will spend big bucks to defend that  subsidy. In fact, to maintain their grip on that subsidy, fossil fuel  companies deploy lots of propaganda on the American people. They swamp  us in advertising. The game isn't just to sell you more gas. It is much  bigger than that.   Professor Robert Brulle of Drexel University--now in Rhode Island at  Brown University--together with his coauthors, wrote a recent article,  ``Corporate Promotion and Climate Change,'' looking at oil companies'  carefully crafted public relations campaigns deployed way back since  legendary muckraker Ida Tarbell chronicled the greed and cruelty of the  Standard Oil Company. To offset their reputation for greed and  nastiness, ``fossil fuel companies have attempted to burnish their  image in various ways,'' Brulle and his colleagues write, ``[including]  contemporary multimedia promotional campaigns . . . to project the  corporation as a positive, responsible, and legitimate social actor.''  Hah.   The public began to catch on to the harms of industrial pollution in  the 1960s and 1970s, and Big Oil deployed public relations campaigns to  stem the public opinion tide.   One example Brulle uses is Mobil Oil, pre-ExxonMobil merger. In 1970,  Mobil began buying space on the opinion page of the New York Times.  They called these things advertorials--not advertisements, not  editorials, but  [[Page S983]]  advertorials. They ran in the same section as real opinion pieces.  Every Thursday, those ads promoted Mobil's image as a good corporate  citizen and boosted its public policy priorities, like reduced  regulation of Mobil's operations. Meanwhile, Mobil worked hard to place  rosy ``earned media'' stories on airwaves and in print. ``Between 1975  and 1977 alone, Mobil representatives appeared on 365 TV shows, 211  radio shows, and gave 80 newspaper interviews,'' the study authors  observe.   I will pause to note some good news, which is that, just recently,  The Guardian announced that it will no longer accept advertising that  props up fossil fuels like oil and coal. The Guardian urged its  colleagues in the media to do the same. Acting chief executive Anna  Bateson and chief revenue officer Hamish Nicklin said in a statement:  ``Our decision is based on the decades-long efforts by many in that  industry to prevent meaningful climate action by governments around the  world.''   Welcome to our experience here in the Congress. As we have seen here  in the Congress, the fossil industry companies have done that with dark  money, they have done that with raw political muscle, they have done  that through fake science, and they have done it through advertising  campaigns. So bravo to The Guardian for shutting off that spigot of  fossil fuel nonsense. I hope American media outlets follow suit.   Dr. Brulle then turns to recent decades. Using spending figures from  1986 to 2015, he and his scientists find that corporate promotional  spending for the five major oil companies in the United States-- ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron-Texaco, BP, and ConocoPhillips--totaled  nearly $3.6 billion. That is an average of $120 million per year, and  the trend is upward.   After $35 million in spending in 1996, from 1997 to 2004, annual  spending rose to an average of $102 million per year. Then Brulle and  his team chronicled that spending averages leaped again between 2008  and 2016 to an average of $217 million per year.   These spending figures themselves are pretty eye-popping, but what is  important here is the patterns of spending. Brulle and his coauthors  write:         The bulk of this spending . . . corresponds to the       increased public and congressional attention to climate       change in recent years. Not unexpectedly, the major oil       companies spent $315 million in 2010 alone, which is when the       highest possibility of binding climate legislation occurred.    That is no coincidence. Here in this building, something was  occurring that the fossil fuel industry saw as a threat.   Brulle and his colleagues continue:         This high level of corporate promotional spending took       place in response to the legislative battle from 2009 to 2010       over the House of Representatives' passage of the Waxman-      Markey climate bill and the subsequent Senate consideration       of the Kerry-Lieberman climate legislation.    This pattern shows Big Oil's purpose: to block climate action in  Congress.   While we are talking about that period, right over there in the  Supreme Court, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others, on behalf of  their Big Oil funders, urged the Supreme Court to open up our politics  to unlimited special interest spending, and the five Republican  Justices on that Court, led by Chief Justice Roberts, did. From that  decision forward, we have seen a disaster in the Senate on climate  legislation. Before that decision, we had four or five bipartisan  climate bills going in the Senate at any given time. We had a  Republican candidate for President--John McCain--who campaigned for  President on a strong climate platform. But right after that decision  came out, right after the fossil fuel industry got handed that huge new  hammer to knock any dissent on climate out of the Republican Party,  they did so. We have had a lost decade since then. So it is not just  their advertising, but their PR spending certainly helped the fossil  fuel industry block the Waxman-Markey bill and obstructed efforts since  to solve the climate crisis.    Another study by Professor Brulle just last month chronicled the full  sweep of this industry's fight against climate legislation. Brulle  describes how this polluting industry used ads, webs of phony front  groups, bogus science, and that massive Citizens United political and  PR artillery to fend off any meaningful action by Congress.   Professor Brulle breaks this process down to its component parts;  one, shaping the direction of research efforts into nonthreatening  areas; two, concealing information about the harmful aspects of a  corporate product; three, attacking scientific findings and the  scientists who produce research that threatens corporate interests;  four, packaging their own carefully constructed interpretations of the  science to appear legitimate; and, five, aggressive efforts at spinning  the media to promulgate favorable press.   A typical example of the first tactic is oil company ads touting  research and investments in alternative low-carbon fuels or renewable  energy. For instance, we have seen ExxonMobil ads touting ExxonMobil's  research into algae biofuels, and we have seen BP ads touting renewable  energy under its label ``Beyond Petroleum.'' ``Badly Polluting'' would  be a better term.   So how much do these renewable investments represent? According to  Reuters, Exxon will spend roughly $30 billion this year--$30 billion  this year--in capital expenditures. That is Exxon's capital budget.  Investments in green technologies round to zero percent of Exxon's 2020  capital expenditures. You see the ads, but that investment, they call  it, rounds to zero percent of ExxonMobil's capital investments.   BP will spend more than $15 billion in capital expenditures. Its  renewable energy investments is 3 percent--3 percent--of that.   I challenge Exxon to disprove that it spent more on advertisements  touting its renewable investments than it does on the renewable  investments themselves. These investments are a prop for an advertising  campaign, like the Potemkin villages that were built for the czar when  he was taken out of Moscow to go see how happy the peasants were, and  they built phony villages near the railroad with dressed-up peasants to  dance and wave at the czar so he wouldn't know that revolution was  coming and that fury and anger raged through his country. This is a TV  version of a Potemkin village.   You go through National Airport right now, you will see the most foul  nonsense up on the walls of that airport designed to convince people  passing through National Airport at our Nation's Capital that these  companies are responsible about climate change. People walking in  forests looking natural, the phony-baloney investments designed to prop  up ad campaigns, they are immense in the PR space. You can see why the  Guardian will not take this poison any longer.   For decades, these ads blared these phony articles at the newspapers.  Their paid-for pundits populated the talk shows, just as the fossil  fuel companies polluted our atmosphere and our oceans. While they did  this, they knew better than anyone what they were causing.   Back in 1982, Exxon projected that by 2019, atmospheric  CO2 would reach between 390 and 420 parts per million. Sure  enough, as 2019 drew to a close, guess where carbon dioxide in our  atmosphere was. It had just crossed 410 parts per million. They  predicted this, and they were right. But instead of acting on what they  knew, they rammed all this public relations nonsense--this has been the  atmospheric carbon dioxide climb. But instead of reacting to this in a  responsible way and trying to really do something with renewable fuels,  they did fake renewable investments to prop up advertising campaigns to  convince the public that they were on it. These are the phrases right  now from the American Petroleum Institute: We are on it. Don't worry.  Don't get mad. Don't get involved. We are on it.   And then they shower this body with money and with threats, powered  up by Citizens United from the five Republican judges across the street  there.   Not only did Big Oil correctly model this increase in CO2  in our atmosphere that their product would cause, they also understood  what this meant. They predicted the hotter temperatures. They predicted  the melting ice sheets. They predicted the rising seas that Louisiana  and Rhode Island are so menaced by. They predicted the massive damage  that climate change would cause. Exxon knew its business was ultimately  toxic to our planet. And the Exxon CEO who led them through this, the  craftsman and CEO of so many of these campaigns of lies, now sits  happily on the board of J.P. Morgan--J.P.  [[Page S984]]  Morgan which claims to be seriously and sincerely interested in climate  response. J.P. Morgan, a major investor that has been warned over and  over again by now more than 30 sovereign banks of the danger of an  economic crash from this carbon bubble popping--they give the man who  led this campaign of lies sanctuary and fees on their board.   So what is the purpose of spending all that money? The reason Big Oil  spends billions on its ads is to implant favorable perceptions of  fossil fuels into what Robert Brulle calls the ``collective  unconscious,'' and it does that to support its other great influence  project, which is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on lobbying  and on elections to control the politics of climate change and to  ensure that Republicans block any serious efforts to limit carbon  pollution. That is a scheme that deserves infamy, and it is a scheme  being perpetrated as I speak, right now, today.   Right now, the American Petroleum Institute--the largest trade  association for the oil and gas industry--has a seven-figure ad  campaign called ``We're On It.'' They run ads on the internet, on TV,  and on billboards--the ones I mentioned all over the DC airport-- designed to fool the public and policymakers that the oil and gas  industry is ``on its'' carbon and methane emissions problem. Not only  are they not on it, they are cheating about even reporting their  methane leaks.   This is an ad in the Washington Post's ``Energy 202'' newsletter just  last week. It reads: ``Let's create climate solutions together.''  Content from the API.   Seriously? What a joke. API, the same trade association that is  furiously lobbying against efforts to control methane pollution from  oil and gas facilities don't even want to report it fairly. When Trump  got in, job one was to take down the methane leakage reporting  regulation that was coming. They are lobbying for expansion of offshore  drilling, and they are lobbying against any price on carbon to offset  that $650 billion subsidy, and they want to create climate solutions  together? It is unreal--unreal.   Let's take a walk back into history. In 2006, here in Washington, in  the U.S. district court, a judge named Gladys Kessler wrote a long,  long opinion--well over 100 pages. It was a commanding opinion, and it  was an opinion that was upheld afterward by the U.S. court of appeals.  It was an opinion in relation to a case that had been brought by the  U.S. Department of Justice.   The U.S. Department of Justice had sued the tobacco industry, and  they had asked Judge Kessler to find the tobacco companies' PR efforts  fraudulent and to order them to knock it off. They were committing  fraud. Stop it. You are lying to people, enough already.   In her opinion, Judge Kessler found in favor of the U.S. Department  of Justice. Indeed, she found the tobacco companies' fraudulent PR  campaigns to have amounted to racketeering. It was a civil racketeering  lawsuit. I will quote her decision here. She said the tobacco industry  ``coordinated significant aspects of their public relations,  scientific, legal, and marketing activity in furtherance of a shared  objective--to . . . maximize industry profits by preserving and  expanding the market for cigarettes through a scheme to deceive the  public.''   So swap out ``cigarettes'' and plug in ``fossil fuel,'' and you have  described exactly what big oil companies do: coordinate their public  relations, scientific, legal, and marketing activity in furtherance of  a shared objective to maximize industry profits by preserving and  expanding the market for fossil fuel through a scheme to deceive the  public.   What the fossil fuel industry is doing is precisely the conduct that  was racketeering activity when done by the tobacco industry, but don't  expect Bill Barr's Department of Justice to pursue any type of legal  action like that. The fossil fuel industry is too strong, and the fix  is too far in.   This is all rotten stuff. It is gross. It is banana republic  behavior. It is not what we expect here in the United States of  America.   It is on us. It doesn't have to be this way. We can stop it. We have  the power here in the Senate to shake off the malign influence of a  desperate and greedy industry and actually tackle the defining issue of  our time, like Americans should.   So let's have a real debate on a real climate change bill. Let's  surprise the world and pass something big and bold. Let's wake up to  the threat of climate change and get ahead of its consequences before  the situation becomes irretrievable.   I yield the floor.
