 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 276) a bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to ensure  reliable air service in American Samoa, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 276         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. RELIABLE AIR SERVICE IN AMERICAN SAMOA.         Section 40109(g) of title 49, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) in paragraph (2), by striking subparagraph (C) and       inserting the following:        ``(C) review the exemption at least every 30 days (or, in       the case of exemptions that are necessary to provide and       sustain air transportation in American Samoa between the       islands of Tutuila and Manu'a, at least every 180 days), to       ensure that the unusual circumstances that established the       need for the exemption still exist.''; and        (2) by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the following:        ``(3) Renewal of exemptions.--        ``(A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B),       the Secretary may renew an exemption (including renewals)       under this subsection for not more than 30 days.        ``(B) Exception.--An exemption that is necessary to provide       and sustain air transportation in American Samoa between the       islands of Tutuila and Manu'a, may be renewed for not more       than 180 days.        ``(4) Continuation of exemptions.--An exemption may       continue for not more than 5 days after the unusual       circumstances that established the need for the exemption       cease.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 276.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 276, as amended. This bill will  improve transportation in American Samoa by making air service between  its islands more reliable and predictable.   Specifically, the bill streamlines a burdensome Federal regulatory  process that artificially inhibits economic growth and jobs on the  islands. The Senate unanimously passed similar legislation in the last  Congress, and I am hopeful they will join with us this year in  addressing this issue.   I want to thank the sponsor of the bill, the gentlewoman from  American Samoa (Mrs. Radewagen), for her tireless efforts on behalf of  her constituents and for working with us to bring a bill that benefits  so many of them to the floor.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 276.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Larsen) and the staff for their help on this.   I urge all Members to support H.R. 276, as amended.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to amend the title  of the bill.
