 Mr. Speaker, over 275 bipartisan bills  are piled up on Mitch McConnell's desk because he refuses to bring them  to the Senate floor for a vote.   Three of those bills are my bills, each of which passed the House  with over 400 votes from Democrats and Republicans alike.   H.R. 95, the Homeless Veterans Families Act, will keep veterans and  their families together and off the streets in safe and adequate  housing.   H.R. 840, the Veterans' Access to Child Care Act, will ensure  veterans have access to childcare to attend critical medical  appointments.   And H.R. 3224, the Deborah Sampson Act, aims to address the  inequities and barriers that women veterans face when accessing VA care  and benefits.   I urge Majority Leader McConnell to allow the Senate to vote so our  veterans will have the support and care they have earned and deserve.
