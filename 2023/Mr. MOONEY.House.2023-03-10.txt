 Mr. Speaker, going to work is more than just earning a  paycheck. It is an important part of human dignity. Unfortunately, too  many Americans are getting paid not to work.   According to a recent study, Americans can receive more money to stay  home than they could putting in a hard day's work. According to the  findings, a family of four in three States can receive more than  $100,000 in cash and benefits per year without working. A further 14  States allow a family of four to receive more than $80,000 in cash and  benefits without working.   In West Virginia, my home State, two unemployed parents with two  minor children can make over $73,000 in unemployment benefits and  healthcare subsidies. Unfortunately, this is more than essential  workers, like our firefighters or our truck drivers, make in a year.   Hardworking West Virginians helped build America. From the coal  industry to the logging industry, our Nation needs Mountaineers to keep  America moving forward.   While it is true that the CARES Act provided unemployment benefits  for Americans in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, the  pandemic is over. Even President Joe Biden said as much on ``60  Minutes.''   Now Congress needs to provide bipartisan solutions to get Americans  working again.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the passion of my good friend  from Texas, and many of the points he is making need to be heard and  understood. Even if it is uncomfortable, the truth has to be told.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about legislation I am promoting to  return the United States to the gold standard. As was discussed  earlier, our Nation is facing an inflation crisis not seen in over 40  years.   Inflation is a regressive tax hurting lower-income Americans more  than anyone else. West Virginians have seen the value of their savings  erode before their very eyes as a result of the reckless tax-and- spending spree of President Joe Biden and the Washington Democrats and  an overzealous Federal Reserve.   Thanks to Democrats, your 401(k) is now more like a 301(k), and it  will go even lower if they stay in power.   Today, our national debt is over $32 trillion, which is borrowed, not  only from Americans, but also from foreign adversaries.   We know who is responsible for the current debt crisis, but the  question has to be asked: What in our country's history allowed us to  get to this point?   The answer can actually be traced back to 1971, when President  Richard Nixon took the United States off the gold standard. Rather than  tackle the root causes of economic challenges, Nixon severed the  dollar's convertibility to gold once and for all. President Nixon said  at the time that that would actually combat inflation.   Art Laffer, a well-known and respected economist, accurately warned  that taking the United States off of the gold standard would actually  only exacerbate these problems. What followed was a period of severe  inflation, rivaled only by what we are seeing today.   Domestic production became more expensive and corporate profits  declined, so companies were encouraged to shift production abroad,  overseas where labor costs were cheaper.   Today, our number one economic rival is China, which continues to  attract American companies, due to the cheapness of production there.   Now, the gold standard, as we know it, is not actually using the gold  as currency but, rather, tying the dollar bill directly to the value of  that gold. Under the gold standard, any American would be able to trade  their dollars for a fixed amount of gold.   By linking the dollar to the value of gold, the money supply could  only be increased if the supply of gold increases. This connection  protects the purchasing power of your hard-earned tax dollar.   The gold standard would protect against Washington's irresponsible  spending habits and the creation of money out of thin air. Prices would  be shaped by economics, rather than instincts and wishes of Federal  bureaucrats. With the gold standard, no longer would our economy be at  the mercy of the Federal Reserve and reckless Washington spenders.   Through government mismanagement and economic manipulation, is it any  surprise that many Americans are looking for alternatives to the U.S.  dollar in cryptocurrencies?   Americans are losing confidence in our currency. It is long past time  for Congress to begin considering a return to the gold standard. That  is why I will be introducing legislation to do exactly that, as I have  in previous Congresses.   Under my proposal, the Secretary of the Treasury would define the  U.S. dollar in terms of a fixed weight of gold  [[Page H1269]]  based on the market price, while allowing dollar bills to be exchanged  for gold at that rate.   Had the United States been on the gold standard, or some other fixed  standard, we would not be in the inflation crisis we are in today.   I hope to work with the new Republican majority to make sure this  issue gets the attention it deserves.              Expanding Access to Capital for Rural Job Creators     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address my bill, the  Expanding Access to Capital for Rural Job Creators Act.   Earlier this year, the House resoundingly passed my bipartisan  Expanding Access to Capital for Rural Job Creators Act. Rural small  businesses face unique challenges that big city businesses do not.  Nearly 20 percent of the United States population lives in rural areas  and yet, businesses in rural areas raised under 2 percent of total  capital over the last 3 years.    West Virginia, which I am so proud to represent, is a very rural  State, where no city has a population greater than 50,000 people, so my  legislation simply requires the Security and Exchange Commission, SEC,  Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation to identify  and report to Congress those challenges rural small businesses face  when trying to access our capital markets. This will make it easier for  Congress to then act to address these problems.   My bill would make it easier for Congress to do our jobs and make  sure rural small businesses like in West Virginia, are not left behind.  I hope the Senate takes up this commonsense measure promptly.
