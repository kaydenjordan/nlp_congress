 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, I rise very briefly to thank my friend,  the chairman of the Intelligence Committee.   One more time, I urge all of our colleagues to vote for S. 139, which  will be coming up for a vote in a few moments.   This is a critical tool that our intelligence community uses on a  regular basis to keep America safe. It is a tool that--as someone who  has more, perhaps, observance of this program than most--I do not  believe has been abused or will be abused. This legislation includes  meaningful reforms on furthering civil liberties protections and making  sure that a year from now, the questions that many Members have asked  over the years, particularly of the Bureau, will be answered.   I think this foreminded legislation needs to pass and needs to pass  with an overwhelming majority.   Again, I thank the chairman for his good work. We had a 12-to-3 vote  out of our committee on this legislation. We had a 60-to-38 vote that  moved us forward on the cloture motion. My hope is that many other  colleagues who care deeply about national security will join us in the  final passage of this legislation.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.
