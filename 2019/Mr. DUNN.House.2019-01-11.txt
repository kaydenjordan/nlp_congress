 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the people of  Florida's Second Congressional District who stand in strong support of  the Trump administration's efforts to secure our southern border.  Unfortunately, obstructionist leadership on the other side of the aisle  is unwilling to even consider a commonsense solution to the problem  that hurts the security of our Nation.   This has become a needlessly divisive issue. We simply must secure  our borders. Despite the steadfast efforts of law enforcement, human  traffickers, drug dealers, and other violent criminals continue to  enter our country from the southern border daily. Furthermore, the  majority of heroin, fentanyl, and methamphetamine in America are  smuggled into America from Mexico.   With the opioid epidemic and drug addiction costing our economy  hundreds of billions of dollars annually, and taking countless lives,  we must take action.   I stand with my colleagues and President Trump in our commitment to  secure our Nation and protect our people.                            ____________________
