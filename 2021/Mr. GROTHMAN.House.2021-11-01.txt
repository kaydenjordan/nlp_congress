 Mr. Speaker, over the weekend I attended a University  of Wisconsin football game, and for awhile I sat high in the second  deck overlooking the campus and the beautiful Lake Mendota.   As I stood there looking at over 80,000 people, I wondered what was  going on in different people's minds. Some people were looking at  beautiful Lake Mendota. Some people were looking at the beautiful  college buildings: Vilas Hall and Van Vleck Hall. Other people were  looking down on the football game.   As I looked at the 80,000 people, I realized that some people looking  at 80,000 people said: Wouldn't it be great if we hired all 80,000  people to be new IRS agents?   Please, don't let this country become East Germany. Vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I hope we all vote ``no'' on the reconciliation bill.                            ____________________
