 Mr. Speaker, yesterday we unveiled plans for  a new, state-of-the-art land port of entry at the Peace Bridge in  Buffalo, New York.   Deploying the most advanced detection technology, the Gateway at  Buffalo will improve national security and  [[Page H1276]]  public safety. It will cut wait times for both passenger and commercial  vehicles in half. It will greatly improve air quality in the  neighboring community. It will improve aesthetics with new L.E.D.  lighting, landscaping, and public art.   This plan will improve our region's growing economic relationship  with Canada, leveraging $30 billion in commerce and over $200 billion  in economic activity, supporting over 1 million jobs. This plan is long  overdue. It is a plan that our community deserves and a gateway that is  worthy of the promise and potential of our future in Buffalo and  western New York and our relationship economically and otherwise with  the great country of Canada.                            ____________________
