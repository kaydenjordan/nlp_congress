 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 979, I call  up the bill (H.R. 2116) to prohibit discrimination based on an  individual's texture or style of hair, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        March 18, 2022, on page H3833, in the second column, the  following appeared:CREATING A RESPECTFUL AND OPEN WORLD FOR  NATURAL HAIR ACT OF 2022  Madam Speaker, pursuant to  House Resolution 979, I call up      The online version has been corrected to read:CREATING A  RESPECTFUL AND OPEN WORLD FOR NATURAL HAIR ACT OF 2021   Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 979, I call up    ========================= END NOTE =========================     The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 2116.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural  Hair Act, or the CROWN Act, is a critically important civil rights bill  that would explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of hair  texture or hairstyles commonly associated with a particular race or  national origin. It would do so in areas of the law where  discrimination on the basis of race or national origin is already  prohibited, such as employment, education, and housing.   Although Republicans blocked passage of this bill a few weeks ago,  their arguments have just as little merit now as they did then. That is  why we are here again, to advance this important legislation.   Among the arguments that we heard previously was that this bill was  not needed because the law already protects people from hair-based  discrimination. While I agree that existing civil rights statutes, if  properly read, already make such discrimination unlawful, several  Federal courts have erroneously rejected this interpretation, leaving  the state of the law unclear at best.   Far from being duplicative, this legislation is absolutely essential  to remove any ambiguity from the law and to fix these courts'  misinterpretation of Federal civil rights law.   Republicans also argued that this legislation could somehow undermine  the ability of employers to maintain workplace safety standards. But  nothing could be further from the truth. This bill does nothing to  prohibit employers from addressing safety concerns, and the  longstanding provisions under the civil rights laws that enable  employers to ensure workplace safety would remain firmly in place.   Since neither of these arguments holds up to scrutiny, it is  important to step back and understand why the CROWN Act is so urgently  needed. According to a 2019 study conducted by the JOY Collective,  Black people are ``disproportionately burdened by policies and  practices in public places, including the workplace, that target,  profile, or single them out for natural hairstyles,'' and other  hairstyles traditionally associated with their race, like braids, locs,  and twists.   This has real consequences for real people. Students have been sent  home from school or told they could not walk at graduation. Employees  have been told to change their hair because it violated their  employer's dress code. Some people have even been denied jobs  altogether because of their hairstyles.   In view of these disturbing facts, 14 States have enacted statutes  prohibiting discrimination on the basis of an individual's natural  hairstyle, in every case with bipartisan support and sometimes even  with the unanimous support of both parties.   I am disappointed that we did not see such bipartisan support when we  brought this bill up a few weeks ago, but my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle have another chance today to do the right thing. This  is a matter of basic justice that demands a national solution by  Congress. That is why I strongly support the CROWN Act and urge all my  colleagues, including my Republican colleagues, to do so as well.  [[Page H3835]]    I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) for her  leadership and for introducing this important bill this Congress. I  urge all Members to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I said that this was covered by the law,  but several Federal circuit courts disagree. Therefore, it is not  covered in those circuits, and that is why we need this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Jersey  (Mrs. Watson Coleman), the sponsor of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Ms. Bush), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader of the House of  Representatives.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would point out again, because some of my Republican colleagues  seem not to hear it, that this is the law, as they say, but that  several circuit courts say it isn't the law, so all this bill is doing  is reaffirming what the law is, despite several circuit courts. And we  see that the law in those States where the circuit courts have upheld  it properly has not resulted in any of the catastrophes we just heard.    Yes, I will. I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Yes.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, I just want to point out that we don't  need new drilling legislation. There are 6,000 leases which have been  granted by the Federal Government which the oil companies are not  drilling. They can drill.   Madam Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 15 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Ms. Williams).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, while racism and discrimination sometimes appear in  overt forms, they can also manifest themselves in more subtle ways.   One way is through discrimination based on natural hairstyles and  hair textures associated with people of a particular race or national  origin.   This CROWN Act would make explicit that civil rights laws prohibit  such discrimination. This is a matter of basic fairness and justice.   This bill passed the House last Congress unanimously, and I hope we  will do so again today.   All the arguments we have heard about everything else are interesting  and important but not relevant to this bill. This bill is purely about  discrimination, purely about protecting people from discrimination, and  we ought to pass it.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
