 Mr. Speaker, it was 16 years ago that we first authorized  Johanna's Law, it was a long time ago. I was a fairly junior Member and  Congresswoman DeLauro had worked on it for a number of years before  that. It is something that today will easily be reauthorized--and  America has been and will be better for--and seems easy. But it is  never easy to begin the process of helping people understand what they  don't know.   Misinformation or a failure to have information continues to cause  young women to die of cancer needlessly: whether it is ovarian cancer,  gynecological cancer of any sort, whether it is related to HPV, or some  other fashion. The fact is, Johanna's Law, H.R. 1550, which it is  merged with, in fact, is something that America needs to understand  today and in the future.   When we originally passed Johanna's Law, we had 257 cosponsors and  could have had more. More than 100 Republicans and Democrats signed on  before we brought it to the floor. On that day, we said, if we can only  get $10 million to get the awareness. We passed the bill and then we  went looking for the money.  [[Page H6684]]    Over time the money has increased. The fact is, Americans today,  especially young women, are not as informed as they need to be.  Reauthorizing both of these bills in one goes a step further to  educating people about preventable death, preventable cancer.   The fact is, I am thrilled that Congress, in such a tumultuous time,  from time to time, comes together across the aisle and does something  so important.   These bills do not cost much, but the lives they save are precious  and priceless. Mr. Speaker, I urge its support.
