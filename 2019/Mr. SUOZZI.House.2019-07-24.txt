 Mr. Speaker, every Democrat and every Republican in this  House believes, or at least should believe, that if you are willing to  go to work every single day, you are willing to work 40 or 50 hours a  week, you are willing to work 48 or 50 weeks a year, you should have a  decent life in America.   That is the American Dream: If you work hard, you make enough money  so you can find a place to live, you can educate your children, you can  retire one day without being scared.   And, right now, 1.3 million Americans are scared that they are going  to lose the retirement benefits that they negotiated for.   We have got to work together to try and solve this problem on their  behalf.   Chairman Neal has stated he has been working on this for the past 2  years. People say, ``Oh, we have got to work together. We have got to  work together.''   Let's do it already. This is your opportunity to try and move  together to help hardworking people in America, to save the American  Dream for people that have put the time in, that have done the hard  work, that have negotiated for their benefits.   It is time to protect these people. And it is time to stop saying we  are going to work together; it is time to work together now and pass  the Butch Lewis Act.
