 Madam Speaker, let's take a look at what Democrats are  ignoring so they can censure a conservative Republican because he  posted a cartoon they found offensive and which he took down himself:   More than two million illegal aliens crossing our border this  calendar year;   Attorney General Garland deploying Federal agents to spy on parents;   Inflation driving gas prices up;   Everybody's Thanksgiving dinner is going up;   A vax mandate that is clearly unconstitutional;   A bankruptcy-inducing, bureaucracy-bloating spending bill by  Democrats;   Supply chain in shambles;   Democrats consistently ignoring calls to violence and anti-Semitic  statements of their own;   Foreign policy embarrassments;   Americans languishing behind in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan;   China, Iran, North Korea on the move.   Yeah, we have been ignoring those things. But we are here today.   I lived in Japan for several years. I speak Japanese. I read and  write Japanese. This is an anime. It is ``Shingeki no Kyojin'', highly  popular, stylized, intended to demonstrate the alienation people feel,  particularly young people in their cultures.   Now, does anime have violence? Yes. It is highly stylized violence.  It is not meant to induce people to violence.    It was not Mr. Gosar's intention, I believe, and he has  made that clear, to induce anyone to violence. Like he, I also condemn  violence, but I would ask you to reconsider further usurping and taking  control of this body for political purposes because that is what is  happening here today.
