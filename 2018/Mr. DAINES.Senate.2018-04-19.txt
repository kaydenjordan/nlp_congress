 Mr. President, this week, I have the honor of  recognizing  [[Page S2317]]  the Museum of the Beartooths director, Penny Redli, for receiving the  Museums Association of Montana President's Award.   Penny Redli lives in Columbus where she serves as the director of the  Museum of the Beartooths. She has worked at the Museum of the  Beartooths for just over 10 years, and under her leadership, the museum  community in Montana has grown tremendously. Before her time at the  Museum of the Beartooths, she spent 9 years working at the Carbon  County Historical Society and Museum.   While her extensive time spent working at museums in Montana is  notable, it is her passion and dedication to the community that makes  her stand out. Her willingness to provide leadership and engage with  other organizations around the State has given other museums the  opportunity to thrive. Her passion for history and the community has  made her a leader among her peers.   I congratulate Penny Redli on her success with the Museum of the  Beartooths and thank her for her contributions to Montana and the  greater Stillwater community.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the Senate Resolution, ``Designating the week of April 21, 2018,  through April 29, 2018, as ``National Park Week'' introduced for  myself, Senator King, and others be printed in the Record.                                S. Res. 478         Whereas, on March 1, 1872, Congress established Yellowstone       National Park as the first national park for the enjoyment of       the people of the United States;        Whereas, on August 25, 1916, Congress established the       National Park Service with the mission to preserve unimpaired       the natural and cultural resources and values of the National       Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of       current and future generations;        Whereas the National Park Service continues to protect and       manage the majestic landscapes, hallowed battlefields, and       iconic cultural and historical sites of the United States;        Whereas the units of the National Park System can be found       in every State and many territories of the United States and       many of the units embody the rich natural and cultural       heritage of the United States, reflect a unique national       story through people and places, and offer countless       opportunities for recreation, volunteerism, cultural       exchange, education, civic engagement, and exploration;        Whereas the national parks of the United States attracted       record-breaking visitation during the National Park Service       Centennial, with over 330,000,000 recreational visits to       these incredible places both in 2016 and 2017;        Whereas visits and visitors to our national parks are       important economic drivers for the economy responsible for       $18,400,000,000 in spending in 2016;        Whereas the dedicated employees of the National Park       Service carry out their mission to protect the national parks       of the United States so that the vibrant culture, diverse       wildlife, and priceless resources of the parks will endure       for perpetuity; and        Whereas the people of the United States have inherited the       remarkable legacy of the National Park System and are       entrusted with the preservation of the National Park System       throughout its second century: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That Congress--        (1) designates the week of April 21, 2018, through April       29, 2018, as ``National Park Week''; and        (2) encourages the people of the United States and the       world to visit and experience the treasured national parks of       the United States.     Mr. President, as a fifth generation Montanan who grew up  just a short drive from our Nation's first National Park, Yellowstone  National Park, and as Chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources  Subcommittee on National Parks, I am excited to introduce this  resolution to reassure the public that Congress recognizes the  remarkable value that our National Parks bring to our national  heritage. I am happy to be joined by Ranking Member Angus King and  Senator Hirono and nearly 30 of our bipartisan colleagues in  introducing this resolution. The support of this resolution is a  reflection that our National Parks bridge political divides and make  our Nation uniquely American. I am hopeful that Congress, the Trump  Administration and future Administrations will continue to invest in  our National Parks to ensure their legacy endures for our children and  generations to come.                            ____________________
