 Mr. President, since 2010, I have sponsored a  State of the Union essay contest for Vermont students. The contest, now  in its 7th year, is an opportunity for Vermont's high school students  to articulate what issues they would prioritize if they were President  of the United States. A panel of Vermont teachers reviewed all of the  essays submitted and selected the top 20.   I would like to congratulate each and every finalist and to  specifically acknowledge Quinn Nelson Mayo as this year's winner of the  contest. I would also like to recognize Musa Mayange for placing second  and A.J. DeFelice for placing third. I ask to have printed in the  Record the winning essays.   The material follows:           quinn nelson mayo, st. johnsbury academy junior (winner)         The United States was founded on several core values; the       most important, as most of us agree, is freedom. This shared       belief has been the foundation of our country for over 200       years. And for centuries, media has been a major outlet for       people to exercise this freedom because it allows them to       share their opinions with the masses. The idea of free speech       took on a different meaning with the development of the       internet in the late 80s. Since then, this liberty has grown       exponentially. Now people have the ability to share their       thoughts with a much larger audience. It is possible to do       this anonymously and without fear of consequence. The       internet is an incredible asset which has helped with       globalization and the spread of information. However, this       form of media does have its drawbacks. The leading issue is       that it enables the spread of false information. So, while       the internet embodies our nation's core value of freedom, it       can also be detrimental to another vital aspect of our       society: educated and well informed citizens.        Regardless of one's political views, we can all agree that       2016 has been a tumultuous year for politics, here in the       United States and across the globe. The 2016 presidential       campaign was a dramatic affair, and just the opening act to       one of the most high-stakes elections in our country's       history. The actions and rhetoric of the president-elect have       inspired a great political shift, as well as a burgeoning       sense of xenophobia and hatred throughout the country. During       times such as these, it is important to focus on what we can       do to create a better future. Much of the hate directed       towards certain groups of people is due to ignorance and can       be traced back to stereotypes perpetrated by unreliable media       sources. Forcing media sites to drastically increase their       censorship would rightfully anger their users, on the grounds       that it restricts their constitutional right to free speech.       Therefore, the most plausible and effective solution to the       problem of misinformation is to educate people.        As of this year, 78% of the United States population has a       social media profile (Statista). Facebook and Twitter have       billions of users across the world. It is imperative that we       use such sites with care. The recent controversies over fake       news have made the influence of the media on politics       increasingly apparent. The rumor now known as ``Pizzagate''       is a prime example of a fake news story with tremendous       influence. Millions of people believed that Hillary Clinton       was involved in a child-prostitution ring run out of a pizza       parlor. This is because, for a vast number of people, social       media and biased news sources are their only ways of       acquiring information. In fact, it is estimated that 62% of       American adults use social media at least occasionally as a       news source (Pew Research Center). However, many blindly make       the assumption that it is accurate. When hundreds of       thousands of people are susceptible to hate-driven fake news,       it can have a huge impact on our democracy.        This is why I propose the incorporation of media literacy       as a core subject in all public schools. Public schools       educate the majority of our nation's children. Which is why,       by teaching America's youth how to approach sources       impartially and critically, we can fix this problem of       misinformation. Integrating media literacy as a required       course at elementary and high-school levels is an investment       in our future generations.           musa mayange, winooski high school senior (second place)         Twelve years and still no change. After fleeing from a       civil war in Somalia in 1992, my parents took refuge at a       refugee camp in Kakuma, Kenya. After 12 years of struggle, in       2004 we flew from the National Airport of Kenya to J.F.K.       International Airport in New York thinking our lives were       saved. Finally here, the land of the free and the home of the       brave. One of the only places on earth where you can taste       opportunity and smell a second chance. At the age of 17, I       can see it now. America's resistance to change.        Racism exists in America. Surveys reveal that whites apply       stereotypical thinking about blacks, considering them lazy       and unintelligent. What are we going to do about these       attitudes towards persons of color?        The American National Election Studies asked voters to rank       blacks and whites from hardworking to lazy, from intelligent       to unintelligent. In 2012, 62 percent of whites gave blacks a       lower score in at least one area. In 2008, 45 percent of       whites expressed negative feelings about black stereotypes.       (Milbank, Washington Post)        For a while, we thought that the issue of racism was over       and that our nation was going to move forward and ``leave the       past in the past.'' It almost had me fooled because we live       in Vermont and we sometimes can be isolated from world       issues. But racism is still here. When everyone thought that       it was no longer ``relevant,'' it's still alive.        As a young African-American immigrant, how can I wrap my       head around this? As Vermonters how can we annihilate racism       and get our community to be accepting of all races, cultures,       and ethnic backgrounds?        Ta-Nehisi Coates addresses the disadvantages of living with       black skin in Between the World And Me. Coates says ``. . .       today, when 8% of the world's prisoners are black men, our       race has been refinanced to the Dream of being white. Black       life is cheap, but in America, black bodies are a natural       resource of incomparable value.'' Black people are born with       a disadvantage. We are more likely to go jail than white       people. The Center for American Progress says, ``In the       United States, black people account for 60 percent of those       imprisoned. The prison population grew by 700 percent from       1970 to 2005, a rate that is outpacing crime and population       rates.        Black people make up 17% of the United States population       yet more of us are in jail. A black man is twice as likely to       go to jail than a white man, even if they did the same crime.        Racism was born when humans identified skin color as a       positive or negative factor. If each of us could accept that       we are all humans, we come from different places, and have       different interests, we could accept racial differences, but       not let them divide us. We will never move forward if we       don't work together side by side and knock down obstacles.           aj defelice, hartford high school freshman (third place)         The United States is one of the greatest countries on       Earth, prized for its natural beauty, economic opportunities,       and democratic principles. However, many challenges face our       nation. Among the most pressing issues are climate change,       immigration, and income inequality.        Perhaps the most daunting problem we face is climate       change, and the crucial role our country plays in it.       Although President Obama recently signed the Paris Agreement       to limit greenhouse gas emissions, much must still be done to       combat this issue. We can begin by putting unemployed or low-      income Americans to work--manufacturing, transporting, and       installing renewable energy products--such as solar panels,       wind turbines, and more. This would produce a similar effect       as the New Deal put into place by President Franklin D.       Roosevelt to combat the negative effects of the Great       Depression. Additionally, a carbon tax should be established       nationally, to lower emissions, and encourage the usage of       renewable energy. A carbon tax would also allow for tax       reductions in other areas, and combined with employing       Americans to transition to widespread renewable energy, would       create economic growth, while simultaneously reducing our       carbon footprint.        Another controversial issue which troubles our nation is       immigration. The United States is a country built on the       backs of immigrants, and to deny a path to citizenship to       millions who long only for a higher quality of life is       unpatriotic. We must stop dehumanizing these people and see       them only for who they are--people. Immigrants strengthen our       economy, whether it be as producers, consumers, or       developers. To deny them access to citizenship in our nation       would be depriving ourselves of economic growth and cultural       diversity. Economic and cultural change that would only       strengthen American society.        Income inequality is another issue which plagues our nation       today. According to countless years of research, income       inequality has a direct correlation on social and health       issues. A study conducted by the University of Wisconsin       found that people who reside in more financially unequal       communities are more likely to die before the age of 75. As       national income inequality decreases, so do social and health       problems. This decline can be seen in Scandinavian countries,       where having a more equal gross domestic product per capita       results in a higher quality of life. To make this possible       for the United States, corporations must be regulated and       held accountable by lawmakers to be sure that the American       people are receiving the representation they deserve. As       citizens, we must be responsible in electing officials who       will place the needs of the greater population  [[Page S360]]       above the interests of wealthy corporate executives.        Our nation is at a turning point in its history, and the       choices we make today will have lasting effects on future       generations.        The United States of America will remain a strong,       respected, and prosperous nation if we are able to look past       our disagreements and focus on making progress through       compromise. We must act wisely, and keep our eyes on what is       most important--the liberty we treasure as our nation's       crowning promise.                            ____________________
