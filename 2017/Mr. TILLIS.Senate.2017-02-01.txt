 Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Utah and  his eloquent comments about the Supreme Court nominee. I would like to  associate myself with everything he said. He has the kind of experience  and insight that I hope so many Members on both sides of the aisle will  listen to.   I am here to talk about the spirit of bipartisanship and getting  things done. I submitted an editorial to my local newspaper down in  Charlotte a couple of weeks ago. The whole premise of my opinion was  that in November the voters did not vote for a Republican mandate; they  voted for a results mandate. They are tired of the gridlock they see up  here in Washington. They are tired of people promising things they know  they can't deliver. They are wanting for a leader in President Trump  and in the congressional leadership people who want to produce results.  They want people who want to work across the aisle and come up with  bipartisan solutions to a lot of the problems that confront this  Nation.   You would have thought that I changed my registration and became a  member of the minority party with the criticism that I got from people  on my side of the aisle. I was called a RINO. For those of you who  don't know what that is, that is a Republican in name only.   When I was the speaker of the house in North Carolina, the last thing  I was ever called was a RINO. We worked on a conservative agenda that  made sense. We gained the support of a number of Democrats along the  way. North Carolina is a lot better place because of the courage of  those folks who were willing to work across the aisle to help our great  State, to go from one of the laggards in terms of economic performance  to one of the leading States in the Nation for economic performance  over the course of about 4 years.   I don't really care about the criticism from the talking heads--from  the far left or the far right--because I consider them one of the great  threats that we have to actually turning this Congress around and  getting things done. I am going to do everything I can to reach across  the aisle and produce solutions to some of the most vexing problems we  have.   There are solutions within our reach. If you think about immigration  reform, there is a 40-year-old failure on the part of the Republicans  and Democrats to address the immigration problem. Everybody wants their  position on one end of the spectrum or the other versus what the  American people want or a solution to the problem--a solution that  makes sure the American worker is respected and taken care of, that our  borders are secure, and that we end this 40-year-old failure on the  part of Washington to solve the problem.   They want solutions on criminal justice reform. We have many people  in prison who, after they get out, are more likely to go back into  prison because we really haven't thought about commonsense ways to help  them enter back into society and have productive lives, beyond just  going back into a criminal enterprise. We can solve that problem, but  we can only solve it if we have Republicans and Democrats come  together--and silence the voices who want their perfect version based  on their ideology--on a solution that makes sense to the average  American.   The agenda that we want to complete can only be completed if we have  people who have the courage to come to this floor and do what I  consider to be political courage. It is not courageous for me as a  Republican to stand up to a Democrat and oppose their view. That is my  job. I am a conservative. I am a proud conservative. Courage, in terms  of someone who would walk onto this floor, is someone who can look at a  person--a fellow Republican and conservative--and say: We are not going  to go where you want to go because we are here to get something done-- not just to make speeches, not to talk about an unachievable goal, but  to make progress on things that are sound, conservative policies. But  maybe we have to make some compromises. Maybe we have to go a little  bit further than we want because we want to get something done. We want  to pass things that are good. If we wait to only pass things that are  perfect, then we will be guilty of doing exactly what many other people  have done in this body--to promise a lot and deliver very little.   I took a lot of hits for my op-ed and my public comments about  bipartisanship, about compromise, about respect, about reaching across  the aisle. I am willing to take those hits because I would rather go  down as someone who is willing to go get something done than someone  who is willing to only settle for the perfect, knowing that perfect  never happens here. The Founding Fathers didn't expect perfect. The  Founding Fathers introduced defects, if you read the Federalist Papers,  that  [[Page S566]]  prevented any one ambition from prevailing. To have ambition set  against ambition is foundational to our democratic institution here. We  are not going after perfect. We are going to go after good.   I was really excited. I got some great comments from my friends  across the aisle. I thought this is an area where we can work together.  There are a lot of areas where we can't work together because our world  views are so different. Let's not focus on those. Let's focus on things  on which we can work together. I thought we had a minority leader who  was actually committed to that. At least that is what I thought. But I  have to say I am beginning to wonder if we haven't gotten a different  sort of view of the leadership. Comments today do not reflect the  comments of not so long ago. In 2012, the minority leader said:         Everything doesn't have to be a fight. Legislation is an       art of working together, building consensus, compromise.    I could have written that. I absolutely agree with that principle.  That is why I got criticized by folks on my side of the aisle--or the  talking heads, anyway, the conservative talking heads--because I wasn't  willing to take a purist position.   Now, you fast forward. And the minority leader made this comment when  he was not the minority leader. But today this is what we are hearing  just within the last month: ``The only way we're going to work with  him''--that would be President Trump--``is if he moves completely in  our direction and abandons his Republican colleagues.''   Does that sound like bipartisanship? Does that sound like somebody  who wants to reach across the aisle and work on immigration reform,  criminal justice reform, sentencing reform--things where I believe  there is a majority of people in this body, as many as 60 or more  votes--who would be willing to move legislation? I don't think so.   We have to make sure that people like this are accountable to the  American people, the so-called real people. I will get to that in a  little bit. That is not bipartisanship. That is not leadership. That is  divisiveness. That is gridlock. That is the stuff that inspired me to  run in 2014. That is the thing I am against, whether it is a Democrat  saying it or a Republican saying it.   I think we can also expect more of what really stems--or what you can  infer from the latest position of the minority leader, more gridlock.  We will go to the next chart. The sort of a double standard here,  duplicity, really drives me crazy. Situational ethics I will call it or  situational principles. On the one hand, you stand firm on something.  You fast forward because you didn't like the outcome of the election,  and suddenly you no longer take that same position.   People can rationalize it any way they want to, but I think the real  people, the real voters, the folks out there, see this for what it is.  It is taking a so-called principled position when that particular  position benefits your agenda, not necessarily something that is  bipartisan, something that actually serves a political agenda.   The Supreme Court, I think that is what we are going to see here. I  have presided. I have been a freshman for 2 years. We get to preside a  lot. I get to hear a lot of these floor speeches. I heard endless  speeches talking about how we needed to do our job, how we actually-- here is another quote from the now minority leader:         The Supreme Court handles the people's business. As       President Reagan put it, every day that goes by without a       ninth justice is another day the American people's business       is not getting done.    Now what we are hearing is that same group of people say they are  going to use every lever they can to stop us from seating a ninth  Supreme Court Justice. What has changed, except for the fact that you  are not happy with the outcome of the election? So I think we need to  recognize that the American people are sick of Democrats and  Republicans promising things, but if they don't get their way in the  election outcome, if they are not able to set the agenda, then they are  no longer interested in bipartisanship.   I have a lot of confidence in this body. I have a lot of confidence  in a number of people on the other side of the aisle. I think there is  a pent-up demand among Members here who want to see results--not  perfect, but good. I am going to do everything I can to work with  those. I will do an equal amount of time focused on those who I don't  think are acting in the best interests of their own constituents. They  are not listening to the real people in America, the real people who  did not endorse a Republican mandate in November.   They said: It is time to stop. It is time to get things done. It is  time to treat people with respect on both sides of the aisle. It is  time to accept good, and it is time to stop pretending that this body  can produce perfect. Now, I have to say I am glad to see my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle are starting to look at the so-called  real people.   Last week, the Republicans were in Philadelphia. We were at a  retreat. At the same time, there was a group of my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle who were meeting up in West Virginia. There was  a Politico article that I thought was particularly interesting. This  was a part of the published agenda that was reported by Politico, an  agenda that says they are getting people together. They want to talk  about speaking to those who feel invisible in rural America, listening  to those who feel unheard, and a discussion with Trump voters.   There was another entry in the agenda, I believe, that says talking  to real people. I am here to talk to the real people tonight. You have  Members in the Senate who want to get things done. We know you are  hurting. We know the government has failed you, Democrats and  Republicans. We have failed to actually take the tough votes. We have  failed to deliver. It is time for us to deliver.   I believe we have a President who expects us to reach across the  aisle and solve problems. I am going to be a part of solving that  problem. We have a great opportunity here with the Supreme Court  nomination. It is time to get past the election results, get over it,  and get to work. It is time to recognize that the real people, the  people who sent a mandate here--but the mandate was not Republican, it  wasn't far right, it wasn't far left--all they said was produce  results.   I am going to produce results. I am going to expect my Members to  produce results. I am going to go into my conference, when it looks  like we are going down the path of taking an intransigent position that  does not produce a result, and I am going to call them out. I am also  going to hold my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to the same  standard.   I am going to hope to find folks who want to solve the immigration  problem in a respectful, methodical way. I want to work with people on  the other side of the aisle who want to solve the criminal justice  problem, the sentencing reform, the judicial reform bills that are  moving through that have, I believe, far more than 60 votes to support  it.   We have to work on these. We will save the other ones where we simply  can't find common ground, and those will be the arguments that we can  have that can influence future elections, but for the next 2 years,  let's get work done. Let's actually be able to go back to our State and  proudly proclaim that we had the courage to stand up to people on our  side of the aisle when getting to perfect was at the expense of doing  something good.   If we do that, we will have one of the most productive legislative  sessions. The 115th Congress could go down in history as one of the  most productive Congresses in the last 100 years. I want to be a part  of that story. I want to go back to North Carolina and be proud of what  I did, proud of the compromises, proud of the bipartisan relationships  that we did to solve these problems.   I am going to go to other States who may be up for reelection in 2018  and either thank the Members on the other side of the aisle who worked  with us for those solutions or campaign against them because they  failed to actually look at their constituents and do the right thing.   There are a lot of opportunities here. I, for one, am going to spend  every waking hour to make sure I do my part, and I can be proud of the  work I did to produce results, to answer that mandate by the electorate  that came in November to produce results.   I have every confidence that there are enough Members here to join  us.  [[Page S567]]  With that, we will do great things. We will fulfill the promises we  made. There is nothing more rewarding than being able to look your  constituents in the eye and say: We did it. We listened to you. We  compromised. We treated people with respect. We delivered.   I call on all my Members to think again about what they can do to be  a part of providing the solutions. I look forward to working with them  in this Congress.
