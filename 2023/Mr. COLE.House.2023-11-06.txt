 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on H.R. 4820, and that I may include  tabular material on the same.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to stand before you today as we consider  the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies  bill for fiscal year 2024.   I am glad that we are back at work moving appropriations bills  through the House floor under our new Speaker. We are continuing to  fulfill our constitutional duties.   I thank Chairman Granger, Ranking Member DeLauro, and my partner on  this bill, Ranking Member   Mike Quigley.   This bill responsibly funds our most critical transportation and  housing needs and will have a positive impact on every congressional  district in the country.   At the same time, the bill meets the challenge before us to reduce  spending and get our debt under control. The bill reduces spending 25  percent below fiscal year 2023 levels, with a CBO score of $65 billion.  We achieve these savings through a rescission of IRS funds and by  reducing billions in excessive spending.   To really compare this bill to last year, we need to be honest about  what was in the fiscal year 2023 bill, what it actually contains.   First, I will point out that last year, my Democratic friends labeled  an extra $3.6 billion as emergency funding. We do not repeat that  mistake this year.   Second, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development bill uses  receipts from HUD-backed mortgages and refinancing to offset spending.  In fiscal year 2023, this provided $10 billion to offset spending. For  fiscal year 2024, that receipt number is down over 70 percent.   Why?   It is because few people want to refinance at an 8 percent interest  rate.   The real level of spending in the T-HUD bill was $101 billion in 2023  compared to $93 billion in the same bill before us today. This is a  decrease of $8 billion, bringing the total slightly below the 2022  level.   Every year across government we face unavoidable cost increases in  some programs. I believe we need to be responsible when addressing  these costs. This bill does just that by cutting excess, removing  duplication, and even trimming some programs that are, quite frankly,  popular on both sides of the aisle.   Nevertheless, we also made sure to prioritize the core missions of  DOT and HUD. We prioritize transportation safety on our railways,  roads, and airways. I am proud that we provide resources for the  Federal Aviation Administration to hire 1,800 new air traffic  controllers to backfill the retiring workforce and deploy air traffic  controllers to understaffed facilities. We also provide funding for the  most critical air traffic control modernization programs. We all feel  the impact of a strained air traffic control system. This bill will  address some of those strains.  [[Page H5421]]    These investments will generate economic growth and ensure  uninterrupted air service, which is critical for rural and remote  communities and metropolitan areas alike.   This bill provides $60 billion for highways and bridges through the  highway trust fund. These resources are directly allocated to our State  departments of transportation, enabling State and local governments to  collaborate on the highest priority road projects.   The bill prioritizes safety programs at the Department of  Transportation to ensure that our roads and railways are safe for  freight haulers and the traveling public.   The bill supports the DOT's maritime mission for full funding for  national security programs. We ensure a responsible safety net with  housing support for our most vulnerable citizens, especially the  elderly, disabled veterans, and the working poor. These programs are  run at the local level, through public housing authorities, private  landlords, and faith-based organizations.   The bill supports self-sufficiency programs so that families can move  up and out of rental assistance. Our housing assistance programs should  be a hand up and not a handout.   I have heard from Members on both sides of the aisle about the  importance of Community Development Block Grants, or CDBGs, so we  provide the fiscal year '23 enacted level of $3.3 billion for this  program.   I am proud of the work that we have done in this bill to meet our  trust and treaty responsibilities to Native Americans. For years, HUD  Tribal programs languished, their buying power eroded by inflation. At  the same time, much of the housing on Tribal lands has deteriorated to  the point of being dangerous and uninhabitable. So we have increased  the Indian Housing Block Grant Program to $1.1 billion, catching up to  an inflation-adjusted 1998 level. While this does not make up for  decades of underinvestment, it is at least a start. The bill also  increases investments in historically underfunded Tribal road programs.   The bill includes provisions that will scale back the Biden  administration's regulatory overreach. For example, we prohibit funds  such as to implement the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule at  HUD. This does nothing to impair HUD's enforcement of the Fair Housing  Act but cuts red tape for public housing authorities and other  recipients of HUD funds.   The bill also bars the DOT from imposing new carbon emission  reduction targets for highway projects. This would be particularly  burdensome for small and rural communities.   In addition, the bill prohibits funds for drones subsidized by the  Chinese Government. This will safeguard our national security and  create a fair playing field for American manufacturers.   These are just a few of the policy provisions in the bill that will  scale back the Biden administration's overreach. I am pleased that we  will consider several amendments that will do even more to keep a check  on the excesses of this administration.   I thank Members of the House for their input to this bill. We  received roughly 9,000 requests, and we were able to meet over two- thirds of them, including community project funding for transportation  infrastructure and bricks-and-mortar community development projects.   The alternative to passing this and other appropriations bills is a  continuing resolution. Let me remind all Members that a CR will serve  no one well. This bill is an ideal example of why we must avoid putting  the government on autopilot.   Under a CR, our air traffic control system would suffer delays  because of staffing shortages, housing assistance would be revoked from  vulnerable Americans, and spending that is no longer needed from fiscal  year 2023 would be carried forward for another year.   We must avoid that outcome.   In closing, Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased that we are moving  forward. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman  from California.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, while I recognize the concerns of my good friend, the  ranking member of the full committee, I think you need to put some of  them in a little bit of context, particularly the subject of the Amtrak  Northeast corridor.   While I recognize there is always a desire for greater support for  the Northeast Corridor, I believe our bill strikes a necessary balance  given the allocation we have for the year. I would also note that we  are having just as many Members who believe we are spending too much as  those who think we are spending too little.   Our $99.2 million appropriation supports the contingencies and  legally mandated improvements to the Northeast Corridor. I recognize  that while this level is certainly lower than last year, we must make  three major points and take them into account.   First, prior to the passage of the Infrastructure Investments and  Jobs Act, the Northeast Corridor normally received about $650 million  to $700 million for capital improvements on an annual basis. This was  at a time when Amtrak was nearly profitable. Today's ridership levels  are still not back to where they were then, and the changing work  patterns indicate that they may never return to those same levels.   The IIJA provides $1.2 billion, in addition to what we appropriate in  this bill, annually in advanced appropriations to the Northeast  Corridor for capital improvements. When you combine our appropriation  with the advance, the total support for the Northeast Corridor is still  double what it was prior to November 2021.   Further, Mr. Chairman, two-thirds of the Federal Railroad  Administration's Federal-State partnership program advanced  appropriations are set aside for projects in the Northeast Corridor,  and we are also beginning to see these dollars flow.   This week, the FRA announced $16.4 billion in funding for projects  along the Northeast Corridor, with $16.2 billion of those going to  projects where Amtrak is the sponsor or one of the core beneficiaries  of the project.   Clearly, the IIJA advanced appropriations are providing an amount of  funding higher than Amtrak has ever seen in the past, particularly  given the fact that their ridership is at a lower level.   The thing that my colleagues never address is that we are running a  $2 trillion deficit. These programs are significantly above what  Amtrak, particularly the Northeast Corridor, was receiving less than 2  years ago. We regret we have to make some adjustment, but we need to  begin to bring this deficit down. This legislation responsibly does  that.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1800     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My friend is certainly correct, I voted against the Infrastructure,  Investment and Jobs Act, and I did so for a very good reason. It didn't  pay for itself. There have been three previous transportation bills in  my time here, two under President Obama. I voted for those because they  paid for themselves.   My friends worry about rising costs. They should worry about rising  costs. It is their reckless spending that sparked the worst inflation  in 40 years and the highest interest rates in 20 years. When they are  concerned about housing costs, just look in the mirror.   That is not just me saying that. Go back and look at all the  Democratic economists that criticized the passage of the so-called  American Rescue Plan where my friends injected $1.9 trillion into the  economy at a time when we were growing at over 6 percent and rapidly  recovering.   We do have problems with what it costs. Nobody in my son's lifetime-- he is 41 years old--ever paid 8 percent interest rates, but my friends  got us there. It didn't take them long to do it, either.   The record deficits we are running are why we are having to make some  of these reductions. The income to the Federal Government is actually  higher than it has been in quite some time. It is higher on a  percentage basis, it is higher in actual totals, but you can't continue  to spend at these rates. That is what caused inflation. That is what  drove up housing prices. That is why we are passing this legislation,  to try and begin to responsibly fund important programs as opposed to  just throwing money at problems and leaving the American people to deal  with the bill in terms of higher costs, higher inflation, and more  expensive housing.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.  [[Page H5425]]    Mr. Chairman, I begin by reciprocating the very kind remarks of my  working partner, Mr. Quigley. I find him to be a person of  extraordinary ability, a wonderful working partner, and somebody that I  look forward to continuing a dialogue with as we go through the  process.   As my friend knows, we are not at the end of that process. Our aim is  to pass a vehicle and be able to go to conference, where I know my  friend and I will continue to work on some of the concerns that,  frankly, people on both sides of the aisle have. I think that is the  way we ought to work, and I am very proud of the relationship that we  have that will allow that to continue.   I will, however, point out that we have several problems. The reality  is our funding levels are actually essentially where we were in 2022.  This is 2023. We have not gone a long way past that.   Second, there is an enormous amount of money that has been  interjected into the infrastructure bill by the Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act, and that money needs to be offset in some way  to bring down this extraordinary deficit that we have.   My friends are concerned, appropriately so, about the cost of things.  Those costs have been raised mostly by excessive government spending.  The worst thing that we have out there right now is simply what  interest rates are compared to what they were, literally, when the  President walked into office. They were 1.4 percent. They peaked at 9  percent. They are still running somewhere around 7 percent. If you  don't think it makes a difference, go try to buy a home.    You have to begin to responsibly restrain government spending. This  bill does that. It takes us from $101 billion in total spending to $93  billion. That is a significant cut. That is exactly where we were in  2022, not very long ago.   We will continue to work and try to find common ground with our  friends because I recognize, as I know my friend does, at the end of  the day, all appropriations bills have to be bipartisan, but they are  usually not bipartisan at this stage in the process. I am not surprised  that that is where we are right now.   I think there are a lot of good features in this. I think, quite  frankly, Tribal housing and Tribal roads have been underfunded for  decades. It didn't matter who was in power. This bill begins to address  that.   I think we have critical needs at the FAA, where we need to train  more air traffic controllers to modernize the system. This bill does  that. It matches up pretty closely to what this Congress actually  passed when it passed the FAA Reauthorization Act earlier this year.   There is lots of infrastructure in this bill. Would we like more?  Yes, we would. Maybe we will be able to get more, but right now we have  to operate within the allocation that we have.   I think we have more in common to work with here than probably the  initial debate and the early rhetoric suggests, and I will just close  by saying my friend has my commitment that I will continue to work with  him.   I share his admiration for the staff on both sides of the aisle.  Sometimes I often like to say Members may not work together very well,  but staff almost always does around here. At the end of the day, more  problems are solved at that level sometimes than solved by the rhetoric  on the floor.   My friend and I, I hope we get to a deal. I know we have one thing  above all in common. We both know what a continuing resolution would  mean. We both know that is a bad outcome. If that happens, we will lose  the improvements in this bill, particularly for FAA, but for other  areas as well.                                time  1815    My friend has my commitment that we will continue to work together.  We may not get to the same place in the debate over this particular  piece of legislation, but if we are going to have something that  actually becomes law, he and I will have to come to an agreement. At  some point, I am confident that we will.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mrs.  Miller-Meeks) having assumed the chair, Mr. Bacon, Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4820)  making appropriations for the Departments of Transportation, and  Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2024, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 838, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bipartisan en bloc amendment  which represents amendments from both sides of the aisle. The en bloc  includes 25 noncontroversial amendments that reiterate our collective  support  [[Page H5452]]  for the Nation's transportation and housing needs.   Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend Ranking Member Quigley and all  Members who have worked with us on this en bloc, and I ask my  colleagues to support the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Mrs. Rodgers), who is the chairman on the Committee on  Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mast).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's support. I also,  obviously, support the en bloc amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise  in support of his amendment.   There is no question that the CRISI program is incredibly popular and  improves the safety and efficiency of passenger and freight rail. It is  the most in-demand program, and despite having over a billion dollars,  we quite often get more requests.   Mr. Chair, this is a very good and thoughtful request, and I am happy  to support it.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, the Thriving Communities Program is duplicative  to the technical assistance already provided by the DOT's Office of the  Secretary.   I recognize the burdens that rural, Tribal, and disadvantaged  communities face in obtaining Federal grant funds, but a $25 million  office focused on providing additional technical assistance is  unnecessary.   DOT should focus on simplifying the grant application process as  opposed to a slush fund for additional grant consultants.   I understand that this program has received a total of $50 million in  funding over the last 2 years. However, even the Senate recognizes that  this program does not need any more funding. They detail in their  report that they are also not providing any funding for this program  this year because the program still has $28 million in unused balances.   I simply don't think it is necessary, and I urge the rejection of the  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank my friend for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to my good friend from Pennsylvania's  amendment for a simple reason. Actually, I will start with where my  friend, the ranking member, was.   These decisions are too often made by faceless bureaucrats in  Washington, D.C., and there ought to be an opportunity for Members to  advocate.   We all know the top lines are set long before any of these projects  are awarded, so this doesn't add a single dime. It just allows Members  to advocate under a structured process for things that they think will  make a difference in the lives of their constituents.   We are not spending one cent more than we would have spent. We are  giving Members the opportunity to influence decisions that are  important to them and their constituents.   We do take our vetting responsibilities very seriously. These were  vetted by the Republican Appropriations Committee and staffers in  cooperation with our friends from the other side of the aisle, and we  don't approve them all. About a third of these things never make it,  and a lot of them don't get as much money as they ask for.   This is a good tool, an important tool. Congress went without it for  a decade and decided after that experience, we need it back.   Overwhelming majorities in both conferences made that decision, not  one or the other. We voted on this rule in our conference multiple  times. The margin has gotten bigger every time.   Mr. Chair, I urge defeat of the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Brecheen) having assumed the chair, Mr. Gimenez, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4820)  making appropriations for the Departments of Transportation, and  Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2024, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________
