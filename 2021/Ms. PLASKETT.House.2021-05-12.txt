 Mr. Speaker, today, the House is holding a hearing on  the insular cases, doctrines which hold the territories in a perpetual  state of colonialism.   Earlier this year, I served as a House impeachment manager in the  second trial of President Donald Trump. My presence on the floor of the  U.S. Senate carried a great deal of meaning for me. It also said a lot  about America.   Although I was making the case, I was unable to actually cast a vote  in the House. My constituents in the Virgin Islands, U.S. citizens,  remain unable to vote for President, lack any voice in the Senate, and  have only a limited vote in the House.   The second-class treatment of the territories is not just unfair; it  is un-American. More than 3.5 million Americans are denied the right to  vote simply because of where they live, whether it is Puerto Rico;  Guam; Northern Mariana Islands; American Samoa; or my home, the Virgin  Islands of the United States. This number of people is equivalent to  the population of the five smallest States combined, and each of the  territories send more men and women to the military per capita than any  State.  [[Page H2203]]    More than 98 percent of the territorial residents are racial or  ethnic minorities like me, a fact that cannot be a mere coincidence in  our continuing disenfranchisement, which extends well past the century  mark.   Our Nation's Founders never intended our country to work this way.  Alexander Hamilton, as a young man, arrived in New York after spending  his formative years in my home on St. Croix. He and others risked their  lives to reject colonialism. They wanted no part of it. They understood  that governments derive their just powers from the consent of those  governed.   America has, from its inception, included U.S. territories. The  original understanding was that the Constitution provided a promise of  full political participation to each resident of a territory through  eventual statehood. Until that happened, the Constitution was  understood to fully protect their rights.   That promise was broken after the United States began acquiring  island territories in 1898. During that time, in a series of decisions  known collectively as the insular cases, the Supreme Court invented an  unprecedented new category of unincorporated territories whose  residents were not on a path to statehood. Which territories the Court  determined were unincorporated turned largely on the Justices at the  time's view of the people who lived there--people they labeled in those  court opinions as half-civilized, savages, alien races, ignorant, and  lawless--people like Alexander Hamilton; Camille Pissarro, the founder  of Impressionism; Edward Wilmot Blyden, the founder of Pan-Africanism;  and me--lawless, savage.    While other racist Supreme Court decisions from that same era by  those same Justices--such as Plessy v. Ferguson--have long been  overturned, the insular cases remain. The last three administrations-- Bush, Obama, Trump--have all upheld and fought for these same cases.  Indeed, our own House Parliamentarian uses the insular cases to deny  the people who live in the territories and their representatives full  voting rights on this floor.   The ramifications go well beyond just voting. We do pay billions in  Federal taxes, yet residents of the U.S. territories are denied and  limited access to Federal programs and support. Otherwise, eligible  citizens in the territories are denied SSI, leaving our most vulnerable  seniors and disabled to fend for themselves. Federal programs like  Medicaid, SNAP, child tax credit, and the earned income tax credit are  capped or denied altogether.   The Supreme Court will soon tackle questions of Federal  discrimination against citizens in the territories in United States v.  Vaello-Madero, a case where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First  Circuit ruled unconstitutional the arbitrary denial of SSI benefits in  Puerto Rico.   The Justice Department should not continue defending this case. The  House should not continue to defend and utilize the insular cases to  deny people living in the territories basic rights.   Making sure that 3.5 million U.S. citizens can vote is not a partisan  issue. Of my four other colleagues in the territories, two are  Democrats and two are Republicans. We are not a monolithic people.   Our country has been given a collective opportunity to ask what  America is and who we are as a people. These questions extend to  America's responsibilities to citizens living in the territories.   Please reject the insular cases.                            ____________________
