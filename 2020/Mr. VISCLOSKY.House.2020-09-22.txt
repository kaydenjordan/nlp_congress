Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 8337, currently under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, obviously, we are here to consider a continuing  resolution to allow the Federal Government to continue its operations,  H.R. 8337.   At the outset of my remarks, I do want to thank the staff of the  Appropriations Committee for all of their diligent work in some very  difficult negotiations to bring us to this moment. People tend not to  appreciate their good work.   This is a terrible way to govern the United States of America. I  regret that I believe most of my colleagues here feel that a continuing  resolution does no damage. It does serious damage to the agencies, to  the budgeting process, and to fiscal discipline.   We should be having consideration today of 12 conference reports 8  days away from the beginning of the next fiscal year. The committee has  completed consideration of all 12 appropriations bills. This body has  passed 10 of them. Unfortunately, the other body has not acted at all.  This resolution would take us to December 11.   I would point out there are anomalies in this continuing resolution.  The majority have been submitted and requested by the Office of  Management and Budget.   Additionally, there are some other anomalies where there were no  government expenses to continue in 2020; for example, possible  transition of cost; additionally, authorization legislation to continue  programs which might expire on September 30, again, with the agreement  of the authorizing committees.   Some Members are upset at this moment that items have not been  included, but negotiations have taken place in good faith. We have an  agreement, and I would ask for this body's support of the legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I do have requests for time, but no one  is here, so I reserve the balance of my time at this moment.    Madam Speaker, I see Ms. Granger, who is the ranking  member on the full committee, might be seeking recognition, so I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who is the majority leader.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the chairwoman of the Energy and Water  Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the chairwoman of the Military  Construction-Veterans Affairs Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time on  our side, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I simply ask our colleagues to support  the continuing resolution, and I, too, yield back the balance of my  time.
