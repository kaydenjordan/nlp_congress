 Mr. Speaker, after only 24 days in office, President  Trump's National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned in disgrace.   Why?   He had direct contact with the Russian Ambassador, assuring him, in  likely violation of U.S. law, that the Obama sanctions against Russia  would be reversed. And then he lied about it.   There is evidence of Trump campaign officials having regular contact  with Russians officials, and we know Russia hacked into DNC files and  doled out stolen information with the goal of aiding the Trump  campaign.   So the question is: What is the Russian connection?   Congress must do its job. We should conduct a full-scale, no-holds- barred investigation of the links between the Trump campaign and  Russian officials. There is a mountain of evidence we cannot ignore.   The American people have a right to know, of course. But even more  importantly, the enduring strength of our democracy is being tested.  Congress must maintain our constitutional protection of checks and  balances. Investigate now. Investigate fully.                            ____________________
