 Mr. President, I am here tonight to join my colleague  the senior Senator from New Mexico and all my other colleagues on the  Senate floor to stand up for hundreds of thousands of my constituents  in New Mexico who will lose their health care coverage if Republicans  repeal the Affordable Care Act and throw our Nation's health care  system into chaos.   It is absolutely criminal for Republicans to strip millions of their  health care without even a conceptual replacement plan in place. To my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I want to make it clear that  ``we will fix it later'' simply doesn't cut it.   They promised repeal and replace, and now they are giving us repeal  and run, and that will cause chaos in our health care system. In my  home State of New Mexico, according to the Urban Institute, an  estimated 266,000 people will lose their health care coverage. This is  not a change to their plan or a different premium. They will lose their  coverage in its entirety. Thousands more of our State's 2 million  residents will lose access to birth control and other preventive  services and Medicare prescription drug coverage. Nearly everyone will  be subjected to higher costs for lower quality insurance, especially  those with preexisting conditions. Dismantling our health care system  would also put at risk many of the gains we made in protecting the  860,000 New Mexicans who have preexisting conditions like cancer,  diabetes, and heart disease. These individuals will be forced to pay  more for their health care coverage and possibly lose access  altogether.   This is not a game; this is a matter of life and death. Without any  plan in place, this repeal and run maneuver will cause health care  costs for all Americans to skyrocket. Dismantling our health care  system literally means taking hundreds of dollars each month away from  hard-working families. In my book, that is highway robbery. How? It is  simple. This reckless Republican repeal and run will strip away the tax  credits that help many working Americans afford their premiums. More  than 32,000 New Mexicans rely on those tax credits, which average about  $200 a month--well over half of their monthly premium for health care  coverage. Many of the sickest, oldest, and the poorest of our neighbors  and family members will lose their health care coverage altogether.   Over 20,000 New Mexican seniors will be forced to pay $1,000 more per  year for their prescription drugs. Fixed income seniors can't afford to  pay more for prescription drugs.   Dismantling our health care system is particularly problematic in our  Nation's rural areas, including much of the State of New Mexico. Last  fall I went on a multiday rural health care listening tour across  communities throughout Northeastern New Mexico. Rural hospitals like  those in Raton, Clayton, and Santa Rosa are often the only health care  providers for hundreds of miles in any direction. Under the Affordable  Care Act, rural hospitals agree to exchange higher rates of insurance  coverage for their patients for a reduction in reimbursement rates. In  other words, they aren't being paid as much per patient as they once  were, but the number of patients who come in without any insurance is  dramatically lower. Now Republicans are going to take away coverage  from a quarter million New Mexicans, but they aren't going to give  rural hospitals their higher reimbursement premiums back. This repeal  and run maneuver will cause many rural hospitals that already are  operating on the margins to shut their doors or to simply turn away  sick patients.   Nationwide, nearly 700 local hospitals in rural communities face the  risk of imminent closure. Think about that. That is nearly one-third of  the Nation's hospitals. Almost all of them would be forced to turn away  patients if the Republicans move forward in dismantling our Nation's  health care system. In New Mexico, that would mean forcing many of my  constituents to drive for hours to access critical lifesaving care. It  would also shake our State's economy to its core.   Health care jobs were one of the few economic bright spots in New  Mexico over the past 6 years, particularly in rural communities, but  this reckless plan--or I should say lack of one, to be accurate--throws  our Nation's health care system into chaos and scars New Mexico's rural  communities for years to come. A community whose hospital shuts down  may never recover. That is what is at stake here. Denying a family  health care, denying a whole community health care is reckless and  immoral.   You might hear Republicans say they want to tear everything apart  now, but we shouldn't worry because they will fix it later. Let me be  clear: We have the capacity to fix and improve our current health care  system in a bipartisan way without throwing it all into chaos, but  Republicans have to make that choice before it is too late. I would  welcome honest attempts to find ways to improve our Nation's health  care laws, to make them work better for all Americans.   In the past, I have taken the lead on commonsense fixes to our  Nation's health care policies. In 2010, in the House of  Representatives, I led the fight to extend coverage to the children of  military families covered by TRICARE up until the time they are 26  years old. After hearing from many small businesses in New Mexico, I  fought to repeal unnecessary 1099 tax reporting requirements for small  businesses. To this day, I continue to work with Republicans like Dean  Heller of Nevada to eliminate the so-called Cadillac tax that would  place an incredibly unfair tax burden on employer-provided health  insurance that many working families rely on.   Republicans need to put partisan politics aside and remember why  Congress passed the ACA in the first place: To expand access to quality  health care for all Americans. Before we passed health care reform, New  Mexico had the second highest rate of uninsured citizens in the entire  Nation.   I have heard from a lot of New Mexicans who have told me how access  to health care coverage has impacted their lives, even saved their  lives. I would like to tell you just one story of one of those New  Mexicans.   Karen from Santa Fe is a registered nurse, and she is a breast cancer  survivor. As a nurse, Karen has seen how health care reform and the  reduction of uninsured and uncompensated care has helped community  hospitals better serve their patients. But the real impact of health  care reform for Karen has been personal. When she was diagnosed with  breast cancer in 2002, Karen's insurance company dropped her coverage.  When she had to pay out of pocket for her coverage, her costs doubled.  As she went through several more recurrences of cancer, Karen went  bankrupt. She lost her home.   In a letter to me, she said: ``Cancer is hard enough, but not to be  able to afford my co-pays and appointments caused me so much stress it  made me more vulnerable for complications.''   Today, Karen is able to afford health care coverage even with her  preexisting condition. But Republicans are threatening to take that all  away from her and from hundreds of millions of other Americans.   Karen went on to say in her letter:         No one should go without health care because of income.       Good health is not a privilege for a wealthy few, but a human       right.   [[Page S148]]     It is hard to say it any better than that. No American has sent their  elected representative to Washington to score political points and  threaten the health and finances of hard-working Americans. Republicans  need to realize that is exactly what they are doing. What they are  doing means chaos. It means less health care. It is that simple.   I wish we could be here today talking about pragmatic policy  solutions to reduce health care costs and improve how providers  actually deliver that care. Instead, and unfortunately, we are here  trying to stop Republicans from turning bumper sticker governance into  a very real disaster for thousands of my constituents and millions of  Americans. This reckless effort threatens the very lives and the  livelihoods of the people of New Mexico.   I will not stand for that, and I know my constituents will not  either.    Mr. President, for generations, Tony Reyna  served his people in Taos Pueblo and northern New Mexico as a respected  community leader and constant source of wisdom and kindness.   Last year, Mr. Reyna joined friends, family, and community members to  celebrate his 100th birthday, which the New Mexico State Legislature  officially proclaimed as Tony Reyna Day. After a full life of service  and dedication to his community Mr. Reyna passed away last month  surrounded by his family and loved ones.   Mr. Reyna was the last remaining survivor from Taos Pueblo of the  Bataan death march. On April 9, 1942, Mr. Reyna and 1,800 other members  of the New Mexico National Guard were among the more than 75,000  American and Filipino soldiers who were taken as prisoners of war by  Japanese forces.   The Bataan death marchers were forced to endure 3 and a half years of  brutal captivity. They were marched for days in the scorching heat  through the Philippine jungles. Thousands died. Those who survived  faced the hardships of a prisoner of war camp. Others were wounded or  killed when unmarked enemy ships transporting prisoners of war to Japan  were sunk by U.S. air and naval forces.   After returning to Taos after the war, Mr. Reyna opened Tony Reyna's  Indian Shop in 1950, which has remained open to this day. He served two  terms as governor of Taos Pueblo. He also served the Town of Taos as a  police commissioner and as a museum board member. He was a lifetime  member of the Taos Pueblo tribal council.   He leaves behind an enduring legacy thanks to his lifelong efforts to  preserve the culture, resources, and traditions of Taos Pueblo. He  played a vital role in the return of Blue Lake, the Pueblo's sacred  headwaters in 1970. And  [[Page S154]]  in 1992, when Mr. Reyna was serving his second term as governor, UNESCO  designated Taos Pueblo as a World Heritage Site.   In 2015, at a Veterans Day ceremony at the Indian Pueblo Cultural  Center in Albuquerque, Mr. Reyna, then age 99, said, ``I served my  country. I served my people. I'm still serving. I'm available anytime  they ask me!''   The people of Taos Pueblo and all of us in New Mexico owe an enormous  debt of gratitude to Mr. Reyna for his full lifetime of  service.                            ____________________
