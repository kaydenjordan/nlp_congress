 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Rotary Club of Fort Worth, Texas, on their 110th anniversary.   Since their first meeting in June of 1913, the Rotary Club has  supported the community in many ways and has enriched the lives of  people in the Fort Worth area.   Rotary was founded as a service club for community members from  diverse backgrounds to come together to make positive changes in their  communities.   Whether it is scholarships to local schools, supporting nonprofits,  or providing education and water to impoverished countries around the  world, the Rotary Club of Fort Worth has always put service above self.   As a long-time Rotarian and member of this club in Fort Worth, as my  father was--Jack Williams--I am proud to congratulate the Rotary Club  of Fort Worth for their significant milestone.   I am confident they will continue their exceptional service to the  community for the next hundred years. If the Four-Way Test was observed  more today, the world would be a better place.   In God We Trust.                            ____________________
