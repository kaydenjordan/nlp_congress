 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to lend my strong support for this balanced  budget amendment.   Mr. Speaker, the very first bill I introduced when the 115th Congress  kicked off last year was a balanced budget amendment. With the national  debt at over $21 trillion, it is no secret that the Federal Government  has a spending issue.   Before coming to Congress, I served in the Alabama State Legislature.  Like many States, Alabama is required to pass a budget that does not  spend more than we have. We do it each year.   A balanced budget is not some far-flung idea. Families in southwest  Alabama and all around the country sit around the kitchen table and  figure out how to make ends meet. Small businesses face the exact same  challenges. The Federal Government should be required to play by the  same rules.   I want to be clear about a few things. First, despite what my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle believe, the answer to our  debt issue is not to tax the American people more. We do not have a tax  problem. We have a spending problem.   Second, the most serious drivers of the national debt are on  autopilot. So-called mandatory spending programs must be reined in, and  a balanced budget amendment would finally require Congress to tackle  those programs head on.   Mr. Speaker, I know passing a balanced budget would be hard, but I  didn't run for Congress because I thought the job would be easy. We  were elected by our neighbors to make difficult choices and decisions.   We can make a strong step in the right direction by passing this  balanced budget amendment, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me  in supporting this resolution today.
