 Mr. President, I rise today to express my appreciation for  a dedicated public servant, Mr. Lee J. Lofthus of Maryland, who is  retiring after nearly 40 years of public service at the U.S. Department  of Justice.   Lee received his MBA from American University in 1982 and joined the  Department shortly thereafter. Since then, he has served in a number of  positions, including the last 16 years as its Assistant Attorney  General for Administration, the highest ranking career position at the  Department of Justice. In this role, he has been responsible for many  duties, including serving as the Department's chief financial officer,  leading its financial reporting, annual financial statement, budget  formulation and execution, accounting operations, asset forfeiture fund  support and debt management support. As Assistant Attorney General, he  has also been the Department's chief ethics official while also  overseeing its facilities, procurement, human resources, and planning.  Lee also served as the Department of Justice career Agency Transition  Director for every Presidential transition since 2008. His leadership  has been essential to the Department's operations.   I know Lee from his role as the top Department of Justice liaison  with the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. In my time as both  chairman and ranking member of the Senate Commerce, Justice, Science,  and Related Agencies Subcommittee, I have seen firsthand Lee's deft  understanding and management of the congressional appropriations  process. He has been an asset to both the Department and the  Appropriations Committees and will be missed by all of those who have  worked with and for him.   Lee has many interests outside of his work, and he will now have the  opportunity to focus more time on those interests, foremost among those  his wife Dawn and his sons Mike and Austin. I also expect Lee will  dedicate more time to caring for animals, including his affinity for  dachshunds and his occasional adoption of a wayward bird. Lee may even  find some time to indulge his devotion to Bob Dylan.   The one activity to which I am certain Lee will be devoting his time  is enhancing his status as one of the Nation's leading numismatists.  Lee's role as the Department of Justice's CFO makes even more sense  once you learn that he has long been a nationally recognized,  published, and award-winning expert on U.S. paper currency. Lee's  particular emphasis is on National  [[Page S2748]]  Bank Notes, which were effectively a form of national currency until  being discontinued in the 1930s. The ledgers Lee is familiar with are  not just the ones involved in the Department's budgeting, but also the  original Treasury Department ledgers tracing the return and destruction  of these notes. I wish Lee continued success in this field.   Above all else, Lee will leave behind a legacy of strong, calm, and  effective leadership. Few can fill the multifaceted role he held at the  Department but even fewer can do so in the universally respected and  admired manner that he did so.   The Nation and the Department of Justice have lost a great asset. I  commend Lee for his many accomplishments and for his selfless service  to this country. He will be missed. On behalf of Kansans and a grateful  nation, I personally thank Lee for his service to our Nation and  congratulate him on his retirement; he has earned a long and fulfilling  one.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, I would like to congratulate  the Benedictine Ravens on a wonderful 2022 season and their NAIA  National Championship victory.   Winning a national championship is no easy feat. It takes years of  dedication, and this championship is the result of that dedication. You  have made your school, as well as our entire State, proud. This  national championship is particularly special as it is the first ever  for the Benedictine Women's Lacrosse team and the first for the college  since 1967.   I know many of you came here to play lacrosse, but along the way, I  hope you have made lifelong friends, learned valuable lessons about  hard work and determination, and given back to this community.   What makes this victory even more special is the adversity these  women had to overcome. Senior Natalie Wechter, the reigning NAIA  National Player of the Year, injured her knee in the semifinals.  Despite this setback, through persistence and grit, the Ravens edged  out their opponents by a score of 9-8.   Winning a national championship is also a full team effort. I would  like to recognize a few outstanding members of the team: Ms. Wechter,  as well as Clare Ryan, Aiden McEnerney, Erica Odell, and Rianna  England, who received All-American honors. Additionally, Ms. Odell was  named the tournament MVP.   It is also worth mentioning that this was head coach Clare Hanson's  first year in the position. I congratulate all on these  accomplishments.   Winning this tournament is one of those things small colleges  remember and discuss for decades. It is a shared win that the whole  Benedictine and Atchison community gets to appreciate and take pride  in.   I commend you and the entire team for your hard work and dedication.  Congratulations to the 2022 NAIA women's lacrosse champion  Ravens.                            ____________________
