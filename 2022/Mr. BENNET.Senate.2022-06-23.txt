 Mr. President, this morning, the Supreme Court weakened  gun safety laws in America for the first time in over a decade. It  gutted a century's-old law to make sure that people carrying concealed  weapons actually needed them. The Court is taking us backward at a time  when the American people are demanding that we do more, not less, to  protect our communities.   The shooting at Columbine High School happened the year before my  oldest daughter was born. She is now 22 years old. We have raised three  daughters, and their entire generation has grown up in the shadow of  gun violence. Since Columbine, my State has endured one tragedy after  another.   In 2012, a gunman killed 12 people at a movie theater in Aurora.   In 2019, a shooter injured eight students at a STEM high school in  Highlands Ranch.   Last March, a shooter killed 10 people at the King Soopers grocery  store in Boulder. That was almost a year to the day, really, of the  shootings in Buffalo, which took another 10 lives of people who had  just gone to shop for their families.   Two months after that grocery store shooting in Colorado, a gunman  killed six people at a birthday party in Colorado Springs.   Now, I remember back--it is hard because, over time, you lose track  of things--in 2017, after a gunman in Las Vegas killed 58 Americans  after shooting across the street from a hotel room. I came to work the  following Monday, and I realized at about three-quarters of the way  through the day that nobody had talked to me about the shooting. I  don't know whether it was the shooting before that or the two or three  or four before that when we became so desensitized that 58 people could  be killed in Las Vegas, and it wasn't even mentioned the following  Monday.   We cannot allow this to become normal in this country, and the people  of Colorado have refused for this to become normal in this country. It  is not just mass shootings; it is the daily shootings that stalk our  communities like the West Side of Chicago, where I have spent time with  my friend Arne Duncan who, after being the Secretary of Education, has  gone back to his hometown to try to keep young men from killing. They  can't afford for us to continue to just move on and forget that it ever  happened. Communities, once they have been savaged by something like  the Aurora movie theater shooting or the Columbine shooting, never move  on.   The pages here are a little bit younger than my daughters are, but I  can tell you that there is a whole generation of Americans that has  grown up in this country savaged by gun violence and the prospect that  it could happen to them when they go to school the next day or the next  week. You can see it. You can see kids sitting on the couch, cringing,  when they are watching the television reports, wondering whether that  is going to be them or their classmates.   They have carried a burden that no generation of Americans has ever  had to carry. No generation of humans living in the industrialized  world has had to carry this particular burden. Today, our kids are  growing up with a reasonable fear that they could get shot in their  schools or in their temples or in their churches.   I didn't grow up in a country with more gun-related deaths than in  virtually any country in the industrialized world. That was not the  country I grew up in. I grew up in a country with a Second Amendment  but not a country with more shootings than anyplace else in the  industrialized world. Our attitude about this has changed. It is  different from what our parents and grandparents believed, no matter  what party they were in.   After a shooting, I heard somebody on the radio--some well-known talk  show host--say that this was just the price of freedom, that being  victimized in a mass shooting or being worried that your family members  could be killed in a mass shooting was just the price of freedom. That  is not what freedom meant to America when I was growing up. Partly what  freedom means is being free from the fear that you are going to get  gunned down. That is a freedom, and we have denied that freedom to the  next generation of Americans. What a shame that somebody would say  something like that after a mass shooting. What a limited view of what  freedom is. What a surrender that represents to our children and the  victims of these crimes.   In 2020, the leading cause of death for kids in America was guns-- guns--not  [[Page S3112]]  car accidents, not drugs but guns. There was a study that looked at how  many kids, ages 4 or younger, had been killed by guns across 29  industrialized countries. This was of kids 4 or younger in 29  industrialized countries. The United States accounted for 97 percent of  the deaths. This country accounted for 97 percent of the deaths of kids  who were 4 years old and under. What a disgrace. What an indictment.  The entire rest of the industrialized world accounted for 3 percent. We  accounted for 97 percent. We have nearly 200 times the rate of violent  gun deaths as Japan or South Korea and nearly 100 times what they  experience in the United Kingdom.   I can tell you, speaking as a father, it is not because we love our  children any less or because we are uniquely violent or that somehow we  have got a mental health problem that other countries don't have or  that we are mentally more unwell, which I hear some people say. It is  because we have a U.S. Senate, year after year after year, that has  been paralyzed by the National Rifle Association, by the NRA. We have a  Senate that has allowed our kids to get shot in schools, in movie  theaters, in grocery stores, and at concerts but has offered nothing  but thoughts and prayers. We have a Senate that, until now, has failed  to respond to the overwhelming demand of the American people to protect  our communities.   That is what I hear when I go home. I live in a Western State. As you  will hear, we have been able to enact meaningful gun reforms in my  State. If we can make progress in a Western State like Colorado, where  people are demanding it--Democrats, Independents, Republicans, and most  importantly, all of our children are demanding it--we can do it here. I  have said it over and over and over again on this floor after we have  had mass shooting after mass shooting across our country. Finally, for  the first time in a decade, we have the chance to make progress.   I want to thank my colleagues. I really do. I don't mean that in the  usual way that people do when they come out here and say, you know, ``I  thank my colleagues.'' I want to thank my colleagues Chris Murphy and  John Cornyn for leading this really important bipartisan effort.   I strongly support what they have put forward, which would strengthen  background checks for young people buying firearms, so we are checking  their mental health and juvenile records.   It would help States strengthen their red flag laws, which would help  keep guns out of the hands of people who are a threat to themselves or  others. We passed a bill like that already in Colorado.   It would make a historic investment in mental health and school  security. I said a minute ago that sometimes you just hear people  talking about how we have mental health, and I pointed out that we  probably have got the same mental health that other countries in the  world have, but that doesn't mean that it is not an issue. It is an  issue. We are having an epidemic of mental health and behavioral health  on the back end of this pandemic, especially among adolescents in this  country and in the State of Colorado. There is $15 billion in this bill  for mental health, and I am proud that that is in there. That is a  historic investment, and it is both sides that are making it.   We are going to close the boyfriend loophole, which allows abusive  partners to buy a gun. We are going to crack down on straw purchases,  where people illegally buy guns on behalf of someone else. That is a  big problem we are going to address in this bill.   Frankly, I don't know how anybody on this floor could object to any  of those ideas. I don't know how anyone could go home and say they  opposed investing in mental health or making sure they are not letting  a troubled 18-year-old have access to an AR-15 or some other weapon.   On that point, this can't be the end of our work. There is more for  us to do. We should raise the age for buying a semiautomatic weapon  from 18 to 21. We should pass universal background checks. In Colorado,  after Columbine, we passed universal background checks. I have said it  over and over again on this floor. Every year, somewhere around 3  percent of the people who try to buy a gun can't buy a gun in Colorado.  Do you know why they can't buy a gun? Because they are convicted  felons, because they are murderers, because they are domestic abusers.   In the 10, 12 years that I have been coming down here talking about  this, I have challenged people. I have said: Come tell me why Colorado  is not safer with that law in place. There is nobody who has ever come  here and said, ``Here is why you are not safer,'' because obviously we  are safe. The country would be safer and Colorado would be safer if we  pass background checks at the national level.   We should close the gun show loophole. We should limit the size of  magazines, which we also have done in my Western State of Colorado. We  should ban bump stocks. People in Colorado and across the country  overwhelmingly support these steps. But in the meantime, let's pass  this bipartisan proposal.   A few weekends ago--it was actually over the Memorial Day weekend--I  had high school kids--not in the same place and not just one--literally  coming up to me in tears out of desperation that we were not responding  to what had happened in Texas and we hadn't done anything in this  country about guns. I think we need to show them and the young people  who are here today, the young people who are living all over America,  that we aren't so broken that we can't respond to one more massacre of  kids at a school. We need to show them when we have this opportunity to  demonstrate that we are not going to fail again and that we can succeed  in passing this bipartisan bill and that, after all these years, we can  meet the American people's reasonable expectation to begin to protect  our communities against gun violence that happens in the United States  of America and only in the United States of America.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have five requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.
