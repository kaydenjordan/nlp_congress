 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I chair the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee  on Foreign Affairs. I have been in Congress for 5 years, and what I  have noticed over the last, probably, 30 years is a growing China.  China is a culture that has been around for thousands of years. What we  have seen is a growing China, but, more recently, in the last 25 years,  a more aggressive China, in the policies and the different things that  they do around the world.   Twenty-eight years ago, Deng Xiaoping announced that China's strategy  to accrue global power would be to ``hide one's strength and bide one's  time.'' As I rise, today, in the House, this evening, it is clear that  China is done biding its time.   I can remember seeing a documentary several years ago from 1986,  where that leader, Deng Xiaoping, talked about that he could not  compete with the U.S. or the Japanese in the intellectual property,  computer manufacturing, or in IT.   What they said at that time was that they will compete by taking over  the rare earth metals that are required in all of that. So, from that  point forward, they led that charge to strategically set out a 100-year  plan.   At China's 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China  last October 2017, Xi Jinping announced a new era, in which China has  started to overcome the humiliations of colonialism and that it has  stood up, grown rich, and is becoming strong.   We talked about this. It came out in a meeting. Somebody brought up  that, through their whole adult life, China was just kind of this big,  stumbling child. But they had reached a point and grown through  puberty, where the hormones had kicked in, and they found out how  strong they were. Then they discovered how rich they were, and they  started to flex both of those.   He explicitly offered the Chinese model as an alternative to liberal  democracy. Liberal democracy, that is what the Western world and the  United States rests on: allowing people to be self-determining,  allowing people to be free-thinking, allowing people to be empowered.  This is something that is to the antithesis of the Chinese doctrine,  stating that ``the banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics is  now flying high and proud for all to see,'' offering ``a new option for  other countries and nations.''   Mr. Speaker, as the new year begins, we must decide how we want to  craft policy and legislation that will address not just Xi Jinping's  so-called new era, and China's. I say that we should welcome China's  effort to assume its rightful place on the world stage. But we must  also reject China's efforts to undermine the values, institutions, and  rules that generations of Americans have died for, along with other  countries, to establish and uphold. We must never allow a socialist,  authoritarian model of government, to supplant the primacy of  democracy, no matter how rich and how strong the authoritarians become.   China is not choosing to rise through the global order that the  United States and our allies have built with our blood and our sweat--a  global order made up of the international institutions that have held  the peace since World War II; of the competitive and rules-based  economic playing field; and of a free marketplace of ideas where  people, not governments, decide what they will think.   Instead, China has grown to become a revisionist power--not rising  within the current order, but seeking to change, subvert, or coerce it  to suit China's end--not playing by the rules, but rewriting the rules  to suit the needs of China.   China's foreign policy is rewriting the rules in three key areas:   First, China is replacing traditional soft power, which is based on a  nation's attractiveness, with ``sharp power,'' which leverages  coerciveness. The scale is astounding. China has used sharp power to  buy political influence in Australia, academic influence on American  campuses, and even bought off Panama's diplomatic alliance with Taiwan.  The National Endowment for Democracy, which coined the term ``sharp  power,'' has exhaustively documented China's efforts to turn Latin  America elites into ``de facto ambassadors of the Chinese cause''-- right in our own backyard.    The world will not tolerate these coercive influence operations. Last  month, Prime Minister Turnbull of Australia captured this indignation  best when he used Mandarin to play on a classic Mao Zedong quote, ``the  Chinese people have stood up.'' Turnbull said that ``the Australian  people stand up.'' Congress must, likewise, ensure that the American  people stand up to coercion in our politics, academia, and culture.   Second, China is rewriting the rules of engagement by using gray zone  tactics that erode the distinction between peace and conflict. In the  South China Sea, China has used what it has referred to as ``salami  slicing'' to gradually attain its military objectives without provoking  a confrontation, undermining the international mechanisms that are  supposed to decide territorial disputes. It goes back to the saying of  Deng Xiaoping: ``Hide one's strength and bide one's time.''   As I said, I chair the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, and at  one of our hearings last year, one witness testified that ``by slowly  changing the situation on the ground, China hopes to transform `Asia  Mediterranean' into a Chinese lake.''   We can't keep standing idly by while China does these things. Xi  Jinping once stood next to President Obama at the White House and  pledged that he would not militarize the South China Sea.   As an aside, I was at a hearing. We were there with one of the  representatives of the Chinese Government. They were talking about how  everything they have done in the South China Sea was for peaceful  navigational purposes. I brought up that I wish I could feel the love,  or I wish I could feel the sincerity  [[Page H542]]  of that, because our military satellites showed a 10,000-foot runway,  our military satellites showed military barracks, our satellites showed  both offensive and defensive weapons, radar systems. Yes, there was a  lighthouse, but I didn't see a resort on there that showed peaceful  navigational purposes.   Then he built a network of air bases, missile emplacements, radars,  and ports that we had seen. Four thousand acres of the South China Sea  that were dredged, destroying the environment--coral reefs--and they  put in this today, which is militarized, and they don't hide it. We  should look to India's example rather than accept further lies. A  little resistance to China's encroachment along their disputed border  has prevented the same ``salami slicing'' from happening on land.   And, thirdly, China is rewriting the rules of trade and economics. At  a hearing before my subcommittee last year, one witness warned that  ``China has doubled down on its unfair, mercantilist strategies, and is  now seeking global dominance in a wide array of advanced industries  that are key to U.S. economic and national security interests.'' These  zero-sum policies benefit China's domestic champions at the expense of  fairness and competition in global trade.   At home, China wields its massive market as a blunt instrument,  forcing foreign companies to divulge what it wants without giving them  a chance to compete. Abroad, China is acquiring or stealing the  industries of tomorrow, unfairly boosting its domestic innovation and  hollowing out our competitors. Throughout the developing world, China  has undertaken a massive infrastructure program that exports surplus  industrial capacity and aligns closely with military interests.   In 2018, the United States must stand up to China's revisionism in  these three key areas: sharp power influence operations, gray zone  warfare, and mercantilist economics.   Some important policy steps have already begun. For example,  Congressman Pittenger has introduced legislation in the House to  improve CFIUS, which is a review, and the Treasury Department has  undertaken a section number, called 301 investigation into China's  innovation of mercantilism.                                time  2015    These actions will help protect the future of the U.S. economy. This  is a warning sign that we have seen that we must rise up to and  counteract, but more must be done.   We have to blunt China's sharp power in the United States by  countering Confucius institutes at schools and propaganda outlets in  our cities that spread communist propaganda. We have to respond to the  malicious state-sponsored activity in shared domains like the cyber  realm. We have to modernize our international development work to  compete with China in the developing world.   This year I will be introducing legislation to accomplish these  goals, and I hope my colleagues will join me in this important work.   We must also remember that standing up for American interests means  standing up for our values. Xi Jinping's leadership has turned to  creeping totalitarianism. He is building an unprecedented surveillance  state, increasing the communist party's ideological control of society  and the reconciliation of the party's authority over every aspect of  life. Human rights and civil liberties in China is worsening, and Xi  Jinping must be held accountable.   In the year ahead, I hope all of my colleagues would join me in  standing up for America's interests and values, and resisting China's  revisionism.   After the 19th Congress, the Communist Party Congress, Xi Jinping  stood up and said the era of China has arrived. No longer would China  be made or forced to swallow their interests around the world, nor  should they, but he also said the era of China has arrived and it is  time to take the center stage.   That is a threat, and not acceptable, I don't think, to the American  people. It sounds like it is a warning that they are going to throw us  off the stage. However, talking to people in the administration and the  rest of the world, I think we would be willing to share the stage, but  to think that they are going to supplant every other country is not  acceptable.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who  used to be the chair of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee, and who  has brought up some important legislation on this topic that we are  talking about tonight.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the kind words, and  I look to follow in his footsteps.   I want to also give a shout-out that the first version of the six  assurances, Mr. Chabot introduced to Congress on October 28, 2015, what  the six assurances were proposed to be, and we will read those later  on.   Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Poe). Judge Poe has been a strong supporter of the whole Asia-Pacific  region and he has got some wise words that I think we all can learn  from.    Mr. Speaker, the whole purpose of this Special Order is to  draw attention to what China is doing, and I think, as Mr. Chabot  brought up, we are not against China. It is the practices that they are  doing that we need to make sure that the American people know, the  American people know what is going on, the amount of theft that we see,  intellectual property, that costs the American taxpayers between $300  billion and $600 billion.   I have been at expos held by the Department of Homeland Security  where they have counterfeit products that come from American  manufacturers that are in China on goodwill, good faith efforts to  create a good product, to create jobs in China, but yet that product  winds up being counterfeited by Chinese companies that we think the  Chinese Government--and we have evidence that they are complicit in it.  They are selling products against our own competition, our own  manufacturers in this country, and it is eroding the American economy,  and China gains from this. This is a practice that has to be stopped,  and we have to stop allowing this to happen.   One of the other things, if we look back over history, in the 1840s,  there were the opium wars between the United Kingdom and China. A lot  of opium and drugs flowed into China, and it hurt the Chinese  population. At one  [[Page H544]]  point, 90 percent of the males in China were hooked on opium.   Yet today, in the 21st century, we are seeing the reverse of that,  and we are seeing narcotics flow from China, or precursors of synthetic  opioids flow into Central America, to Mexico, to come into our borders.  There is no medicinal use for fentanyl other than pain control, or  heroin. Heroin has no medicinal use, very limited.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan),  who, in the last Congress, introduced the Comprehensive Fentanyl  Control Act to combat illegal fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, coming from  China.   Not only do they send the precursors, they send the presses to create  the pills into these other countries. Again, it does not serve us or  the American people or our economy at all.   If you are a trading partner and you want to go by the rule of law  and you want to, hopefully, in trade, do what is best for your country,  but you also want to have a benefit for your trading partner, this is a  one-way street, and it is going to have to end.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the work that the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Donovan) has done with the Comprehensive Fentanyl Control  Act to combat illegal fentanyl. I thank him for his participation,  being on the committee, and his passion for what he is doing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), a  good friend of mine and a good Member of Congress, to add to this  discussion.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the remarks by Mr. Hultgren. He  did a great job, and I hope that guy gets released.   The gentleman brought up a very good point, and this is something I  have noticed. I am so blessed, and I know we are so blessed to live in  this great country of ours. Our Founders got it right. I don't know how  they did other than divine intervention, that our rights come from a  Creator, not from government. Government is instituted by we the people  to protect our God-given rights and our core values of life, liberty,  and the pursuit of happiness.   Our government is a government that empowers the people. Empowered  people do great things. In the 19th Congress, it was said--the Chinese  Government has set up a Chinese United Front, which is to show soft  power in the world instead of doing the things they have done, where  they go into a country, put up infrastructure, suck out the resources,  and leave and don't care. So they have changed their tactics. They have  gotten smart, and they started the Chinese United Front.   But in that communique that they said, it said that the role of the  citizens of China is to serve the Government of China. It is the  antithesis of what we stand for, and that is why I feel confident in  our form of government because we believe in the people. We believe in  the greatness of people.   The greatest resource a country has is not their gold, their timber,  or any of that other stuff; it is the people. And our country values  that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Garrett), a  good friend of mine, a passionate speaker on China who sits on the  Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia, and if he  wants to participate in a colloquy back and forth, we have a few more  minutes. But I want to touch on some issues that I think we need to  draw out again. I want the American people to understand what is going  on.   When you buy something that says ``made in China,'' I want you to  understand what is happening. China has gone from where they were in  the 1970s and the 1960s. Richard Nixon went over there, kind of  normalized relationships in 1972.   We had a relationship with Taiwan prior to that. I don't want to go  into the history of the war between the KMT and Chiang Kai-shek back in  the 1940s, but there was a relationship we had with Taiwan. We had a  relationship with Great Britain on Hong Kong, and here we are in the  21st century.   Things have changed. Now we have got North Korea on the stage. It is  a different world than what it was. We had some longstanding traditions  that we stood by as a nation, and people respected that, and then I  look at the trade imbalance that we have with China.   Here is a country that Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger in 1971 and  1972 opened up the trade that we have today, that has led to what we  have today. And China has done great, and they ought to be applauded  for what they have done. They have raised a lot of people out of  poverty. But at what expense?   When I look at what is going on in the South China Sea, taking  islands that were just coral reefs right under the top of the sea, and  they have reclaimed over 4,000 acres--probably the largest ecological  disaster and insult to the environment that the world has ever seen-- the world stood idly by.   One country, Vietnam, stood up, took them to the court in The Hague,  the tribunals. The tribunal ruled against China, and again, the world  stood by, did nothing.   The previous administration had a policy of strategic patience. The  profession I come from, the veterinary profession, we call that benign  neglect. That is where you have a disease that is not life-threatening  and you hope it goes away if you ignore it.   But what was going on in the South China Sea could not be handled  with benign neglect. What happened is China militarized the islands  that they built, even though they said they wouldn't.   And if we look at the other things they said they would help us on  with North Korea, China has the biggest influence with North Korea of  anybody else. Ninety percent of the trade of North Korea goes through  China. China says they are there with us, but yet we know fuel is going  in there, coal is going in there. They are trading with them.   In addition, they are complicit in allowing other companies to have  shell companies that keep the Kim Jong-un regime afloat developing  nuclear weapons. They have a hand in bringing this to a close.   I look at the trade deficit we have with China. It is over $350  billion. Add to that the intellectual property theft, over $350  billion, some people say up to $600 billion. And China says: We are  going to get it under control. But just last month they had a trade  deficit of over $60 billion.   I want to pose a question to the American people: Do you want a  trading partner that is doing these things?  [[Page H546]]  They flood our borders with illegal drugs, as you heard Mr. Donovan  talk about. They erode our culture. They kill our citizens. They break  down our culture. Do you want a trading partner that steals the  intellectual property at the cost of American entrepreneurship,  American intellectual property, and American jobs?    Do you want a partner that does not honor their word when they said  they are going to do something? You talk to other countries around the  world and they say: We like doing business with America because you  have a rule of law and you will follow it. China does not.   They have halfheartedly agreed to help us with North Korea. And so  when you go into a department store and you buy cheap as far as cost  and it says ``China'' on it, ``made in China,'' I want people to think:  What are you selling? What are you buying, and what are you giving away  for your future generation--not just of your kids, but for the  posterity of this Nation?   And I would like to get Mr. Garrett's response on that or anything  else he wants to add as an afterthought here.    Mr. Speaker, I need to make a correction. I said it was  Vietnam that took China to court. It was the Philippines.   But along these lines that you were just talking about, when you look  at the word of a nation, the integrity of a nation, I think of Hong  Kong. Great Britain and China came to an agreement in 1996, 1997 that  Hong Kong would revert back to China.   There was a 50-year agreement that China was to allow them to have  self-rule, the rule of law, self-determining, their own government, the  right to choose that. Twenty years into this, China has got a strong  influence. The freedom in Hong Kong is going backwards.   If we look at the Tibetan people, the Tibetan are probably one of the  most peaceful populations on Earth, but yet I can't travel there as a  U.S. dignitary or as a U.S. Member of Congress. They can't come here  and be recognized. The Dalai Lama can't come here and be recognized  because China gets mad. Beijing gets mad.   The Tibetan people have a way to pass on the Dalai Lama to the next  generation. China kidnapped the Panchen child and said: We will replace  it with who we think should be the next leader, and it is somebody they  are going to groom.   And I look at our country, being a Christian. That would be like one  of the kings of the Old Testament going in and stealing the baby Jesus  and saying: Well, we will put in who we think should be the leader of  Christianity.   It is ludicrous what is going on.   And then I think of Taiwan. Taiwan is our 10th largest trading  partner, and we have had an agreement since before Richard Nixon. But  during Richard Nixon's time, there have been three communiques that  talked about how we were going to deal with Taiwan.   And I just want to reiterate the six assurances that Ronald Reagan  and Steve Chabot talked about, and they are:   Number one, we did not agree to set a date certain for ending arms  sales to Taiwan. Robert Gates talked about this in his book, ``Duty.''  We had had this agreement for years, and during that time, about 2012,  we were having our arms sales agreement with Taiwan. China raised holy  heck about this, and our negotiators said: What is your problem? We  have been doing this since the 1970s?   China's response was this, and I think this sets the tone for the  future: Back then, we were weak. We are strong now.   I think that speaks loudly of China's intention.   Number two, we see no mediation role of the United States between  Taiwan and the PRC.   Number three, nor will we attempt to exert pressure on Taiwan to  enter into negotiations with the PRC.   Number four, there has been no change in our longstanding position on  the issue of sovereignty over Taiwan.   Number five, we have no plans to seek revision of the Taiwan  Relations Act.   And number six, the August 17 communique should not be read to imply  that we have agreed to engage prior consultations with Beijing on arms  sales to Taiwan. And we tend to stay with that in this administration.   So with that, does the gentleman from Virginia have any closing  remarks?   Mr. Speaker, I am ready to close.   I thank everybody for their participation, and I want the American  people, again, when you look at something that says ``made in China,''  how is that affecting the future of America?   And nothing against China. If they play fair, they play by the rules,  we wish them the best of luck, but we will not be supplanted from our  role in the free world.   And again, I feel confident about where America will be 100 years  from now because we believe in our people, we empower our people, and  we have a government that will stand and protect our constitutional  rights that come from a creator.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
