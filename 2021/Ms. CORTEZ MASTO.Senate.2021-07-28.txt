 I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all  remaining time be yielded back on the nomination.    Mr. President, I rise today to tell you about Brian  Neuman, an Iraq combat veteran who was wounded while serving our Nation  overseas in 2004.   Brian has spent years working with the Wounded Warrior Project to  help other veterans get the benefits that they need.   Years after returning home, Brian applied for an annual clothing  allowance of $841. This allowance should be available to veterans like  Brian when a medication or a medical device causes irregular wear or  damage to their clothing.   As many vets with service injuries will tell you, their clothes wear  down much faster than other people's, and the prosthetics can rip or  tear clothes as well. Some veterans need tailoring to make clothing fit  more comfortably around their injuries. Others have to treat skin  conditions with creams that damage their clothes.   These veterans get compensation for the expenses associated with  their injuries--and rightly so. Our veterans have given this country so  much, and Congress has a responsibility to hold up its end of the  bargain, to care for them when they are injured during their service to  our Nation.   But right now, this benefit isn't accessible for many veterans, and  that is wrong, and we need to change it.   In the case of the clothing allowance benefits, as Brian discovered,  the VA currently requires veterans to be evaluated for this benefit in  person, every year. One year, Brian physically went to a VA clinic to  submit the clothing allowance application, and his request was denied  because the VA had no record that he received a prosthetic at that  specific clinic. At that point, like many vets, Brian gave up on the  process in frustration.   That is just unacceptable. These are brave men and women who are  living with severe burns or who wear prosthetic devices as a result of  their service. In many cases, the VA already knows these veterans have  a medical condition that isn't going to change year from year.   And that didn't make any sense to Brian, so he did something about  it. He reached out to see if Congress could solve the problem. He did.  He did it, he says, less for himself, but more for the many veterans in  rural States, like mine in Nevada, who live hours away from the nearest  VA Brian knows that many of them are so worn out by the process of  applying for what is owed them that they just give up.    These men and women are tired of jumping through hoops to access  their earned benefits. So why are we forcing them to navigate this  complicated bureaucracy? There are certainly places to cut costs, but  this isn't one of them.   The Senate can fix this problem easily, and I have introduced a  bipartisan bill to do just that. I am glad to be working across the  aisle with my colleague Senator Boozman to support injured and disabled  veterans. Our bill makes it easier for them to get clothing that works  for their specific needs. My legislation requires the VA to  automatically renew this clothing allowance. Veterans can get it until  they say they don't need it anymore or until the VA's records indicate  that they don't require it. This will make sure they aren't forced to  drive long distances to access a VA benefit they are owed.   I am looking forward to moving this legislation through Congress so  we can make life a little easier for the 40,000 wounded warriors who  currently receive this benefit and for the thousands more who qualify.  There shouldn't be any redtape stopping veterans from getting their  benefits, so let's pass this bill and fix this problem.   I am going to continue to work in every way I can to make sure that  veterans in Nevada and across the country get the Federal resources  they need                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to tell you about Brian  Neuman, an Iraq combat veteran who was wounded while serving our Nation  overseas in 2004.
