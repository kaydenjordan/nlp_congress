 Madam Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to American  Heart Month, a topic that is extremely important yet also personal to  me.   Almost 10 years ago, I was diagnosed with severe three-vessel  coronary artery disease, and I have since had 13 stents placed in my  heart. So while this is deeply personal to share, I also recognize the  unique position that I have been given to raise awareness about  cardiovascular health.   Half of all Americans have at least one key risk factor: high blood  pressure, high cholesterol, or history of smoking. By changing our  diets, avoiding nicotine products, and exercising, roughly 83 percent  of premature deaths from heart disease can be avoided.   Along with annual checkups and prescribed medicines, I urge all to  remain alert to the symptoms of heart problems, including shortness of  breath, heart palpitations, or numbness in the arms.   Heart disease is currently the world's leading cause of death,  claiming 17.9 million lives annually, yet it doesn't have to be.   With modern medicine, and by the grace of God, I am here today. So I  urge everyone to take control of their heart health before it is too  late.                            ____________________
