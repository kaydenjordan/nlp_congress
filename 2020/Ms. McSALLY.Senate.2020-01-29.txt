 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Arizona.    I send a question to the desk on behalf of myself and  Senators Scott of Florida, Hawley, and Hoeven.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question is for counsel for the President from Senator McSally,  Senator Scott from Florida, Senator Hawley, and Senator Hoeven:         Chairman Schiff just argued that ``we think there's a crime       here of bribery or extortion,'' or ``something akin to       bribery.'' Do the articles of impeachment charge the       President with bribery, extortion, or anything akin to it? Do       they allege facts sufficient to prove either crime? If not,       are the House Managers' discussion of crimes they neither       alleged nor proved appropriate in this proceeding?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for that  question.   No, the Articles of Impeachment do not charge the crime of bribery,  extortion, or any other crime. And that is a critical point because, as  the Supreme Court has explained, ``No principle of procedural due  process is more clearly established than that of notice of the specific  charge, and a chance to be heard in a trial of the issues raised by  that charge . . . are among the constitutional rights of every  accused.''  [[Page S673]]  That was the Supreme Court in Cole v. Arkansas.   The Court has also explained that for over 130 years, a court cannot  permit--it has been the rule that ``a court cannot permit the defendant  to be tried on charges that are not made in the indictment against  him.'' That is the rule in criminal law, and it is also the case for  impeachments.   It is the House's responsibility to make an accusation and a specific  accusation in Articles of Impeachment. The House had the opportunity to  do that, and they did that. The charges that they put in the articles  were abuse of power on a vague standard that they made up and  obstruction of Congress. They put some discussion about other things in  a House Judiciary Committee report, but they did not put that in the  Articles of Impeachment.   And if this were a criminal trial in an ordinary court and Mr. Schiff  had done what he just did on the floor here and start talking about  crimes of bribery and extortion that were not in the indictment, it  would have been an automatic mistrial. We would all be done now, and we  could go home. Mr. Schiff knows that because he is a former prosecutor.   It is not permissible for the House to come here, failing to have  charged--failing to have put in Articles of Impeachment any crime at  all, and then to start arguing that, actually, oh, we think there is  some crime involved, and, actually, we think we actually proved it,  even though we provided no notice we were going to try to prove that.   It is totally impermissible. It is a fundamental violation of due  process.   Scholars have pointed out those rules apply equally in cases of  impeachment. Charles Black and Philip Bobbitt explained in their work  ``Impeachment: A Handbook'' that is regarded as one of the  authorities--collecting sources of authority on impeachments:         The senator's role is solely one of acting on the       accusations (Articles of Impeachment) voted by the House of       Representatives. The Senate cannot lawfully find the       president guilty of something not charged by the House, any       more than a trial jury can find the defendant guilty of       something not charged in the indictment.    So what Manager Schiff just attempted here was totally improper. It  would have resulted in a mistrial in any court in this country. There  is nothing that has been introduced in the facts that would satisfy the  elements of the crime of extortion or bribery either.   To attempt--after making their opening, after not charging anything  in the articles that is a crime, after not specifying any crime, after  providing no notice that they are going to attempt to argue a crime--in  the question-and-answer session, to try to change the charges that they  have made against the President of the United States and to say that  actually there is bribery and extortion is totally unacceptable. It is  not permissible, and this body should not consider those arguments.  They are not permissible bounds for argument. They are not included in  the Articles of Impeachment, and they should be ignored.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from New Mexico.
