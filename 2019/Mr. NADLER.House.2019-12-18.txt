 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H. Res. 755.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the House of Representatives must now consider two  Articles of Impeachment against President Trump. The first article  charges that the President used his public office to coerce a foreign  government into attacking his political rival. The second article  charges that the President took extreme and unprecedented steps to  obstruct our investigation into his conduct.   Taken together, the two articles charge that President Trump placed  his private political interests above our national security, above our  elections,  [[Page H12135]]  and above our system of checks and balances.   After months of investigation, there can be no serious debate about  the evidence at hand. On July 25, when he spoke to President Zelensky  of Ukraine, President Trump had the upper hand. The President, through  his agents, had already demanded that Ukraine announce an investigation  of his political opponents. Ukraine needed our help, both military aid,  which had been appropriated by Congress because of our security  interests, and an Oval Office meeting to show the world that the United  States continues to stand with Ukraine against Russian aggression.   President Trump should have been focused on the interests of the  American people on that call. Instead, he prioritized his private  political interests. President Trump asked President Zelensky for a  favor. He wanted Ukraine to announce two bogus investigations, one into  former Vice President Biden, then his leading opponent in the 2020  election, and another to advance a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not  Russia, attacked our elections in 2016.   Neither request was premised on any legitimate national security or  foreign policy interests. One was intended to help President Trump  conceal the truth about the 2016 election. The other was intended to  help him gain an advantage in the 2020 election.    After the call, President Trump ratcheted up the pressure. He  deployed his private attorney and other agents, some acting far outside  the regular channels of diplomacy, to make his desires clear. There  would be no aid and no meeting until Ukraine announced the sham  investigations.   To our founding generation, abuse of power was a specific, well- defined offense. A President may not misuse the powers of the  Presidency to obtain an improper personal benefit. The evidence shows  that President Trump did exactly that.   For this alone, he should be impeached. But the first article also  identifies two aggravating factors.   When President Trump conditioned military aid on a personal favor, he  harmed America's national security. When he demanded that a foreign  government target his domestic political rival, he took steps to  corrupt our next election. To the Founders, these offenses clearly  merited removal from office.   The President faces a second Article of Impeachment for his efforts  to obstruct our investigation of his misconduct. The Constitution  grants the sole power of impeachment to the House of Representatives.  Within our system of checks and balances, the President may not decide  for himself what constitutes a valid impeachment inquiry, nor may he  ignore lawful subpoenas or direct others to do so.   Many Presidents, including President Trump, have asserted privileges  and other objections to specific subpoenas, but only President Trump  has ordered the categorical defiance of a congressional investigation,  the automatic rejection of all subpoenas. The President is not above  the law, and he should be impeached for this, as well.   Congress cannot wait for the next election to address this  misconduct. President Trump has demonstrated a clear pattern of  wrongdoing. This is not the first time he has solicited foreign  interference in an election, has been exposed, and has attempted to  obstruct the resulting investigation.   We cannot rely on the next election as a remedy for Presidential  misconduct when the President threatens the very integrity of that  election. He has shown us he will continue to put his selfish interests  above the good of the country. We must act without delay.   By his actions, President Trump has broken his oath of office. His  conduct continues to undermine our Constitution and threaten our next  election. His actions warrant his impeachment and demand his removal  from office.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the following Judiciary  Committee staff for their extraordinary efforts during the Committee's  consideration of the Impeachment of President Donald Trump:   Amy Rutkin, Chief of Staff; Perry Apelbaum, Staff Director and Chief  Counsel; John Doty, Senior Advisor; Aaron Hiller, Deputy Chief Counsel  and Chief Oversight Counsel; Shadawn Reddick-Smith, Communications  Director; Daniel Schwarz, Director of Strategic Communications; Moh  Sharma, Director of Member Services and Outreach and Policy Advisor;  David Greengrass, Senior Counsel; John Williams, Parliamentarian and  Senior Counsel; Barry Berke, Special Counsel; Norm Eisen, Special  Counsel; Ted Kalo, Special Counsel; James Park, Chief Counsel of  Constitution Subcommittee; Arya Hariharan, Deputy Chief Oversight  Counsel; Charles Gayle, Oversight Counsel; Maggie Goodlander, Oversight  Counsel.

William S. Emmons, Professional Staff and Legislative Aide; Julian  Gerson, Professional Staff and Legislative Aide; Rosalind Jackson,  Professional Staff and Legislative Aide; Priyanka Mara, Professional  Staff and Legislative Aide; Thomas Kaelin, Oversight Intern; Anthony  Valdez, Oversight Intern; Alex Wang, Fellow.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these Articles of  Impeachment, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Wisconsin knows full well  the President asserted no privileges here. He simply ordered complete  defiance of the impeachment inquiry.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon).    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman knows that impeachment was put  into the Constitution as a defense of the Republic in between  elections.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ted Lieu).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I am hearing a lot from my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle, except a defense of President Trump's conduct,  which is indefensible.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch).    Mr. Speaker, the evidence is clear that President Trump  took advantage of Ukraine's vulnerability and abused the powers of his  office to pressure Ukraine to help his reelection campaign. This is the  highest of high crimes, and President Trump must be held to account.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa).    Mr. Speaker, I would remind the gentleman that, after  recovering millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains, the Mueller  investigation was actually a net plus for the taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Neguse).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on both  sides.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Escobar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, abuse of power was no vague or weak notion  to the Framers. It had a very specific meaning: the use of official  power to obtain an improper personal benefit while ignoring or injuring  the national interest. President Trump has abused his office and must  be removed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, President Trump said no quid pro quo only  after the White House learned of the whistleblower complaints and after  the Washington Post had published an article about the President's  pressure campaign on Ukraine.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Bass).    Madam Speaker, I remind the gentleman that, if President  Trump is impeached and removed, the new President will be Mike Pence,  not Hillary Clinton.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Mucarsel-Powell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Lofgren).    Madam Speaker, one specific concern of the Framers was a  President who would corrupt our elections and who would abuse the great  powers of his office to ensure his own reelection.   The impeachment inquiry is not an effort to overturn an election. It  is a reaffirmation of the simple truth that, in the United States of  America, no person--not even the President--is above the law, and our  democracy cannot allow a duly-elected President to abuse the power of  his office for personal and political gain.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Richmond).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentlewoman is correct. President Trump's behavior is not new. He  has a pattern of engaging in misconduct and then obstructing any  investigation into his misconduct to cover up his actions and hide the  truth from the American people.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Roybal-Allard) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.   (Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD asked and was given permission to revise and  extend her remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Madam Speaker, the President's conduct constituted the  highest of high crimes against our country. An offense does not have to  violate a criminal statute to be impeachable. That was confirmed in  President Nixon's case and again in President Clinton's. There is no  higher crime than for the President to use the power of his office to  corrupt our elections.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Pocan).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Price).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Peters).    Madam Speaker, the President was given the opportunity to  come and testify before the Judiciary Committee, to send his counsel,  to question witnesses. He declined to do so.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Kildee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene).                                time  1415     Madam Speaker, I would remind the gentleman that the  House has passed over 400 bills, 275 bipartisan bills: driving down  costs of healthcare and prescription drugs, raising wages, rebuilding  infrastructure, taking on corruption and self-dealing in Washington.  Eighty percent of these bills are languishing on Senator McConnell's  desk.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms.  Kaptur).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the President's obstruction is unprecedented and  categorical. President Trump claims that the House cannot investigate  his misconduct outside of an impeachment inquiry. He defies lawful  congressional subpoenas and then he sues to block third parties from  complying with such subpoenas.   Even as he pursues his own interests in court, his administration  simultaneously argues that Congress is barred from obtaining judicial  enforcement when executive branch officials disregard its subpoenas.   So when can the President be held accountable for his wrongdoing? In  his mind, never.   The Constitution, however, disagrees.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the District  of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Madam Speaker, I remind the gentleman that President  Obama provided thousands of pages of information to congressional  requests, and that Attorney General Holder and others testified, unlike  now.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Kelly).    Madam Speaker, once again, I hear a lot of attacks on  Democratic Members of Congress, but not one single word of substantive  defense of the President's conduct.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Connolly).    Madam Speaker, how much time do both sides have  remaining, please?    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Velazquez).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Lowenthal).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We do not hate President Trump, but we do know that President Trump  will continue to threaten the Nation's security, democracy, and  constitutional system if he is allowed to remain in office. That threat  is not hypothetical.   President Trump has persisted, during this impeachment inquiry, in  soliciting foreign powers to investigate his political opponent.   The President steadfastly insists that he did nothing wrong and is  free to do it all again. That threatens our next election as well as  our constitutional democracy.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McNerney).    Madam Speaker, John Adams warned in a letter to Thomas  Jefferson that these risks are unavoidable and might sometimes overlap:  ``You are apprehensive of foreign interference, intrigue, influence. So  am I--but, as often as elections happen, the danger of foreign  influence recurs.''   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Michigan  (Mrs. Lawrence).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Huffman).    Madam Speaker, I would remind the gentleman that the  impeachment clause is placed in the Constitution to protect the  American people and our form of government against a President who  would subvert our constitutional liberties in between elections.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Madam Speaker, all we keep hearing from the other side  are attacks on the process and questions of our motives. We do not  hear, because we cannot hear, because they cannot articulate a real  defense of the President's actions.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts  (Ms. Pressley).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Barragan).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to remind the gentleman that there is, in fact, extensive direct  evidence--including the President's own words and actions--which is  corroborated and supported by indirect and circumstantial evidence.   The record leaves the following key facts indisputable: President  Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, pushed Ukraine to investigate  Vice President Biden and a debunked conspiracy theory about the 2016  elections.   President Trump directed U.S. officials and President Zelensky  himself to work with Mr. Giuliani to fulfill his demands.   President Trump withheld critical military aid for Ukraine.   And President Trump stonewalled Congress' investigation to cover up  his misconduct.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Casten).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gallego).    Madam Speaker, President Trump's actions are both  impeachable and criminal. Although the violation of the Federal  criminal statute is neither necessary nor sufficient to justify  impeachment, President Trump's conduct violated the Federal antibribery  statute very clearly.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Beyer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui).  [[Page H12160]]         Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gonzalez).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).    Madam Speaker, I am deeply concerned that any Member of  the House would spout Russian propaganda on the floor of the House.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Higgins).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Thompson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, my friend, the gentleman from Georgia, has a tagline  about the clock and the calendar. Madam Speaker, this is not about the  clock and the calendar. It is about corruption and the Constitution. It  is about a President who abuses power to coerce an ally to intervene in  our election and poses a continuing threat to the integrity of our next  election.   The President's defense is built on three pillars, and when those  three pillars fall, the entire defense of the President collapses.   First, they claim there was no quid pro quo. Well, the evidence is  undisputed. President Trump conditioned a White House visit and  military aid on President Zelensky's public announcement of the  investigations. Ambassador William Taylor wrote at the time, ``I think  it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political  campaign.''   A reporter asked White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney if there  had been a quid pro quo here, and he replied, ``We do that all the  time. Get over it.'' The President refused to help our ally until he  got a personal political favor, and so the first defense falls.   Second, the minority claims that the Ukrainians didn't know about the  hold. The evidence, again, is undisputed. Ukraine knew about the hold  on the military assistance within hours of the President's July 25  call. Laura Cooper of the Department of Defense testified under oath  that on July 25 the State Department sent two emails to the Department  of Defense notifying them that Ukrainian officials were asking, Where  is the aid? The Ukrainians understood exactly what President Trump was  asking. He wanted a personal political favor before the aid was  released. And so the second defense falls.   Third, and finally, my Republican friends say the aid was released.  But the aid was released only after the President got caught. This  House launched its investigation on September 9. The hold on the aid  was lifted on September 11. This is not evidence of innocence. It is  evidence of culpability. The evidence is overwhelming. And when the  President got caught, he did everything in his power to prevent the  American people from learning the truth about his actions by defying  the congressional investigation, by ordering that all requests and  demands for information be denied.  [[Page H12163]]    With our national security and the integrity of our election at risk,  we must act, not because of the clock and the calendar, but to fight  against corruption and for continued self-government by the American  people.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I now inform you that the gentleman from  California (Mr. Schiff) the chair of the Intelligence Committee, will  now serve as my designee and will control the remainder of the time on  the majority side.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 230,  nays 197, answered ``present'' 1, not voting 3, as follows:                               [Roll No. 695]                                 YEAS--230       Adams      Aguilar      Allred      Amash      Axne      Barragan      Bass      Beatty      Bera      Beyer      Bishop (GA)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Boyle, Brendan F.
