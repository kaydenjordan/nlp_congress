 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mrs. Alberta Daniels of  East Orange, New Jersey, for her lifetime of service.   Mrs. Daniels is like a mother to many of us in public life from Essex  County, New Jersey. I know that she has helped me learn to be a better  public servant.   Mrs. Daniels spent 25 years at RCA in Harrison, New Jersey.   In her late forties, Mrs. Daniels started a new chapter as a senior  correctional officer. She spent 14 years in corrections working for the  State of New Jersey and helping open the first halfway house for women  in our State.   Since retiring from her distinguished life in public safety and  corrections, Mrs. Daniels has been an active community servant, and  Mrs. Daniels keeps a busy civic schedule as well.   Last week, I had the honor of speaking at a ceremony to rename a  street in East Orange Alberta Evelyn Daniels Court. It was a well- deserved honor that she has received from her community because of her  lifetime of achievement and service to that area.   Mrs. Daniels, it is well deserved, and you are well loved.                            ____________________
