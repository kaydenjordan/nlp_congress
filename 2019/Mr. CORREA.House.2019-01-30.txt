 Madam Speaker, today I rise to bring attention to the  Vietnamese Government's violence and oppressive attacks on its own  citizens in Loc Hung garden. For generations, families have thrived in  this farming community, Loc Hung garden. They raised their children and  care for their elders.   These citizens are law-abiding citizens, yet, the Vietnamese  Government sent over 1,000 officers to destroy this community and  displace over 200 families.   There was no due process, no day in court, and no compensation.  Instead, the Vietnamese Government took land by force from its own  citizens.   These tactics cannot go unnoticed, and the world must call this out  for what it is: tyranny. I ask the Vietnamese Government to allow these  families to return to their homes.   On behalf of the thousands of Vietnamese citizens living in Orange  County, I ask the Vietnamese Government to cease its behavior, cease  these oppressive tactics, and let the Vietnamese people live in peace  and return to their land where they have been living for generations.                            ____________________
