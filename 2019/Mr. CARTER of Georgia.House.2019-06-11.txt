 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the  Liberty ships and those who built them during World War II in Savannah,  Georgia.   Just after the U.S. entered the war, the Maritime Commission awarded  a contract to the Southeastern Shipbuilding Corporation to start  building cargo ships for military service.   The first completed ship was called the USS Oglethorpe, named after  the city's founder. By the end of the war, 46,000 employees had  produced 88 Liberty ships at the Savannah location.   These were America's lifeline to the war in Europe and the workhorses  that transferred necessary supplies back and forth across the Atlantic  Ocean filled with dangerous obstacles.   Unfortunately, the USS Oglethorpe was lost, torpedoed by a German U- boat in 1943. Today, a model of that ship stands at the Savannah trade  center to thank and remember all those who served in the Savannah  shipyards, constantly working to help win the war, as well as those  ship captains who risked their lives crossing the ocean.   This generation truly deserves the name the Greatest Generation, and  with them rested the fate of the entirety of Western civilization.   I am proud of this group in the First Congressional District of  Georgia and their contribution to the effort during World War II.
