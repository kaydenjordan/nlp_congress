 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chairman, I thank Ms. Castor for her  tireless leadership on this landmark legislation.   Nearly 2 years ago, the United States ceded global leadership when  President Trump announced plans to withdraw from the Paris climate  agreement, a sweeping accord amongst the overwhelming majority of  nation-states to curb carbon pollution and mitigate the damaging  effects of climate change.   The Climate Action Now Act reverses this misguided decision by  ensuring that America honors its commitments to the Paris Agreement and  prevents any taxpayer dollars from being used to take any action to  advance the United States' withdrawal from the agreement.   I am proud to support this legislation and to offer an amendment that  would require the President to produce a report examining how rejoining  the Paris Agreement will bolster clean energy job creation in rural  communities.   Contrary to the claims that have been made here today by my  colleagues across the aisle, we have seen the positive impacts across  my district and across New Hampshire that the deployment of clean  energy can have on our communities, both for our economy and our  environment.   Our rural communities are home to some of the hardest working  Americans who are committed to securing good-paying jobs to support  themselves and their families. Clean energy jobs are good-paying jobs.                                time  1645    In New Hampshire, a clean energy job pays 50 percent more than the  State's median wage.   Rejoining the Paris climate agreement will spur a new clean energy  economy that weans America off fossil fuels from countries that do not  share our values, protects our environment by reducing carbon  pollution, and creates good paying jobs.   My amendment is straightforward. If we are going to rejoin the Paris  Agreement, we must ensure that rural communities benefit from the  subsequent job creation and manufacturing. My amendment would create a  framework for how rural America can thrive and combat climate change.   We know that rural communities face unique economic challenges, and  it is imperative that they are not left behind as we move toward the  21st century clean energy economy.   We also know that rural communities can lead the clean energy  revolution, and I am very proud to represent five communities that have  made a commitment to use 100 percent renewable energy by 2030: Concord,  Keene, Plainfield, Hanover, and Cornish.   I am proud and pleased to offer this amendment with my colleague,  Congressman Chris Pappas, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to vote ``yes'' on the amendment and the underlying bill.    I yield to the gentleman from New  Jersey.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the  committee chair. I want to thank Ms. Castor for her leadership on this  issue, and I want to urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  help us to create good jobs in our rural communities.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
