 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5788, the STOP  Act, sponsored by my good friend  Mike Bishop.   This important piece of legislation would secure our mail system from  fentanyl and other dangerous synthetic opioids that are flooding into  the United States from foreign countries, namely China and Mexico.   The opioid crisis kills more than 100 Americans each day and caused  more than 45,000 deaths last year alone. In 2016, more Americans died  from a drug overdose than we lost in Vietnam. A third of those deaths  are attributable to fentanyl.   Over the last few years, I have witnessed my kids losing their peers  to this crisis, and it is terrifying.   Yesterday, I spoke to the mother of Nate Gordon, a young man from my  district, who lost his life due to a fentanyl-laced overdose. Nate's  mother and the rest of his family are heartbroken.   We have a responsibility to stem the tide of this crisis and prevent  more families from suffering the tragic loss  [[Page H5172]]  of one who is loved to opioid addiction. A vital component of this  effort is plugging the holes in our mail system and stopping illicit  substances from entering the United States.   So far this year, Customs and Border Patrol, working with the U.S.  Postal Service, has seized more than 790 pounds of fentanyl. That is  enough fentanyl to kill 179 million people. To put that in perspective,  that is more than half our population.   My friend Mr. Harris talked about the size of a grain of rice. How  about 1 gram, Mr. Speaker, a Sweet'n Low packet, something that we use  every day? It is enough to kill 500 people.   The STOP Act is a great companion to the bill I recently introduced  with my friend Tom Cotton that provides the U.S. Postal Service with  more resources to screen international mail to stop these insane  amounts of drugs coming into our country.   I thank my friend from Michigan for his thoughtful work to implement  this much-needed policy change. I urge my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle to support it.                                time  1300
