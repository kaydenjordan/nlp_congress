 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H10428]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6418, as amended, the VA  Website Accessibility Act of 2018. This bill from Representative Esty  mandates that the VA finally make all of its websites compliant for  visually impaired individuals. This is a long-overdue action that the  Blinded Veterans Association has tirelessly advocated for to make VA  communications and information fully accessible to everyone, and I am  proud to support this bill.   I have no further speakers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. 6418, as  amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3777, the Forever GI Bill  Housing Payment Fulfillment Act of 2018. This bill from Senators  Boozman and Schatz will help keep the VA accountable as it moves  forward to fix the issues it has run into in fully implementing the  Forever GI Bill.   As we continue our oversight over VA's implementation of the Forever  GI Bill, I am glad this bill provides us with more tools to do so.  [[Page H10430]]    I have no further speakers.
