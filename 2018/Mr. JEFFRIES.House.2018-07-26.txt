 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may  hereafter be considered to be the first sponsor of H.R. 134, the Home  Foreclosure Reduction Act, a bill originally introduced by  Representative Conyers of Michigan, for the purposes of adding  cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to clause 7 of rule XII.
