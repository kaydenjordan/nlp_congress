 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of an important  milestone in Indiana history, the bicentennial of Spencer County,  Indiana.   Founded in 1818 by Captain Spier Spencer, this rural county along the  Ohio River was the boyhood home of Abraham Lincoln. Years later, when  recalling his time in Spencer County, the man who became our 16th  President stated quite succinctly: ``There, I grew up.''   In addition to the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial and a scenic  state park, Spencer County is home to St. Meinrad Archabbey and  Indiana's premier tourist destinations, Holiday World and Splashin'  Safari. Wildly recognized as the world's first theme park, Holiday  World draws hundreds of thousands of visitors to the county each year.   Today, strategically connected to the world by Interstate 64, US 231,  rail, and the Ohio River, Spencer County has become a leader in  agriculture, manufacturing, maritime and ground logistics, steel  production, power generation, and world class family entertainment.   I proudly salute the citizens and the wonderful hometowns of Spencer  County on this notable occasion.                            ____________________
