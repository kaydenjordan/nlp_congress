 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  remember and mourn the life of a dear friend and sister, Ericka Edwards  Jones of Algiers, Louisiana.   She lived a life of service and activism throughout her 48 years of  life, as a longtime employee of the parish courts, and staffer of  former Congressman William J. Jefferson, and as chief deputy of 2nd  City Court under the leadership of clerk Darren Lombard. She served  with compassion and honor.   She thoroughly enjoyed politics, but, most importantly, public  service. She was an incredible wife, mother, daughter, and friend. We  will sorely miss her incredible smile, her leadership, her compassion  for service.   She had a smile that would light up the room. Ericka was passionate,  and compassionate, and generous to a fault.   My thoughts and prayers are with her, our families, and the community  on this tragic loss of a true public servant.   Ericka, we will miss you, but your fingerprints will long live in the  great works that you leave behind.   My thoughts and prayers are with her family, with all that knew her,  and all that will remember her forever.   We will miss you deeply.                            ____________________
