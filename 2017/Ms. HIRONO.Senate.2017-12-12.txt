 Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Durbin for  organizing this time and for his leadership and advocacy on behalf of  Dreamers across the country.   Passing the Dream Act is about more than the law. It is about  compassion and basic human decency. There is nothing compassionate or  decent about revoking the status that 800,000 young people, including  600 in Hawaii, depend on to live, work, and study in the only country  they have ever known.   Relying on a promise from the Federal Government, these young men and  women came out of the shadows, handed over personal information, and  underwent extensive background investigations to earn their DACA  status, but the President's actions have put them all at risk. Like so  many people, I have been moved by stories of how DACA has transformed  the lives of Dreamers across the country.   Earlier today, I spoke with two young Dreamers who flagged me down in  the hallway as I was going from one hearing to another, and they asked  to speak with me. One had traveled from Arizona and is only a high  school student. He was all dressed up, and he had a bowtie on. The  other who flagged me down in another part of the building lives in  California and is originally from South Korea. Both asked me to  continue to fight to pass the Dream Act before the end of this year.   To see these young people politely approaching Members of Congress  like me--I don't think a lot of them even had appointments, but they  had to study the faces of the Members of Congress so, as they saw us in  the hallway, they could come up to us. So the fact that they politely  asked to speak with me, even as they literally are fighting for their  lives, speaks volumes. We should open our hearts to them and support  their cause.   Like so many of my colleagues, I have met with Dreamers from my home  State of Hawaii to hear about how DACA has changed and enriched  [[Page S7969]]  their lives. In October, I met with three young women studying at the  University of Hawaii thanks to DACA.   Karen, Maleni, and Beatrice were, in many ways, like any other  college student. They balance busy class schedules with part-time jobs  and extracurricular activities. They have also lived in fear since the  President and his Attorney General made the cruel and arbitrary  decision to end DACA on September 5. Karen, Maleni, and Beatrice told  me they hadn't received any notice about what would happen after the  program ended on March 5, 2018, and depended on media updates that  would literally determine their futures. They shared hopes and concerns  most of us would take for granted.   When their newly issued driver's licenses expire, they may not be  able to fly home to California to visit their families because they  will no longer have valid IDs. After turning their information over to  the Federal Government, they worry for their parents and families, many  of whom are undocumented. When their work authorizations expire, they  will have to drop out of college because they can't afford tuition.    Karen is pursuing her master's degree in conservation biology and  environmental science and hopes to have a career in research. She said:         If I lose my DACA, that means I'd lose my work permit which       means I lose my graduate assistantship which means I can't       [graduate]. So thinking about those logistics is definitely       scary. Because I wouldn't be able to complete my education       unless I found another way to fund it.        [Dreamers] are working to improve our lives, and the lives       of our families, and hopefully, through our professions, your       life too. We're becoming doctors and lawyers and teachers and       any field you can imagine there's probably at least one of us       represented. So give us a chance.    Even with all they have been through, Karen, Maleni, and Beatrice  told me they don't regret signing up for DACA because, although their  futures are now in jeopardy, for a few years they were given a chance  at their American dream.   Dreamers like Karen, Maleni, and Beatrice are not asking for much.  They are just asking us, as Karen said, ``for a chance.'' They are  asking us to keep the promise we made to them, and it is in our power  to do that.   Around 10,000 Dreamers have already lost their DACA status since  Attorney General Sessions announced the program's end. Every day  Congress doesn't act, 122 Dreamers lose their DACA status. We are  taking away these young people's chances of staying in school, pursuing  meaningful careers, and even visiting their families at Christmas.   While the President once called Dreamers ``absolutely incredible  kids'' and made promise after promise to protect them, he has gone back  on his word time and again. We can't rely on his empty promises.   I ask my colleagues to put yourselves in the shoes of these Dreamers.  What if your future in this country was uncertain after March 5? What  if you were facing deportation to a country you don't even know so you  have to start life all over again? What if your families lived in daily  fear? If we can put ourselves in the shoes of Dreamers, what part of  the Dreamers' uncertainty and living in fear can we not understand?   Is it because we are not them? Is it that we can only relate to  someone's existence or experience only if we lived it ourselves? If  that is the only way we can relate to people's problems--people who  come to us for help--then we are in a very sorry state.   Most of us who serve in the Senate are only one or two generations  removed from immigrant status or immigrant backgrounds. I, myself, am  an immigrant. I was not born in this country. I came here with a single  mother. I know what it is like to come to a new country where you don't  speak the language and where you have to learn, where you have to  adjust. All my mother asked for was a chance to attain the American  dream.   It really bothers me that at the time when we were talking about  passing comprehensive immigration reform, Member after Member came to  the floor of the Senate and talked about their immigrant backgrounds.  Yet too many of them were perfectly happy to shut the door on  immigrants in this country--over 11 million undocumented persons--to  shut the door in their faces; forgetting that most of us come from  immigrant backgrounds; forgetting that this country, apart from the  original people who were here, American Indians, we are all immigrants.   So let's put ourselves in the shoes of our Dreamers. Let's open our  hearts to them. These are young people who just want to have a chance  at the American dream that too many of us take for granted now. Let's  not only be able to empathize with people whose experiences we have  lived. Let's not be there, let's not go there.   I call on my colleagues to support the Dream Act now.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.
