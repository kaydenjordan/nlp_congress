 Mr. Chair, I am in disbelief over the ridiculously low  spending levels proposed by the Republicans in the Agriculture  appropriations bill. They slashed funding to 2001 levels, funding from  over 20 years ago. That is a 41 percent cut, $10 billion, to the people  that feed America, our farmers.   I don't see how any Member of Congress who represents rural America  can show this much disrespect to their constituents. Certainly no  Member from Wisconsin.   Here are a few examples of what the bill does:   It zeroes out the Dairy Business Innovation Initiatives completely,  from $25 million to nothing. That is assistance for new and growing  dairy businesses that want to get products like milk and specialty  cheeses to market.   If you are an economically distressed farmer, of which,  unfortunately, there are plenty, this strips assistance for 104,000  farm loan borrowers.   If you are a farmer who uses the Farm Service Agency for things like  loans or disaster relief, this bill cuts FSA in addition to  conservation programs like EQUIP that help farmers improve their  operations and output.   If you get energy assistance as a farmer, good luck with that. The  REAP fund will be cut by over $500 million, making your energy costs go  up in rural America.   If you farm and supply food through international food programs, you  are really out of luck because they cut it by $1.2 billion, a 69  percent cut.   With this level of cuts, I would assume this was a satire, a  ``Saturday Night Live'' episode, but it is just another Tuesday night  in the U.S. Congress where farmers apparently aren't valued by the  House Republican majority.   No one who claims to support rural America could write or vote for an  agricultural funding bill this bad. No one. I, for one, won't be  supporting this kind of disrespect to the farmers in my district.
