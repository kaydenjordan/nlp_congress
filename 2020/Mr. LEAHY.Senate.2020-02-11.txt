 Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote on the  nomination of Andrew Brasher for an Alabama seat on the 11th Circuit.  This is over the objection of Senator Jones, who was not meaningfully  consulted by the administration and did not return a blue slip. Senator  Jones is as reasonable as they come; the fact that he was denied a  voice in this process shows just how disinterested the White House is  in being reasonable when it comes to selecting judges who will shape  the laws in our States for decades to come.   It is clear the President views the courts as a mere extension of his  power, not as an independent body critical to the checks and balances  of our constitutional system. The President knows that no matter who is  nominated, whether or not qualified or within the mainstream, the  Judiciary Committee of today and the Senate of today--led by a majority  leader who describes the Senate's role as a mere conveyor belt for  President Trump's nominees--will confirm them.   The President likes to brag about the number of judges that have been  confirmed under his administration. Less attention is paid to the cost.  Of the last 20 circuit court nominees the Judiciary Committee has  reported, 15 have been along party lines, and 13 had a negative blue  slip. My friends across the aisle apparently no longer care about the  constitutional principle of providing advice and consent to nominees in  your home State, a tradition that, until recently, had been guarded by  members of both parties.   Blue slips aside, Andrew Brasher had served as district court judge  for just 7 months before receiving this Presidential promotion. Every  single Democrat opposed his nomination when it was reported out of the  Judiciary Committee and again when it was considered on the Senate  floor. During his short tenure as a district court judge, he has  presided over only three cases that have gone to verdict or judgment.  In his questionnaire, when asked what significant opinions on Federal  constitutional issues he has written, he simply wrote ``none.''   But of course, the President did not select Brasher for his judicial  experience. A partisan judicial philosophy, along with youth, seem to  be the only qualifications of many of this administration's nominees.  Before becoming a judge, Brasher spent his short legal career  systematically restricting the  [[Page S979]]  rights of vulnerable populations, including opposing voting rights and  LGBTQ rights and supporting an unconstitutional law mandating universal  drug testing for food stamp applicants, which the 11th Circuit slapped  down as stripping away peoples' privacy simply because they are poor.   Brasher is opposed by literally hundreds of civil and human rights  groups who represent millions of Americans. They all are afraid that  with this elevation, he will continue to be a rubberstamp for the  President's radical agenda and negatively impact 37 million residents  of Alabama, Florida and Georgia--States that have often been on the  frontlines of systemic voter disenfranchisement for years.   For these reasons, I will oppose the nomination of Andrew Brasher. We  all must commit to considering each nominee carefully and on his or her  individual merit. I hope this body can reverse course and return to its  historic roots: tackling our Nation's most serious problems in a  bipartisan way, displaying comity even when we disagree, and treating  our unique role in approving lifetime judgeships with the seriousness  of purpose required by the Constitution.                            ____________________
