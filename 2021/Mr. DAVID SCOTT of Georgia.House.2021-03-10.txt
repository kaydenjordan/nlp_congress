 Mr. Speaker, let me, first of all, try to  respond so the American people will know that this money, this $1.9  trillion, is going to help our Nation survive COVID-19. It is not just  a disease that is out there. It is a disease that has impacted our  people.   Let me tell you what is in this bill: $800 million for food.   Don't you all know we have a hunger crisis? Don't you know that the  American people are hungry? They are in record lines--you see them-- miles long every day, trying to get food.   It has $800 million for food for women, infants, and children. We  have 13 million of our children and infants going to bed hungry and  malnourished every single night. You know why? Because of COVID.  Employment is down; our folks don't have the money to get the food.   Mr. Speaker, this is why our Agriculture Committee is having hearings  tomorrow to address hunger, to see what else we need to do.   And I must respond to this.    He brought up the issue of the Black  farmers. It is important for you to know that our Black farmers were  not included in the other pieces, so we got them $4 billion just to  help them and technical assistance. America needs this.
