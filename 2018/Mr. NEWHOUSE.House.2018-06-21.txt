 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 953 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 953         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 6136) to       amend the immigration laws and provide for border security,       and for other purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate, with 40 minutes equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on the Judiciary and 20 minutes equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Homeland Security; and (2) one motion to       recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis),  pending which I yield myself such time  [[Page H5439]]  as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time  yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, the House Rules Committee  met and reported a rule, House Resolution 953, providing for  consideration of H.R. 6136, the Border Security and Immigration Reform  Act. This legislation demonstrates a pivotal moment in our Nation's  history, one in which we can choose to, for the first time in decades,  make significant improvements to our Nation's broken immigration  system.   Mr. Speaker, I have been in this body for just about 3\1/2\ years,  and throughout that period of time, and even before as I was working to  become a Congressman, I have always been clear with the people of the  Fourth Congressional District of the State of Washington that fixing  our broken immigration system is a top priority and one that I believe  my district, my State, and the entire Nation desperately needs.   With the rule that we bring forward today, I can look my constituents  in the eye, and, with certainty, I can tell them that I believe that  this legislation, the underlying bill, this consensus legislation that  we have before us, is the best opportunity this body has had in many,  many years--in fact, decades--to get something signed into law to make  a true, lasting, substantive difference to improve our broken  immigration system.   While it may not be perfect--few bills are--H.R. 6136, the Border  Security and Immigration Reform Act, includes several main tenets to  addressing our immigration crisis, and, I should add, it is the only  bill that we are considering that includes all four pillars that the  President, on numerous occasions, has stated must be a part of any  legislation that he will sign into law.   First, this legislation includes desperately needed appropriations  for border security. The bill appropriates funding for further  construction of the border wall, as well as technology, personnel, and  modernization of our ports of entry.   Our border security system is broken and must be fixed, so I would  look to my fellow conservatives and say: This is our one shot to get  this done. This is our one opportunity to live up to the commitment we  gave to our constituents when we said we would secure our border.   Mr. Speaker, I truly believe that this is our only chance, and we  can't waste it. We can't squander it. Let's get our border secured once  and for all, and keep our commitment to our people.   It also includes a desperately needed solution for the DACA  population. I have shared with many of my colleagues time and time  again that I have the second highest number of DACA recipients in my  district in the State of Washington out of the entire Republican  Conference. A full third of Washington State's DACA population lives in  my district of central Washington.   I can tell you that I have met with literally hundreds of them,  including just this week. Monday afternoon, I met with about half a  dozen of these young people. They are smart, hardworking, respectful,  caring members of our community, people that you would be proud to call  your own constituents. I am proud that this legislation provides them  with the certainty that they need so that they can continue moving  forward with their educational and professional endeavors, and continue  to be productive, upstanding members of society.   Do you know what they told me that they wanted and that they need?  They would like hope. We can give it to them with this bill.   Mr. Speaker, this bill also, importantly, addresses the terrible  situation that we have all been witnessing regarding family separation  at the border. Children should not be taken away from their parents. We  can enforce our laws and enforce our border while also keeping families  together.   This situation has shown one more broken piece of an immigration  system that is not working for anyone, and another example that shows  why reform is so desperately needed. It makes clear that minors at the  border must remain with their parent or legal guardian.   Mr. Speaker, I want to share an excerpt that comes from an interview  that I just watched with one of our Border Patrol agents, a Mr. Chris  Cabrera, and if I may quote him, Mr. Speaker.   ``We've had this situation going on for 4 years now, and for some  reason, we haven't fixed it. I don't think you can necessarily blame it  on one administration or the other. It started under one and is  continuing under another. It hasn't been fixed, and it needs to be  fixed.   ``Right now, we have this beacon of, `We'll leave the light on for  you and let you come illegally into the country.' If you've seen some  of the stuff we've seen down here, you would understand just how  important it is to have a tough stance to divert people from coming  here. When you see a 12-year-old girl with a Plan B pill--her parents  put her on birth control because they know getting violated is part of  the journey--that's a terrible way to live. When you see a 4-year-old  girl traveling completely alone with just her parents' phone number  written across her shirt, something needs to be done.   ``We had a 9-year-old boy last year have a heat stroke and die in  front of us with no family around. That's because we're allowing people  to take advantage of this system.   ``Let's be honest here, if we want this law changed, then that's on  Congress. That's on nobody else but Congress. They need to get to work  and change this law.''   So I would respectfully challenge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle, but on the other side of the aisle especially, do not join  Senator Schumer, who says there is no need for a legislative solution.  There is a need. I urge you to reject much of the rhetoric that I have  heard on the floor just today rejecting funding for border security.   It can be easy to make this political and refuse to move a solution  forward that actually has a chance of being signed into law in an  effort to score political points. That is really easy. But this is just  too important. Congress can legislate on this. Congress must legislate  on this. And with this bill before us, we can fix this.   Now, to me, something important this legislation does not address is  the desperate need for a reliable, efficient, and fair program for  American farmers to access a legal, stable supply of workers. Our  broken H-2A and guest worker program has hobbled much of the  agricultural industry from attaining a reliable workforce.   Chairman Goodlatte of the House Judiciary Committee has been a  steadfast advocate for reforming this system, and I thank him for his  dedication to this matter over the years. I am heartened by the  commitment the Speaker, as well as the majority leader, have given to  me and others for a stand-alone vote on agricultural workforce  legislation before the August recess. And I pledge to Chairman  Goodlatte to work with him and all of my colleagues on that  legislation.   So while this bill does not fix every broken aspect of our  immigration system, it does take a major consensus-based step toward  addressing several main components, including providing certainty for  DACA recipients and finally securing our border once and for all.   Honestly, Mr. Speaker, many of my constituents are asking me a pretty  hard question: Why isn't this bill bipartisan? Why aren't any Democrats  supporting it? I don't know the answer to that, but it may be just as  simple as this: Because it is actually something that the President  will sign into law.   Even though it provides certainty for the DACA population, which we  all want, even though it addresses the terrible situation of family  separation at the border, which I hear is something everybody wants to  fix, anything that actually fulfills the President's goal of securing  the border my Democratic colleagues seemingly refuse to vote for.   Now, I don't engage in hyperbole, but I do not think it is hyperbolic  to say that my Democratic colleagues may not want to secure our border  or enforce our immigration laws. That is what I see. It is clear to me  their desire  [[Page H5440]]  to not give the President a ``win'' is more important than their desire  to actually fix and find a solution to these issues.   Mr. Speaker, compromise is hard. It is tough stuff. Consensus is  always difficult. Both of these things seem to have become four letter  words. The same goes for cooperation and negotiation. But these are  values that I, and many of us, have tried to espouse as we have worked  together with colleagues from both sides of the aisle for these many  months to find a solution to DACA while also securing our border.                                time  1430    But at the end of the day, we should all be operating under one  reality--one thing that maybe some people do not want to accept or  admit--whether you like it or not, the President has made it clear what  must be included in any bill in order to be signed into law, he has  told us what he needs. Now, I have acknowledged this, and I admit, it  may be easier for some of us to admit than others, but that is the  reality. If my colleagues refuse to accept that the President's top  priority is securing the border, then consensus, Mr. Speaker, is just  not possible.   I believe our President has shown good-faith willingness to  compromise on the issue of DACA. He has come a long way.   Unfortunately, we have not seen that same good-faith effort coming  from all of our colleagues. It is disappointing, my friends on the  other side of the aisle refuse to work with us to try to find a  solution here.   Mr. Speaker, history will be our greatest judge. It is always easy to  be a no, but I will always strive to get to yes for the betterment of  our Nation's future. There is simply too much riding on this  legislation for us to not work as hard as we can to get to yes. The  people of this country deserve nothing less.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and support  the underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the gentleman that the Dream Act  that he says is supported by many people in this Chamber would do  nothing to address the issue that is happening at the border right now.  The only piece of legislation before us today is the bill that we have  in front of us, H.R. 6136, that if we pass that would solve that  situation now.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs.  Love).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The previous speaker just made the point I was going to. If you are  going to negotiate in good faith and arrive at consensus, you have to  accept who the President is and what he requires in order to sign  legislation whether you like it or not. And one of the priorities that  he has made as clear as day is that there will be border security and a  wall. Refusing to accept that fact pretty much closes the door on the  opportunity or any possibility of negotiation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from the great State  of Florida (Mr. Curbelo).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and would just like to respond to one thing that was said previously.   All of us have been using examples of young people and how they are  being treated at the border. I take exception to the implication that  we will all be judged accordingly by our Maker for doing so, in a  negative way.   Let me just repeat what I said in my opening remarks, quoting a  Border Patrol agent, Mr. Chris Cabrera. He told us that: ``If you've  seen some of the stuff we've seen down here, you would understand just  how important it is to have a tough stance to divert people from coming  here. When you see a 12-year-old girl with a Plan B pill--her  [[Page H5444]]  parents put her on birth control because they know getting violated is  part of the journey . . . something has to be done.''   That is exactly what we are doing here with this piece of  legislation, Mr. Speaker.   If we pass this today, that will help solve this problem today. That  is what we, as Congress, need to do. We need to be responsive to the  plight of people trying to get here, as well as to the citizens of our  own country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, let me just say that I am proud to  represent my conference and stand here with this piece of legislation  that will provide the certainty and the hope for more than 1.8 million  DACA recipients and Dreamers in this country. If you vote ``no'' on  this bill, you will be denying those individuals what they for so long  have been wanting.  [[Page H5445]]    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be here representing my conference to do  just that, to give them that hope, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Sessions), the chairman of the Rules Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, we have got so many Members coming wanting  to speak. How much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Denham).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, don't believe me. I would say don't believe Mr. Polis  either. Believe the border security guard that I quoted earlier who  said that the situation we have at the border happened under the  previous administration as well as this one.   Mr. Trump, our President, did not manufacture this crisis, but this  bill before us will solve that situation, which is why we need to pass  this rule.   That whole issue takes away from one of the most pressing issues of  our time, immigration reform. We will solve that, but we can also  address immigration.   I am proud of the bill we have before us. I am proud that we have had  so many speakers come and speak on its behalf. This is the only bill in  front of us that has any potential chance of becoming law. The  President will sign this bill because it addresses his four main  pillars: it provides for border security, which the American people  want. And, certainly, as we have talked a lot today, it provides for  those 1.8 million DACA recipients and Dreamers. It is a good bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill because it is  the right thing to do.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
