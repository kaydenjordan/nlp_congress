 Madam President, yesterday's CPI report told Americans  what they already knew all too well: The disastrous effects of  Washington Democrats' spending binge last year still have our economy  in a vice grip.   Year-on-year, inflation has hit 9.1 percent for the first time since  the fallout of the Carter administration. And the signs are  inescapable. Price hikes on everything from food to fuel to housing are  setting new multidecade highs.   A shopper out in Oregon told a reporter recently she doesn't buy beef  anymore. Here is what she said:         We kind of try to eat what we have while we have it.    Yesterday, we learned exactly what she and millions of Americans are  up against: the fastest rising grocery prices since 1979.   In Nevada, the owner of a local diner says:         My concerns are that my food costs have escalated       dramatically. I used to gut wrench about [raising menu       prices] 2 or 3 percent. Now it is way more than that just to       keep my doors open.    Yesterday's report says he is not alone. Nationwide prices for food  outside the home haven't risen this fast since back in 1981. And this  new reality is especially frustrating for those working to help.   As the head of one South Dakota food bank put it, ``The donation load  seemed to lighten up. . . . When we give out food boxes, they're not as  full as they used to be.''   Right as working families are struggling the most, so are the  organizations trying to help them. Just one more cruel twist of  Washington Democrats' runaway inflation.   One of the first and most painful consequences of the Biden  administration's failed policies have been the soaring costs of energy.  Remember, on their party's watch, the cost of heating a home rose by  double-digit percentages last winter. Electricity prices climbed at  their fastest rate since 2006. Prices at the gas pump have doubled  since President Biden took office. One Pennsylvania woman said that  ever since her heating bill skyrocketed last winter, she has had to  scale back her spending big time. Here is what she had to say:         I need to hide under my bed and save every dollar I can.    And in Maryland, one retiree reports that ``skyrocketing gas prices  mean that visits to the local library--about 5 miles round trip--no  longer feel free.''   From day one, the Biden administration has worked overtime to make it  [[Page S3286]]  harder to produce the most affordable and reliable forms of energy that  Americans rely on at home. Now, as their radical climate agenda takes  its toll on domestic production, millions of Americans are facing the  possibility--listen to this--of summer blackouts.   The heartland, the West, and the Southwest face the highest risks.  The people of Arizona and Nevada, for example, are already at what  experts call ``elevated risk'' for this summer.   Are Arizonans and Nevadans clamoring for a new tax hike on natural  gas electricity on top of everything else? I doubt it. Are they  desperate to double down on the very unreliable green sources that set  us up for these blackouts in the first place? I don't think so.   Our electric grid is overburdened already, but Democrats apparently  want to strain it even more by eliminating the most reliable sources of  energy we have, all the while spending hundreds of billions on schemes  that depend on Chinese minerals, components, and supply chains.   Trading American energy independence for less reliable sources that  depend on forced child labor and foreign producers with questionable  environmental standards--really, is this what our colleagues think will  usher in a big transition to green daydreams?   Washington Democrats are the only ones who would define higher energy  costs and lower reliability as a victory. Real-life Americans know that  higher costs and rolling blackouts are just two more symptoms of a  failed government with failed leadership pushing failed policies.   Working families are still reeling from the time Democrats decided to  spend us into inflation. They have got no appetite for being taxed into  recession.
