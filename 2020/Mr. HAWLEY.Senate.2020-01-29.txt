 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Missouri.    Mr. Chief Justice, I send to the desk a question for both  counsel for the President and the House managers on my own behalf and  on behalf of Senator Cruz, Senator Daines, and Senator Braun.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The President's counsel will respond  first to the question from Senator Hawley and the other Senators:         When he took office, Viktor Shokin, Ukraine's Prosecutor       General, vowed to investigate Burisma. Before Vice President       Joe Biden pressed Ukrainian officials on corruption,       including pushing for the removal of Shokin, did the White       House Counsel's Office or the Office of the Vice President       legal counsel issue ethics advice approving Mr.  [[Page S683]]       Biden's involvement in matters involving corruption in       Ukraine or Shokin, despite the presence of Hunter Biden on       the board of Burisma, a company widely considered to be       corrupt? Did Vice President Biden ever ask Hunter Biden to       step down from the board of Burisma?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for the  question.   We are not aware of any evidence that then-Vice President Biden  sought any ethics opinion. We are aware that both Amos Hochstein and  Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kent testified--excuse me--Amos  Hochstein is in the public domain. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State  Kent testified in the proceedings before the House that they each  raised the issue with Vice President Biden of the potential appearance  of a conflict of interest with his son Hunter being on the board of  Burisma. Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent testified that although he  raised that issue with the Vice President's office, the response was  that the Vice President's Office--the Vice President was busy dealing  then with the illness of his other son, and there was no action  taken. So from what we know, there wasn't any effort to seek an ethics  opinion. We are not aware of an ethics opinion having been issued.  Although the issue was flagged for the Vice President's Office, we are  not aware that Vice President Biden asked his son to step down or that  any other action was taken. And I believe that Vice President Biden has  said that he never discussed--he said publicly he never discussed his  son's overseas business dealings with him.    Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief Justice and Senator, I appreciate  your question. The facts about Vice President Biden's conduct are clear  and do not change. Let's go through them.   First, every witness asked about this topic testified that Mr. Shokin  was widely considered to be a corrupt and ineffective prosecutor who  did not prosecute corruption. Shokin was so corrupt that the entire  free world--the United States, the European Union, the International  Monetary Fund--pressed for his office to be cleaned up. So I would  caution you to be skeptical of anything that Mr. Shokin claims.   Second, witnesses, including our own anti-corruption advocate,  Ambassador Yovanovitch--remember that very dedicated anti-corruption  Ambassador--testified that Shokin's removal made it more likely that  investigations of corrupt European--Ukrainian companies would move  forward. Let me repeat that. The dismissal of Shokin made it more  likely that Burisma would be investigated.   Third, Burisma was not under scrutiny at the time Joe Biden called  for Shokin's ouster, according to the National Anti-Corruption Bureau  of Ukraine, an organization several witnesses testified is effective at  fighting corruption.   Shokin's office investigated Burisma, but the probe focused on a  period before Hunter Biden joined the company. But, again, another  investigation was warranted. Dismissing Shokin would have made that  more likely.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.
