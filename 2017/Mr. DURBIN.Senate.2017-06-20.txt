 Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from New Jersey  for his excellent remarks on the Affordable Care Act and its future and  really spotlight the point he made. He and I have been around  legislatures for a long time, both at the local level, State level, and  here in Washington. If you have something you are really proud of--a  bill--you can't wait to roll it out. We have a place for a press  conference about every 15 feet in the corridors around here. We have a  press corps that fills the Gallery when they all show up, and they are  anxious to hear our story. If you have something you are proud of--and  each of has had that legislation--you put it in a press release and do  the social media and the whole number.   If you are unfortunate to be in the position to bring a bill to the  floor you are not very proud of--you don't know how you can explain it  back home--you keep it secret. You do it behind closed doors.   What the Senator has said is exactly the truth--and we know it, as  our colleagues on the other side know it. They have, for the past  several weeks, since the House passed their bill, been meeting behind  closed doors. So 13 male Senators--why they couldn't invite the women  Republicans in the Senate--it is their decision--I can't understand.  They have not produced one thing for public consumption--nothing. Yet,  Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, tells us: Well, you have 10  days. We are going to pass the new healthcare system for the United  States of America in 10 days, and pretty soon we are going to show you  what we are going to propose.   It tells you the whole story. There is something in there that is  painful, that hurts them politically, and that they can't really  explain. After all these years--``Repeal ObamaCare, repeal ObamaCare,''  they can't come up with an alternative they can sell to the American  people.   I thank the Senator for pointing out his experience, and the  experience he is finding in New Jersey. I am finding the same thing  back in Illinois.   I thank my colleague from New Jersey for his statement.   This last Saturday, I was invited to debate a Republican House Member  from my hometown of Springfield, IL, on his vote in favor of  TrumpCare--if you want to call it that--the Republican healthcare plan  in the House. We were invited by the Ministerial Alliance of  Springfield, the African-American ministers. I accepted the invitation  on a Saturday afternoon, and he did as well.   He put conditions on it. No. 1, no media coverage. This is not open  to the public. Really? We are going to debate a healthcare system  change for America that is going to affect millions of people, and we  will not talk about it in public? But that was his ground rule. And  then in the midst of it, he thought someone was taping him while it was  going on and stopped full sentence and said: I don't want this taped.  Well, here is a bill he voted for to change the healthcare system for  the people he represents, including the folks in that room, and he  didn't want to be on the record or public about that discussion. That  tells me a lot as well.   It isn't just a secret bill we haven't seen, it is a lot of  Republican House Members who voted for it--and they were all  Republicans--passed by, I believe, two or three votes, and now they  don't want to talk about it. Well, there is a message there.   Here is what I have concluded after looking at this in a lot of  different ways. Where you stand on healthcare in America depends on  where you start on the question: Do you believe every American has a  right to affordable, quality healthcare? If the answer is, no, that is  for people who are lucky or rich or have the right job, then you can  reach the same conclusion they did in the House when they passed the  Republican measure because, you see, their bill removed health  insurance coverage from 23 million Americans, instead of expanding the  percentage of Americans with health insurance coverage, which we set  out to do with the Affordable Care Act. The Republicans have reversed  field. They are taking away health insurance from more people than the  Affordable Care Act gave.   Is that a press release from the Democratic National Committee I just  quoted? No. It was the Congressional Budget Office--a bipartisan group  here, an agency in Washington that analyzes our legislation and gives  us their analysis. They looked at the Republican bill and said it will  cost 23 million people in America their health insurance.   If you started with the position that healthcare is a right, you  would stop at that point and say: Well, this bill clearly doesn't work  because it takes away healthcare coverage instead of creating  healthcare coverage.   Where you start is where you stand.   The second question is this: If you believe the highest priority of  this effort is to cut taxes on wealthy people, then, of course, you  would vote for what they passed in the House--$700 billion in tax cuts.  Now, that tax cut came right out of the healthcare system of America.  That is the tax revenue that is used to expand Medicaid insurance  coverage to those who are lower income workers. That is the money that  is used to help subsidize the premium payments of middle-income workers  who can't afford the monthly premium.   But they believed--the Republicans who voted in the House--that there  is a higher priority than helping those people to have health  insurance, and that is cutting the tax burden of the wealthiest people  in America. So if you start with that premise--that you have to cut  taxes by $700 billion regardless of what happens--this is what you end  up with, the measure that came over from the House of Representatives.  I don't know what the Senate Republicans will come up with in response  to that, but clearly it must be parallel or close to what the House of  Representatives did.   Let's take a close look at this measure and take a look at the  history that brought us to this moment. As I mentioned, we still don't  have the text of the Republican secret bill to repeal the Affordable  Care Act. Six years and counting, they can't produce a replacement. It  looks like we are going to vote on this in a few days. By congressional  standards, this is a high crime and misdemeanor. To think that we are  going to consider a bill within 10 days affecting every American,  affecting one-sixth of the American economy--a bill that will say to  some people: You are going to lose your health insurance, and to  others: We are going to offer you a health insurance policy that really  isn't worth the paper it is written on, and we haven't seen the bill.   Well, what is the history of this? Is this the way the Republicans  always operate? Not really. In December 2009, Republican Senator  McConnell, their leader, said, when we were debating the Affordable  Care Act: ``This massive piece of legislation that seeks to restructure  one-sixth of our economy is being written behind closed doors without  input from anyone in an effort to jam it past, not only the Senate, but  the American people.'' That was Senator McConnell about the Affordable  Care Act when it was being proposed by President Obama.   Well, what is the fact? During the passage of the Affordable Care  Act, the Senate held over 50 bipartisan hearings on the bill. How many  bipartisan hearings have we held on the new Republican healthcare  proposal? None, not one.   At that time, 6 years ago, we had a week-long markup in the Finance  Committee and a month-long markup in the HELP Committee. The Senate  spent--and I remember this well--25 consecutive days in session on the  floor of the Senate debating this bill. It is the second longest  consecutive period of time ever spent on a bill in the Senate.   We considered on the floor of the Senate hundreds of amendments. You  know, we ended up adopting 150 Republican amendments to the Affordable  Care Act. Not a single one of them would vote for it, but we took their  proposals to make it better seriously and adopted 150 changes.  [[Page S3640]]    How much of a chance will we have to amend the Senate Republican bill  that may come before us as soon as this week? It remains to be seen. It  could be what we call a vote-arama around here, which is a corruption  of what this grand institution really established as a standard of  operation for generations and centuries. The vote-arama lets you vote  on an amendment offered to the bill, with 2 minutes of debate.   You are changing the healthcare system and you have 1 minute on each  side to debate your amendment? Is that a serious undertaking with  something that is that consequential for so many Americans? No one has  seen this secret bill--not Democrats, not many Republican Senators.   I asked Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price last week in  a hearing: Have you seen the bill? You are the one that is going to  have to implement it.   He said: No, I haven't seen it either .   This weekend the Presiding Officer, Senator Rubio, a Republican from  Florida, said:         The Senate is not a place where you can just cook up       something behind closed doors and rush it for a vote on the       floor.    Mr. President, I couldn't agree more.   Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, said:         I want to make sure the American people, I want to make       sure the members of Congress have enough time to evaluate it.       I want to have enough time to really take a look at what       we're voting on.    That was Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.   Senator Bob Corker, a Republican Senator from Tennessee, said:         I've said from Day 1 and I'll say it again: The process is       better if you do it in public. Obviously, that's not the       route that is being taken.    I didn't pull these quotes from months and years ago. They are from  the weekend. The comments were made over the weekend by Republican  Members about their very own leadership and the process they are  following in preparing to change America's healthcare system.   Let's talk about some numbers. Let's start with zero. How many  hearings have we had on the Senate bill to repeal the Affordable Care  Act? Zero. How many markups have we had? Zero. How much time has the  Secretary of Health and Human Services, the man responsible for  implementing this bill, spent on it to review it? Zero. How much  Democratic input has been allowed for this secret negotiation? Zero.  How many women Senators have been involved in crafting the bill? Zero.  How many medical organizations or patient groups support the secret  Senate bill? Zero. And most concerning of all, how much time has the  public had to even read this bill? Zero.   Let's take a look at another number: 23 million. The Congressional  Budget Office estimates that 23 million Americans will lose their  health insurance under the House-passed repeal bill--1 million in  Illinois.   I have said it before, but I will say it again--and this is a driving  factor in terms of my views on the subject: If you have ever in your  life been the parent of a seriously ill child and didn't have health  insurance, you will never forget it as long as you live. I know. I have  been there.   I was a law student, newly married, with a brand new baby girl with a  really serious health issue, and I had no health insurance. My wife and  I sat in the charity section at Children's Hospital waiting for them to  call our name so we could take our little girl in to the latest  resident, with a hundred questions and who wanted to go through them  all over again. I thought to myself: Durbin, how did you ever reach  this point where you don't have health insurance?    I fixated on health insurance from that point forward. From the time  I got out of law school, for years afterwards while my daughter was  growing up, I not only had health insurance, but I sometimes had two  health insurance policies. I was so worried about having coverage if I  ever really needed it.   So we want to take health insurance away from 23 million Americans?  Do you want it to be your family, your son, your daughter? I sure  wouldn't.   Here is another number: 750. Lower income older Americans would see  their premiums increase 750 percent under the House-passed repeal bill,  from $1,700 under ACA to $14,000 under the Republican plan. Now, how  can that happen? How can you see the premiums go up that fast? We built  into the affordable care bill a guaranteed protection for disparity in  premium payments of no more than three to one. The most expensive  health insurance policy cannot be more than three times the lowest cost  policy. The Republicans changed that to five to one. Well, who does  that affect?   If you are between 50 and 64 years of age, you are in a category of  people not yet eligible for Medicare. If you are now facing chronic  illnesses that could make health insurance more expensive, you will pay  the higher premiums. The higher premiums, when calculated, are  dramatically higher for this group. That is why the American  Association of Retired Persons has come out foursquare against the  Republican TrumpCare, the Republican repeal bill. It is just unfair to  those between the ages of 50 and 64.   Some 130 million, that is how many people nationwide have preexisting  conditions. Almost half of the people in Illinois have a preexisting  condition. Several weeks ago, I had a procedure for an atrial flutter.  It worked out just fine. Now I have a preexisting condition. I am in  that category. What does that mean? If you went out to buy health  insurance with a preexisting condition, you are charged more, if you  could buy insurance at all.   So when the Republican bill that passed the House does not guarantee,  as the Affordable Care Act, that you cannot be discriminated against  because of a preexisting condition, it makes millions of Americans--130  million--more vulnerable.   Is that what they wanted to achieve?   Where you stand depends on where you start. If you think everyone is  entitled to health insurance, then you can't be standing for something  that allows preexisting conditions to be used against you. A lot of the  people whom I am talking about have employer insurance, but what about  those who shop on the individual market or purchase individual  insurance in the future? Under the House repeal bill, insurers would,  once again, be allowed to charge people with preexisting conditions  more money for insurance.   The next number is 33,000. Senator Menendez referred to it. That is  how many people are dying every year because of the opioid or heroin  overdose--33,000, and 1,800 a year in Illinois.   Now, listen to this. The Republican bill dramatically cuts the  Medicaid Program, the Nation's largest provider of substance abuse  treatment services, and it allows insurers, once again, to refuse  coverage for those needed services.   I have been here a few years, and I can remember that desk because  that is where Paul Wellstone of Minnesota sat, and I remember that desk  because that is where Pete Domenici of New Mexico sat. You couldn't ask  for two more polar opposites politically. Paul Wellstone was a  garrulous, proud liberal. Pete Domenici was a proud conservative. One  was from Minnesota, and one was from New Mexico, and they came together  on an issue.   Do you know what the issue was? Each of them had someone they loved  in their family who suffered from a mental illness, and they said: Why  in the world will health insurance companies refuse to write coverage  for people with mental illness? They fought for years against the  insurance companies, and they finally won.   We included, in the Affordable Care Act, the requirement that your  health insurance policy cover not only physical illness but mental  illness. It was a breakthrough. For the first time, we stopped treating  mental illness like a curse and treated it like an illness that could  be treated.   They added a section at the end that most of us didn't even notice:  mental illness and substance abuse treatment. I didn't know it was  there until the opioid crisis, and I started going to these rehab  facilities and saying to these people there: How are you paying for  this care? Some of them were under Medicaid, but those under private  health insurance said: My policy covers it. It covers it because  Wellstone and Domenici insisted on putting it in.   After that historic victory, you would think the Republicans would  include mental illness and substance  [[Page S3641]]  abuse treatment as one of the basic essential services for health  insurance, but they don't.   When they say we are going to write a bill that gives Americans more  choice in their health insurance--oh, that sounds appealing--the choice  is whether you want mental illness and substance abuse treatment or you  don't.   Well, from where I am sitting, that is the kind of insurance coverage  that should be basic to everyone. You never know whether that little  girl that you are raising--that beautiful little girl--6 years from now  is going to be struggling with an addiction. At that point, you better  hope that your health insurance policy has some coverage so that you  can save her life and bring her back from that addiction.   Now, 280,000 is the next number. That is how many children in  Illinois depend on Medicaid for school-based health and medical  services, from feeding tubes and handicapped buses to special education  teachers. I made a point this last week when I was home to visit the  schools in Chicago and Bloomington and hear firsthand what cuts in  Medicaid meant to local school districts.   Many Senators don't realize this, but the kids with whom you are  dealing who have learning disabilities and other disabilities, many of  them are supported at your local schools by Medicaid dollars. The  Medicaid dollars pay for the counselors, pay for the special buses, and  pay for the feeding tubes for these kids to survive. So when you make a  dramatic cut in Medicaid, as the Republican bill that came out of the  House does, you endanger the very services and the very benefits that  these special ed kids need. The school districts are mandated by law to  help these kids, but if the money is cut off from Medicaid, what are  they going to do?   The Republican repeal bill that every Republican Congressman in my  State voted for slashes $40 billion in Medicaid funding to Illinois,  including money to school districts.   Three--this is the most important single number in the next 10 days  in the Senate--3. That is the number of Republican Senators needed to  stop this. Surely, there are three Republican Senators who are  concerned enough about this secret, behind-closed-doors process that we  are witnessing when it comes to rewriting healthcare in America--at  least three Republican Senators who want to take time to properly  review this legislation that affects one-sixth of our economy.   Just the Senators who have publicly stated their personal concerns  about this process--if the three of them would come together, we could  stop this and do it the right way.   I said privately to a Republican Senator last week, after the tragedy  where a Republican Congressman was shot at a baseball practice: Isn't  this the moment when we ought to get together quietly--Democrats and  Republicans--when we ought to sit down and write a bill we can both be  proud of? I am hoping he was listening.   I am hoping that three Republican Senators, if they stand up for it,  will help us achieve that goal. Surely there are three Republican  Senators who are worried about the kids in their States like I am  worried about the kids in mine, who do not want to make the opioid  epidemic any worse, who want to make certain--underline the word  ``certain''--that they are protecting the people they represent from  discrimination because of preexisting conditions. Surely there are at  least three Republican Senators who do not want to throw millions of  Americans off of health insurance coverage. Maybe some of the Senators  who represent States that have been ravaged by the opioid epidemic will  step forward. There are a lot of them. It only takes three to change  this.   To Republican Senators, I say: Do not do this. Do not do this secret  process. Democrats are willing to work with you to improve our  healthcare system. I have said before that the only perfect law that I  know of was carried down a mountain on clay tablets by Senator Moses.  All of the other efforts can use some work, and in this case, we are  willing to work with you. Take repeal off the table, and we will put a  chair up to the table.   Over the past week, I have received thousands of emails and letters  from Illinoisans who are worried about what is happening in the Senate  today.   Helen, from River Forest, IL, is 47 years old. She is a primary  caregiver for her parents. Her mom has Alzheimer's and is in a nursing  home.   Here is what Helen writes:         Just before Thanksgiving, my dad's health deteriorated. He       is now in hospice in the same nursing home. I have spent all       of their savings--my mom and dad's savings--on healthcare. My       mom is finally eligible for Medicaid. Without Medicaid, I       would need to bring my parents to my home and quit my job to       personally nurse them myself because I don't have the money       myself to keep them in the nursing home and pay for private       care. Please protect ObamaCare and Medicaid.    Here is Madeline from Chicago, who writes:         My younger sister is disabled. Before the Affordable Care       Act went into effect, she was just about to hit the maximum       lifetime limit on her private insurance policy.    That used to be the case. You would sign up for insurance, and you  would say: Oh, great coverage--no copays, no extra charges. Then you  would find in the fine print that there is a limit to the coverage of  $100,000. My friends, I can tell you that we are--each and every one of  us--one diagnosis or one accident away from having more than $100,000  in medical bills. It happens pretty quickly. That used to be built into  insurance policies. We outlawed it under the Affordable Care Act. Now,  in the name of ``choice,'' the Republicans want to bring that back.   Madeline writes:         Before the ACA went into effect and my daughter was about       to hit the maximum lifetime limit on her private insurance       policy, she was going to have to apply to be part of a high-      risk pool, but that was going to involve a long wait, without       any insurance, plus high premiums if and when she was       accepted into the pool. The Affordable Care Act came just in       time for my sister and for our family.    When the Republicans in the House say not to worry about people with  preexisting conditions, that they have set aside $8 billion to take  care of them in private risk pools, it is sad and, in a way, tragic  that they would say that. That is not nearly enough money, and there is  no guarantee that private risk pools that never worked before the  Affordable Care Act would work in the future. It is a way to give an  answer to the obvious question of why they are dropping so many people  with preexisting conditions from guaranteed coverage.   The last note is from Erin of Chicago, who writes:         I implore you to force a public hearing on the ACA repeal       that the Republicans are trying to sneak through. If this       bill passes, many of my friends and family will lose coverage       either due to preexisting conditions or because the       deductibles are too high. Additionally, my parents are self-      employed and getting older. Under the proposed act, their       health insurance premiums will likely increase to $14,000 a       year. They cannot afford it. They just can't. They will not       have coverage, will get sick, and be unable to afford care.    If the Republicans have a better idea than the Affordable Care Act,  for goodness' sake, stop hiding it from the American people. Stop  talking about it behind closed doors. If it is such a good idea, bring  it out for the world to take a look at. There will be critics. There  were certainly critics with regard to the Affordable Care Act. I  remember that very well. Yet that is what this body is all about.   The Senate is supposed to be a place where we deliberate on the  important issues of our time. Is there anything more important than  your health, the health of the people whom you love, and your  opportunity to get basic healthcare so that you can protect them?   I implore the Republicans and those who know that this is the wrong  way to go to stand up and say so. It only takes three Republican  Senators to do this a much different way so as to bring credit to this  institution and create a bill--create a change--that makes healthcare  more affordable, more accessible, and more fair to more Americans.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.    Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to  acknowledge my friend, Joan Claybrook. Joan is a legend. She is one of  the most effective champions this Nation has ever seen--and she is  still leading the charge. Last week, Joan celebrated her 80th birthday,  and one thing is clear, Joan Claybrook isn't slowing down.   Like so many bright young people in Washington, Joan began her career  right here in the U.S. Congress, working for Senator Walter Mondale and  Representative James Mackay as a congressional fellow. In the summer of  1966, the Senate unanimously passed the National Traffic and Motor  Vehicle Safety Act, the first major legislation to improve auto safety  in this country. This effort was led by consumer advocate, Ralph Nader,  and working right by his side was Joan Claybrook. It led to important  safety standards we take for granted today: seatbelts, windshield  wipers, outside mirrors, and dashboards. This landmark legislation also  launched Joan's impressive career as a consumer advocate.   During the Carter administration, Joan served as the head of the  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, where she led efforts  to improve vehicle safety and increased consumer access to safety  information. Prior to her time with the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration, she ran Congress Watch, worked for the Public Interest  Research Group, National Traffic Safety Bureau, Social Security  Administration, and the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and  Welfare.   In 2009, Joan retired as president of Public Citizen, after nearly  three decades of service championing consumer interests and campaigning  on issues from campaign finance reform, to truck safety, and business  regulation. Among her many accolades at Public Citizen, Joan was able  to limit the number of triple- and longer double-trailer trucks on the  road, and she helped to ensure that health, safety, and environmental  agencies were able to continue its important work protecting the  American people, but her proudest, and perhaps most impactful,  achievement was winning a 20-year battle with the auto industry to  install airbags in cars. Because of Joan's work, countless lives have  been saved. I want to thank her for these contributions that improved  the health and safety for so many across the country.   Joan Claybrook has been honored by numerous organizations, including  the Philip Hart Distinguished Consumer Service Award from the Consumer  Federation of America, an Excellence in Public Service Award from the  Georgetown University Law Center, and an award for Superior Achievement  from the National Traffic Safety Bureau--just to name a few. In her  precious spare time, Joan serves on the board of Citizens for Tax  Justice and Public Justice. She also cochairs the Advocates for Highway  and Auto Safety and Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways.   It is not simply Joan Claybrook's extraordinary resume that earned  her such great respect; it was her approach to the job. Joan brought  humility, integrity, and fairness to every challenge she faced. Her  energy, passion, and optimism are infectious, and her continued drive  to ensure all Americans have the chance to lead safe and equitable  lives make her an inspiration. Joan may have retired, but her  commitment to those values has never wavered. She is a force of nature.   I will close with this. I strongly believe in the role of public  service to create change and make a difference. Joan Claybrook's years  of service reflect these values and prove that, with the right  approach, change is possible. I am lucky to count Joan as a friend. It  is with great pride that I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating  Joan Claybrook's 80th birthday and congratulate her on an outstanding  career. I hope Joan enjoys this special day, and I wish her many more  wonderful years.                            ____________________
