 I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, before last year, the committee I chair  and one of the committees on which the Presiding Officer sits--the  Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee--was far too much about  Wall Street and far too little about issues that matter to people's  lives.   We have changed that. Instead of always listening to the biggest  banks and their corporate lobbyists, we listen to workers and we listen  to their families from all kinds of communities all over the country.   Last year, we held the committee's first-ever worker listening  session where, as hard as it was for all of us, no Senator asked  questions. We just heard from witnesses. We heard from workers--about a  half-dozen workers--who just told us their story.   We know that workers power our economy. We heard from workers from  all kinds of backgrounds, working all kinds of jobs. Some worked for  banks, others worked for large tech companies, and some for other  corporations. They talked about wage theft. They talked about being  laid off during a pandemic with no severance pay. They talked about the  danger in their workplaces. They talked about how, in some cases, their  companies busted their unions.   Their stories make it clear that the real harm the Wall Street  business model does is to workers' lives.   Yesterday, we held our second listening session, this time with  renters from around the country whose homes are owned by deep-pocketed  investors like corporate landlords and private equity funds.  [[Page S604]]    One of those renters--some lived in the Presiding Officer's home  State, I believe in North Minneapolis--told her story. It is an  increasing problem in every region, from big cities to rural towns.  Deep-pocketed investors come into a community they have no connection  to, and they buy up homes; they raise rents; they cut services; and  they don't deliver on their promises to their tenants.   These out-of-town and sometimes out-of-country investors are raising  rents often by as much as 50 percent, issuing eviction notices, and  leaving toxic mold and pest infestations to grow worse, all to pad  their bottom line.   We heard from renters in apartment buildings and single-family homes  and manufactured housing. We heard from renters in Las Vegas, NV; Great  Falls, MT; and Hyattsville, MD--all sharing those stories.   One renter was told, when she asked why her rent suddenly increased  by hundreds of dollars a month, ``We have to please the investors.''  Think about that. ``We have to please the investors.''   Renters in Nevada, in Maryland, in Texas, and in California had their  homes repeatedly flooded with wastewater, lived with rodent  infestations, and went long periods without working showers or hot  water.   Listen to Juan Cuellar from Maryland. He said:         The ceiling in the hallways is falling in. The wood floor       is buckling. We don't have heat. There are cockroaches and       mice. The air conditioning units don't work. There is a lot       of mold. The refrigerator doesn't work. They don't want to       fix anything, including the stove and the refrigerator and       the heater.    They don't even have heat. These investors claim they are just  running a business. OK. The business is supposed to be providing a  decent place to live--that is part of the deal--in exchange for  collecting people's hard-earned money in rent each month. If your  building is full of mold and mice and doesn't have working heat or  doesn't have a working stove, you are not holding up your end of the  deal. You are not running a real business; you are running a scam.  Families pay a very high price for it.   Rachel Jones is a working mother in North Minneapolis. She said her  persistent complaints about her home's leaking sewage and dangerous  garage went unanswered. The city itself was forced to step in because  of code violations. This single mother said the company that owns her  home bought it as ``essentially a money-grabbing tool. That's all they  are doing.''   Ms. Nguyen, who lives in Brooklyn, talked about the firm that bought  her building, Greenbrook. She said:         They and their business model do not care if I or my       neighbors become homeless--in fact, their business model       makes that possibility [much more] likely.    Cindy Newman, from Great Falls, MT, talked about her manufactured  home community. She worked hard to buy her home, but she rents the land  it sits on. That is how manufactured homes work, how mobile home parks  work. She rents the land it sits on. She said they used to have ``a  fair land owner who kept our community safe and affordable,'' until the  private equity firm Havenpark Capital took over.   I would just add that Senator Sanders just walked in, and Senator  Sanders and I have talked about when these private equity firms come in  and buy mobile home parks and the damage that so often does.   She said her new owners in Montana have ``cut back on all amenities  and strip value out of our communities. They are brutal, absentee  landlords.'' Her line, her quote.   The group raised rents and added fees for water and sewer and trash  removal. Ms. Newman said this company bought a number of these homes-- Havenpark--all over Montana and Iowa and other places around the  country.   She said it amounted to about an 86-percent increase--her words--for  the dirt that her home sits on. But they just can't pick up and move.  Moving her home to a different community would cost $10,000 or $20,000.   Just picture these mobile home parks. These mobile homes they buy-- maybe $30-, $40-, $50,000 in some cases--they set them and then they  build around them, and they aren't really mobile at that point. It  costs, as this woman said, $10- to $20,000 to move them.   Most of her neighbors are seniors. They are on fixed incomes.   She continues:         It's hard to believe we could lose our homes and our life       savings to such uncaring, greedy people.    Remember, they moved into these places 5 years, 10 years, 20 years  ago. A family owned it. The family rented the land out for $200 or $300  a month. Then a private equity firm came in and doubled their rent. I  mean, think about what that does, just upending the lives of people who  are not all that affluent. They are kind of living paycheck to paycheck  or Social Security check to Social Security check anyway.   As apartments and houses and manufactured home communities that  people can afford become harder and harder to find, families are left  with an impossible choice: pay money they don't have for a home that  may put their kids at risk or gamble and look for a new place to live  with a fear they will end up with no place to sleep.   That is what these seven renters, who represent millions of renters  across the country--that is what they told us yesterday. These renters  and homeowners shared their stories. They have shone a light on this  problem.   Tomorrow in our hearing--we will hold a hearing in our committee  looking at how we ended up here, how this exploitive business model has  exploded around the country. For Wall Street investors, rent increases  are distilled down as returns to shareholders. Code violations and  eviction violations are just the cost of doing business. But for Mr.  Cuellar and Ms. Jones and Ms. Newman and millions of Americans, these  are their homes. These are their neighborhoods. It is up to us to look  out for them, not to look out for private equity firms' bottom lines.   I yield the floor.
