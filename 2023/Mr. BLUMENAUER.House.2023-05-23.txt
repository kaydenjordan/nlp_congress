 Madam Speaker, our Supreme Court is a symbol of  corrupt and cruel judicial politics.   Clarence Thomas is the poster child for the Supreme Court, the only  Federal court with no ethical standards at all, let alone, enforce  them.   They empower extremists who would deny vital lifesaving care in their  zeal to enforce their vision on the limits of women's health.   It is not just about their opposition to abortion. They are forcing  women to be pregnant, regardless of the consequences to real people.   The harms are not theoretical as illustrated in today's Washington  Post editorial. Real women and their families suffer serious injury  being denied care they need.   I am proud I come from one of the few States that has no limitations  on families' access to reproductive healthcare, the most personal of  decisions.   Change is coming, make no mistake, as more and more recognize the  impact of this cruel interference in the most personal of decisions.   Despite hopelessly gerrymandered State legislatures, the people  ultimately will win.                            ____________________
