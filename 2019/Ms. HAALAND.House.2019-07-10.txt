 Mr. Chairman, America must live up to its values, and  that means treating transgender servicemembers with the same respect  and dignity as their counterparts. Both of my parents served and only  judged their fellow servicemembers on one standard: their ability to  complete the mission.   Transgender servicemembers honorably serve this country and are not  any different than any other servicemember. They come from families  where service is a tradition. They go through the same training and  abide by the same requirements. They deserve fairness and respect, and  I urge the passage of this amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment, and I  want to highlight three key points:   The military women of reproductive age lack access to adequate  healthcare. This is a healthcare problem.   Unplanned pregnancies hamper readiness and make it harder for women  to advance their careers, and this personnel issue can be easily  remedied.   A service branch shouldn't determine the quality of care our  servicemembers should have, and this is an equality issue.   I thank Chairwoman Speier, and I urge passage of this amendment.
