 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the opportunity  to speak here. I will just speak off-the-cuff. My staff wrote me a  speech, but I have only 30 seconds to get this done.   Mr. Speaker, let me tell you what farmers across my district say.  They say that if you can get the Federal Government to relieve the  regulatory burden and open up markets, we can farm in this country. We  can succeed.   Mother Nature is a treacherous business partner, and so the Federal  Government needs to do all that it can to  [[Page H10124]]  make sure that we are mitigating those uncertainties inflicted by  Mother Nature that we have seen across the country this year, certainly  in my district and other parts of the country.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to lend my support to this effort.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Conaway for his exemplary leadership.  To all those who supported this effort on the House and Senate side, I  thank them so much.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the underlying bill.
