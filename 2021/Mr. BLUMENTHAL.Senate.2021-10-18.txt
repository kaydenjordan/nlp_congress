 Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart  to pay tribute to Alan Kalter, a warm, generous man and friend to many.  Alan passed away on October 4, 2021, at the age of 78.   Alan was born in 1943 in Brooklyn, NY. He graduated from what was  then Hobart College in 1964, after which he attended the New York  University School of Law. His radio work began while he was still an  undergraduate, when he served as an announcer for WGVA in Geneva, NY.   While working as a high school English teacher, Alan furthered his  passion for the radio through weekend gigs. Three years later, he was  hired at WHN Radio in New York, where he was a newsman for 4 years.  Following this, Alan transitioned into commercials and then game shows.  His work as an announcer earned him acclaim, and his voice was  recognizable to people across the country.   In 1995, Alan joined the Late Show with David Letterman, following  the retirement of Bill Wendell. A dynamic addition who was known for  his open-minded willingness to try any stunt or suggestion, Alan  quickly became beloved by staff and audience members alike. He was  known for his calming, affable presence and the enthusiasm with which  he approached every task before him.   When not on air, Alan lived quietly in Stamford, CT, where he resided  for over four decades. I had the distinct privilege of having Alan as a  friend, and I can attest firsthand to his caring and compassion.   Alan's great humor and thoughtful spirit touched countless lives. He  brightened the days of both friends and strangers without a second  thought. Alan was also guided by his deeply rooted values and dedicated  himself to giving back to his community.   My wife, Cynthia, and I extend our deepest sympathies to Alan's  family during this difficult time, especially his wife, Peggy, his two  daughters, and his five grandchildren. May their many wonderful  memories of Alan provide them solace and comfort in the days  ahead.                            ____________________
