 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment would prohibit funds for  implementing the social cost of carbon rule.   Congress and the American people have repeatedly rejected cap-and- trade proposals. The Obama administration continuously used social cost  of carbon models, which can easily be manipulated in order to attempt  to justify new job-killing regulations.   I believe in efficiently using the Nation's vast energy resources  while protecting the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land  we live on.   The House has a clear, strong record of opposition to the social cost  of carbon, voting at least 12 times to block, defund, or oppose the  proposal. A carbon tax would inevitably be passed along to consumers,  undermining the success of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we passed last  Congress.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, there is a lot to unpack there, and we can  debate that all day, especially when you start bringing the farmers  into it, because you are looking at one. I don't have to be with them  because I am one of them, and I am from the Midwest.   But when you start saying that everything is the fault and everything  is to blame because of climate change, it has been changing for quite  some time, and we could go ahead and talk about that, too. However, I  am not going to change her mind, so we are going to agree to disagree.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
