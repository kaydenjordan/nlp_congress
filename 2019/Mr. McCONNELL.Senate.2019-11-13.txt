 Mr. President, after we confirm Chad Wolf to serve in  a senior position at the Department of Homeland Security, the Senate  will turn to President Trump's nominee to serve on the Second Circuit  Court of Appeals.   Steven Menashi's nomination continues an already distinguished career  studying, teaching, and practicing law. After earning degrees from  Dartmouth and Stanford, he clerked for Judge Douglas Ginsburg on the DC  Court of Appeals and Justice Alito on the Supreme Court. Mr. Menashi  has held a research fellowship at the New York University School of Law  and taught at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School.   Even the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal  Judiciary, which has lately--lately made headlines for treating  President Trump's nominees in a less-than-evenhanded way, has rated  this nominee ``well-qualified.''   Obviously, a majority of our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee  concurred, and now the entire Senate will have the opportunity to  confirm yet another outstanding jurist to the Federal bench.   I urge each of my colleagues to join me in supporting Steven  Menashi's nomination this week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on another matter, today President  Trump will host the leader of Turkey at the White House. Although I  have expressed concerns about granting President Erdogan such an honor  in light of his recent actions, I hope the meeting produces better  behavior from this important NATO ally.   We recognize Turkey's legitimate national security concerns about the  destabilizing conflict in Syria. Indeed, no NATO ally has suffered more  terrorist attacks or hosts more refugees than Turkey. Nevertheless, we  have legitimate national security concerns of our own, and I know the  vast majority of my colleagues share my concerns about Turkey's recent  behavior.   It is important for the region and the fight against ISIS that  Turkey's incursion into Syria not further jeopardize the anti-terrorism  campaign of the Syrian Democratic Forces. It is important for Turkey's  80 million people that Turkey's Government moves to restore its  democratic traditions--freedom of the press, religious freedom, respect  for secularism and ethnic minorities, and a robust space for civil  society. Despite the optimism from the  [[Page S6516]]  Obama administration and others that Turkey, under President Erdogan,  would be a model democracy, in practice, these important values have  suffered under his tenure.   As the Turkish people's concern continues growing, it is troubling  that the political space for them to express those concerns has seemed  to shrink further. At the same time, the United States must recognize  that the path to addressing our concerns involves working with this  important NATO ally and aligning its interests with ours.   Turning a cold shoulder altogether would be a major strategic misstep  and would jeopardize our national security and our interests. We do not  need Turkey to fall further into Moscow's orbit. I know my colleagues  are looking to see whether a deal can be reached on the S-400 air  defense system.   I share my colleagues' uneasiness at seeing President Erdogan honored  down at the White House, but I urge this body to remain clear-eyed  about our Nation's vital interests in the Middle East and the fact that  advancing them will mean strengthening our relationship with this NATO  ally, not weakening it further.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, today, almost 3  years in the House Democrats' quest to impeach the President and 7  weeks into the inquiry that Speaker Pelosi proclaimed in a press  conference, House Democrats will hold their first public hearing on  impeachment.   This hearing was mandated by the strange resolution House Democrats  passed a couple of weeks ago. That resolution did not provide President  Trump with important rights, which the House afforded to Presidents of  both parties during past impeachment inquiries. It didn't even afford  their own House Republican colleagues the same rights that House  Republicans gave Democrats during the Clinton inquiry. No; House  Democrats' resolution just codified their unfair approach: no due  process now, maybe some later, but only if we feel like it. That is  what it establishes.   The American people know that many Washington Democrats have had  their minds made up on impeachment for years. It was clear on election  day 2016, and it became undeniable by Inauguration Day. That is when  the Washington Post, before he was sworn in, ran this headline: ``The  Campaign to Impeach President Trump has Begun.''   The whole country saw a prominent House Democrat state publicly in  April of 2017: ``I'm going to fight every day until he's impeached.''  That is the chairwoman of one of the committees the Speaker has given  responsibility for this inquiry, promising impeachment 3 months into  his Presidency.   It is hardly surprising that this partisan journey is not yielding a  neutral process. Unfortunately, it is also crowding out important  legislation for the American people. In the House, Speaker Pelosi is  more interested in taking away President Trump's job than in creating  176,000 new jobs for American workers by passing the USMCA. She is  blocking this landmark trade agreement.   In the Senate, our Democratic colleagues have filibustered the  funding of our Armed Forces. Despite promising to forgo the poison  pills a few months back, Democratic leadership has run the  appropriations process aground so they can fight over immigration  policy with the White House.   Speaking of our Armed Forces, House Democrats are also slow-walking  the National Defense Authorization Act. That is an essential bill that  Congress has passed every year--every year since 1961 like clockwork-- every year, on a bipartisan basis, for almost six decades, but this  year House Democrats broke with precedent and passed their own partisan  version and are now stalling the conference committee. These are the  priorities that are languishing as impeachment marches on.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk that is due for a second reading.
