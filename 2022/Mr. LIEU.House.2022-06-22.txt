Keep Government Out of Your Doctor's Office     Madam Speaker, abortion is a highly and deeply personal  decision.   It is very complicated. You have dramatic effects for the family, for  the woman. It can have health effects.   Some pregnancies are fine in the first month, and then they are not  fine in the fourth month for medical reasons.   Some pregnancies are the result of rape or incest.   Some religions support abortion. Some religions oppose abortion.   This is a very complicated issue, very personal, and it is exactly  the wrong issue for government.   Republicans want to criminalize abortion. Keep government out of your  doctor's office.   Democrats support Roe v. Wade. I urge the American people that if  they want to have Roe v. Wade upheld, they cast their vote at the  ballot box this November.                          Democrats' Accomplishments     Madam Speaker, under the American Rescue Plan, we created  jobs, we got vaccines into people's arms, we reopened schools, and we  helped get the economy back on track.   In the first 15 months of the Biden Presidency, over 8.5 million jobs  were created, the most in American history.   Democrats are for the people, and we put people over politics.   We also passed an infrastructure law that is going to rebuild roads,  bridges, and highways, get lead out of water, and put broadband  everywhere, from rural areas to inner cities to everywhere in between.   What are Republicans doing? I don't know, but I know a number of  Republican Members of Congress sought a pardon from the White House for  inciting an insurrection.                       National Foster Youth Shadow Day     Madam Speaker, today is one of my favorite days in Congress  because it is National Foster Youth Shadow Day.   I have a foster youth shadowing me. His name is Joseph Mariscal. He  just graduated from community college, and now he is going to go to Cal  State LA. He is watching how Congress works.   He has overcome so many obstacles, and because of the amazing things  he has done to overcome his obstacles, I am confident he can do  anything he wants in his future.   I thank Karen Bass and other members of the National Foster Youth  Institute for all they do for our foster youth and for having this  shadow day today.                            ____________________
