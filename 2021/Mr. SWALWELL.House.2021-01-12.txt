 On January 6th, Donald Trump incited radicalized  terrorists to attack the Capitol to stop the counting of electoral  ballots. Donald Trump won't protect life and cannot uphold our  Constitution, so we must do so today.   It is time for our country to unite, but unity in a national crisis  starts with accountability, and that starts here in the people's House.  So let's unite against the violence incited by Donald Trump to stop a  peaceful transition of power, and unite for the safety of all  Americans. Let's unite against a President whose hate speech led to the  death of a law enforcement officer, and unite for the cops, the  military who bravely defended the Capitol. Let's unite against Donald  Trump, who inspired terrorists to carry a Confederate flag into this  Capitol, display a noose, and desecrate the people's House. And let's  unite for the custodial staff, largely people of color, who cleaned up  after those White supremacists, because they still believe in this  democracy, as imperfect as it was that day.   The most essential function of a President is to protect life and  defend liberty. Donald Trump has failed to do that and is failing to do  that. So Vice President Pence must invoke the 25th Amendment.
