 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   In the 2 years that I have been here, every motion to recommit has  been a poison pill, a gimmick designed to tank a bill or sow division  between Members of Congress and their constituents.   Despite high-flung rhetoric here today, not once have I seen the MTR  used to make legislation better. In fact, on those occasions when it  prevailed, our colleagues voted against the underlying bill.   Since this legislative tool has not been used in good faith, it needs  to be reformed.   But I also wish to speak in favor of the efforts that have been made  to use gender-neutral language in the rules. As a female Member of  Congress and a member of last term's Select Committee to Modernize  Congress, I applaud the efforts to drag the rules package into the 21st  century and make it more inclusive, as well as to make it streamlined.  The text changes have allowed us to make the rules package more  concise, and that is a good thing.
