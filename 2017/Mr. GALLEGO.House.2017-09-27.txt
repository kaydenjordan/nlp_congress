 Mr. Speaker, President Trump's decision to end DACA was  one of the most callous and cruel acts of his Presidency so far--and  that is saying something.   Mr. Speaker, ending the DACA program means betraying our Nation's  promise to protect 800,000 young people who are in America right now  and American in every way except on paper, including many thousands who  have served in the military. It means exposing them to deportation from  the only home they have ever known and robbing our Nation of their  exceptional talent, work ethic, and patriotism.   We cannot allow this President to play politics with so many young  lives. Congress must pass the Dream Act now and as soon as possible to  protect these outstanding young people, offer them the chance to become  citizens, and empower them to give back to the country they know and  love.   Vote ``no'' on the previous question so that we can end this  Republican obstructionism and bring this critical bill to the floor.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are, once again, reminded to refrain  from engaging in personalities toward the President of the United  States.
