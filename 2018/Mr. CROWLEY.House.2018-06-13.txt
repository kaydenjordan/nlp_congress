 Mr. Speaker, the Trump administration and its attacks on  families seeking asylum are in full force.   The Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, just announced this week that  victims of domestic violence and gang violence will no longer qualify  for asylum here in the United States. Victims of domestic violence and  victims of gang violence will no longer be eligible for asylum, refuge,  here in the United States.   This isn't about going after the perpetrators. What the Attorney  General is doing is targeting the victims--not the perpetrators, but  the victims--of domestic violence and of gang violence. Meanwhile, the  administration continues to engage in the sickening policy of taking  children, babies, away from their mothers and their fathers, just like  this woman from Guatemala.   Mr. Speaker, this is an ugly hour for our Nation, uglier than we have  seen in a very, very long time. As a father myself, my heart aches when  I hear the stories of toddlers screaming for their parents who are  sitting in a cell within earshot. If that isn't psychological torture,  I don't know what is.   The stories my colleagues have recounted from the visits to detention  centers are simply gut-wrenching. Any one of my Republican colleagues  who supports these abominable policies should be ashamed.   Put yourself in the shoes of these people. They have just ventured  hundreds, if not thousands, of miles to save their lives and to save  the lives of their children. They have left everything they have known  behind; every person they have left behind because it is no longer safe  to stay there.   They arrive in the world's greatest nation seeking refuge and asylum  and turn to American authorities, willingly, and apply for that asylum.  And what happens? Their children are ripped from their arms screaming  and crying, all because they tried to save their children from a  treacherous fate.   The Republican Party used to stand for and talk a lot about family  values. Republicans of all stripes would tout it over and over again:  family values, family values, family values.   There is no value in ripping a child from the arms of their mother.  It is inhumane.   There is no value in keeping children alone in a steel cage without  the love of their family. It is cruel.   There is no value in traumatizing children who cannot fend for  themselves. It is torture.   My colleagues, America is asking, the world is asking: Where are your  family values now? Where is your outrage? Where is your compassion?  Where is your courage?   They don't need to do this to these families.   And don't let them fool you: the law does not require this, not one  bit. This is a choice that is being made by President Trump--not the  law, a choice--and it must stop. America must be on the side of  children and families. America must remain a safe haven for those  seeking safety and refuge.   Last week, 10 of my colleagues and I sent a letter to the Department  of Homeland Security and other agencies on this reprehensible action.  We called on them to cease and desist with their so-called zero- tolerance policy and reunite separated parents and mothers with their  children.   We made very clear that we expected an immediate response; and  surprise, we have gotten no response. They have offered no response to  how cruel they are being, no response to the harm that they are causing  to these children.   So I will stand in solidarity with these families. I will stand in  solidarity with those fleeing violence and seeking asylum. I will stand  up and I will shout out against these agencies until they recognize  that these practices are unacceptable.   Democrats will keep fighting until the disgusting practice of taking  children away from their mothers ends.                            ____________________
