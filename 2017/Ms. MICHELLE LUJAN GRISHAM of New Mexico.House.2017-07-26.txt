 I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment  ensures that NNSA has adequate work space to fulfil its national  security mission. In my home State of New Mexico, over 1,000 Federal  and contract employees at NNSA currently work in a network of old and  rapidly deteriorating facilities on Kirtland Air Force Base in New  Mexico.   A portion of the existing facility includes a 60-year-old former  military barracks, which creates a number of health, safety, and  quality-of-life issues for its employees. These employees are involved  in some of our Nation's most important national security work,  including managing our Nation's nuclear deterrent and reducing global  nuclear and radiological threats.   The NNSA administrator, Lieutenant General Klotz, said that:         The highly talented employees in Albuquerque are frankly       forced to work in facilities that are inadequate to NNSA's       current mission.    Furthermore, because of the age of the buildings, NNSA is forced to  spend approximately $6 million every year on maintenance and repairs  just to keep them habitable.   In fact, the $40 million worth of deferred maintenance alone on the  old buildings is approximately one-fifth of what it would cost to build  a new, modern, and reliable facility. So this is a perfect opportunity  to save money in the long run.   I strongly support NNSA's efforts to replace the existing complex  with a single new building that will provide  [[Page H6441]]  safe, reliable, and sustainable infrastructure that improves the safety  and working environment for approximately 1,200 employees.   The new state-of-the-art facility will meet enhanced environmental  standards and consolidate staff for a more efficient delivery and  support of the important national security work at NNSA.                                time  2130    The current total project cost is $202 million, and I agree with  Chairman Simpson that we have an obligation to ensure that every single  taxpayer dollar for this project is used efficiently and effectively.   I know that the chairman shares my concerns to ensure that NNSA has  the infrastructure and resources it needs to fulfill its national  security mission now and in the future. That is why I am pleased that  he has agreed to work with me on this issue to ensure that we are  fulfilling our oversight responsibilities while moving the construction  of the Albuquerque complex project forward.   With that, I am prepared to withdraw my amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate  the chairman's words and respect his work prior to this and in this  current effort to get this space and the facility infrastructure issues  addressed. I look forward to working with him on a variety of ideas to  make sure that we get this project completed in a timely and effective  manner.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time, and I withdraw my  amendment.
