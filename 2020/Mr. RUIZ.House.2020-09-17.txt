 Mr. Speaker, nearly 200,000 Americans have tragically died  from COVID-19 in the United States. In Riverside County, California,  1,136 have died and 56,201 people have been infected.   We have record-breaking unemployment in our Nation, with 13.7 percent  unemployment in Riverside County.   They are our family, our neighbors, our friends. My constituents are  struggling, and they urgently need relief. The Senate must get their  act together. Their delay in stalling is a shame, and to make matters  worse, their skinny-aid excuse of a proposal is much worse than a day  late and a dollar short.   In fact, it has been 125 days since the House passed the HEROES Act.  They must meet the HEROES Act at least halfway to provide another round  of stimulus checks, extend unemployment benefits, small business  support, and money for local and State governments to pay for essential  services, like for police, firefighters, and teachers.   The Senate must act. The Senate must step up and bring this  legislation for a vote. Meet us halfway to slow the spread and save  lives as quickly and safely as possible. We need the HEROES Act for the  people.                            ____________________
