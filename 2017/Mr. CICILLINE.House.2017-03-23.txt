 Mr. Speaker, we have heard this legislation described  as a rescue mission and an act of mercy. Don't insult the intelligence  of the American people. This bill is the cruelest and most immoral  piece of legislation I have seen since I arrived in Congress. It will  rip insurance from 24 million hardworking Americans, including 60,000  Rhode Islanders. It will put $600 billion in tax breaks into the hands  of the powerful, wealthy special interests.   This is not a healthcare bill. This is a tax-cut bill. Let's call it  what it is. It is going to produce higher costs, higher premiums, and  more out-of-pocket expenses. It imposes a crushing age tax on older  Americans. It ransacks funds that seniors rely on for long-term care,  and it will destroy nearly 2 million jobs.   All of this harm to the American people, to settle a political score,  and to reward your friends and wealthy special interests. Shame on  President Trump and shame on the Republican Party for doing this to the  American people.
