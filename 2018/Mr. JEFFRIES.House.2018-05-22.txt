 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Goodlatte as well as  several distinguished members of the Judiciary Committee--in  particular, Cedric Richmond and Karen Bass--for their leadership on  this issue and, of course, my good friend Doug Collins for being a  phenomenal champion of improving the lives of currently incarcerated  individuals, folks who have no time for political games.   These are individuals who are in the system right now without hope,  without opportunity, without a meaningful chance at transforming  themselves. And the FIRST STEP Act will provide that.   It will give them an opportunity to get educated now, give them an  opportunity to get vocational training now, a GED now, a college  education now, give them the opportunity to deal with their substance  abuse problem now, mental health counseling now. Why would we possibly  refuse that?   These individuals are amongst the least, the lost, and the left  behind. And we have an opportunity, in a bipartisan way, to make a  difference in their lives in so many areas. Any objective reading of  this bill is that it will improve their quality of life.   And what is so wonderful about this is that you have the right and  the left, conservatives and progressives, united in this effort.   Nothing meaningful is ever easy, but the mass incarceration epidemic  has been with us for almost 50 years. You will not just take one  legislative magic wand and wipe it away in one shot. It will require  sustained effort, sustained intensity, sustained commitment, and a  meaningful first step. That is what this bill represents.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this effort to  transform lives, save taxpayer dollars, and dramatically reduce  recidivism now.
