 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Chris  Walsh, who tragically lost his long fight against cancer on January 24,  2022. Chris was a dear friend to all, a devoted husband, a father to  two beautiful young girls, a Cal State Fullerton graduate, and  hardworking public servant who served the 74th Assembly District of  California in Assemblyman Matt Harper's office, the city of Irvine in  Councilman Mike Carroll's office, and most recently California's 39th  District in my Placentia district office.   While we remain heartbroken that he was taken from us way too soon,  all of us who had the pleasure of knowing him remain inspired by his  courage, persistence, and integrity in the face of the worst adversity.   I first met Chris when he was a young, impressive, and ambitious  young man interning at the office of Congressman Ed Royce, who I was  working for at the time. At the age of 25, he found out that he was  diagnosed with a terminal cancer and was told by doctors that perhaps  he would maybe have only 2 months to live.   This is daunting news for anyone to hear. However, instead of letting  this change the course of his life, he took charge and defied the odds  over the next several years, having a productive career, meeting his  beautiful wife, Amanda, and having two girls.   Chris was gracious to everyone and lit up every room with his  kindness, sense of humor, and charisma. He was always willing to pitch  in and help out our team, his friends, and loved ones. He made all of  us work harder and brought out the best versions of each of us every  day. Without Chris, I would not be here in Congress nor would I be the  person that I am today.   Chris would often spend his evenings after work cheering on our  Anaheim Angels, and I am comforted in knowing that his loved ones,  including his wife, Amanda, and daughters, Amelia and Madeline, will  have their guardian angel watching over and protecting them.   Amanda, you know that Chris loved you with all his heart, mind, and  soul until he took his last breath. You were the light of his life, and  he enjoyed talking about you and your beautiful two girls that you  created together. You were his everything, and I want to thank you for  loving him the way you did, giving him unconditional love.   Crystal and Mike, as a parent and mom, I feel your pain and the  sadness of losing a son. And to Katherine, I am sorry that you lost the  only sibling that you had. I want you to know that Chris was not just  someone who worked for me. I, too, loved him like my own son.   Crystal, I remember you telling me that minutes after Chris passed  how you were holding his hand and praying to God to show you some signs  that he would be fine, and you thought you saw Chris smile. Yes, I  believe that was a true sign that Chris was smiling because he has  arrived at the gate of Heaven, and he is now resting comfortably in the  arms of Jesus.   My heart remains with the Walsh family, friends, and relatives as we  continue to mourn a life that was taken from us too soon. We are  grateful for the positive influence that Chris had on so many of us  while he lived a full and productive life.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to join my  community in celebrating Lunar New Year.   Madam Speaker, 2022 is the year of the Tiger, which represents,  strength, passion, bravery, and courage. These are qualities we have  seen in our communities every day.   While this past year brought new challenges, I know through the  strength and drive of the Tiger, we will face these challenges head-on.  And as someone who was born in the year of the Tiger and as a proud  Tiger mom, my hope is to embody this courage and persistence every day  as I fight for communities to receive the proper services and support  that we need to come back stronger than ever.   In Congress, I will continue to promote policies to help Americans  succeed and achieve their dream.   Happy New Year.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my  esteemed colleague from Minnesota for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule and the  underlying legislation, the so-called America COMPETES Act.   I have worked tirelessly with my colleagues to produce thoughtful,  bipartisan STEM bills that could have been considered through a  committee conference tomorrow. Instead of working on a comprehensive  and bipartisan strategy to counter the CCP, Speaker Pelosi released a  bill that was written behind closed doors less than a week ago that is  nearly 3,000 pages and mentions, as you have heard over and over from  my colleagues, the words ``coral reefs'' more than the word ``China.''   The bill also puts $8 billion in a U.N. climate slush fund that we  have zero oversight over and that China has already taken $100 million  from.    The CCP's goal is to become the world's top economic superpower by  the year 2025 and has made clear that their goal is to surpass the  United States in science and technology. The reality is that they are  winning. They are outspending us on research and development. They are  producing more STEM graduates than us. And by 2025, they will graduate  twice as many STEM Ph.D.s as we do.   The way to ensure future United States leadership and counter China  is by working together, not by ramming partisan bills through Congress.   The CCP is watching us. Speaker Pelosi's concedes act plays right  into our adversaries' hands.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.
