 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Republicans just passed the largest tax  reform package in 30-something years, and middle America will go home  in February with bigger paychecks than they did--I say in February  because it will not take that long for the IRS to update their  software. They will go home with more money in their pockets.   If there has been a theme in the Trump administration, it is that  they want those working Americans, those middle-class Americans, to do  better under this President than they did in the previous 8 years. That  tax reform package is part of that, and I am amazed that my Democratic  colleagues objected to it. They objected to middle-class Americans  having more money in their pockets, in their take-home pay, for no  other reason, I think, than to resist President Trump.
