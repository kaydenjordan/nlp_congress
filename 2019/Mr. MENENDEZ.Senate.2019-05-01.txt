 Mr. President, freedom of the press is a fundamental  human right, a foundational pillar of democracy, and an indispensable  check on authoritarian overreach. Today, press freedom is under assault  across the globe--including in the United States. As journalists fight  to advance truth and objectivity, far too many governments and non- state actors are targeting them, seeking to thwart their efforts to  promote transparency and accountability and expose abuses of power.  Their focus on attacking journalists indeed serves to highlight their  critical work.   Since 2009, 659 journalists and media workers have been killed in  connection with their efforts to report and disseminate news and  information. Stories of abuses of government power, of human suffering,  of environmental disasters, and stories of the remarkable resilience of  people abused and oppressed. 2018 marked the worst year on record for  deadly violence and abuse toward journalists, with murders,  imprisonment, hostage-taking, and enforced disappearances all on the  rise.   Slovak journalist Jan Kuciak and his partner Martina Kusnirova were  gunned down in their home after investigating organized crime in his  country and in alleged retaliation for his reporting of tax fraud on a  businessman with close ties to Slovakia's ruling party, a stark  reminder of the danger reporters sometimes face when investigating  corruption at the highest levels.   Just over a year ago, in the deadliest day for Afghanistan's media  since the start of the war, nine journalists were killed in a second- wave suicide bombing in Kabul, and another was shot dead in the eastern  city of Khost, a sign of the constant threat against the fundamental  elements of a free, secure, and democratic Afghanistan.   Last October, at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul, Washington  Post columnist and U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi was brutally murdered  by a group of Saudi operatives at the behest of Crown Prince Mohammed  bin Salman, showing the reach of political oppression and the silencing  of dissent.   In many cases, crimes carried out against the media go unpunished-- this includes murder, the ultimate form of censorship. According to the  Committee to Protect Journalists, in nine out of 10 cases where a  journalist has been targeted for murder, the perpetrator goes free,  reflecting widespread impunity in this space.   In 2018, across the world 251 journalists remained imprisoned on  charges related to their reporting. Last month, Burma's Supreme Court  upheld the conviction and prison sentence of Pulitzer Prize-winning  reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who were arrested after exposing the  massacre of ten Rohingya men in a village in Rakhine State. In  Nicaragua, Miguel Mora and Lucia Pineda Ubau, directors of the  country's only 24-hour cable news network, were jailed on charges of  fomenting hate, spreading fake news, and terrorism, falling victim to  President Daniel Ortega's widespread crackdown on dissent and freedom  of expression. While in different countries, these ongoing  imprisonments are in countries with degrading records on human rights  and fundamental freedoms more broadly.   In the last year, governments have ramped up similar attempts to  silence the press in places like Turkey and the Philippines. Beyond  threats to journalists themselves, governments across the world from  Poland to Sudan continue to pursue legislative efforts to restrict  media freedom and free expression, ultimately weakening the ability of  citizens to hold their governments accountable. In Bangladesh,  photojournalist and human rights advocate Shahidul Alam faced torture  and spent 107 days in prison for violating a law that forbids criticism  of the government on digital platforms in his native Bangladesh. One of  several journalists who were named Time's Person of the Year in 2018  for being one of ``the guardians'' in the face of the ``war on truth,''  he expressed, ``The world over, journalism is under threat. Whether  you're a teacher, a dancer, a painter, or a journalist, each one of us  needs to be constantly fighting.''   But the threat to press freedom isn't limited to foreign lands--it is  something we've had to increasingly contend with here at home in the  United States. President Trump continues to employ dangerous rhetoric  in targeting the media, referring to the free press as the ``enemy of  the people,'' and fostering an environment of hostility toward  journalists. Moreover, he refuses to hold autocratic world leaders  accountable as they attack press freedom in brazen ways, including  targeting American journalists in places like Egypt. This only adds to  the deterioration in free expression throughout the world. As a recent  report from Reporters Without Borders highlights, ``The number of  countries regarded as safe, where journalists can work in complete  security, continues to decline, while authoritarian regimes continue to  tighten their grip on the media.''  [[Page S2575]]    In spite of the unprecedented assault on the free press, journalists  continue to take significant risks in the pursuit of truth and  transparency. Journalists from Radio Free Asia have relentlessly  covered the Chinese government's gross human rights abuses against the  country's Uyghur minority, including mass internment and surveillance  in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR). If not for the work of  these courageous reporters--many of whom are Uyghurs themselves, having  to report on abuses exacted against their families and friends--Chinese  authorities would be able to commit such abuses largely in secrecy.  Instead, those who champion human rights will be able to use the  reporting in order to hold this repressive government to account.   Over 200 years ago, our Founding Fathers had the foresight to  recognize the importance of a free press to a fledgling democracy,  enshrining it in our first amendment. Today, that importance cannot be  overstated. Recognizing that societies where informed citizens can hold  their governments accountable are more stable, secure, and prosperous,  we have a responsibility to stand up for the fundamental right of free  expression and free press. I join the international community in  honoring and defending freedom of expression and the brave journalists  seeking to tell a story that deserves to be told. In fact, the very  fact the repressive governments, autocrats, and thugs continue to  attack journalists is a tragic testament to the critical work they do.  Just yesterday, the Maduro government in Venezuela took CNN off the air  while the network was broadcasting live video of protestors being run  over by military vehicles in Caracas, a transparent attempt by a  criminal regime to silence journalists telling the story of brave  Venezuelans standing up for their democratic aspirations.   This week, I introduced a resolution commemorating World Press  Freedom Day. The resolution highlights increasing threats to freedoms  of the press and expression worldwide, reaffirms the centrality of a  free and independent press to the health of democracy, and reiterates  freedom of the press as a priority of the United States in promoting  democracy, human rights, and good governance. On this World Press  Freedom Day, I call on the Trump administration to reverse course and  recommit to advancing press freedom--both at home and abroad.''                            ____________________
