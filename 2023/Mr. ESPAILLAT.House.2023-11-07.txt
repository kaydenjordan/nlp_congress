 Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank President Joe Biden for  the investment of $1.2 trillion--that is right, Mr. Speaker--trillion  with a t, of the Bipartisan Infrastructure and Jobs Act.   We hear a lot of noise from the other side every single day, but when  we see those shovels going in the ground and when we see those major  projects coming forward across the Nation, those same Members that are  making noise on the other side of the aisle will show up to the ribbon- cutting, Mr. Speaker, and some of them may be there to take credit for  the project.   The biggest investment in the history of our Nation with regard to  infrastructure and jobs. It is not just infrastructure; it is an  economic development machine that will generate hundreds of thousands,  if not millions, of jobs across our Nation.   I thank our President for his investment in our Nation, and  particularly in the 13th Congressional District, which is an iconic  district that has Harlem; East Harlem, also known as El Barrio;  Washington Heights--yeah, some of you may have seen the movie ``In the  Heights''--Inwood; and the Northwest Bronx. The second phase of the  Second Avenue subway just kicked off this past weekend.   Mr. Speaker, I thank our Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg,  for coming to our district to kick off the second phase of the Second  Avenue subway right in East Harlem. This phase is such an important  phase for a community that has for far too long been subjected to a  transportation desert.   On Saturday, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Transit  Administration stood hand in hand with East Harlem leaders to sign off  on a $3.4 billion Full Funding Grant Agreement.                                time  1015    This was part of the capital investment grant program that received  [[Page H5471]]  record funding under the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs  Act. I thank the Secretary for coming to my district.   The funding will help support a 1.8-mile extension of the Q line.  Some people seem to think that America cannot build a subway anymore.  Yes, we can. Yes, we can when we put people over politics.   This new initiative on the East Side of Manhattan will connect the Q  line from 96th Street to 125th Street to Harlem and will relieve an  over-crowded Lexington Avenue line which is the most overcrowded line  in the Nation, if not the world. It will transport over 200,000 riders  on a daily basis in the most heavily used transit corridor in America.   Saturday marked the start of a vibrant economic future for families  across East Harlem, and we worked with the Charles B. Rangel  Infrastructure Workforce Initiative at City College that Congressman  Rangel and I have been working on to ensure that we train those young  people in our communities so they can have access to prevailing wage  jobs.   This project is also called Uptown Grand Central. As you can see, Mr.  Speaker, we will have a transportation hub that will connect Harlem to  the rest of the world. You can see the lines here that will go from  125th Street to 96th Street.   Now, the first phase went uptown right through the Silk Stocking  District, the richest ZIP Codes in the country. Maybe they weren't too  open about the jobs, but we are laser focused on making sure that the  second phase creates thousands of jobs.   The first phase created 16,000 jobs and generated $142 million in  wages and produced $2.87 billion in economic activity during the  construction. This second phase will lift that district, East Harlem,  not only producing jobs but injecting oxygen to our economy.   Yes, we can when we put people over politics.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to be here to tell you that this project will  connect Harlem to the rest of the world. It will connect the Second  Avenue Subway to the Metro-North line and 14 counties outside of New  York City.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here to say we have a bright future.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Dyckman  basketball, the red carpet of streetball.   In my district, basketball is everything to Dyckman. It is the  opportunity to connect with friends and neighbors in fellowship and  celebration of the vibrancy of our community.   During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a halt in the 30-year  tradition of the Dyckman summer basketball tournament, but I am here to  tell you that Dyckman is back.   Featured in the sports documentary ``Dyckman: The Comeback,'' the  incredible team of Dyckman sports worldwide, CEO Ken Stevens and Sharon  Bond, or Ms. B as she is known throughout the community, have poured a  tremendous amount of love into the sport.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate them on their Emmy award-winning  documentary, and I congratulate the dedicated Dyckman team.   Dyckman basketball is back.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the lack of  resources for safe and affordable housing in the Transportation,  Housing, and Urban Development funding bill.   Sadly, it does nothing to address the significant housing and  community development needs of our constituents.   Across the country, Madam Speaker, more Americans than ever are cost  burdened with the price of rent. Parents are worried about whether they  can keep a roof over their families' head. Frankly, Madam Speaker, the  rent is too damn high.   This bill rescinds $560 million from accounts that would address the  current harmful conditions of the housing that residents currently  face.   The New York City Housing Authority has revealed that over the next 5  years, to address the current and future capital needs, the agency will  need $60 billion. These needs will only continue to compound.   Instead of helping make these investments, the bill funds the public  housing fund at a $150 million below last year's fiscal budget.   Americans deserve to live in safe, reliable, and dignified housing,  Madam Speaker. The bill does nothing, absolutely nothing, to accomplish  this, and I urge my colleagues to vote against its final passage.
