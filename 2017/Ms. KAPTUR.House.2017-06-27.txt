 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as co-chair of the Ukrainian  Caucus, and I will include in the Record an article reporting on an act  of violence that has taken place in Ukraine.   Yesterday, a bomb exploded in the car of a high-ranking Ukrainian  special forces official, Colonel Maksim Shapoval, in Kiev, in what  Ukrainian authorities are calling an act of terrorism.   Shapoval's heroic unit fought in eastern Ukraine, where a conflict  between Ukraine and Russia has been raging since 2014, with mainly  citizens being  [[Page H5220]]  killed, over 10,000 innocents in that country.   Shapoval's death comes almost a year after prominent Ukraine  journalist Pavel Sheremet was killed by a similar explosion in Kiev as  he drove to work. No one has been brought to justice in that murder  case.   A number of other public figures have also been killed under shady  circumstances in and around Kiev in recent years.   Denis Voronerkov, a former Russian member of Parliament who fled to  Ukraine, was shot dead in central Kiev in March 2017.   Lawyer Yuri Grabovsky, who had represented a Russian soldier captured  in Ukraine, was found dead with a gunshot wound in 2016.   This has all the fingerprints of Putin's Russia, who will stop at  nothing to blunt liberty. America must be a friend to liberty and an  enemy to tyranny. I call on this administration to help Ukraine defend  itself against these hostile acts of war against liberty.                     [From theguardian, June 27, 2017]     Ukrainian Military Intelligence Officer Killed by Car Bomb in Kiev                               (By Alec Luhn)         A high-ranking Ukrainian military intelligence official has       been killed by a car bomb in Kiev in what authorities are       calling an act of terrorism.        An explosive device destroyed the Mercedes being driven by       Col Maksim Shapoval at 8.15am local time, police said.        The car's bonnet was blown open and its roof and driver       side door almost completely destroyed, video footage from the       scene showed.        ``The picture of the crime looks like it was a planned act       of terrorism,'' interior ministry spokesman Artem Shevchenko       told local media. The military prosecutor said his office       would lead an investigation.        Police said a female passerby with shrapnel wounds to her       legs received medical treatment after the explosion, as did       an elderly man who suffered shrapnel wounds to his neck.        According to the defence ministry, Shapoval was a colonel       in military intelligence. The Ukrainian Pravda newspaper       quoted law enforcement sources saying he had headed a special       forces unit.        Yury Butusov, editor of the Censor.net news website, said       in a Facebook post that Shapoval's unit had fought in eastern       Ukraine, where a conflict with Russia-backed separatists that       broke out in 2014 has killed more than 10,000 people. He       claimed Russian intelligence could have killed Shapoval.        Shapoval's death comes almost a year after prominent       journalist Pavel Sheremet was killed by a similar explosion       in Kiev as he drove to work. A documentary film released last       month revealed evidence suggesting that Ukraine's spy agency       may have witnessed the planting of the car bomb that killed       Sheremet. No one has been brought to justice in the murder       case.        A number of other public figures have also been       assassinated in and around Kiev in recent years. Denis       Voronenkov, a former Russian MP who fled to Ukraine, was shot       dead in central Kiev in March. Pro-Russian journalist Oles       Buzina was shot in a drive-by in 2015, and lawyer Yuri       Grabovsky, who had represented a Russian soldier captured in       Ukraine, was found dead with a gunshot wound in 2016.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Murphy for his  incredible leadership on this important topic and for holding this  Special Order this evening.   I can tell you, the citizens of the State of Ohio are paying  attention. The opioid epidemic continues to intensify with over 2  million people addicted to prescription opioids and more than half a  million addicted to heroin in 2015, alone.   According to an estimate from The New York Times, drug overdoses are  now the leading cause of death for Americans under 50; and drug  overdoses are the leading cause of accidental death in our country,  with prescription opioids responsible for more than 20,000 deaths in  the United States just in 2015, according to the American Society of  Addiction Medicine.   I have to mention that Medicaid plays an important role in addressing  this epidemic because it is a lifeline program, providing coverage to  over 650,000 non-elderly adults with opioid addiction and covering a  range of treatment services.   Ohio, tragically, leads the Nation in opioid overdoses in 2014.  Sadly, deaths have continued to rise with increased use of heroin and  fentanyl. Many States have expanded Medicaid, including Ohio, to cover  adults who make a modest $16,500 a year per individual. By broadening  coverage of adults, the Medicaid expansion reaches many low-income  adults with opioid addiction who were previously ineligible for  coverage and facilitates access to treatment.   The opioid epidemic is so bad that even librarians are learning how  to treat overdoses for individuals who come into libraries.   Mental health can be comorbid with opioid abuse, and those suffering  from that duality are truly an American tragedy. For an addict to  complete rehab and recovery successfully, they need to work in concert.  And over half of uninsured non-elderly adults with an opioid addiction  had a mental illness in the past year, with over one in five operating  with a serious mental illness, such as depression, bipolar disorder, or  schizophrenia.   To address the gravity of the challenge, I want to put on the Record  the work that Lucas County, my home county, is doing with their DART  program, which engages hospitals, mental health centers, and businesses  in the community.   Believe it or not, according to Sheriff Tharp, the DART program has  helped nearly 2,300 overdose victims and has a 74 percent success rate  of getting people into detox and treatment programs at a total cost of  about $370 per individual. This is truly an amazing record, and I wish  to include in the Record the information about other counties in the  district that I represent.   The opioid epidemic does not just affect the addicted. Lucas County  Children Services is struggling to help children displaced by the  opioid epidemic.   The agency has been repeatedly forced to do the unimaginable tasks of  comforting children as first responders work to save their parents from  a heroin or fentanyl overdoses. On several occasions, it has had to  break the terrible news to these children that their parents succumbed  to their addiction.   LCCS is also coping with a dramatic increase in the number of  children placed in protective custody because their families have been  blinded by substance dependence. The State's current budget proposes no  increase for this program, which is a shame. This is no time to short  change children.   Finally, I submit for the Record a story of the Guest family of  Lorain, Ohio, whose daughter Tera died of a heroin overdose at the age  of 24.   According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer: ``Tera Guest, 24, died Jan.  29, 2014, shortly after she and her sister used painkillers and a  heroin-fentanyl mix. Her death marked the end of a two-year period that  included stints in treatment and losing custody of her two children to  her mother.  [[Page H5228]]    ``Tera is among the hundreds who have died of overdoses within the  last three years in Lorain County. The county coroner's office said a  record 67 people died in 2013, followed by 60 in 2014 and 62 in 2015.''   Lori took her tragedy and turned it into action and formed the Lorain  Community Task Force, which is a group that raises awareness and  provides assistance to addicts and their families.   Lori stepped up, and now Congress must do the same. We cannot turn  our back on these people now. We must fight, we must work together, we  must put politics aside. Only then can we begin to heal our Nation from  this crisis.
