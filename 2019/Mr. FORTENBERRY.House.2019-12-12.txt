 Mr. Chair, I thank both leaders, first of all, for  this debate. This is absolutely critical, and here is why:   The other day, I went to the doctor--a kind of a common ailment. The  doctor prescribed an antibiotic.   I said, ``Doc, let's check the price before we use the credit card.''   He said, ``Don't worry about it. It is going to be about $6. It is  commonly used.''   But guess what? The list price was about $430. It used to be $6 in  2011; now, it is $430.   We have a problem. We have a big problem in America. A very big  Democrat, a very big Republican problem. I want to commend my  Democratic colleagues for raising the issue, for putting this on the  agenda, for making an attempt to propose something. There is strong  disagreement with the nature of the policy proposal, but there ought to  be unification around the idea that we have to do something.   I commend my Republican colleagues for putting together a bill of all  the bipartisan initiatives that are around here that we can agree on.   So what is going to happen is we are going to get stuck again,  really, really quickly. This bill now has a chance of going into law,  the bipartisan bill. There is some opposition to it, and it could be  fleshed out further.   The President has called for negotiations. This is an important part  of all of us. So let's get back to work after we get past this moment.   Mr. Chair, I thank everyone for a spirited and good debate.    Mr. Speaker, I went to the doctor recently for a  common ailment, and he prescribed an antibiotic.   I said, Well, Doc, let's check the price on that before we go any  further. He said, Oh, don't worry about it. It is commonly used  throughout the world. It is about $6.   Well, guess what? It was $6 dollars in the year 2011; and now the  list price is about $430.   Now, I have insurance provided by the House of Representatives, which  I am thankful for, but even with that, it is still close to $200. And  then you have to start searching for a coupon to try to bring it down a  little bit more.   So why does an antibiotic, that just a few years ago cost $6 now cost  over $400 if someone has to pay cash?   Why? Why?   This is one of the premier questions before this body. And we debated  this today in a prescription drug bill, and it was a robust debate and  a good debate. And as I said earlier, I commend my Democrat colleagues  for raising the issue and putting something on the table.   There were substantive policy disagreements with that bill. There is  a realistic fear that if that bill became law, which the President said  he will not sign, that we would undermine America's leading role in  inventing lifesaving drugs. But there are real considerations as to how  to contain costs.                                time  1545    We should be focused on negotiations and government programs.   I also commended my Republican colleagues for having an alternative  answer by coalescing all the bipartisan solutions that are innovative,  that have come from both sides, and putting it together in one package  that presented an alternative. But that didn't pass, either.   So we are stuck. We are right back to where we are.   But I only tell my own personal story not because this is about me.  That is a simple issue, the little problem that I had. Many other  Americans are suffering grievously from this ever-escalating,  skyrocketing prescription drug problem.   Let's just take, for instance, the case of insulin. About 30 million  Americans suffer from diabetes and need insulin.   I want to show you something here. Here is an important chart, Mr.  Speaker. It starts down here in the year 2011. Basically, this is a  chart that shows the price of insulin in 2001, about $35, and here we  are today, approaching $300.   So, what is happening? That is about a 1,000 percent increase. Is  insulin pretty much the same drug? Yes, there have been some  modifications and improvements. There have been. Justifying a 1,000  percent increase? No, absolutely not.   What is going on here? The price of insulin has gone up dramatically,  and there has to be a reason for it. Big pharmaceutical companies and  middle management, responding to bad government policy, have created a  huge mess in this healthcare space.   Not just this problem with insulin, but the average annual cost of a  brand name drug has more than tripled in the past decade. Families with  diabetic children, seniors on Medicare, and others face prohibitively  high costs for these lifesaving drugs, and they deserve better.   I want to show you something else right quick, if I could. This is a  chart of the last 5 years. Going back to the issue of insulin again, 30  million or so Americans need this drug.   This is a difference between what is called the average net price and  the average list price. We have about $400 here 5 years ago. Now, we  are up to almost $600.   But look at this net price. What does that mean? Well, the net price  is the price, basically, that the manufacturer is getting. The middle  sector here, the marketing sector here, is getting a much higher price.   So what is a solution? We didn't come up with a good solution today  in debate on the House floor. So what is a real solution? Well, because  we can't seem to solve the overall problem with one large piece of  legislation, why don't we start with something very small? But it is  not small to people affected by diabetes.   Why don't we just take this particular drug and allow the  manufacturer to sell it directly to the patient? Again, we have an  average price of about $600 and a net price of $135. That huge cost  savings that could be attained by a person in need by simply being able  to pay this price is what I am talking about here.   I have dropped a piece of legislation, and I am really hopeful that  it rallies Republicans and Democrats away from the big construct that  we can't necessarily agree on, but we should continue to work toward,  which involves major structural change. Why don't we do something that  is very, very specific to one group of Americans that is suffering from  exorbitantly high prices?   Basically, now, under this one-line bill, manufacturers would be  allowed to sell insulin directly to a patient. It is just one line.   I am from Nebraska. Many people write to me and ask: Why does  legislation have to be so complicated? Why don't you make it a single  page? I have made this a single line, one line.   What we do when we do this is we begin to cut out these layers upon  layers of management and bureaucracy that have driven the price upward,  while being fair to the manufacturer and without undermining America's  system of innovation that leads the world in producing lifesaving  drugs.   Nonetheless, we have added this problem, or this middle management,  if you will, to the way in which we dispense drug prices. That is part  of the problem of why they have gone up so fast, especially around  drugs like this. Again, not necessarily a brand-new formulary. No  extraordinary innovation has happened over the last number of decades,  some changes, some modifications and improvements, but no way to  justify these price increases.   I think this would be a good idea that actually could unite us, to  get us away from the large philosophical differences when we discuss  how we move forward, ensuring that we both find fair prices and better  cures without undermining the good, innovative, leading industry in the  United States, but an industry that has a real problem, that really  ought to be rallying around solutions that I am suggesting here.   That is just one idea, but I am hopeful it is a start because this  idea actually pulls a thread. It is specific enough to affect tens of  millions of Americans. It would be so beneficial to lower costs, yet  without infringing upon the dynamics of a good market system that we  have.   I think this is an answer. Perhaps, this could be a good start.   Besides this one-line solution, Mr. Speaker, another obvious solution  here should be the acceleration of generic drugs. Drug companies,  however, have a long history of slow-walking generic drug approval  through legal maneuvers, anticompetitive prices, and patent extensions.   I have been given a unique responsibility in helping to lead the  House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development,  Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, which has oversight  responsibility for the Food and Drug Administration. Through our  focused efforts,  [[Page H10236]]  the FDA is reforming the generic approval process.    Cracking down harder on pharmaceutical companies that are exploiting  loopholes to modify patents for not-so-unique drugs is one way to grow  generics. Currently, even a small modification in a drug can be enough  to get it approved by the Patent and Trademark Office.   In 2018, an analysis found that patent protection for 70 percent of  the 100 best-selling drugs was extended at least once. This is a  significant cost driver.   According to the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, when generic  competition exists, prices are often 80 percent to 85 percent less than  brand-name drugs. With 90 percent of generic prescriptions available  for less than $20 for patients with insurance, that translates into  very real savings for families across this country.   The Government Accounting Office says that generics can save the  United States healthcare system--get this--well over $1 trillion in a  10-year window.   We could spend another hour speaking about the financial difficulties  that we are having. We have a good, strong, growing economy. Many  people are finally, thankfully, finding access to meaningful work, and  there is an appropriate upward pressure on wages in this country.   But what erodes that? The escalating cost of healthcare. For people  who are in need of lifesaving drugs, this is fundamentally unfair.   Again, our efforts at trying to move generics faster to market,  identify abuse, and stop it can result in savings like this. This is  huge. This is good public policy, and we are working on it.   Another important piece of legislation allows the pharmacist to tell  a patient about therapeutically equivalent but less costly drugs as an  alternative method that is less expensive. For a small number of  lifesaving but rarely used what we call orphaned drugs, we also need to  prevent single corporations from exploiting a small market niche of  desperate patients who sometimes find themselves in a life-or-death  struggle.   Further, Mr. Speaker, I would suggest this: Getting at another root  cost driver of prescription drugs, we need to change how we procure  drugs in large public programs. Our government, through Medicare,  Medicaid, TRICARE, and other programs, is the largest purchaser of  prescription drugs in the world. The Department of Health and Human  Services, however, is prohibited by law from negotiating with  manufacturers what it pays, but not the Department of Veterans Affairs,  by the way.   There is broad bipartisan consensus in Congress, as well as with the  White House, that this policy needs to change. We should be  negotiating. I should note that was part of the earlier bill submitted  to the floor--again, substantive policy disagreements that could  potentially undermine America's leading role.   But that aspect of this in the Democratic bill that was submitted is  an important public policy initiative. Again, I commend my colleagues  in that regard.   Mr. Speaker, a prescription drug should do two simple things. It  should cure disease, but at a fair price. And as we have seen today,  there were two very large bills debated, but unfortunately, in this  political environment, one is a Democratic bill, and one is a  Republican bill, and no consensus exists.   But after the smoke clears, I hope that reasonable people will make  way and will make a pathway for the right solutions and not political  anger.   This system is sick. Our people deserve better cures at fairer  prices.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
