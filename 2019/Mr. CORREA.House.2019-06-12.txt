 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address this body and demand  the release of one of our constituents, Michael Nguyen, a law-abiding  American citizen with no criminal record in the United States.   He was arrested almost a year ago in Vietnam while visiting his  elderly relatives. He has been held in detention for almost a year.   This unjust imprisonment is due, essentially, to one act, which is  his expression of freedom of speech. He has experienced extreme  hardship, both mentally and physically, while in prison.   It is unacceptable that an American citizen is detained in Vietnam  for almost a year for nothing else than expressing his freedom of  speech. The Socialist Republic of Vietnam has not provided us with any  evidence of wrongdoing that would justify such an arrest. The  government has, instead, confirmed that he is being charged with  violating article 109 of Vietnam's penal code, which is essentially a  catch-all.   What is his crime again? His freedom of speech, expressing his  opposition to government policy.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the Government of Vietnam to release this American  citizen. They are charging him with nothing more than expressing his  freedom of speech.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I am proud to join my colleague from New York (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez) to  support this life-saving amendment. We need legitimate, reliable  research by universities and other institutions into the health  benefits of cannabis and other substances. This amendment will allow  credible research institutions to conduct research by removing layers  of paperwork that serve as hurdles meant to block such research.   As more Americans, including veterans, use cannabis and so-called  magic mushrooms to manage or treat their pain or other health  conditions, it is important that doctors have the necessary information  on the possible benefits or not of these substances.   Our brave men and women who served in Iraq and Afghanistan returned  home with many wounds, many of them invisible. Sadly, the current use  of opioids to treat PTSD and other chronic pains has been effective and  many times has led to addiction and even death.   I have listened to veterans both in California and in my office here  in Washington, D.C., who have called for additional research into  cannabis. According to an Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America  survey, more than 80 percent of their membership agree that cannabis  should be legal for medical purposes, while 90 percent also support  medical cannabis research.   As a result, I introduced a bill to promote cannabis research, the VA  Medical Cannabis Research Act. My bipartisan bill requires clinical  research on the safety and effectiveness of medical cannabis in  treating veterans.   Likewise, this amendment will reduce barriers to research on cannabis  and psychedelics. Since Denver and Oakland have decriminalized the use  of certain psychedelics, this amendment is both timely and very  necessary.   I urge my colleagues to pass this amendment.
