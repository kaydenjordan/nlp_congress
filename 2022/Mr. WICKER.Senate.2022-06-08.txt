 Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I  certainly hope we don't have to prolong this for very long, but I can  report to Members of the Senate that there are Members on this side who  have concerns about this particular nomination. Perhaps those matters  can be resolved in short order. I certainly understand my friend from  Massachusetts and his support for this nominee, and I respect that. In  addition, there are larger issues involving actions and conduct of the  State Department in Europe writ large that go beyond this nominee.  Again, I hope the State Department will work with us on those important  concerns. But for those stated reasons, I do object at this point.
