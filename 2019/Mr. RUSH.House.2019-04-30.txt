 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the staggering  cost of insulin.   A study published last September estimated that manufacturers could  charge between $7 and $11 for insulin and still make a profit. In  reality, Madam Speaker, the list price today is $275 a vial.   This is an unconscionable markup on a critical, lifesaving drug, as  diabetes is the primary cause of death for 85,000 Americans each and  every year.   While insurance covers some of the costs, insulin is, all too often,  unaffordable for the 17,000 Medicare beneficiaries in my district who  depend on it to survive. That is because it can cost a senior on  Medicare living in my hometown over $1,400 a year to pay for their  diabetes medication.   To combat this issue, I introduced the Insulin Access for All Act. My  legislation ensures that Medicare and Medicaid recipients pay nothing  out of pocket for their insulin.   I urge my colleagues to join with me in reducing the cost of insulin  for all Americans.                            ____________________
