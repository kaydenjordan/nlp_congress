 Madam Chair, I rise today in support of the two  amendments included in this en bloc package. The first is to ensure  that the Air Force prioritizes construction of the Weapons Generation  Facility at Barksdale Air Force Base.   The Louisiana congressional delegation and I have continued to push  the Air Force for this project because of its strategic importance to  our Nation's security and nuclear strategy. Millions of Federal dollars  have been invested in projects to prepare for this facility, and last  year, we in Congress prioritized funding for a new gate entrance at  Barksdale.   The Weapons Generation Facility at Barksdale is a national security  imperative. Funding this project cannot wait any longer, and I  encourage the Air Force to prioritize funding for this project.   The second amendment I would like to speak on is to prioritize the  funding of our Army's combat development centers. One of these is the  Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana.   Fort Polk has supported training operations for our Army for decades.  The  [[Page H5015]]  training our soldiers receive at Fort Polk is the best and closest they  will get to combat without actually being deployed. This training is  imperative to readiness and our national security.    We need to do a better job about resourcing the infrastructure needs  of these training centers, and we must prioritize funding for them.   Madam Chair, I want to thank my colleagues for working with  Congressman Johnson and me on these amendments, and I look forward to  seeing them pass.
