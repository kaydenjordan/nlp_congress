 Mr. Speaker, I wish to engage the gentleman from Texas in  a colloquy.   We should not be satisfied with the historically low economic growth  rates of the past decade. This tax reform bill that creates jobs,  increases paychecks, grows our economy, and increases American  competitiveness can help Maryland families and businesses.   The bill we are considering today has many positive elements that  will benefit our country in many ways. However, I am concerned about  its impact on some of my constituents in Maryland who pay high State  and local income taxes. I ask you, as the Ways and Means chairman, to  continue to work with me to ensure that families and job creators in my  district will all be helped by this legislation.    I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for agreeing to work  with me on this as we move forward. I will be voting for this bill  today, and I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill to increase  American competitiveness.
