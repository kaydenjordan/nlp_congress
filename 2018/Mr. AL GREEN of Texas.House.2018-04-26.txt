 Mr. Speaker, once again, I rise because I love  my country.   Mr. Speaker, I rise because I want to thank the President and  compliment the President. I thank the President for indicating this  morning that he will not--N-O-T--will not interfere with the Mueller  investigation. He said as much on national TV. I compliment him for  saying this, Mr. Speaker, because if he does so in contravention of  Article II, section 4 of the Constitution, it would be tantamount to  impeachment.   So, I compliment you, Mr. President, for being forthright, and I  assume you meant what you said. However, you went on to say: ``I may  change my mind.''   Mr. Speaker, I trust that the President meant what he said initially,  and that he will not change his mind. Because, again, to do so in  contravention of Article II, section 4 of the Constitution will be  tantamount to impeachment. The only body in this country that can  litigate impeachment is the Congress of the United States of America.   As a result, Mr. Speaker, I want to assure all--especially the  President--if you do this, Mr. President, I assure you there will be  articles of Impeachment brought before the Congress of the United  States of America.   Now, Mr. President, I am in no rush to do this. As a matter of fact,  I don't enjoy using the personal pronoun when it comes to this kind of  dialogue--monologue, in this case, as I am talking directly to you.  But, Mr. President, if no one else does, I will. I will not allow the  Constitution to be ignored and, to a certain extent, trampled upon. I  will bring the Articles of Impeachment. As a matter of fact, I have  instructed my staff to draft them. They will be ready to go.   I also have instructed my staff to tweet this message that if you do  so, Mr. President, if you interfere in contravention of Article II,  section 4, I will bring the Articles of Impeachment.
