 Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize Marty Reiser, a  man of immense character and integrity who selflessly served the  American people for over 20 years.   After graduating from the College of the Holy Cross, Marty started at  the Department of Commerce as an appointee under President Ronald  Reagan.   In the 1990s, Marty came to the House of Representatives, where he  worked for Congressman Dan Miller in a variety of roles, ultimately  finishing up as his chief of staff. After leaving Capitol Hill, he went  on to a think tank and taught high school before managing Xerox's  governmental affairs team.   In 2011, Marty came back to the House, joining the Ways and Means  Committee's Health Subcommittee, where he was instrumental in crafting  legislation that would provide quality healthcare for millions of  Americans.   On August 18, 2014, Marty joined my team and has been a vital part of  it ever since. With a servant's heart and attention to detail, Marty is  an expert not only on House procedure, but on all issues passing  through the whip's office, and is relied upon in all other leadership  offices as well.   Thank you, Marty, for your faithful service to the House of  Representatives, and best of luck in your future. You will be missed.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota  for yielding.  [[Page H4368]]    Madam Speaker, I rise to object to this whole process. What we are  doing here today, this is an example of the misplaced priorities of  this Democrat majority.   Let's start with the bill at hand, this package of bills that  includes a budget that I am sure very few people in this Chamber have  read, that authorizes the taxing and spending of trillions more  dollars.   Now, what does that mean? They call it the for the children act. It  really should be called the mountains of debt for the children act  because that is what it does. If you look at inflation today, every  family in America is facing inflation. They are paying over 40 percent  more for gasoline, for cars, for things that they buy at the grocery  store.   Families know that if you add trillions more in debt, trillions more  in spending, trillions more in taxes, inflation will only go up and you  know who is going to pay for it. It is not anybody in this Chamber,  Madam Speaker. Under their own budget--it says it--it is the children.  That is who is going to pay for it.   Right here. Just go to page 7 where it authorizes up to $45 trillion  in debt--we are at about $28.6 trillion right now--$45 trillion in debt  with taxes and spending through the roof that will hit every family in  America, Madam Speaker.   Then let's get back to those priorities. Now, you would think with  the backdrop of everything that we have been dealing with in  Afghanistan, as we here in this Chamber, with so many of our veterans  who served in Afghanistan honorably, have been calling on the President  to ensure and commit that he will get all Americans out. Yet, what is  our President doing? I will tell you what he has been doing. He has  been working the phones pressuring Members of Congress this week.   I wish, Madam Speaker, I could say he was pressuring Members of  Congress to help get Americans out. That is not what he was doing. He  was working the phones this week pressuring Members of Congress to vote  for this trillions of dollars in spending and tax package. That has  been President Biden's priority.   He just said today he is going to bow to the Taliban's deadline of  August 31 even if we don't get all Americans out. President Biden  should be the President of the United States; not bowing to terrorists;  not bowing to anybody except committing that he will get all Americans  out instead of living by some artificial deadline.   Every ounce of his energy ought to be focused between now and next  Tuesday, the date he set and the date the Taliban set, every minute he  ought to be spending between now and next Tuesday should be focused on  getting all Americans out. But if he fails to do it, people will look  back and say: What was he doing instead? What were the President of the  United States' priorities? He was pressuring Members of Congress to  vote for this garbage: trillions of dollars in debt and spending,  rather than focus on getting Americans out of harm's way that he left  behind.   It is a national and international disgrace. Our priorities ought to  be with the American people. That is what we will fight for. That is  why we oppose this whole process.
