 Mr. President, first of all, I want to congratulate all  of these speakers. It has been wonderful hearing all of my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle state their positions, as they have done so  eloquently. We have all learned a lot. I am not sure it has changed  anything, but we sure have learned a lot in this process.   But I rise today to rebut what I believe is a great misleading of the  American people.   Before I get into the details, let me tell you a little bit about  where I come from and my political background. I have been involved in  public service in my State of West Virginia for over 40 years, in one  capacity or another. I have been in the house of delegates. I have been  in the State senate for 10 years. I have been secretary of state. I  have been Governor for two terms. And now I have been here in the  Senate for going on 11 years.   When I served in the legislature, I could put a bill on the floor or  I could put a bill in committee, and it would go through committee. It  would go to the floor if it came out. I could get amendments on it.  Sometimes it passed; sometimes it didn't.   But, at the end of the day, we had a place we called ``Junior  Rules.'' It was behind the senate chamber. You would go behind the  door, and there would be ``Junior Rules.'' After it was over, after we  had our debates and discussions--whether it be in committee or whether  it be on the floor--we would all gather, Democrats and Republicans. We  ate together. We had some refreshments together. We spoke about what  happened today and what we could do to make it better tomorrow. I never  could understand, when I got here, how divided we were. How did this  happen?   So I kept thinking, when I first got here they said: Well, you know,  the Republicans are over there, and we are the Democrats here, and it  is nice. We all get along and everything. But now, when they run, we  have to be against them.   I have to be against you, no matter how close you may be, no matter  if I sat beside you, no matter if we have dinner at night. If it is  your election cycle, I have to be against you. Not only that I am  supposed to be against you, I am supposed to basically write a check to  whoever is running against you--to whoever is running against you. And  maybe, even, they want me to maybe go to your State and campaign  against you.   And I am thinking: You know something, where I come from in West  Virginia, if I went to work during the day and you did that to me, we  are going to go outside and have a little conversation. That ain't  going to happen back where I come from. And I wasn't going to do it  here.   Now, if we can change some things, that is what we should be  changing. Why should we do this? How are we expected to sit down at the  end of the day or the end of a session or at the end of anything and  come back on Monday and say, ``OK, now, Senator Thune, would you go on  this amendment with me and help me with this bill,'' after I just came  out and basically worked for your opponent that the Democrats have  recruited and basically given them money.   That is not going to happen. It is not going to happen.   So I keep thinking, we keep thinking: What is wrong with the place?  That is what is wrong. I tried to get just a little oath that we could  all sign that we wouldn't do that to each other. I guess there used to  be a gentlemen and ladies' agreement that you just didn't do those  things, but not anymore, not anymore.   I heard about the good old days. I don't know what happened to the  good old days, but I can tell you they are not here now.   We can talk about a lot of things and the way we want to change, but  I still really believe we should talk about how we treat each other and  how we approach each other in a body that this 330 million people are  depending upon.   But rules--what little bit we have left that maybe makes us take  pause before we jump off of that bridge--we had better be careful what  we are doing.   After the State legislature, I also had the privilege to serve as  West Virginia's secretary of state. I never one time, as secretary of  state in my official capacity, had anyone ever talk to me: We have got  to suppress the vote. Democrat, Republican, Independent, no matter  what, no one ever came and said: Joe, we have got to stop this group  from voting because that won't help us. No one ever thought that way.   You know where most of my ideas came? I brought in early voting. I  had a lot of men working in the mines, shift working and all that, and  sometimes on Tuesdays, on our election day, they couldn't get off. They  had to work.   So someone says: Do you know what we did in our State? We got early  voting. We call it no-excuse voting. You can come any time you want.  You have got 7 days, 10 days, 2 weekends, whatever.   So I had a hard time getting people to understand. They think: Oh,  maybe something bad is going to happen; something nefarious will  happen.   It took a while for me to get 7 days in, just one week in. I fought  for that. After I got 7 days, they wanted more.    I understand that Kentucky just has early voting, and that is great.  They make those decisions.   That came out of the experiment we call the great experiment, State  by State. There are 50 experiments that go on every day in every State.  We should learn from them. They should learn from us. We all share  together. We have got many former Governors sitting here. We know how  this works. And that is what we are talking about.   I also started a program called SHARE. It was the SHARE Program. I  [[Page S315]]  had low turnout in West Virginia, and I was trying to get the turnout  up. So I am thinking: What can I do? And I always thought this: I can't  sometimes teach an old dog new tricks, but I can teach a pup some  tricks and maybe get the old dog to follow him. So I thought of a  program called SHARE, Saving History and Reaching Every Student--Saving  History and Reaching Every Student--because Jennings Randolph, former  Senator Jennings Randolph in West Virginia, was the father of the 18- year-old vote. It took him 21 years to get it done. He started back in  World War II and didn't get it done until the 1970s--1970. He was the  father.   So I had the Jennings Randolph award. I had every high school  competing for it, because we went out and educated students that if you  are 17 years of age and you turn 18 on election day or before--on  general election day or before--you can vote in the primary election at  17 years of age. No one knew that. The kids didn't know that.   We got them all fired up, and, I mean to tell you, we had awards and  made a big ceremony, and all of our election counts went up. Everything  went up. We did a good job. And they really, really appreciated it.   So we were able to increase the turnouts, but I believe with every  fiber in my body that every eligible citizen of voting age should have  the right to vote and be protected by law--everyone. And I think  everyone in here believes the same thing--I truly do--that we should be  able to do that.   Later today, we are going to vote. And I am going to vote, again, to  protect that right, and I am going to be proud to cosponsor the Freedom  to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Amendment Act. We all have  different positions on that, but I am proud to be a part of that. But  that is not what we are debating right now, and I think we all know  that. Right now, we are debating a fundamental change in the Senate  rules that will forever alter the way this body functions.   For the last year, my Democratic colleagues have taken to the Senate  floor, cable news airwaves, and pages of newspapers across the country  to argue that repealing the filibuster is actually restoring the Senate  to the vision that the Founding Fathers intended for this deliberativee  body.   My friends, that is simply not true. It is just not true. The U.S.  Senate has never, in 233 years, been able to end debate on legislation  with a simple majority vote. With a simple majority vote, they have  never been able to end debate. They could not stop the debate.   Robert Byrd used to say that there are two things a Senator can do: A  Senator has a right to amend and a right to speak. He always said that.   In fact, prior to 1917, there was no mechanism for ending debate in  the Senate whatsoever. You couldn't end it. In that year, the Senate  adopted the cloture rule. It required the debate to end when two-thirds  of voting Senators willed it.   Since then, the cloture rule has been amended seven times, always by  regular order. I hear all of these things that we are talking about,  but we forget that a lot of things are done with regular order. Just  recently, Senator Schumer, Senator McConnell, the debt ceiling--they  did that using the rules. You didn't break the rules to do that. You  did it. You worked it out, which is the leadership's responsibility.   It means that the Senate has followed its own rule book when making  changes that affect legislative debate. We have changed rules. We have  all talked about how many times rules have been changed. We changed  them, but we changed them with the rules. We didn't break the rules; we  changed the rules. But, all of a sudden, now we just can't do it  anymore. We just got to blow it up.   The rule book means that the rules changes are done on the basis of  broad bipartisan consensus, not imposed on the minority by raw majority  power. No matter who is in power, the majority does not have that power  to do that in this Senate.   Now my colleagues propose to sidestep this process. They would use  the nuclear option to override a rule that we have used ourselves but  now seem to find unacceptable.   Unacceptable now.   We are going to break the rules to change the rules. We will make up  new rules as we go along and invite ourselves and future majorities to  disregard the rule book at will.   No rule of the Senate can withstand the act of a willful majority. No  rule will withstand a willful majority--not the cloture rule or any  other rule. Let this change happen this way, and the Senate will be a  body without rules. There will be no rules.   The Senate's greatest rule is the one that is unwritten. This is an  unwritten rule, and it is the greatest one we have. It is the rule of  self-restraint, which we have very little of anymore--self-restraint.  That rule will be broken along with the cloture rule if the nuclear  option is executed, and for that--I cannot be a party to that.   But there is good news. Here is the good news. We don't have to  change the rules to make our case to the American people about voting  rights, about the John Lewis. We don't have to. We really don't.   Senator Schumer didn't have to file cloture to cut off debate. He  didn't have to fill the amendment tree to block Republican amendments.  We are here. We could have kept voting rights legislation as the  pending business for the Senate today, next week, a month from now.  This is important. Let's work it out. Let's stay here and go at it. I  think you all are here. Everybody is here. We had a lot of good talks  today. I am sure you have a lot of amendments you would like to make,  and all of us would like to make amendments. If you want to see it work  again, let's do it. Let's go for it.   That is exactly what I think should be done. I think the American  people really need that. I think that we owe that to them. We wasted a  year behind the scenes, partisan negotiations back and forth, talking  through each other, around each other, but not to each other.   Let's have the debate, Democrats and Republicans, and let the  American people decide. The pressure will come. That is what the  filibuster is all about. The pressure is mounting until you have made  either a compromise, you have made a decision; you all have decided to  go--you know, one way or another, you are going to end that filibuster.  And today, we haven't seen that.   Just 4 years ago, 61 of us, 61 Senators--myself being 1--33 of us on  the Democrat side, many of whom are sitting in the Chamber today--you  have heard this many times. We sent a letter to Senator Schumer and to  Senator McConnell warning them of the dangers of eliminating the  filibuster. That letter presented a united front committed to  ``preserve the ability of the members to engage in extended debate when  bills are on the Senate floor.''   While some of the Senators have changed their positions, I have not.  I respect that this is a two-way street, and I would hope you would  respect where I am. I respect that you have changed your position on  this. I would hope that you would respect that I have not, and I have  never wavered on this.   I do not and will not attack the content of the character of anybody  who has changed their position, and I would hope you would give me the  same opportunity and not attack mine.   Allowing one party to exert complete control in the Senate with only  a simple majority will only pour fuel on the fire of political whiplash  and dysfunction that is tearing this Nation apart, and you don't have  to look very far to see how we are tearing ourselves apart.   I can tell you, in every part of this country, people are divided  now. It used to be that we couldn't talk about religion at the supper  table; now, you can't talk about politics. It has truly become a blood  sport, and it should not be that way.   The rest of the world is looking at us. They are depending on us.  They are looking for guidance. They are looking for some stability.   If we do this, there is not going to be any check on the executive  branch.   Bob Byrd was scared to death of not having a check on the executive  branch, even when the executive branch was part of his own party, being  a Democrat. He always said: I do not work for the President; I work for  the people of West Virginia. He made very sure of that, he made sure  that every President knew that, and he made sure he would hold them  accountable, and  [[Page S316]]  they weren't going to streamroll over him.   The filibuster plays an important role in stabilizing our democracy  from the transitory passions of the majority and respecting the input  of the minority in the Senate.   Contrary to what some have said, protecting the role of the minority,  Democrat or Republican, has protected us from the volatile political  swings that we have endured over the last 233 years.   The role of the minority is what ensures the policies of our Nation  have input from all corners of the country. We must never forget this  is a Senate made up of 50 States, 100 Senators, blue States and red  States.    For those who believe that bipartisanship is impossible, we have  proven them wrong. In the last several years, we have made historic  investments in our Nation's public lands, passed trillions of dollars  in COVID-19 relief, and finally invested in rebuilding our Nation's  infrastructure. These critical pieces of legislation have had  significant impacts on Americans across the country. They were passed  with broad bipartisan support.   We can do it again. We truly can. We can make it easier to vote. We  must. We can make it harder to cheat. I think we can. We have heard  from our Republican colleagues, who basically agree with us on that. We  can reform the Electoral Count Act, which is what caused the  insurrection. We agree on that. We can fix that. We will never have to  witness another January 6, such an absolutely deplorable stain on this  great country of ours. And we can protect local election officials from  harassment and intimidation by making them Federal crimes. We can do  that, and I know we can do that together.   I am going to leave you with this: In May 2010, just a month before  Robert C. Byrd died--he died in June of 2010. This was a month before.  Senator Byrd was asked by then-chairman Senator Chuck Schumer of the  Rules Committee--I believe at that time--to testify about the  filibuster before the Senate Rules Committee because of his unsurpassed  knowledge on this subject.   Senator Capito knew him well too. She knows how he would pontificate  at times with us.   Senator Byrd began by quoting James Madison. He said:         Madison said that the purpose of the Senate was ``first, to       protect the people against their rulers, secondly, to protect       the people against the transient impressions into which they       themselves may be led,'' and that the Senate serves as a       ``necessary fence against such danger.''    Senator Byrd testified that ``the right to filibuster anchors this  necessary fence.'' He concluded with, ``We must never, ever, ever, ever  tear down the only wall, the necessary fence, that this nation has  against the excesses of the executive branch and the resultant haste  and tyranny of the majority.''   Eliminating the filibuster would be the easy way out. It wasn't meant  to be easy.   I cannot support such a perilous course for this Nation when elected  leaders are sent to Washington to unite our country, not to divide our  country. We are called the United States, not the Divided States, and  putting politics and party aside is what we are supposed to do.   It is time that we do the hard work to forge the difficult  compromises that can stand the test of time, and that is why we are  here--230 years. Think about it. Wars. Depressions. Think of all the  hardships this country has gone through, all the people who have  suffered and fought for every right we have. We are not going  backwards.   But with that being said, we can do better than what we are doing  today. We truly can. We must promise Americans a brighter future. I  think we can do that together.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, if my colleague will yield for one  second, sir.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.    Is it possible we can enter into a talking filibuster  now without a rules change? Could we start a talking filibuster right  now without a rules change?    I understand. The way this rule reads right now, sir:  during which all amendments, motions, and points of order are not in  order, and any appeal shall be determined without debate. That doesn't  allow any amendments whatsoever.    That is the way this reads, what we are voting on right  now.    I am saying, that is what we are voting on right now.    No amendments. No amendments.    We didn't have amendments on the bill. No amendments, no  motions, no points of order.    Thank you.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Republican leader.
