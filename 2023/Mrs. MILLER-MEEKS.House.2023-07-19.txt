 Madam Speaker, today the House Committee on  Oversight and Accountability heard the testimony of two IRS  whistleblowers who revealed how the Department of Justice interfered in  the investigation of the foreign business dealings of the Biden family.  During this oversight hearing, we learned that Hunter Biden received  money from China and other countries.   Today's hearing made it apparent that there are two sets of rules in  this country, one for the Biden family and another for the rest of us.  If people in my district did even a small amount of what Hunter Biden  did, they would have to serve time in jail. Instead of receiving full  accountability from our Justice Department, the two IRS whistleblowers  confirmed that the Attorney General was not impartial in its  investigation.   Further, they revealed that President Biden not only knew about  Hunter Biden's corrupt foreign business deals, but he was in the room  for the deals.   Hunter Biden, with the full knowledge and participation of then-Vice  President Biden, leveraged his family name during these shady business  deals, which is absolutely an abuse of power and not an appropriate use  of the Office of the Vice President.    If the Department of Justice will not do its job and complete a  thorough investigation, then it is up to Congress to employ the  accountability needed. Iowans want to have full faith in our criminal  justice system, and that starts with an equal application of the law.   Madam Speaker, I wish a happy birthday to my brother-in-law, Ralph  Martino.   Happy birthday, Ralph.                            ____________________
