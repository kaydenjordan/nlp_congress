 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 2 minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Thank you.                              Amendment No. 389    Mr. President, I rise today in support of an amendment that will  relieve millions of Americans of a moral conflict. For too many, access  to healthcare coverage comes only with the restriction of deeply held  personal convictions about the sanctity of human life.   The amendment before us offers the opportunity to end the flow of  taxpayer dollars to abortion procedures once and for all. It allows  Hyde protections to be extended to all funds appropriated through the  healthcare legislation we are considering today.   Let me provide some context. Premium tax credits implemented under  ObamaCare currently provide over $8.7 billion in annual subsidies for  nearly 1,000 different insurance plans that cover elective abortion on  the State exchanges. This provision stands in violation of the  fundamental principle of the Hyde amendment and the long-held  understanding that the U.S. Government has no role in funding  abortions.   In recent weeks, the Senate has debated countless nuances of  healthcare policy, and we have taken several crucial votes on efforts  to rescue the American people from a failed social experiment, bringing  us to this moment. Under our current procedural circumstances, in order  to ensure that both the spirit and the letter of the Hyde amendment's  provision against taxpayer-funded abortion is upheld, we need a new  solution.   My amendment would establish a matching arrangement between stability  funds and premium tax credits, delivering an arrangement that complies  with the Byrd rule. Starting in 2019, the value of premium tax credits  that continue to subsidize elective abortions would drop to 10 percent,  with the remaining 90 percent being made available as Hyde-protected  monthly payments to insurers to benefit the same people who relied on  those tax credits.   Let me be clear. This amendment does not reduce the amount of tax  credit dollars available to low-income Americans. It does not result in  their losing coverage. It certainly does not create or expand an  entitlement program.   When hard-working Americans pay their taxes, they do so with the  understanding that the rights granted to them by the Constitution are  not checked at the door. For the people of my State, the right to life  is foremost among these, codified by the Hyde amendment and engrained  in the conscience of a majority of Americans. The amendment before us  allows for a clear conscience. It allows for a concise, conservative  solution to a problem that has dogged this Chamber for the 44 years  since Roe v. Wade changed the landscape of American society.   On behalf of the unborn and the conscience rights of millions of  Americans, I am proud to offer this amendment, and I urge my colleagues  to join me in this effort.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blunt). The Senator from Hawaii.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of amendment  No. 389 and, if adopted, for the provisions of the adopted amendment  included in any subsequent amendment to H.R. 1628 and any amendment  between Houses or conference report thereon, and I ask for the yeas and  nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The question is on agreeing to the motion.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.   The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 50, nays 50, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 174 Leg.]                                  YEAS--50       Alexander      Barrasso      Blunt      Boozman      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Cochran      Corker      Cornyn      Cotton      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Enzi      Ernst      Fischer      Flake      Gardner      Graham      Grassley  [[Page S4387]]        Hatch      Heller      Hoeven      Inhofe      Isakson      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      McCain      McConnell      Moran      Paul      Perdue      Portman      Risch      Roberts      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott      Shelby      Strange      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Wicker      Young                                  NAYS--50       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Donnelly      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Franken      Gillibrand      Harris      Hassan      Heinrich      Heitkamp      Hirono      Kaine      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Manchin      Markey      McCaskill      Menendez      Merkley      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Nelson      Peters      Reed      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Stabenow      Tester      Udall      Van Hollen      Warner      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden   The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 50, the nays are  50.   Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted  in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.   The point of order is sustained and the amendment falls.                            ____________________
