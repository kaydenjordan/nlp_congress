 Mr. President, I applaud what the senior Senator from  Alabama said. We worked very closely together on the weekend,  yesterday, and today, and we are continuing to work on a managers'  package. I also want to be able to bring up my elections security  grants amendment, especially as we know that Russia and others continue  to try to interfere with our elections.   I believe the Senate has to act as a coequal branch of government in  defending against a threat to our democracy. The threat is very real.  Our intelligence community unanimously agrees that Russia interfered in  the 2016 elections. There is an imminent threat to our 2018 elections.  Just last week, we learned that a Russian hacker targeted the office of  a sitting Senator. We can't ignore such a threat against this Chamber  or our government.   My amendment, if I bring it up, will provide $250 million for State  election security grants to protect our elections. It improves election  cyber security, replaces outdated election data equipment, and  undertakes other anti-cyber efforts.   In fiscal year 2018, Congress came together--Republicans and  Democrats, House and Senate--and appropriated $380 million for state  election security grants. It was the first new funding for election  security in years. In just a few short months since then, all the  States and territories--55 in all--requested funding, and 100 percent  has been committed to the states and 90 percent disbursed.   Last week, 21 State attorneys general signed a letter pleading with  Congress to provide more funding to address this crisis, writing:  ``More funding is essential to adequately equip states with the  financial resources we need to safeguard our democracy and protect the  data of voting members in our states.''   Securing our elections and safeguarding our democracy should not be a  partisan issue. The House Republicans blocked Democrats from even  having a vote on the House floor. I am still hopeful the Senate will  not make that same mistake.   Let us heed the warnings of our intelligence agencies. Of the lights  blinking red. Of the appeals from the attorneys general, the  secretaries of state, and the state and local election officials who  are sounding the alarm. This duty has fallen to us, and we must not  later be found to have been asleep at the switch, with so much at  stake.   I join with Senator Shelby on this next vote, but I do want Senators  to be on notice that I will be bringing this up at some point.    Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator  preceding me, and I thank him very much. He has worked very hard in the  Appropriations Committee.   Senator Shelby and I have worked very hard to get a bipartisan bill.  I would hope that we could have a consent agreement very soon to bring  the current bills to a conclusion.   I would note that both Mr. Shelby and I have done our best to work  with Members of both parties. Many people on the Appropriations  Committee have concerns, some of which are by nature parochial, many  national. I think we have tried to accommodate as many people as  possible, and I hope that Senators can reach an agreement soon so we  can know exactly what we will be voting on if not tonight, tomorrow  morning.   I thank the Senator for his comment.   I see my friend is about to speak, so I will yield the floor.    Mr. President, Senator Shelby and I and Senator Moran have  worked on this. We have no objection.    Mr. President, I have no objection.    Mr. President, I would again note that Senator Shelby and  I have been working very hard on this appropriations bill, but so have  a whole lot of other Senators, my colleague from Kansas being one of  them.   Both Republicans and Democrats want to bring the Senate back to the  way it should be, where we work things out between both parties. It  means that everybody has to give something, and not everybody wins  everything, but the country does very well. That is what we are trying  to do on the appropriations bill. I think we can wrap these up, and I  would hope that the other body, when they get back from their vacation,  will be able to work  [[Page S5504]]  with us to get them finalized and to the President.   I must point out that it has taken the courage of a lot of Senators,  both Republicans and Democrats, to work together to get this done. As  the dean of the Senate--the longest serving one here--I applaud them  very, very much.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
