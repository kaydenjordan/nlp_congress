 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize the  small business, Olive You Boutique of Richmond, KY, as the Senate Small  Business of the Week.    Nearly a decade ago, Katie Stallons and her sister Lindsay Wiley  decided there were not enough clothing options for the ladies of  central Kentucky. The sisters, both Richmond natives and alumni of  University of Kentucky, decided to take matters into their own hands  and open Olive You Boutique. Their mother, Jennifer Brandenburg, joined  in their venture, designing the interior of the boutique, and now  working in-store alongside her daughters and the other lovely ladies at  Olive You Boutique. In their 9 and a half years of operating, this  woman and family-owned business has seen plenty of growth and success.  In 2015, they received the Richmond Chamber of Commerce Minority  Business of the Year Award, and they are routinely voted as Best  Women's Shopping in Richmond in local publications. Despite all this  success, they have never lost sight of their mission.    Owner Katie Stallons' fundamental goal for Olive You Boutique is to  carry something for ``all of you'' lovely women of central Kentucky and  beyond. The store offers clothes to women of all ages; one stop  shopping for daughter, mother, and grandmother, during all seasons.  Olive You Boutique carries a wide range of items from casual loungewear  to cocktail attire and everything in between. Regardless of age, shape,  likes, and dislikes, Olive You Boutique has something for every woman.  Customers are known to travel from all over Kentucky and beyond, with  the store offering items for every Bluegrass activity, whether it be  Keeneland, Kentucky Derby, weddings, graduations, Easter, and more.    Small businesses often have a very familial atmosphere, and Olive  You Boutique is no exception. Whether you are greeted by one of the  sisters in charge, their delightful mother and interior designer, or  one of the other charismatic women working alongside them, customers  instantly feel like they are at home. Without a doubt, Olive You has  brought a fun and personal shopping experience to the Bluegrass State.  From unique clothes to sweet gifts for any occasion, ``all of you'' can  be sure to find something special when shopping at Olive You Boutique.    The owners of the store keep both feet on the ground when conducting  business and always look out for friends and neighbors. Often hosting  ``Shop For a Cause'' events in their store, they most recently teamed  up with jewelry designer Kendra Scott and raised $1,000, which was  matched by the designer, and then donated towards the medical journey  of a Centre College student who had suffered a horrific spinal cord  injury. Their caring spirit extends even beyond the Kentucky community.  In 2013, during the week following the category five tornado that  struck Moore, OK, the owners of Olive You Boutique donated 10 percent  of all sales to the American Red Cross Oklahoma Disaster Relief Fund.    In keeping their community in mind, Katie and Lindsay do not forget  about other small businesses. Olive You Boutique is often the source of  gatherings, with the owners inviting weekly food trucks to come offer  breakfast or lunch to their customers. They also host trunk shows where  they invite food vendors, florists, and other local artisans to come  and sell their products alongside those found at Olive You. And if it  is not a trunk show, it is a fun seasonal event to take advantage of  community good cheer, often hosting summer soirees and other events  around the winter holidays.    Katie and Lindsay are two entrepreneurs who demonstrate the best  values of a small business owner. Olive You Boutique is not just a  women's clothing store, it is a site that fosters community involvement  and outreach. It is a fun and friendly place where ladies can shop,  where vendors can collaborate and where you can find local support and  always a friendly face. Congratulations to Katie Stallons and Lindsay  Wiley and the entire Olive You team. I wish them the best of luck and  look forward to watching their continued growth and success in  Kentucky.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize the  small business, Powell Valley Millwork of Clay City, KY, as the Senate  Small Business of the Week.   Twenty-seven years ago Jim Thornberry and his son Jimmy left the  mining industry behind in search of a new venture. Shortly thereafter,  Powell Valley Mill work was founded. The Thornberrys started their mill  with the desire to harvest a tangible product within a sustainable  industry, and that mission has stayed at the heart of their business  throughout their decades of growth and success.   The talent and substance of Powell Valley Mill work draws directly  from our State, with the mill focusing on only one species of lumber:  poplar. As the State tree of Kentucky, poplar is an abundant resource  within Appalachia, which makes their location in rural Clay City a  prime spot for their operation. Often referred to as ``the painter's  wood'' poplar is known for its clear grain, smooth milling, and paint- taking qualities. The versatile and fine nature of the wood allows  Powell Valley Millwork to supply consumers with a wide variety of  interior-trim products, such as stretcher bars, door and window jambs,  stair parts, cabinetry components, primed finger-joint interior trim,  and more. In creating all these products, the Powell Valley millworkers  make sure nothing goes to waste. Poplar can be safely used as animal  bedding which means the mill's offcuts, those that are not already  being used to fuel the company's wood drying kilns, are turned into  shavings. These shavings are then bagged and shipped out by the truck  load to be sold in a wide variety of retail outlets.   This Powell County mill maintains their technology at a topnotch  standard. In 2019, the owners invested in a new addition to the team: a  sophisticated scanning rough mill line from Eagle Machinery & Supply,  Inc. The new rough mill line is able to process 65,000 board feet of  lumber in a single 8-hour shift with only six people required to  operate it. The joint project between Powell and Eagle, both family  companies, demonstrates that U.S. machinery manufacturers can  successfully compete with Europeans in providing world-class technology  to the North American wood processing industry.   The Thornberrys keep their eye on efficiency and progress, opening up  ownership of the company to experts outside the family, including Dale  Budke, Powell Valley's Operations Manager. As a partner in this  company, Dale provides the expertise necessary for navigating the  growing Kentucky lumber industry. In 2019, Powell Valley Millwork  acquired the Metrie Poplar manufacturing facility in nearby  Jeffersonville, KY. With a new 125,000-square-foot location only 12  miles from their original facility, the two locations utilize their  natural synergies to support the needs of a diverse customer base  across North  [[Page S520]]  America in full truck and railroad quantities.   Powell Valley Millwork is a testament to the ingenuity and  resourcefulness of Kentuckians. Drawing from our beautiful natural  resources and employing over 200 local men and women, this business  illustrates some of the best qualities Kentucky has to offer: fine  craftsmanship and dedicated hard work. Powell Valley Millwork is a  decades-old dream the Thornberrys had when they left the mining  industry, a dream that has grown beyond what they had imagined. Small  businesses like Powell Valley are the core of small towns across  Kentucky, and like the poplars they use in their mill, their roots grow  deep to help our communities flourish. Congratulations to the  Thomberrys and the entire Powell Valley team. I wish them the best of  luck and look forward to watching their continued growth and success in  Kentucky.                            ____________________
