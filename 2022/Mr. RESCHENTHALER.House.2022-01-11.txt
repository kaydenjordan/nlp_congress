 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I thank my good friend from Colorado for his kind words and also for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Madam Speaker, before I get into debate, I do want to talk about my  good friend from Colorado. I know that he may be moving on in some  months. I want to say I truly am looking forward to working with my  good friend for the next few months. He is a gentleman and a good  friend both on and off the floor.   Madam Speaker, the rule before us today makes in order two pieces of  legislation, H.R. 1836, the Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act of  2020 and also H.R. 4673, the EVEST Act.   As a former Navy JAG, I am deeply committed to supporting the  military men and women who make sacrifices every day to protect our  freedoms, both at home and abroad.   And that is why I am incredibly disappointed that neither of these  measures received a legislative hearing in the House Veterans' Affairs  Committee this Congress.   Without input from the VA, VSOs, and other stakeholders, it is  absolutely unclear the impact these bills would actually have, let  alone whether these are actually workable bills.   Take for example H.R. 1836. Republicans agree that we must address  the benefit and equity for our National Guardsmen and simplify the law  so that any time spent on Active Duty for service other than training  would count towards GI Bill eligibility. But unfortunately, the broad  expansion of benefits in H.R. 1836 could have very real impacts on  retention in both the Reserves and Active Duty.   Additionally, it would be helpful to hear from VSOs and other  stakeholders about the impact that increased interest fees would have  on veterans' access to housing. This is a real problem, and I don't  think we have properly addressed it or debated it.   These are issues that could have been explored. They could have been  explored during a legislative hearing. They could have been explored to  ensure a final product that meets the needs of our guardsmen and our  veterans.   At the same time, while I agree that we must support transitioning  servicemembers and we must do it by connecting them with VA hospital  care and medical services, this has been an incomplete legislative  process that makes H.R. 4673 completely problematic.   According to the VA 2022 Budget documents, 9.2 million veterans are  enrolled for care and medical services while 7.1 million veterans  actually receive treatment at VA or community care facilities. So given  that the budgets are determined by historical enrollment versus actual  utilization, increasing enrollment without understanding the impact on  the VA healthcare system could create an imbalance between the  budgetary needs and what reality will show. It would also be helpful to  understand H.R. 4673's potential impacts on access to care for current  veterans and the ability of VA staff and facilities to handle the  influx of the new enrollees.   To that end, last Congress we passed the Commander John Scott Hannon  Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act of 2019. This required the  VA to submit a strategic plan to provide a healthcare plan to any  veteran during the 1-year period following their discharge or release  from Active Duty service. This strategic plan is currently expected to  be released early in 2022. So it would make a lot more sense to wait  until we receive the strategic plan before we move forward with a  legislative solution.   Again, Madam Speaker, these are issues that could have been discussed  at a legislative hearing. These issues could have helped ensure a  veteran-focused approach to enrollment eligibility for VA healthcare.  Instead, the majority is moving forward without a true understanding of  the real-world impacts of these measures. I, therefore, urge my  colleagues to oppose this rule.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time    Madam Speaker, during my opening statement, I  referenced the strategic plan that the VA is undertaking that we are  supposed to get in early 2022. And the reason for that is we typically  need data before we legislate, but we do have data on another topic,  and that is the damage that our children are facing by being kept out  of school.   Madam Speaker, we have nearly 2 full years of data that show that  keeping kids out of classrooms has caused massive learning loss, a  mental health epidemic, particularly among our youth, and stressful  situations for millions of families. Recently, children in Chicago have  been forced to endure virtual hearings after the Chicago Teachers Union  refused to do their jobs and show up for in-person classes.   House Republicans believe schools should be open and that our  children come first. In some municipalities, bowling alleys have opened  before our schools. It is shameful.   Madam Speaker, that is why if we defeat the previous question, I will  personally offer an amendment to the rule to immediately consider H.R.  682, the Reopen Schools Act.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with any extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Hinson), my good friend, the legislation's  author, here to explain the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I appreciate my good friend from Texas talking about suicide.  If we want to talk about suicide, let's look at the youth of this  country. Here is the statistic:   The number of ER visits for suspected suicide attempts by 12- to 17- year-old girls rose by 51 percent in 2021 compared to 2019. Suicide  attempts are up 51 percent. So let's talk about suicide and let's talk  about the effect that these shutdowns are having on our youth.   I know my good friend from Colorado said this is just an issue in  Chicago when we were talking about Chicago. Chicago is just an example  of the shutdowns.   There are over 4,500 schools across the country that chose to begin  the week of January 2 by shutting down, which clearly disrupted  learning.                                time  1300    This isn't just a Republican stat. I have a New York Times article  that has even more facts on this. Remember, it was President Biden who  promised that he was going to shut down the  [[Page H27]]  virus, not shut down the economy and not shut down schools. He has  actually done the exact opposite.   Here is another statistic. More Americans have died from COVID-19 in  2021 than in 2020. That is under President Biden's watch.   We can hear excuses all day long about what can be done, but the fact  is this: This is a crisis that Joe Biden and the other party across the  aisle own. There is no excuse. They control the White House and the  Senate, and they have the majority in the House. This has been done on  their watch.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma  (Mr. Hern) to talk more about this topic.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I am actually glad the economy came up because this is  truly a disaster. We can talk about the stock market, but I can tell  you that the people in my district don't care about Wall Street. They  are focused on Main Street.   When everything they buy every day, whether it is bacon at the  grocery store or gasoline at the gas station, costs more, it takes  money out of their paychecks.    Don't take my word. Let's turn to some statistics.   The December jobs report was the worst of Joe Biden's Presidency,  with the U.S. economy actually adding just under 200,000 jobs when it  was projected to add roughly half a million jobs, grossly falling short  of what all the economists were projecting.   The December jobs report was the worst of the Biden Presidency. The  labor force participation rates decreased for the following  demographics. African-American men 20 and older declined in job  participation. African-American teenagers, Asian Americans, and  Hispanic and Latino Americans all had falling numbers under the Biden  economy.   Again, let's just look at inflation. Gasoline is up 58 percent. We  haven't seen increases like this in gasoline since the last time that  Joe Biden was in the White House. Car and truck rentals are up over 37  percent. As I referenced, bacon is up over 21 percent. Fish and seafood  are up 10 percent. Eggs are up 8 percent. Coffee is up 7.5 percent.   What this means is the real wages of American workers, which have  stagnated, are even worse than they were before this Presidency because  everything the American worker buys costs more thanks to Joe Biden and  thanks to the party across the aisle's economic policies.   I want to talk more about schools that were referenced. Let's talk  about schools. I have a New York Times article. ``No Way to Grow Up''  is the title. American children are in crisis. It was published on  January 4. This is a New York Times article.   Among third through eighth graders, math and reading levels were  lower than normal this fall, according to NWEA, which is a research  group.   Many children and teenagers are experiencing mental health problems  aggravated by the isolation and disruption of the pandemic.   Three medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics,  recently declared a national state of emergency in children's health.   What is really shocking about this is the party across the aisle  claims to be the party of science. I think the party across the aisle  has forever forfeited the right to call themselves the party of science  because nothing that they have done has been based on science--maybe  political science, but not real science.   Here is the real science. Data now suggests that the many changes to  school routines are of questionable value in controlling the virus'  spread. Some researchers are skeptical that school closures actually  reduce COVID cases in most instances.   Here we have the so-called party of science using unscientific  rationale to shut down schools, which we know is damaging kids both  from an education  [[Page H28]]  point of view and a mental health point of view, damaging kids while  having zero science to back that up.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr.  Moore).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman from Utah.    Madam Speaker, again, I just want to reiterate  that I have said if we defeat the previous question I will personally  offer an amendment to the rule to immediately consider H.R. 682, the  Reopen Schools Act, to help our children who are in school who are  suffering. That is why this is now an issue.   To speak more on that, Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from  Wisconsin an additional 10 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I am a veteran in the Navy. I was a naval officer. I  deployed to Iraq. I will talk about veteran issues all day long, and we  can start by talking about the VA loan that needs reform so veterans  can actually use this loan in a hot market where sellers simply will  refuse to accept that loan. I will sit up here and talk about that all  day, and I have been talking about veterans' issues.   But let's just step back. We have had almost 1 year of one-party  rule, one party controlling the White House, the Senate, and the House  for 1 year.   And what has that given us?   It has given us an absolute crisis--a disaster--at the southern  border. It has given us rampant COVID deaths that actually exceed what  they were last year despite the fact that this President inherited from  President Trump Operation Warp Speed which gave him three vaccines and  a list of therapeutics that could be used. Despite all that, this is  still an unmitigated disaster that Biden and his Democratic colleagues  have created.    We also have inflation and stagnation. American workers have less  money to buy the goods and services they need. We have Russia poised to  invade Ukraine. We have Communist China daily invading the airspace of  the free and independent nation state of Taiwan. And don't even get me  started on the fact that we ceded Afghanistan to the Taliban after 18  months of stability in a nation that saw zero American fatalities and  stability for our Afghan allies, and we handed it over to the Taliban.   That is what 1 year of one-party rule has given this country: an  unmitigated disaster.   Now, getting back to schools, I know that my colleagues on the left  want to say that this is just an issue for Chicago or some other city.  Forty-five hundred schools shut down the first week of January is a  national issue.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Louisiana  (Ms. Letlow) to talk more about it.    Madam Speaker, I would like my friend from  Colorado to know that I have no further speakers and that I am prepared  to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Madam Speaker, as a former Navy JAG, I strongly support efforts to  ensure our military men and women receive the care and benefits they  deserve both during and after their periods of service. It is,  therefore, incredibly disappointing to me that the two bills made in  order under today's rule present numerous issues and numerous  uncertainties that could have been addressed through what could have  been just a robust discussion with the VA, VSOs, and other stakeholder  groups.   I really hope that moving forward we can just work together to ensure  that through the legislative process we address the needs of our  Nation's veterans.   Again, I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question so that I can offer the amendment to Reopen Schools Act.   So, again, Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the  previous question and ``no'' on the rule, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
