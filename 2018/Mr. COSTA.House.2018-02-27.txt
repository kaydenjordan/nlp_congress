 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee) for her leadership on this important issue.   Mr. Chair, as the co-chair of the Victims' Rights Caucus with my  colleague Congressman Ted Poe, I am a proud cosponsor of this important  legislation for victims in America who have suffered from these crimes.   A free and open internet, we all believe, is essential to economic  growth, entrepreneurship, and enterprise in the 21st century, and  America leads the way. This new technology age has reshaped our lives  and allowed for greater access to learning, greater ability to shape  our own futures as Americans, and with economic benefits we could not  have imagined 15 years ago.   Sadly, there are some people who look at these freedoms and the  openness of the internet and see ways to exploit, abuse, and prey on  innocent children and teenagers in the name of profit. It is  outrageous, and it is a crime. I am speaking of the scourge of sex  trafficking, which has impacted the lives of too many young people in  the San Joaquin Valley that I represent and throughout America.   Today, here in Congress, we look squarely at traffickers, pimps, and  victimizers and say we must do a better job in protecting our citizens.  As a result of this legislation, our laws will no longer be manipulated  and used as a cover for their abuse. No longer will these people be  able to hide behind the shield that the internet provides you when  knowingly contributing to this horrible crime.   The Fresno Bee, a local daily newspaper in the San Joaquin Valley,  recently ran a 6-week-long series about human trafficking in the  Valley. The paper reported that nearly every 16-year-old girl in Fresno  has been approached at one time or another by sex traffickers. Imagine  that: nearly every 16-year-old girl in our county.   Police have seen sex trafficking victims from every high school in  Fresno County and most of the junior high schools. It is horrible. This  is a tragedy, and it cannot and should not be allowed to continue.   Today, we say it is time to make important changes. This legislation  does that. It will help protect our children and provide them the  ability to confront their abusers.    Mr. Chair, as I had said, it is time to make these  important changes, and this bipartisan legislation does that. It  protects our children, providing them the ability to confront their  abusers, including those who knowingly promote and advertise these  crimes.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman, and I am thankful for the  bipartisan leadership in this effort.    Mr. Chair, I include in the Record these excerpts from a  series of articles entitled ``Slaves of the Sex Trade'' by Rory  Appleton from the Fresno Bee: ``Don't kid yourself. Sex slaves are all  around us--and you may know some of them'' (November 2, 2017), ``She  was a hospital worker. He sold her for sex before, during and after her  shifts'' (November 2, 2017), ``Police: 'Every 16-year-old girl in  Fresno' has been targeted by sex trade recruiters'' (November 9, 2017),  ``Once sold for sex, she now helps lead the fight against human  trafficking'' (November 15, 2017), ``How do you rescue women forced to  walk the streets at night? It's not easy'' (November 16, 2017), ``To  break the cycle of children sold for sex, the legal system is trying  something new'' (November 28, 2017), ``All of us must help beat the  scourge of human trafficking. Here's what you can do'' (December 7,  2017). The full series can be found at http://www.fresnobee.com/news/ special-reports/human-trafficking/.   These seven articles demonstrate the impact of sex trafficking on our  communities. I commend the Fresno Bee on their important reporting.                    [From the Fresno Bee, Nov. 2, 2017]  Don't Kid Yourself. Sex Slaves Are All Around Us--and You May Know Some                                  of Them                             (By Rory Appleton)         Rebecca Rodriguez-Brown still remembers the room where he       imprisoned her--the charming man she met and fell in love       with while still a teenager. She mapped it out with her hands       as she sat in a central Fresno office nearly 20 years later.        ``They would have a little microwave there, and they would       have a little ice chest right there by the sink,'' she said.       ``I still remember the color of the ice chest.''        Rodriguez-Brown isn't sure whether the room was in an       apartment or hotel. But she does remember that for seven       months she was kept in this room under guard and forced to       perform whatever sex act the strangers entering the room       asked for. The room was punishment for refusing to do the       same at her trafficker's home. Her captors brought her all of       her meals. If she defied them, she'd be beaten--sometimes       with her hands bound.  [[Page H1300]]         The Bee normally does not identify the victims of sexual       assault, however Rodriguez-Brown agreed to be named.        Her story is not uncommon in Fresno, or anywhere in the       world. It is one of cyclical abuse, habitual arrest and       unspeakable trauma. Women and children are bought and sold       every day in Fresno--online, in street corners, while at       school. They are raped, branded and beaten. They are taught       that they are the problem, not the people who force them into       this life--causing psychological scars that may never heal.        It is what many refer to as ``modern-day slavery.''

Eight hours a day as a hospital administrator, five hours--      sometimes more--as a prostitute.        He would wake her up at 4 a.m. to walk the streets. She       hated it--not that the house calls were much better. But when       she begged to stop, he would convince her the fault was hers.       Eventually, she would apologize and allow him to drop her off       before the sun was up.        ``He wanted at least $300 before I went to work at the       hospital,'' she said.        So she would work the streets for three hours before       starting an eight-hour day scheduling appointments in the       nephrology unit of a San Diego hospital--a job she had       enjoyed before she met him. He eventually forced her to have       sex with men during her lunch break, in addition to before       and after work. On the weekends, he took her to neighboring       cities--a common tactic to avoid law enforcement or reach a       new clientele.        ``If it were up to him, I would have never slept,'' she       said.        The mood-altering drug Xanax helped with the anxiety       stemming from the intense guilt she felt. She was ashamed to       talk to her friends and family--not that she could have if       she wanted to. He had her phone now, and he made sure she       never heard about her mother's attempts to contact her.        This woman, now 34, is one of thousands who are sex-      trafficked in California each year and one of hundreds of       victims now living in the central San Joaquin Valley.

She climbed into a car       driven by a stranger, who would take her to another stranger       with whom she had agreed to have sex for money.        If it had been a few minutes later, the girl could have       easily blended in with children walking home from school. She       was not dressed provocatively; she wore a red Fresno State       sweatshirt and jeans. She was not wearing excessive makeup.       She carried a backpack.        Who knows how many times she had followed this pattern--      strange men and strange cars. Online advertisements showed       her in various states of undress.        That's how the vice unit of the Fresno Police Department       found her. Today, these strangers were both undercover       officers. Tonight, she will be safe.        ``She said she hasn't eaten in five days,'' Sgt. Curt       Chastain said. ``No real family--an unreported runaway. She's       in the sex trade to survive.''        ``She wants help,'' he continued. ``She wants to be in       school, but mom won't sign her up.''        One of Chastain's undercover detectives confirmed this is       not a rare occurrence.        ``I've had (sex trafficking) victims from every high school       in Fresno County--and most junior high schools,'' the       detective said. The Fresno Bee is not identifying him due to       the sensitivity of his work. These traffickers, he added, use       a variety of tactics to lure children and young women into       ``the life.''

She flashes an easy smile as she speaks. Her voice is soft,       but her words are deliberate and flow with eloquence. She has       a distinct rockabilly style, with one arm bearing a tattoo       modeled from Disney's ``The Little Mermaid'' and a hair clip       featuring two large pink roses.        Looking at her, it's hard to imagine that a man she loved       forced her into slavery. For four years, Pauls was sold for       sex on streets and in hotel rooms across the western half of       the United States. She was barred from contacting her friends       or family. She was arrested multiple times and treated like a       criminal--a stigma that even now, five years later, is       difficult to shake.        Her worst moments seem unimaginable.        Pauls' trafficker--a man she believed to be her boyfriend--      refused to take her to a hospital when one of the men he sold       her to raped her. When she became pregnant with her       trafficker's baby, he forced her into an illegal, late-term       abortion. When her reeling body began to produce breast milk       after the abortion, her trafficker saw it as a moneymaker:       Those with certain fetishes would pay extra now, he told her.        It took a daring late-night escape--her trafficker's SUV       roaring behind her getaway car on a Las Vegas street--to get       out of that life. But once she returned to Fresno, her arrest       record kept her from working in her chosen career, and she       has struggled with the mental scars inflicted during her past       life.

It's Not                                    Easy                             (By Rory Appleton)         For decades, the women rescued from the hotel rooms and       apartments in Fresno where they had been raped, beaten and       forced to have sex with strangers for money had few       alternatives.        The first--and it was seldom optional--was jail. They could       also go to rehab, provided they had a drug problem. But more       often than not, they returned to the sex trade.        That is no longer the case.        In 2012, human trafficking became a crime in California,       carrying with it new language for dealing with the crime and       harsher penalties for traffickers. Local law enforcement       found success against traffickers by treating girls and women       in the sex trade as victims, not complicit criminals.        Over the past few years, a growing network of advocates has       added new avenues of help for the hundreds of women who are       trafficked. These groups have provided victims with shelter,       counseling and the tools to rebuild their lives.        Many who work with human trafficking victims consider the       practice to be modern-day slavery. If that's true, this       advocacy coalition is the underground railroad.

The teenage girl had been beaten, raped and dumped in a       neighboring county. Police found her unconscious, lying naked       in an alley.        ``There are some parts of the body that bruise easily, and       some that don't,'' said Maxwell, who's worked in the Fresno       County Public Defender's office for 11 years. ``Looking at       her, you knew she had been through it. She had been beaten       really badly.''        This case stands out for its brutality, Maxwell said. But       it was the sheer number of human trafficking cases crossing       her desk when she took control of the Public Defender's       juvenile office in 2015 that shocked her into action.        The legal community has partnered with advocacy groups, law       enforcement and the Fresno County Probation Department to       improve the criminal justice system in an effort to get       children out of the sex trade permanently. Their work will       soon bear fruit: On Jan. 19, Fresno County's juvenile court       will establish a courtroom dedicated solely to human       trafficking cases.        This new court--patterned after similar courts in       Sacramento, Los Angeles and other California counties--will       allow a judge with specialized training to work with the       various partner agencies to ensure children caught up in the       sex trade receive help that's customized for their needs.

Young women       have been tricked, blackmailed and forced into having sex       with strangers to support men they believed were their       boyfriends. People--especially children--with low self-      esteem, mental illness, unstable home lives or living in       poverty are the preferred targets of an industry operating in       the shadows.        Human trafficking is a complex issue. Police, advocacy       groups and the Fresno legal community have formed a unique       partnership to tackle the growing problem in new ways. But       what can the rest of Fresno do to fight human trafficking?        Talking to your children or younger family members about       the issue can educate them  [[Page H1301]]       and help keep them out of harm's way. Nonprofits that help       trafficking victims would welcome financial donations.       Residents can urge governments to allocate more resources to       those policing and prosecuting traffickers. And far larger       strides can be made to address a major underlying issue in       the sex trade: the people, mostly men, who buy sex.
