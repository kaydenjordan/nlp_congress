 Mr. Speaker, students from across the Nation, including  from my Ninth District in Michigan, are demanding that their voices be  heard on the issue of gun violence. They are upset with the carnage  they have witnessed. They are fearful for their safety, and they are  tired of excuses and inaction.   But 1 month after the tragedy in Parkland, Florida, not to mention so  many prior school shootings, Republican leaders in Congress have failed  to bring up any legislation that might meaningfully control the weapons  that are being used to kill and wound so many Americans. So all of us  Democrats are coming here today, many of us. On the Republican side--I  am not sure the screen can show--we see empty seats. No bill on assault  weapons, no bill on improving background checks, no bill to ban bump  stocks, nothing--this is a terrible moment of silence when we  desperately need a moment of action.   While there is no single answer to gun violence, any credible  response must address the weapons of war that are turning our schools,  houses of worship, movie theaters, and concerts into battlefields.  Assault weapons with magazines holding 30 bullets are not needed by  hunters nor are they required for self-defense. They are killing  machines, and increasing numbers of our fellow Americans have become  their victims.   Congress must stand up to the NRA and say, ``Enough.'' Even President  Trump called out Republican Members of Congress for being too afraid of  the NRA to act, saying the NRA has ``great power over you people; they  have less power over me.''   But ever since, President Trump has been backtracking, showing he,  too, is more scared of the NRA's political muscle than he is of the  public's demand for change. This outcome is depressingly familiar.   Fifty years ago, 1 week after Bobby Kennedy was assassinated, I spoke  on the issue of gun violence at Wayne State University. I felt  compelled to speak about the myths that the NRA was spreading regarding  any effort toward sensible gun control. In my 1968 speech, I said:  ``One of the favorite sayings of the NRA and the rest of the gun lobby  is that `guns don't kill people; people kill people.' The figures show  the inaccuracy of the statement. The truth is that `people with guns  kill people.' ''   This remains as true today as it was 50 years ago, and yet we still  remain paralyzed by the NRA. And what is its solution to gun violence?  More guns. More guns in the classroom by arming teachers, more guns on  the streets through lax concealed carry laws, and more guns crossing  State lines by overriding local laws. In this deranged math, more guns  somehow equals less violence.   Grieving parents and terrified students deserve so much better. They  are tired of the stonewalling, the diversion, and the deception. They  are demanding real action to stop gun violence. Let us act now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, it is not easy to fool Marcy Kaptur, but we pulled it  off. She thought we were going to talk about Wall Street? We are going  to talk about Main Street. In that regard, I think it was appropriate  for me to bring this.   Marcy, do you recognize this?   It was 30 some years ago that Marcy Kaptur and I went to Japan, and  she had a spark plug made in Toledo. This is an old one, so it is safe.  She took it to Japan because it was impossible to export from the  United States a spark plug to Japan. They excluded our products  completely.   So Marcy and I went over; and everywhere she went, she had a spark  plug. People thought it was because she is kind of a spark plug. But,  instead, again, it was because of the exclusion of any product made in  the U.S. going to Japan. They blocked it out while they had a  completely open market. That began a struggle that went on and on and  on. Marcy never gave up, and we still haven't given up. She was one of  those among us, and we joined together to say that trade is vital, but  it has to work both ways. I may give this to the gentlewoman  afterwards.   I just say this with deep feeling because of her deep feeling. We  spent days and days in Japan and came back and spent days and days, and  we pleaded with administrations: let there be reciprocity when there  wasn't.   So I am afraid Marcy has done so much that it is forgotten what she  was doing some years ago. But she was a pioneer in saying that when it  comes to trade, expand it, do so in a way that is reciprocal, and do so  in a way that is fair that remembers Main Street.   Secondly, I want to talk about another activity I have been  privileged to work on with Marcy Kaptur. There has been reference to  her heritage. Marcy never forgot her roots in Ohio, and she never  forgot her family's roots overseas--never. Indeed, her deep feelings  about democracy--it was in Ukraine that she and I worked on--really  reflected the depth of her feeling about democracy and the United  States of America. So together we put together the Ukrainian American  Caucus, and she has been the spark plug in that caucus.   I think both activities reflect so much about Marcy Kaptur, her  intelligence, combined with her deep feeling. She has never forgotten  where she came from, and she has taken that remembrance, that  remembering, and essentially took it into action in this place.   So we will talk about Wall Street some other day. But we are here on  behalf of so many to tell Congresswoman Kaptur that her career has been  so distinguished.   I have a special duty here. She and I are the two people remaining in  the class that came in. I think there were 81 of us, and the  gentlewoman has never, never failed with the same enthusiasm with which  she came. What a tribute that is to the gentlewoman and her character.   I finish with this. Marcy remembered her roots, and also that meant  deep feeling about family. Her love for her mother and her dedication  to her well-being was something that I think pervaded her life, and it  spilled over into all of ours.   So, I say to Marcy, with this spark plug and everything else, I am  honored to come today speaking for myself and so many others: job well  done, but you are still doing it.
