 Mr. Speaker, we have a problem here. My record is very,  very clear. I am providing assistance to any place in this country. In  fact, my record is 100 percent. So I have some credibility to come to  the floor to discuss this with my friend from Florida, and I hope he  will listen.   My heart goes out to those impacted my Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and  Maria the past several weeks. I am committed to providing for Federal  response and recovery.   I was pleased to support aid to those affected by Harvey and Irma,  and I will continue to do so. We urgently need to deliver relief and  assistance to those currently impacted by Hurricane Maria in the U.S.  Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, where the entire island has lost power  or many are without water. However, this bill today does not provide  that needed relief.   Let's be clear: we in New Jersey are not some Johnny-come-lately on  disaster tax relief. This is not a question of you got yours and I want  mine.   We have been working on disaster tax issues since 2012, based, in  part, on how we addressed helping victims of Hurricane Katrina more  than a decade ago. Let me remind you: Hurricane Sandy devastated the  northeastern United States in 2012, cost 233 lives, and caused $75  billion in damage. At the time, it was the costliest storm after  Hurricane Katrina.   While Congress, until then, had routinely provided tax relief to  communities in the wake of our worst storms--tax relief, I am talking  about--Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, victims of Hurricane Sandy  did not receive the same treatment. In fact, we had to wait 3 months.  We just  [[Page H7465]]  did it in 3 days. We seem to have short memories.   179 Republicans in this body and 36 Senators voted against aid to  victims of Hurricane Sandy in 2013--that many. And today, those same  Members asked us to support not only aid for Hurricanes Harvey and  Irma, but tax relief provisions, which they never even considered after  Hurricane Sandy.   I was a ``yes'' vote a week before last for your aid, unequivocally.  Why should I take out on your citizens the foolishness that happened in  2013? That would be wrong. And I think you feel the same way, through  the Chair.   This whole debate smacks of a certain hypocrisy, and I know I am not  the first to point it out. In the weeks after Sandy, I worked in a  bipartisan manner to draft a tax relief bill that would make permanent  the most commonsense tax relief provisions to take politics out of the  equation when it comes to disaster relief.                                time  1715    Over the years, I worked with many of my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle and from both Chambers of the Capitol.   Our bill, the National Disaster Tax Relief Act, led also by  Congressman Tom Reed from New York----    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding  additional time.   The bill provides tax relief to victims of Hurricane Sandy and puts  in place permanent provisions for all disaster areas going forward.   I am ready and waiting to debate these provisions and go through  regular order. Let's have hearings, let's have a markup, let's have  regular order on something that should be as noncontroversial as  helping those in need.   Instead of taking a bipartisan approach, some in the majority have  chosen to sneak in a few provisions taken from our bill and tack them  onto an unrelated aviation bill and apply them to only this year's  hurricane victims, leaving out all of the disaster victims that been  have waiting for support over the years.   A front-page story in the papers in New Jersey today says people are  still not back in their homes from Sandy, 2013. That is not fair. It is  not the American way.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding  additional time.   The specific provisions Republican leadership put in from our bill  include bigger-than-usual property casualty loss deductions, penalty- free retirement withdrawals.   He may smile, but think about those people who are out of their homes  since 2013. That is no laughing matter, Mr. Speaker.   An increased threshold for charitable giving, a tax credit for  impacted employers, and flexibility in applying for the earned income  tax credit and child tax credit.   I would note that Puerto Ricans, despite being American citizens, are  ineligible for the earned income tax credit, and I have a bill to  correct this.
