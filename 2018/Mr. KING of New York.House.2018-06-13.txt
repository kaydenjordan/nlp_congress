 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Supporting Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Act. I am proud to be a  lead cosponsor of this legislation.   Grandparents play a crucial and increasingly significant role in the  lives of their grandchildren. There are approximately 2.6 million  grandparents who are raising their grandchildren in the United States.   Unlike parents or foster parents who plan for months or years to care  for a child, grandparents often step in to raise the children  unexpectedly with little to no support. This has become more prevalent  in the wake of the opioid crisis. As a result, many grandparents are  left without adequate information on available resources to help them  with their caregiving duties.   This legislation will enable the federal government to provide much  needed support to grandparents. Specifically, this bill will establish  a federal advisory council to identify, promote, coordinate, and  disseminate information and resources in order to help grandparents  meet the health, educational, nutritional, and other needs of the  children in their care. The task force will also help identify  resources to help grandparents meet their own physical and mental  health needs.   I thank Senator Collins, Senator Casey, and Congressman McGovern for  working with me on this important legislation. I urge my colleagues to  join me in supporting this bill.
