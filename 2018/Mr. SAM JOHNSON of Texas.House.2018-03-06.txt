 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  memory of Richardson Police Officer David Sherrard.   Last month, Sherrard and other officers responded to a domestic  disturbance, where Sherrard was shot and later succumbed to his wound.   Mr. Speaker, David Sherrard served with the Richardson Police  Department for 13 years. He was known for his generosity and bravery,  but above all, he was known for his faith in God, which he shared with  others.   Sherrard was the first Richardson police officer to die in the line  of duty. His death is a great loss. His wife and daughters remain in my  thoughts and prayers.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the service  and sacrifice of David Sherrard, a true hometown hero.                            ____________________
