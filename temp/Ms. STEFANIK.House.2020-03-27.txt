 Mr. Speaker, New York is the epicenter of the  coronavirus crisis today, and I want to thank our North Country heroes  on the front lines: our nurses, our doctors, our hospital personnel,  EMS first responders, teachers, grocers, and truckers.   The better angels of our nature are among us each and every day:  volunteers coming forward, quilting groups in the Adirondacks, students  using 3D printers, and mask making from Sackets Harbor to Saratoga  Flag.   This emergency bill needed to pass yesterday. It needed to pass last  week. New Yorkers and this Nation need this relief immediately for our  hospitals, healthcare heroes, and hardworking families.   This country is a resilient nation, from the American Revolution to  the Civil War, to the pandemic flu, to 9/11, we will overcome this.  Congress needs to step up, do our job, and pass this rescue package  today for New York State and the American people.
