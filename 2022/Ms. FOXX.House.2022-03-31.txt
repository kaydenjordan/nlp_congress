 Mr. Speaker, the strides women have made across all corners  of the sports world deserve to be celebrated, not torn to pieces by the  far left's radical ideological agenda.   This year officially marks the 50th anniversary of title IX, a law  from 1972 that mandates equal opportunities for women in education.   While this anniversary deserves to be recognized, the threat of  President Biden's flawed interpretation of this legislation looms  larger than ever before. This administration's radical reinterpretation  of title IX to include sexual orientation and gender identity has  pushed women to the sidelines.   President Biden's decision to allow biological male athletes who  identify as transgender to compete in women's sports is an affront to  the progress that women have made since 1972.   Title IX was a revolution for women's sports. Since its passage,  title IX has spurred women's participation in sports by a considerable  margin. Instead of rightfully celebrating these achievements, the left  is willing to sacrifice them for the sake of its radical political  agenda.    Mr. Speaker, we should not be tolerating the left's assault on women.  We must ensure that the safety and needs of young girls and women are  made a top priority. Erasing sex and gender means, ultimately, erasing  women, especially when it comes to sports.   Girls and women at the top of their sport lose a fair chance to  compete when a biological male enters the field. How is this any  different than keeping women off the field altogether?   We can't let women's sports become collateral damage to the far  left's campaign against the traditional, science-based understanding of  sex and gender. Allowing women and girls to suffer for the sake of  being politically correct is the textbook definition of cowardice.   I am proud of the progress our Nation has made in the past 50 years  to uplift and affirm the rights of women. The prospect of those  advances being lost today is gut-wrenching. If we allow these fantasies  of the radical left to become mainstream, 50 years of progress will be  buried completely.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 6833.   Americans are rightly concerned about the price of prescription  drugs, but Democrats are trying to solve this problem in the wrong way,  as usual. Instead of discussing bipartisan, commonsense legislation to  address the rising costs of prescription drugs, we are debating H.R.  6833. This radical bill is another attempt by the left to advance a  government takeover of prescription drug pricing.   Don't be fooled. This legislation is a Trojan horse. H.R. 6833 claims  to address insulin prices, but what it actually does is opens the door  to government price controls without addressing the root problem, which  is the rising cost of insulin.   H.R. 6833 won't lower costs. It is a smokescreen that will raise  premiums for workers and seniors when inflation is at a 40-year high.   Why are Democrats knowingly raising healthcare premiums on the  majority of Americans when so many Americans are struggling to pay for  gas and put food on the table? Four out of five Americans in large  group plans already pay under $35 a month for insulin. This  [[Page H4043]]  bill will raise healthcare costs for the vast majority of working  Americans.    When insurers are required by the Federal Government to cover an  insulin product, this allows manufacturers to raise the price of  insulin indiscriminately. Since insurers can charge only $35 a month  out of pocket to the patient, the insurer must make up for the  increased cost of insulin by raising premiums for all beneficiaries.  With a lack of competition in the market, this bill removes the  bargaining power insurers use to keep insulin prices low, leading to  increased insulin prices and higher premiums.   This legislation will only worsen the root problem of high insulin  prices, which is a lack of competition in the market. H.R. 6833 will  lead to fewer approved generic insulin brands, making the insulin  monopoly even worse. If Democrats really want to decrease the price of  insulin, they should pave the way for more competition, not less.   This legislation will cost taxpayers $11 billion, giving the Centers  for Medicare and Medicaid Services $1.5 million in fiscal year 2022 to  administer these drug-pricing caps. Trusting the Washington bureaucracy  to manage drug pricing and distribution is a mistake. This legislation  would be the largest expansion of Federal control over Americans'  private health insurance since ObamaCare.   We must stop the Federal Government from wedging its foot in the door  of our healthcare system and moving us one step closer to a socialist,  single-payer system for Medicare for All. In fact, this week, the chair  of the Progressive Caucus said she was ``fighting to make it the law of  the land.''   H.R. 6833 sets a dangerous precedent. If the Federal Government can  set prices for insulin, what is to stop it from implementing price  controls for every drug on the market or in every other sector of the  economy?   The free market is the reason the United States outpaces every other  country in developing lifesaving cures and treatments, particularly  countries with socialized medicine. Federal drug-pricing mandates will  discourage medical innovation, resulting in fewer cures, which will  keep Americans from receiving the therapies they rely upon.   Instead of perpetuating Obama-era schemes to expand Federal controls  over Americans' health insurance, the Biden administration and  congressional Democrats should bring to the floor H.R. 19, the  bipartisan Lower Costs, More Cures Act.   Every single provision in H.R. 19 has bipartisan support. Lawmakers  on both sides of the aisle agree that this legislation will lower  healthcare costs and protect America's status as a leading healthcare  innovator.   Furthermore, H.R. 19 sets a new standard in healthcare affordability.  This bill caps seniors' out-of-pocket insulin costs at only $50 a month  in the Medicare program. It also allows for high-deductible insurance  plans to cover insulin before a deductible kicks in, and it increases  the availability of low-cost options for treatment in the marketplace.   The cost of insulin, like most healthcare costs in this country, are  climbing rapidly. Yet, total Federal control is not the solution.   H.R. 6833 is a perfect example of legislative trickery. This bill  will lower out-of-pocket costs for insulin for a minority of Americans  by bloating premiums and other healthcare costs for the majority of  Americans and leave our healthcare system worse off.   Supporting socialist drug pricing isn't a solution, which is why I am  rejecting this one-sided, harmful bill. I urge my Democrat colleagues  to support the Lower Costs, More Cures Act, bipartisan legislation that  will lower drug costs for Americans without limiting access to cures.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).    Madam Speaker, I believe I have the right to close, so I  will reserve the balance of my time.    I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I cannot let go past one of our colleagues saying  before that we don't believe in helping average people. Yes, we do.   Republicans are here every day. We are average people. We are here to  help average people. But what we believe in most of all is freedom for  Americans.   And we happen to believe that Democrats don't believe in that, and  this bill is an exemplar of the fact that they want the government to  control our lives in every way they possibly can.   In the past, Democrats and Republicans have worked together to bring  down the cost of prescription drugs, but Democrats have once again  pursued politics over progress.   H.R. 6833 is a massive power grab that will lead our country one step  closer to socialized medicine. That is not what the American people  think and want.   There is no such thing as a free-market system when government  bureaucrats control prices. This legislation sets an extremely  dangerous precedent.   We shouldn't pursue policies that will harm the health and well-being  of American patients, and we should not knowingly raise healthcare  premiums on American workers and their families when prices for goods  are soaring.   Republicans stand ready to work with Democrats to advance legislation  that promotes competition, lowers costs for consumers, establishes  transparency and accountability in drug pricing, and advances the cause  of freedom.   H.R. 6833 is not that legislation. I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.
