 Mr. President, I have listened to the remarks of our  distinguished colleague from Illinois who is the Democratic whip. I  agree with a number of things he says and disagree with some others,  but I do think we need to keep this in the appropriate context. We are,  in fact, talking about a provision of the Bill of Rights, the Second  Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and I hope we would never treat any  of those essential guarantees of American rights that precede the  creation of our government casually. It is important that we protect  all of our rights. The right to worship according to the dictates of  our conscience, the right to petition our government for the redress of  just grievances, the freedom of association, and the freedom of the  press are also part of the Bill of Rights, just like the Second  Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.   There are a number of things that we can agree on, and I have been  talking about one of them for some time now--the so-called Fix NICS  bill. It is probably not very well-labeled or branded because ``NICS''  is short for the National Instant Criminal Background Check  System. Basically, what it does is fix the broken background check  system to make sure that convicted felons, people who have been  dishonorably discharged from the military, people who have been  adjudicated mentally ill, people who have committed acts of domestic  violence--and a number of other categories--cannot legally purchase  firearms. Why? Because current law prohibits it.    We have already passed those laws, but as we saw in Sutherland  Springs, TX, one Sunday morning not long ago, 26 people lost their  lives and 20 additional lives were forever changed when they were shot  by a gunman who had lied and obtained firearms when he was disqualified  under the law from purchasing them.   The FBI maintains the background check system, and it wasn't their  fault because the background check system is only as good as the  information that is uploaded into the background check system. When  somebody goes into a store and tries to purchase a firearm and lies,  the background check system catches them and they are denied that  purchase. That is how it is supposed to work.   Recently, the attitude among some here in Washington seems to be that  this bill somehow doesn't go far enough. There are other ideas I am  more than willing to debate and vote on, some of which I actually agree  with, but none have the bipartisan consensus and support that this  particular Fix NICS bill has.   I was just told that now we are up to 70 bipartisan cosponsors. In  other words, 70 out of 100 Senators, on a bipartisan basis, support  this fix to our broken background check system because they know that  if it had been working the way Congress had intended, 26 people would  still be alive in Sutherland Springs, TX, and 20 more who were shot and  wounded would not have had to suffer those grievous injuries and the  painful recovery.   For example, as the Democratic leader--as well as some others--has  said: ``If we only pass Fix NICS, we'll be right back here after the  next shooting, in nearly the same place.'' He said that ``we won't have  done our job.''   Well, as I said, if there are other things that enjoy broad  bipartisan consensus, let's get them done. But if the attitude is that  we will not even vote on what we agree on because we want to do more,  we will never get anything done around here. Why not vote on what we  have agreed on, what people are supporting, and then, in addition, we  can work on other ideas.   As I said, at least 36 Senate Democrats have already cosponsored the  Fix NICS bill. That is 75 percent of the Democratic caucus, and the  numbers have been steadily rising. I hope they will go even higher.   I am grateful to the Democratic leader from New York. He, himself, is  a cosponsor of the bill, as is the Senate majority leader, Mr.  McConnell. I have never seen a piece of legislation involving a  controversial subject like gun rights get such broad bipartisan  support. It is truly unique. We ought to be grateful we have found a  place where we have such broad bipartisan agreement and, more important  than that, a provision that will save lives in the future.   If the shooter at Sutherland Springs had gone into the gun store to  purchase a gun and he lied, had the background check system worked as  it was supposed to work, he would not have been able to legally  purchase a gun because it would have revealed the fact that he was  disqualified from doing so.   Each of these tragedies involves different circumstances. The  shooters are always different. They obtain firearms in particular ways  and use them to perpetrate their crimes according to different plans  and in different settings.   I have already talked about the shooter in Sutherland Springs, who  actually was convicted of a felony after choking and kicking his wife  and cracking his stepson's skull. He was discharged dishonorably from  the military. He was detained in a mental health facility because he  was mentally ill. Yet he was able to lie his way into possession of  these firearms, forever changing the world of innumerable families in  Sutherland Springs, TX.   Under Federal law, he should have been prevented from purchasing  these firearms. Were it not for the breakdown in our background check  system, he wouldn't have obtained them. He would have been caught lying  when trying to buy these firearms and possibly prosecuted, and 26  people would still be living their lives, and the people who were  worshipping that Sunday morning at the First Baptist Church in  Sutherland Springs would still be doing so in that same location. It  has now been turned into a memorial for those who lost their lives that  day.   This is preventable loss of life. That is more than enough reason to  pass Fix NICS. I disagree with those who say that it doesn't do much.  If it saves lives, it does plenty. If our system had worked properly-- and ensuring it does in the future is what my bill aims to do-- Annabelle Pomeroy, the 14-year-old daughter of the pastor at First  Baptist, would still be here, and Ryland Ward, a 6-year-old boy who  survived, would not have been shot five times.   It is simply incorrect to characterize this bill as a pittance. It is  inaccurate to suggest that it really wouldn't do anything, that it  somehow is just window dressing or maybe a political fig leaf. That is  demonstrably false. Tell that to the families who lost loved ones that  day. They wish our background check system had stopped the gunman. Each  of them suffered a terrible trauma because it didn't.   It is also not true to say that Washington has been feckless or  absent in the wake of not only Sutherland Springs but Las Vegas,  Parkland, and all the rest.   On the issue of bump stocks, I agree with the Democratic whip, the  Senator from Illinois. These attachments to a semiautomatic rifle  turned it into an  [[Page S1723]]  automatic rifle. I have never heard of such a thing before, but if  automatic weapons are already illegal, why in the world would we want  to allow an appliance attached to a gun to turn a semiautomatic weapon  into an automatic weapon? I am glad the President has said that those  should be regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and  be unavailable.    We know that a lot of people lost their lives in Las Vegas; 58  concertgoers in Las Vegas lost their lives because of a man in a hotel  room, shooting down into a country music concert. There were 851 people  injured. The scope of the carnage was unbelievable.   We have also learned that mental health problems are some of the  reasons people do these sorts of things. We passed a law, most notably  last December, called the 21st Century Cures Act, which provides new  authority for families, when their loved ones are becoming a danger to  themselves or others, to apply to a court to get assisted outpatient  treatment to make sure they follow their doctors' orders and take their  medications. Then we train law enforcement on how to save lives in the  event of an active shooter incident.   We know the problem at Sutherland Springs was that the Federal  Government hadn't uploaded the information into the background check  system, which would have prevented the purchase of the firearm. But we  know the problem is present, as well, in the States.   In Ohio, we learned that there have been failures to upload  conviction records from at least 90 municipal courts--one that may have  allowed those barred from owning weapons to purchase them in violation  of the law.   Since the shooting in Texas, the Department of Defense has  retroactively uploaded 4,000 additional records of those dishonorably  discharged from the military into the background check system. Under  current law, these are people already prohibited from purchasing  firearms, but, of course, if the military didn't upload them, no one  would ever know, and they would be able to lie and purchase firearms.   One news account stated that since 2015, the number of people barred  from owning firearms because they were dishonorably discharged has  hovered at around 11,000 people, according to FBI statistics. Now it  stands at over 15,000. It is clear evidence that the background check  system isn't working the way it is supposed to. We need to make sure  that Federal agencies are uploading these records in real time, as they  are required to do.   We are taking action in other ways. I am also cosponsor of a  bipartisan bill called the NICS Denial Notification Act. It is  sponsored by a bipartisan pair of Senators--the Senators from  Pennsylvania and Delaware. This bill will alert State law enforcement  about people who lie and try to buy guns. If people go in and lie, the  background check system catches them, and then they are turned away.  Under current practice, that is never reported to the law enforcement  agencies, but it would be if that legislation were passed. When people  do this, their actions may be indicative of criminal behavior. That is  why the bill would insist that Federal authorities notify State police  within 24 hours if it is determined a person has lied in an attempt to  buy a gun.   Meanwhile, the Attorney General has announced that U.S. attorneys  will be instructed to more aggressively enforce laws that criminalize  gun buyers who lie on their background checks. I think all of this will  help be a deterrent, and, yes, I do think it will contribute to the  saving of lives.   The Justice Department will also increase the presence of law  enforcement officers at schools and review the way they respond to  public tip-offs with regard to safety threats.   We know the shooting in Parkland, FL, was a catastrophic failure at  almost every level--from the public education system, to local law  enforcement, to the FBI, to mental health providers. Looking back at  this shooter, local law enforcement actually intervened with him about  40 times. This was a blinking red light. People should have paid  attention and done something about it. We are now trying to make sure  they have the resources and the training necessary to intervene when  people are obviously a danger to themselves and others.   One way we are going to do that is with the bill offered by the  senior Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch--the STOP School Violence Act. This  bill would authorize $50 million annually for safety improvements,  including teacher training and training students on how to prevent  violence and developing anonymous reporting systems for threats of  school violence. It would give schools money for physical improvements,  such as metal detectors or bulletproof windows or doors. This is a  great step. It is not controversial, and we ought to get it done and  get it done now.   As the President has said: ``We cannot merely take actions that make  us feel like we are making a difference. We must actually make a  difference.'' One way we can do that is by passing Fix NICS.   Just this afternoon, a diverse community of victims' rights groups,  law enforcement officers, gun violence prevention groups, and  prosecutors sent a letter to the minority and majority leaders, asking  them for a vote on a clean version of Fix NICS before the upcoming  Easter recess. They said it would ``improve key elements of the  background system, particularly domestic violence criminal history and  protective order records.'' That is really an important point because  so much of the gun violence we see in America is in the context of  domestic violence--people violating protective orders, people  assaulting the person they are married to or living with. We need to  focus on this and do something about it.    This group of victims' rights advocates, law enforcement officers,  gun violence prevention groups, and prosecutors call the Fix NICS bill  a bipartisan, bicameral, commonsense, and noncontroversial bill. So why  can't we pass it? Why can't we do it today?   They made a point to note in their letter that the vote should be  clean; in other words, not conditioned upon or attached to other  controversial measures we can't pass. I think they are absolutely  right. I hope all of us will listen to this good advice and get this  done.   We tried to get an agreement a couple of weeks ago to take up the  bill and vote on it. If we did it today, it would pass this afternoon,  but there was an objection to doing so, saying, well, there are other  things we need to do too. Perhaps that is true, but to condition what  can pass--what does enjoy broad bipartisan support and what will save  lives--on things that will not pass and that aren't achievable means we  have a strategy of either everything or failure. That usually ends up  with us going back home emptyhanded, having nothing to show for our  efforts.   The people we represent deserve better. This institution should step  up and listen to those who are calling upon us to do something, and  doing something that will save lives, while respecting the rights of  all Americans under the Constitution.
