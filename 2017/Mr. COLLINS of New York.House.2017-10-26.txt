 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Officer  Craig Lehner, a Buffalo police officer who lived a life of heroism and  who tragically died during a recent training exercise on the Niagara  River.   Officer Lehner was a 9-year veteran of the Buffalo Police Department,  serving on the underwater recovery team, and also serving as a K-9  officer. His partner, a 4-year-old German Shepherd named Shield, served  alongside him.   Officer Lehner served our country for 16 years as an Army National  Guard military police officer. Having served in Iraq and Guantanamo  Bay, he was a well-decorated staff sergeant, awarded more than a dozen  medals for his bravery and military achievements.   Officer Lehner made the ultimate sacrifice, and we will be forever  grateful for his service. He will be remembered for his bravery and  keeping Americans safe both abroad and in western New York.   I offer condolences to his mother, Kathleen, and all of his surviving  family during this very difficult time.                            ____________________
