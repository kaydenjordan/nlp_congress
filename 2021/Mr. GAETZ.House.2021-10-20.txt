 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding because  I think someone maybe trying to kill me, and if they are successful, I  would like my constituents and my family to know who stopped their  arrest.   Madam Speaker, on October 8, 2021, a Twitter handle styled  @CIABobisatyourdoor tweeted to @repmattgaetz: ``Looky here, pal, I  lived in Portland. Portland has ordered a hit on you. I accepted the  contract. Have a good day.''   Following this tweet, this individual traveled to Washington, D.C.,  and the Capitol Police recommended his arrest. That is information that  was just shared with me by the Investigations and Threat Assessment  section of the Protective Services Bureau and, specifically, George  DiSesso. George shared with me that the Capitol Police recommended the  arrest of this individual and that the Department of Justice refused to  do so, declined to do so.   On the eve of the Attorney General testifying before the Judiciary  Committee tomorrow, it is just yet another example of the Department of  Justice having a double standard. If my name weren't Gaetz, if it were  Omar or Tlaib, you bet this person would have been arrested because  that is what the Capitol Police recommended. But the Department of  Justice doesn't seem to care so much when it is Republicans. I thank my  colleague for yielding to me.
