 Mr. President, today I am introducing the Foster Care Tax  Credit Act, with my colleague Senator Jones. Enacting this bill would  go a long way towards helping families with the expenses that come with  taking in and providing homes for foster children.   Currently, foster families are only eligible for the Child Tax Credit  if the same child lives with them for at least six months. Many foster  families take in children for shorter periods, and sometimes take in  multiple different children throughout the year. Even if these  placements add up to more than six months, these families are  potentially not eligible for the tax credit. Further, state funding for  foster care families often fails to cover the cost of meeting the  child's basic needs.   The Foster Care Tax Credit Act would create a new refundable tax  credit targeted at these families that take in foster children but are  not eligible for the Child Tax Credit. The tax credit would help ease  the financial strain that many of these families face. Further, the  bill instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services and Secretary  of the Treasury to conduct outreach to state and tribal agencies to  better educate foster families about provisions of the tax code that  may benefit them.   I hope my colleagues will support this bill to provide assistance to  families who have chosen to offer a loving home for children who need  it most.                                  ______                                         By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Risch, Mr. King, Mr. Crapo, Mr.          Merkley, and Ms. Collins):   S. 1614. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to modify the definition  of ``renewable biomass'' under the renewable fuel program; to the  Committee on Environment and Public Works.
