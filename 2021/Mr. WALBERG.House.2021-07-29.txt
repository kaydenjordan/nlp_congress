 Madam Speaker, across my district, Michigan families are  having to pay more for gas, for groceries, for cars.   You name it, there is sticker shock everywhere you look. In fact,  inflation attacks on everyone increased every month since President  Biden took office.   As Americans are struggling to pay for skyrocketing costs of daily  necessities, we should be doing something to address these pocketbook  challenges. Instead, this week, we are considering another round of  massive spending bills that will make matters worse on top of massive  spending bills that we have already expended.   Unparalleled and unchecked government spending is not the solution.  It is a root cause of rising inflation--and did I mention that is a tax  on everyone?   Again, this reckless spending and subsequent inflation are  effectively attacks on the American people, their families, their  workplaces, and, in fact, their livelihoods. We can't afford to  continue down this path. It is hurting too many families and their  financial security.   It is time we return to proven economic policies that create jobs,  increase wages, and do not prolong an inflationary crisis that--did I  mention?--is a tax on everyone.                            ____________________
