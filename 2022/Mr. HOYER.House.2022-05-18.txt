 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman for his  very generous comments and congratulate him for his leadership in so  many different ways, not only on this subcommittee, but also on the  Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which he chairs, and  which is so focused on human rights throughout the world.   I thank Mr. Cohen and Mr. Chabot for their leadership on this and  bringing this to the floor, bringing it in a bipartisan fashion. I  appreciate that very much.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the Congresswoman from Florida,  Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been a giant,  yes, on anti-Semitism, but on civil rights and human rights generally.  [[Page H5126]]    We understand that if one of us is at risk, all of us are at risk if  we do not honor the rights of each individual in our country. And, as a  matter of fact, that is one of the things that makes us so distinct.   This is an important resolution. It is a vital resolution. It is a  resolution that must be adopted so that Congress can make clear at this  moment, at this tragic moment in our history, that Jewish Americans can  feel safe and at home in our country, and that anti-Semitism has no  place here. Discrimination and bigotry and hate have no place in  America.   Throughout the month of May, we celebrate Jewish American Heritage  Month, as the gentlewoman pointed out. Why is that so important?   It is important because when we celebrate the achievements and  contributions of a community, we affirm that this community matters;  that those in it are valued members of our American family. That is why  Black lives matter, Jewish lives matter, individual lives matter.   But we know that there are particular groups who are targeted,  targeted for discrimination, and hate, and, yes, violence.   When we fail to recognize or celebrate the history and heritage of a  particular community, it sends a signal that they are not valued, that  they do not matter, and that they are not equal, that they do not  count.   Again and again throughout history, Jewish people were seen as lesser  than. Indeed, disturbingly, Jews were seen as less than human, which  inevitably led to the discrimination, violence and, yes, even the  genocide of the last century.   Jews who came to our shores were seeking a place to live in safety  and freedom. We should be proud of that, and we need to protect that.  Tragically, anti-Semitism followed Jewish Americans from the Old World  to the new one and has become a growing cancer on our body politic.   Too many Americans need to hear the loud voices of their Congress  calling out anti-Semitism because too many of our fellow citizens are  hearing leaders they support and trust either give voice to anti- Semitism or rationalize anti-Semitism. It is not enough simply to be  against anti-Semitism. We must not rationalize or temporize with anti- Semitism.   In recent weeks, we have heard more and more about the great  replacement theory, a twisted conspiratorial ideology rooted in  historic anti-Semitism and racism that has been used by those seeking  to justify heinous acts of domestic terrorism targeting minorities.  That is what happened in Buffalo.   We recall it from the billowing echoes of ``Jews will not replace  us'' from the marchers in Charlottesville in 2017.   We have also heard accusations of dual loyalty tropes about Jewish  financial and political control that inspired the Nazis and, yes, the  Soviets alike in their horrific persecution of Jews in the 20th  century.   Now, Mr. Speaker, in the 21st century, much of this anti-Semitism is  fueled online through social media. We must not ignore it. It must not  be allowed to metastasize.                                time  1430    We have a chance to do that today.   As we celebrate Jewish American Heritage Month, let us do so with  gratitude and with joy, but also with concern and vigilance: Concern  for what anti-Semitism does to Jewish communities in America and for  what it does to our Nation and our democracy; and vigilance against  those who would infect our politics and our culture with the same evils  that gave the world places like Auschwitz, Dachau, and Babyn Yar.   One of the most important ways Americans can support our Jewish  brothers and sisters in this country during this time of dangerous and  rising anti-Semitism is to say, ``We see you. We stand with you. You  matter. You count. You are part of this country and of our community,''  and to do so without qualification or equivocation.   Every Jewish American, like every American, deserves to feel safe and  respected in America. Period.   Let us affirm that today. Let us affirm it every day. Let us declare  that with one strong voice today and every day.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, before I start making my remarks, the gentleman who just  spoke is a member of the Republican Party. The Republican National  Committee passed a resolution telling the American people--and they  passed it overwhelmingly--that what they saw on January 6 was  legitimate political discourse.   A couple of law enforcement officers lost their lives, people were  injured,  [[Page H5149]]  people in the hallways yelling to hang the Vice President of the United  States and to kill the Speaker of the House.   Legitimate political discourse.                                time  1845     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio.    It was not, when they attacked anything.   You ought to visit the Speaker's home. She has protestors in front of  her home all the time. All the time, Mr. Speaker.   Legitimate political discourse is demonstration; it is speaking out.  And as a matter of fact, as the gentleman knows, we had this bill that  raised questions by those very concerned--meaning all of us--about the  legitimate exercising of First Amendment rights by all Americans; left,  right, and in between. The fact of the matter is that we worked hard to  make sure that what the gentleman who previously spoke asserted is not  true.   Secondly, Mr. Speaker, I will guarantee you that our side of the  aisle does not condone violence by either the left or the right.  Violence in and of itself should be rejected.   Now, Mr. Speaker, on January 6 we saw what happens when extremist  ideology disseminated online, in the media, and even by elected  officials is allowed to fester into violent action. And I repeat,  whether that happens from the right or the left is irrelevant. What is  relevant is the violence and the danger that it presents to individuals  as well as to property, I would tell my friend from Ohio.   Mr. Speaker, we see far too much these days of ideology being  transformed into violence, which is never acceptable and must not be  met with silence or acquiescence, or--I would tell the gentleman from  Ohio--rationalization.   Legitimate political discourse on January 6. Absurd.   In recent days, Mr. Speaker, we have watched families mourn those  killed in horrific acts of hatred in Buffalo, New York, where someone  who espoused white supremacy committed a mass shooting targeting  African Americans.   We have also seen this terror in places like Atlanta and Laguna  Woods, California, where members of the Asian-American community were  targeted with deadly violence. We saw it in El Paso in 2019 against the  Latino community and in Pittsburgh in 2018 against Jewish Americans.   This resolution does not condemn extremism on the right or the left.  It condemns extremism which leads to violence against people on the  right or people on the left or people who are neither right nor left  and are not politically identified as such.   Indeed, in the aftermath of these events, and particularly this week,  Americans have been learning more about the kind of violence-promoting  and twisted ideologies of hate that pose a clear and present danger to  our democracy, to the safety of our communities, and to the social  fabric of our country.   I condemn violence from the left, from the middle, and from the  right. And I would hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  would condemn, as vigorously, violence from whichever quarter it is  proposed. One of the worst of these, which is known as the ``great  replacement theory,'' is no more than a centuries-old form of prejudice  and bigotry which holds that minorities are conspiring to replace White  people.   This vile and false narrative is, sadly, not restricted to the dark  and distant corners of the internet where extremists lurk. It has found  a foothold in mass media and, shockingly, even among elected officials  and Representatives in this House.   Many in this House who have had the opportunity to condemn this  theory and those who espouse it have chosen silence. That kind of  silence, Mr. Speaker. Many in this House condemn violence from  whichever source, as I just said.   It is from that same kind of silence that the seeds of  dehumanization, persecution, and horrific violence were planted in  Germany in the 1930s. We know where that kind of rhetoric leads, and we  must not allow our Nation to go down that path.   This is one of the most pernicious forms of hatred that fuels  domestic terrorism in our day. It is incumbent upon us as the  Representatives of the American people and the guardians of our  democracy to ensure that those who espouse violent, extremist views  have no place in our government, our military, or any position of  public trust.   We have seen published by Members of this House images of violence,  of threats, of killings of one of our Members.   Hopefully, this bipartisan legislation will do that and will also  equip law enforcement with the tools needed to identify and stop  domestic terrorists--the head of the FBI says that our greatest danger  in America today is domestic terrorism, the head of the FBI--including  white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and other racially motivated extremists;  and do so proactively.   So everybody on this floor knows, I condemn unequivocally, of  whatever ideological bent there is, people using violence to promote  their political ideas, left or right.   This legislation also commissions numerous reports on the rising  threat to domestic extremism that will help guide future policymaking  on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, to stop these purveyors of evil from tearing our country  apart, we must act decisively, and we must act now.   I thank Representative Brad Schneider and Chairman Jerry Nadler for  their leadership on this very important issue.   I know, as I believe every Member of this House knows, that extremist  violence can reach anyone, anytime, anywhere, whether it be a place of  worship, a grocery store, or as we learned last year, this very Hall.    That is why, Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues of whatever  political persuasion--this does not adopt a political persuasion, but  it adopts the premise that the use of violence and hate and bigotry  should be shunned by all of us.   Our Constitution provides protection for almost any speech that one  can pursue--almost. Not all, if we place others in danger. Not all, but  almost any speech you can give. We are unique in the world in that  regard. We protect that, and we call it the First Amendment, one of our  most important amendments. It makes our country what it has been: a  free and open Nation for discussion and debate. It must not devolve  into the use of violence, the result of death, and the tearing apart of  our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge each Member to support that premise and support  this resolution.
