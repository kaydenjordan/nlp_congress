 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Lakeland Linder  International Airport on receiving their second Department of  Transportation grant, this time totaling $8\1/2\ million.   Lakeland Linder has over 125,000 aircraft operations annually and is  becoming a central hub for major companies like Amazon.   The airport is also home to the NOAA Hurricane Hunters, the Central  Florida Aerospace Academy, and Polk State College's Aerospace programs.   This grant provides the funding to make needed improvements to the  aging runway and infrastructure that will further attract new  businesses and jobs.   Well done to Airport Director Eugene Conrad and his team for their  vision and hard work. He contributes significantly to District 15 and  our economic growth, and we thank him.                            ____________________
