 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss H. Res. 114. The  resolution would expel a Member of Congress who faces 13 Federal  charges, such as stealing public funds and lying on Federal disclosure  forms. In addition, this Member has lied about his education,  employment history, and even his ethnic heritage.   This resolution is about more than one Member of Congress. It is  about more than the typical political party play that poisons this  Chamber.   It is about what is expected from a Member of Congress. It is about  ethics, morality, and character. It is an opportunity to restore faith  in the United States' Congress. Finally, it is an opportunity to show  the country that there are consequences to actions.   Many of us have children, and we tell our children that telling the  truth matters. Now we have a chance to support our words with action  and declare that such behavior will not be tolerated in Congress.                            ____________________
