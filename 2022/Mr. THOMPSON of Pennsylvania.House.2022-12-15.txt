 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  a very special tradition taking place this Saturday, December 17.   Every year, thousands of volunteers set out across the country and  the world in a coordinated wreath-laying ceremony. This ceremony is  known as National Wreaths Across America Day.   In 1992, Morrill Worcester, from Harrington, Maine, noticed that he  had an abundance of holiday wreaths and decided to take the opportunity  to honor our country's veterans. After contacting his Senator,  arrangements were made for wreaths to be placed at Arlington in an  older section of the cemetery.   This tradition would quietly continue until 2005 when a photo of the  tombstones decorated with wreaths and covered with snow went viral.  From there, this quiet annual tribute to remember those who have made  the ultimate sacrifice turned into a mission to remember, honor, and  teach.   Since the viral photo, Wreaths Across America has continued to grow.  This Saturday, volunteers will lay wreaths at more than 2,500 locations  in the United States, abroad, and at sea. This simple gesture is a way  for all of us to express our appreciation during the holiday season.
