 Mr. Speaker, the American people want to know  that their government will be there for them. They want to know that  their tax dollars will pay dividends for them. They want to know that  we will promote the general welfare as extolled in the preamble to the  Constitution. They want to know that we will not allow the perfect to  become the enemy of the good.   This is not a perfect bill. It is a good bill. I will support it. The  American people need certainty. They want to know that we will be there  for them.                                time  1240
