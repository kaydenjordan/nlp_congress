 Mr. Speaker, today has been a tough day as we watch an  extremist and politicized Supreme Court roll back protections Americans  have relied on for decades. But there is good news coming out of  Congress. We have come together to pass the most comprehensive gun  safety package in almost three decades.   In New Jersey, we have already passed a large number of these  proposals, including extreme risk protections, assault weapons  safeguards, and high-capacity magazine prohibitions, and we have seen  the results.   New Jersey has made major progress in combating gun violence. As of  2020, my State has the third lowest level of firearm mortality,  according to the CDC. Think about that. The most densely populated  State in the Nation has one of the lowest levels of gun violence in the  Nation. As the rate of gun deaths has increased by 33 percent  nationwide, in New Jersey, it actually fell by 10 percent.   Of course, as a mother, I am focused on keeping our kids safe. This  law would have prevented the shooter in Uvalde from getting a firearm  without an enhanced background check.    This law gives States the support they need to act when  a mom worries that her child is contemplating suicide.   It is why everyone from the American Society of Pediatrics to the  Fraternal Order of Police has endorsed this bipartisan bill.   It is time for my Republican colleagues to put our Nation's kids  ahead of the gun lobby.
