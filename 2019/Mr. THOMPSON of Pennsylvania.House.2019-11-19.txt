 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  November 21 as National Rural Health Day.   Nearly 60 million Americans call rural America home. It is a great  place to live, to work, and to raise a family.   To ensure the vitality and vibrancy of rural America, investments in  infrastructure, technology, and healthcare are critical. Americans in  every corner of the Nation deserve access to reliable, quality  healthcare, but rural America faces its own unique health challenges  that need to be addressed.   Sadly, rural Americans are more likely than those in urban areas to  die prematurely from heart disease, cancer, unintentional injury,  chronic lower respiratory disease, and stroke, the Nation's five  leading causes of death.   Rural America is no stranger to healthcare struggles, including long  [[Page H8962]]  distances to the closest hospital, many uninsured or underinsured  residents, and a larger number of aging residents with chronic  conditions.   Another issue is simply the lack of doctors and providers. There are  only 40 physicians for every 100,000 people in rural America. This  leads to unserved patients and overworked medical professionals.   One way to address these issues is through telemedicine. Telemedicine  can reduce healthcare barriers, increase access, and bolster  convenience for millions of Americans.   Telemedicine is critical in ensuring increased access to care for  Americans who live many miles away from a hospital or a doctor's  office. It can also make a difference in the lives of limited-mobility  Americans, like those who may be elderly or living with different types  of disabilities.   Another way to improve the health of rural Americans who may be  considered low-income is to address out-of-pocket costs for Medicaid  expenses.   Something that needs to be addressed for seniors in not only rural  America but also across the country is the misuse of direct and  indirect remuneration, or DIR, and how it has impacted the part D drug  plans. Over the years, DIR has become a catchall for pharmacy fees,  which has unfairly shifted additional costs onto Medicaid patients.   While progress has been made with the 2018 Medicare part D pricing  rule, there is still much more to be done. That is why I cosponsored  H.R. 1034, the Phair Pricing Act. This bill directly addresses  necessary reforms to DIR fees by doing four key things.   First, the Phair Pricing Act will require all price concessions  between a pharmacy and a pharmacy benefits manager be included at the  point of sale to decrease patient costs.   Second, the bill will realign market incentives to ensure patients  have access to and receive the best possible care.   Third, the Phair Pricing Act will direct the Secretary of Health and  Human Services to establish a working group of stakeholders to create  quality measures based on a pharmacy's practice.   Lastly, the bill would ensure pharmacy benefits managers disclose all  fees, price concessions, and programs to the Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services.   Mr. Speaker, rural Americans deserve the best medical care available,  and we can improve options for them and for all Americans through  commonsense, bipartisan solutions like investments in telemedicine and  legislation like the Phair Pricing Act.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this weekend I had the  pleasure of joining volunteers of my district at the Port Matilda  Baptist Church for the monthly CommonFood distribution event.   CommonFood is an organization that works to provide underserved and  underemployed elderly, single-parent families, and low-income families  in western Centre County with nutritious food.   CommonFood feeds approximately 140 to 150 families in the area. Each  month these families receive a box of food valued at approximately $150  filled with meat, produce, and nonperishables.   Organizations like CommonFood and our Nation's food banks play an  important role in supporting families who may need a helping hand.  Through the USDA's Emergency Food Assistance Program, States are  provided with food that is then distributed to local food banks and  soup kitchens. These organizations then distribute quality ingredients  to low-income households who are, in turn, able to provide their  families with nutritious meals.   Organizations that provide emergency food assistance play an  important role in the lives of low-income families, and they deserve  our support. I am proud to support the farm bill that provides that  type of support.                            ____________________
