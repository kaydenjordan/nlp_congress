 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Wayne County, Georgia, first responders for their efforts in handling a  recent plane crash in Wayne County. I also rise to honor the life of  Dr. Howard Wasdin.   On Thursday, April 6, Wayne County emergency responders answered a  dispatch to a report of a missing aircraft. About 30 minutes later, the  plane was located approximately a quarter mile from the William A. Zorn  Airport.   The pilot has been identified as Dr. Howard Wasdin, who was a highly  decorated Navy Seal. He served in Desert Storm and was part of the  operation to capture Mohamed Farrah Aidid, a Somali warlord.   After 12 years of service, he earned his doctor of chiropractor from  Life University and lived in Georgia, where he operated a chiropractic  clinic.   This situation has been particularly difficult due to the impact it  has had on Dr. Wasdin's family and the community at large. I thank all  of the first responders for their tireless efforts in responding to  this tragic accident.   Dr. Wasdin will be missed greatly by all who knew him. My thoughts  and prayers are with him and his family.                            ____________________
