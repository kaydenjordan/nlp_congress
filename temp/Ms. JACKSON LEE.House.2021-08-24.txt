 Madam Speaker, I am very proud to be able to stand  here today remembering the Constitution and saying to my good friends  that this floor belongs to the American people. This floor is a floor,  as John  [[Page H4366]]  Lewis has often challenged us, that calls upon us to be courageous.   I am also here to say to you that I have no doubt that the United  States military, with the will of the American people, will ensure that  all Americans come out of Afghanistan and our allies. But at the same  time, I am grateful for the idea of a build back America act that will  have Texas get universal pre-K childcare, tuition-free community  college. And then, of course, the invest act that will see us get $537  million for bridges, $100 million for broadband, $3.3 billion for  public transit so that our climate can improve.   I know that the Texas delegation, State representatives who  sacrificed and came to this Nation's Capital to cry out for justice,  Texas Democratic representatives who are here in this place now, that  H.R. 4 is going to save the day, not partisan, but it is going to make  us a democratic Republic. And we need to pass H.R. 4 because John Lewis  said: Do you have any courage?   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and an  original cosponsor, I rise today in strong support of the Rule  governing debate of Senate Amendment to H.R. 3684, Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act; S. Con. Res. 14, Budget Resolution For Build  Back Better Plan; and H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement  Act.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary,  on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, I rise in strong support of  the Rule governing debate of Senate Amendment to H.R. 3684, the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which represents the most  significant long-term investment in the United States' infrastructure  and competitiveness in nearly a century.   This legislation will make life better for Americans across the  country, create a generation of good-paying union jobs, grow our  economy, invest in communities that have too often been left behind,  and better position the United States to compete globally and win in  the 21st century.   The United States is the wealthiest country in the world, yet after  decades of underinvestment, the country's roads, bridges, and water  systems are crumbling, and our electric grid is vulnerable to  catastrophic outages.   Too many families lack access to affordable, high-speed internet,  clean drinking water, and public transportation, and too often, past  infrastructure investments have disproportionately and negatively  impacted low-income neighborhoods and communities of color.   Investing in our infrastructure--and investing in communities across  the country--can create millions of good-paying jobs in underserved  areas and lay the groundwork for not only a full economic recovery from  the pandemic, but also usher in a new era of American innovation and  prosperity.   The historic Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act invests $550  billion in new federal investment to make an array of transformational  investments in our country's infrastructure including:   $121 billion to repair and rebuild our roads and bridges with a focus  on climate change mitigation, resilience, equity, and safety for all  users, including cyclists and pedestrians.   $89.9 billion to modernize America's public transit, by increasing  routes, reducing the transit maintenance backlog, and providing more  frequent service, resulting in better options for riders, improved  environmental outcomes, and increased access to jobs and essential  destinations.   $66 billion to modernize and expand passenger and freight rail  networks across the country, to position our railways to play a central  role in our transportation and economic future.   $15 billion in zero emission and clean buses and ferries and to build  the first-ever national network of electric vehicle chargers in the  United States, in order to address the adoption of electric vehicles  and support domestic manufacturing jobs.   $42 billion to modernize our airports, ports, and waterways;   $50 billion to weatherize our infrastructure and insulate it against  the threats of droughts, floods, and wildfires.   $55 billion to drinking water infrastructure, including eliminating  the Nation's lead service lines and pipes, thereby delivering clean  drinking water to up to ten million American families and more than  400,000 schools and child care facilities that currently do not have  it, including in Tribal nations and disadvantaged communities.   $65 billion to upgrade our power infrastructure to facilitate the  expansion of renewable energy.   $21 billion in environmental remediation, making it the largest  investment in addressing the legacy pollution that harms the public  health of communities and neighborhoods in American history.   $65 billion to connect every American to reliable high-speed  internet, building on the billions of dollars for broadband deployment  in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.   Across this country, far too many communities are struggling with  crumbling roads and structurally unsound bridges, outrageous  congestion, lead-coated pipes and no broadband access.   The Senate Amendment to H.R. 3684 addresses economic disparities in  our economy and the consequences of decades of disinvestment in  America's infrastructure that have fallen most heavily on communities  of color.   Through critical investments, the legislation increases access to  good-paying jobs, affordable high-speed internet, reliable public  transit, clean drinking water and other resources to ensure communities  of color get a fair shot at the American dream.   These critical investments are first steps in advancing equity and  racial justice throughout our economy.   Additional investments are needed in our nation's caregiving  infrastructure, housing supply, regional development, and workforce  development programs to ensure that communities of color and other  underserved communities can access economic opportunity and justice.   This bill will address these challenges, and will also deliver much- needed investment to my home state of Texas, making life better for  millions of Texas residents.   Specifically, under the bill, Texas is expected to receive:   $26.9 billion for federal-aid highway apportioned programs and $537  million for bridge replacement and repairs with a focus on climate  change mitigation, resilience, equity, and safety for all users,  including cyclists and pedestrians;   $3.3 billion over five years to improve public transportation options  across the state through healthy, sustainable transportation options  for millions of Americans;   $408 million over five years to support the expansion of an EV  charging network in the state; and   Texas will also have the opportunity to apply for the $2.5 billion in  grant funding dedicated to EV charging in the bill;   A minimum allocation of $100 million to help provide broadband  coverage across the state, including providing access to at least  1,058,000 Texans who currently lack it.   In addition, 8,381,000 or 29% of people in Texas will be eligible for  the Affordability Connectivity Benefit, which will help low-income  families afford internet access.   Madam Speaker, in sum, I encourage all members to support the Rule  governing debate of Senate Amendment to H.R. 3684 Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act, so that we can invest in strengthening our  infrastructure and competitiveness, and do so in a way that creates the  good-paying union jobs of the future, addresses long-standing racial  and economic injustice, and helps to fight the climate crisis.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary,  on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, I rise in strong support of  the Rule governing debate of S. Con. Res. 14, which reorders budgetary  priorities to provide $3.5 trillion investments to build back better  and provides reconciliation instructions to 13 House and 12 Senate  committees to support visionary and transformative investments in the  health, well-being, and financial security of America's workers and  families.   It is often said that the federal budget is an expression of the  nation's values and the budget resolution before us is a clear  declaration of congressional Democrats' commitment to ensuring that our  government, our economy, and our systems work For The People.   Madam Speaker, these long-overdue investments in America's future  will be felt in every corner of the country and across every sector of  American life, building on the success of the American Rescue Plan,  accommodating historic infrastructure investments in the legislative  pipeline, and addressing long-standing deficits in our communities by  ending an era of chronic underinvestment so we can emerge from our  current crises a stronger, more equitable nation.   Should our friends across the aisle join us in this endeavor, it  would send a powerful signal to the American people if our colleagues  across the aisle would join us in this effort because nothing would  better show them that their elected representatives can set  partisanship aside and put America first.   And that bipartisan achievement would portend success for similar  initiatives in the area of strengthening the infrastructure of  democracy in which every American has a vital interest, national and  homeland security, and criminal justice and immigration reform.   I would urge my Republican colleagues to heed the words of Republican  Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia who said colorfully several  months ago, ``At this point in time in this nation, we need to go big.  We need to quit counting the egg-sucking legs on the  [[Page H4367]]  cows and count the cows and just move. And move forward and move right  now.''   The same sentiment was expressed more eloquently by Abraham Lincoln  in 1862 when he memorably wrote:   ``The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present.  The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the  occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We  must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.''   Madam Speaker, the bipartisan action we took in February 2021 when we  passed the American Rescue Plan was a giant step in the right  direction, but it was a targeted response to the immediate and urgent  public health and economic crises; it was not a long-term solution to  many of the pressing challenges facing our nation that have built up  over decades of disinvestment in our nation and its people in every  region and sector of the country.   We simply can no longer afford the costs of neglect and inaction; the  time to act is now.   The Build Back Better Plan makes the transformative investments that  we need to continue growing our economy, lower costs for working  families, and position the United States as a global leader in  innovation and the jobs of the future.   This $3.5 trillion gross investment will build on the successes of  the American Rescue Plan and set our nation on a path of fiscal  responsibility and broadly shared prosperity for generations to come.   The Build Back Better Plan will provide resources to improve our  education, health, and child care systems, invest in clean energy and  sustainability, address the housing crisis, and more; all while setting  America up to compete and win in the decades ahead.   The Build Back Better Plan is paid for by ensuring that the wealthy  and big corporations are paying their fair share and Americans making  less than $400,000 a year will not see their taxes increase by a penny.   Let me repeat that: No American making less than $400,000 a year will  not see their taxes increase by a penny.   In sum, Madam Speaker, the investments made by the Build Back Better  Plan will expand opportunity for all and build an economy powered by  shared prosperity and inclusive growth.   Madam Speaker, while I am proud to strongly support this Rule and  underlying bill, I would be remiss if I did not express my  disappointment at the Rules Committee's decision to not include my  amendments to this bill.   Jackson Lee Amendments #6, #7, and #8 are easy to understand and  vitally important--they simply protect state legislators who, in  keeping with their sacred oath to uphold the Constitution of the United  States, refuse to perform unconstitutional acts under the guise of  legislative process.   Specifically:   Jackson Lee Amendment #6 allows for federal judicial review of any  warrants issued for the arrest of a state legislator where said state  legislator refuses to engage in the state legislative process due to a  reasonably held belief that doing so would infringe on the right to  vote.   Jackson Lee Amendment #7 inserts a Sense of the Congress stating that  a state's power to arrest a duly elected representative of a  constituency for refusal to engage in a state's legislative process  should be subject to federal judicial review where such elected  representative's refusal is premised upon a reasonable belief that  participation would result in the suppression of voting rights or other  violations of the Constitution of the United States of America.   Jackson Lee Amendment #8 privileges against arrest any member of a  state legislature for any reason except treason or murder while the  legislature of that state is debating or voting on legislation relating  to redistricting or election practices or legislation relating to the  right to vote in federal, state, or municipal elections.   These amendments would have critically strengthened H.R. 4 because  state legislatures across the country are utilizing every weapon in  their arsenal to curtail voting rights; and no one should fear arrest  due to fighting for the Constitutional rights of their constituents.   This includes my home state of Texas, where earlier this month  officers of the Texas House of Representatives delivered civil arrest  warrants, signed by the Texas state Speaker of the House, for more than  50 absent Democrats in an attempt force a vote on the naked attempt at  voter suppression known as Texas S.B. 7.   This is the latest Republican attack on these brave state  legislators, which began on May 30, where after a night of impassioned  debate and procedural objections, these Democratic lawmakers in Texas  took action to block passage of this massive overhaul of the state's  election laws.   Since the arrest warrants were issued, it is my understanding that  mass intimidation of the Texas House Democrats has occurred.   State officials came to their homes with the purpose of dragging them  back to eviscerate the voting rights of thousands of Texans.   These elected Texas Representatives have had to hide away from their  friends, their families, and their loved ones, all to ensure that  Texans retain their most sacred of rights.   They are risking their freedom to ensure every Texan has full access  to their constitutional right to vote.   Texas Republicans seek to pass voting regulation laws focused on  diverse, urban areas, by setting rules for the distribution of polling  places in only the handful of counties with a population of at least 1  million--most of which are either under Democratic control or won by  Democrats in recent national and statewide elections.   Standing between all of this and the voting rights of thousands of  Texans are those brave state legislators who currently have a warrant  out for their arrest.   No elected representative in this great nation should fear that he or  she will be locked away for simply standing up for justice and ensuring  that America's citizens have the right to vote.   For this reason, I believe that H.R. 4 would have been greatly  strengthened by the inclusion of my amendments in the Rule.   I strongly encourage all Members of Congress to support this Rule and  the underlying bill, because it is the responsibility and sacred duty  of all members of Congress who revere democracy to preserve, protect,  and expand the precious right to vote of all Americans by passing H.R.  4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   Madam Speaker, I am here today to remind the nation that the need to  pass this legislation is urgent because the right to vote--that  ``powerful instrument that can break down the walls of injustice''-- faces grave threats.   The threat stems from the decision issued in June 2013 by the Supreme  Court in Shelby County v Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), which invalidated  Section 4(b) of the VRA, and paralyzed the application of the VRA's  Section 5 preclearance requirements.   Not to be content with the monument to disgrace that is the Shelby  County decision, the activist right-wing conservative majority on the  Roberts Court, on July 1, 2021, issued its evil twin, the decision in  Brnovich v. DNC, 594 U.S. __, No. 19-1257 and 19-1258 (July 1, 2021),  which engrafts on Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act onerous burdens  that Congress never intended and explicitly legislated against.   Madam Speaker, were it not for the 24th Amendment, I venture to say  that this conservative majority on the Court would subject poll taxes  and literacy tests to the review standard enunciated in Brnovich v.  DNC.   According to the Supreme Court majority, the reason for striking down  Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act was that ``times change.''   Now, the Court was right; times have changed.   But what the Court did not fully appreciate is that the positive  changes it cited are due almost entirely to the existence and vigorous  enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.   And that is why the Voting Rights Act is still needed and that is why  we must pass H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   Let me put it this way: in the same way that the vaccine invented by  Dr. Jonas Salk in 1953 eradicated the crippling effects but did not  eliminate the cause of polio, the Voting Rights Act succeeded in  stymieing the practices that resulted in the wholesale  disenfranchisement of African Americans and language minorities but did  not eliminate them entirely.   The Voting Rights Act is needed as much today to prevent another  epidemic of voting disenfranchisement as Dr. Salk's vaccine is still  needed to prevent another polio epidemic.   As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated in Shelby County v. Holder,  ``[t]hrowing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to  work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella  in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.''   For millions of Americans, the right to vote protected by the Voting  Rights Act of 1965 is a sacred treasure, earned by the sweat and toil  and tears and blood of ordinary Americans who showed the world it was  possible to accomplish extraordinary things.   I strongly encourage all Members of Congress to support this bill,  because it is the responsibility and sacred duty of all members of  Congress who revere democracy to preserve, protect, and expand the  precious right to vote of all Americans by passing H.R. 4, the John  Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article  with breaking news: The Texas Speaker of the House signs arrest  warrants for absent Democrats in bid to end chamber's weekslong  stalemate to fight against suppression and oppression in S.B. 7.                  [From the Texas Tribune, Aug. 10, 2021]     Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan Signs Arrest Warrants for Absent           Democrats in Bid To End Chamber's Weekslong Stalemate                 (By Cassandra Pollock and Patrick Svitek)         House Speaker Dade Phelan signed arrest warrants Tuesday       evening for Democrats who broke quorum to block a       controversial GOP elections bill. The warrants will be       delivered to the House Sergeant-at-Arms Wednesday. Credit:       Jordan Vonderhaar for The Texas Tribune. Sign up for The       Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on       the most essential Texas news.        Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan on Tuesday evening signed       civil arrest warrants for 52 House Democrats still missing       from the state Capitol as he aimed to regain the quorum       needed for the chamber to begin moving legislation during the       second special session.        The move was confirmed by Phelan spokesperson Enrique       Marquez, who said the warrants ``will be delivered to the       House Sergeant-at-Arms tomorrow morning for service.''        The warrants were first reported by The Dallas Morning       News. Democrats who may be arrested would not face criminal       charges or fines and could only be brought to the House       chamber. Dozens of minority party members fled to Washington,       D.C., during the first special session to block a GOP voting       restrictions bill.        The 52 warrants represent all but 15 Democrats in the lower       chamber. There were at least 11 present Tuesday. There were       no additional new Democrats on the floor Tuesday after four       returned a day earlier--and drew the wrath of some Democratic       colleagues still in Washington, and prompted a renewed push       inside the party to hold the line.        Earlier Tuesday, the House voted overwhelmingly to       authorize law enforcement to track down lawmakers absent from       the chamber.        That 80-12 vote came hours after the Texas Supreme Court       ordered that those missing Democrats could soon be detained       by state authorities. The order by the all-GOP court came at       the request of Gov. Greg Abbott and Phelan, both of whom had       asked the court Monday to overturn a ruling from a state       district judge that blocked those leaders from ordering the       arrest of the quorum-breaking Democrats.        In a statement after the warrants were signed Tuesday       evening, state Rep. Chris Turner of Grand Prairie, who chairs       the House Democratic Caucus, said it is ``fully within our       rights as legislators to break quorum to protect our       constituents'' and reiterated Democrats' commitment ``to       fighting with everything we have against Republicans' attacks       on our freedom to vote.''        Since the Legislature gaveled in Saturday for its second       special session ordered by Abbott, the House has been unable       to make a quorum as dozens of Democrats have remained absent       from the chamber.        When the House was unable to meet its 100-member threshold       to conduct business Monday, members adopted a procedural move       known as a ``call of the House'' in an effort to secure a       quorum. That move locks doors to the chamber and prevents       members on the floor from leaving unless they have permission       in writing from the speaker.        That vote earlier Tuesday marks the second time in recent       weeks that the chamber has voted to send law enforcement       after Democrats still missing from the House.        During the first special session in July, and after more       than 50 House Democrats flew to D.C., members present       authorized state authorities to track down their colleagues--      but the move carried little weight since Texas law       enforcement lacks jurisdiction outside the state.        By the time that first 30-day stretch ended last week,       Phelan had signed only one civil arrest warrant, for Rep.       Philip Cortez, a San Antonio Democrat. But that move came too       late since Cortez, who had briefly returned to Austin, had       already gone back to the nation's capital.        Intraparty pressure has been mounting on House Democrats       since the second special session started. After at least four       of them returned to the floor Monday, bringing the chamber       within five members of a quorum, some of their Democratic       colleagues who were still in Washington unleashed on them.       Rep. Ana-Maria Ramos of Richardson tweeted at the returning       Democrats that they ``all threw us under the bus today.''        Pressure ramped up Tuesday morning, when a coalition of       Democratic-aligned groups released a statement urging House       Democrats to hold firm and continue breaking quorum. The 21       groups included Planned Parenthood Texas Votes, the state's       Sierra Club chapter, the Texas Organizing Project, Progress       Texas, the Communications Workers of America and several       groups that advocate for Latino Texans.        ``To every pro-democracy Texas lawmaker: the only way to       preserve our right to vote and the best way to fight is to       stay off the House floor,'' the coalition's statement said.        The group also released a four-page memo arguing that far       more was at stake in the second special session than just the       elections bill, citing a ``host of radical conservative       priorities'' throughout the agenda. The memo was particularly       emphatic about a new proposal for the second special       session--dropping the quorum threshold to a simple majority--      calling it an ``ominous allusion to reducing or eliminating       minority rights in the Legislature, breaking centuries of       Texas bipartisanship.''        Meanwhile, a number of House Democrats have returned to       Texas but have not come to the House floor to help provide       quorum.        One of them is state Rep. Evelina ``Lina'' Ortega, who says       she is home in El Paso but not showing up on the House floor       until there is already a quorum or a majority of the       Democratic caucus decides to be there.        ``I pretty much feel that it's a shame that the governor       and Republicans . . . are really using the dirtiest tactic       available to them,'' Ortega told the Tribune on Tuesday       evening after the House's vote to send law enforcement after       the absentee Democrats. ``To me it's all about a power grab.       I'm glad to stay away and continue to fight them.''        As for whether she is concerned about arrest, Ortega said       she believes it would be a ``big mistake'' by Republicans.        ``We'll see what happens,'' she said.    This is John Lewis, and he says: ``We will stand up  for what is right, for what is fair, and what is just,'' and we will  ensure that we have courage, the kind of courage that is ``raw  courage.''   Today, I ask my Republican colleagues to reject the big lie, to  reject the insurrection, and to reject the idea that there is not voter  suppression.   I stand with H.R. 4, a bill that is the continuation of the  reauthorization that I have done over the years as a member of the  Judiciary Committee. I thank Chairman Nadler, Chairman Cohen, Terri  Sewell, all those who are part of this great effort, and our whip.   But the real important point is that we give the vote back to the  American people, to the disabled, to young people, to senior citizens,  and we reject that unfortunate statement. The State of Texas attorney  general, the secretary of state, never found any fraud in the election,  in particular in 2020.   I am very glad that this will particularly have the look-back. It  will protect us against such dilution and diminution.   This is a bill that has to pass, and the Senate has to pass it. Give  the vote back to the American people. Have raw courage.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and an  original cosponsor, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4, the John  Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which corrects the damage done in  recent years to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and commits the national  government to protecting the right of all Americans to vote free from  discrimination and without injustices that previously prevented them  from exercising this most fundamental right of citizenship.   I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Terri Sewell of Alabama for  introducing this  [[Page H4401]]  legislation, to Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Nadler, and the Democratic  leadership, and to the many colleagues and countless number of ordinary  Americans who never stopped agitating and working to protect the  precious right to vote.   Madam Speaker, in response to the Supreme Court's invitation in  Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), H.R. 4 provides a new  coverage formula based on ``current conditions'' and creates a new  coverage formula that hinges on a finding of repeated voting rights  violations in the preceding 25 years.   It is significant that this 25-year period is measured on a rolling  basis to keep up with ``current conditions,'' so only states and  political subdivisions that have a recent record of racial  discrimination in voting are covered.   States and political subdivisions that qualify for preclearance will  be covered for a period of 10 years, but if they have a clean record  during that time period, they can be extracted from coverage.   H.R. 4 also establishes ``practice-based preclearance,'' which would  focus administrative or judicial review narrowly on suspect practices  that are most likely to be tainted by discriminatory intent or to have  discriminatory effects, as demonstrated by a broad historical record.   Under the bill, this process of reviewing changes in voting is  limited to a set of specific practices, including such things as:   1. Changes to the methods of elections (to or from at-large  elections) in areas that are racially, ethnically, or linguistically  diverse.   2. Redistricting in areas that are racially, ethnically, or  linguistically diverse.   3. Reducing, consolidating, or relocating polling in areas that are  racially, ethnically, or linguistically diverse; and   4. Changes in documentation or requirements to vote or to register.   Madam Speaker, while I am proud to strongly support this bill, I  would be remiss if I did not express my disappointment at the decision  to not include my amendments to this bill.   Jackson Lee Amendments #6, #7, and #8 are easy to understand and  vitally important--they simply protect state legislators who, in  keeping with their sacred oath to uphold the Constitution of the United  States, refuse to perform unconstitutional acts under the guise of  legislative process.   Specifically:   Jackson Lee Amendment #6 allows for federal judicial review of any  warrants issued for the arrest of a state legislator where said state  legislator refuses to engage in the state legislative process due to a  reasonably held belief that doing so would infringe on the right to  vote.   Jackson Lee Amendment #7 inserts a Sense of the Congress stating that  a state's power to arrest a duly elected representative of a  constituency for refusal to engage in a state's legislative process  should be subject to federal judicial review where such elected  representative's refusal is premised upon a reasonable belief that  participation would result in the suppression of voting rights or other  violations of the Constitution of the United States of America.   Jackson Lee Amendment #8 privileges against arrest any member of a  state legislature for any reason except treason or murder while the  legislature of that state is debating or voting on legislation relating  to redistricting or election practices or legislation relating to the  right to vote in federal, state, or municipal elections.   These amendments would have critically strengthened H.R. 4 because  state legislatures across the country are utilizing every weapon in  their arsenal to curtail voting rights; and no one should fear arrest  due to fighting for the Constitutional rights of their constituents.   This includes my home state of Texas, where earlier this month  officers of the Texas House of Representatives delivered civil arrest  warrants, signed by the Texas state Speaker of the House, for more than  50 absent Democrats in an attempt force a vote on the naked attempt at  voter suppression known as Texas S.B. 7.   This is the latest Republican attack on these brave state  legislators, which began on May 30, where after a night of impassioned  debate and procedural objections, these Democratic lawmakers in Texas  took action to block passage of this massive overhaul of the state's  election laws.   With little more than an hour before the voting deadline, these  Democrats staged a walkout, depriving their Republican colleagues of  the 100-member quorum needed to pass the measure.   And when Governor Abbot called a special session in Texas for the  purpose of passing horrific voter suppression legislation, those brave  Texas Democrats rose to the challenge again and broke quorum.   Under the threat of arrest, those heroes fighting for voting rights  have escaped to Washington, D.C.   Since the arrest warrants were issued, it is my understanding that  mass intimidation of the Texas House Democrats has occurred.   State officials came to their homes with the purpose of dragging them  back to eviscerate the voting rights of thousands of Texas.   These elected Texas Representatives have had to hide away from their  friends, their families, and their loved ones, all to ensure that  Texans retain their most sacred of rights.   They are risking their freedom to ensure every Texan has full access  to their constitutional right to vote.   Although the Republicans have tried to spin this in many different  ways, let's be clear--Texas Democrats are taking a righteous stand for  our democracy.   Breaking quorum isn't an easy choice--legislators must leave family,  friends, constituents, and their important work for days or weeks.   But by making this choice, these Texas Democrats are fighting for all  of us, because voting is not a partisan issue.   Access to the ballot is a sacred cornerstone of our democracy, and we  must protect it at all costs.   Last month marked one year since we lost a champion for voting  rights, and the namesake of H.R. 4, Congressman John Lewis.   In his final words, he reminded us that, ``the vote is the most  powerful nonviolent change agent [we] have in a democratic society,''  and that ``Though I may not be here with you, I urge you to answer the  highest calling of your heart and stand up for what you truly  believe.''   We may no longer have John Lewis with us, but in his absence, the  Texas Democrats are following his example, and stirring up good  trouble, necessary trouble, for our right to vote.   They have followed the truth in his words and have sacrificed much to  follow the highest calling of their hearts.   Texas Republicans seek to pass voting regulation laws focused on  diverse, urban areas, by setting rules for the distribution of polling  places in only the handful of counties with a population of at least 1  million--most of which are either under Democratic control or won by  Democrats in recent national and statewide elections.   These bills would limit extended early voting hours, prohibits drive- thru voting and makes it illegal for local election officials to  proactively send applications to vote by mail to voters, even if they  qualify.   These bills are at the forefront of Texas Republicans' crusade to  further restrict voting in Texas, which saw the highest turnout in  decades in 2020, with Democrats continuing to drive up their vote  counts in the state's urban centers and diversifying suburban  communities.   Standing between all of this and the voting rights of thousands of  Texans are those brave state legislators who currently have a warrant  out for their arrest.   No elected representative in this great nation should fear that he or  she will be locked away for simply standing up for justice and ensuring  that America's citizens have the right to vote.   For this reason, I believe that H.R. 4 would have been greatly  strengthened by the inclusion of my amendments in the Rule.   Madam Speaker, I strongly encourage all Members of Congress to  support this bill, because it is the responsibility and sacred duty of  all members of Congress who revere democracy to preserve, protect, and  expand the precious right to vote of all Americans by passing H.R. 4,  the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   It is useful, Madam Speaker, to recount how we arrived at this day.  Madam Speaker, fifty-six years ago, in Selma, Alabama, hundreds of  heroic souls risked their lives for freedom and to secure the right to  vote for all Americans by their participation in marches for voting  rights on ``Bloody Sunday,'' ``Turnaround Tuesday,'' or the final,  completed march from Selma to Montgomery.   Those ``foot soldiers'' of Selma, brave and determined men and women,  boys and girls, persons of all races and creeds, loved their country so  much that they were willing to risk their lives to make it better, to  bring it even closer to its founding ideals.   The foot soldiers marched because they believed that all persons have  dignity and the right to equal treatment under the law, and in the  making of the laws, which is the fundamental essence of the right to  vote.   On that day, Sunday, March 7, 1965, more than 600 civil rights  demonstrators, including our beloved colleague, Congressman John Lewis  of Georgia for whom this important legislation is named, were brutally  attacked by state and local police at the Edmund Pettus Bridge as they  marched from Selma to Montgomery in support of the right to vote.   ``Bloody Sunday'' was a defining moment in American history because  it crystallized for the nation the necessity of enacting a strong and  effective federal law to protect the right to vote of every American.  [[Page H4402]]    No one who witnessed the violence and brutally suffered by the foot  soldiers for justice who gathered at the Edmund Pettus Bridge will  never forget it; the images are deeply seared in the American memory  and experience.   On August 6, 1965, in the Rotunda of the Capitol President Johnson  addressed the nation before signing the Voting Rights Act:         The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by       man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible       walls which imprison men because they are different from       other men.    The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was critical to preventing brazen voter  discrimination violations that historically left millions of African  Americans disenfranchised.   In 1940, for example, there were less than 30,000 African Americans  registered to vote in Texas and only about 3 percent of African  Americans living in the South were registered to vote.   Poll taxes, literacy tests, and threats of violence were the major  causes of these racially discriminatory results.   After passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, which prohibited  these discriminatory practices, registration and electoral  participation steadily increased to the point that by 2012, more than  1.2 million African Americans living in Texas were registered to vote.   In 1964, the year before the Voting Rights Act became law, there were  approximately 300 African-Americans in public office, including just  three in Congress.   Few, if any, African Americans held elective office anywhere in the  South.   Because of the Voting Rights Act, in 2007 there were more than 9,100  black elected officials, including 46 members of Congress, the largest  number ever.   Madam Speaker, the Voting Rights Act opened the political process for  many of the approximately 6,000 Hispanic public officials that have  been elected and appointed nationwide, including more than 275 at the  state or federal level, 32 of whom serve in Congress.   Native Americans, Asians and others who have historically encountered  harsh barriers to full political participation also have benefited  greatly.   The crown jewel of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is Section 5, which  requires that states and localities with a chronic record of  discrimination in voting practices secure federal approval before  making any changes to voting processes.   The preclearance requirement of Section 5 protects minority voting  rights where voter discrimination has historically been the worst.   Between 1982 and 2006, Section 5 stopped more than 1,000  discriminatory voting changes in their tracks, including 107  discriminatory changes right here in Texas.   Passed in 1965 with the extraordinary leadership of President Lyndon  Johnson, the greatest legislative genius of our lifetime, the Voting  Rights Act of 1965 was bringing dramatic change in many states across  the South.   But in 1972, change was not coming fast enough or in many places in  Texas.   In fact, Texas, which had never elected a woman to Congress or an  African American to the Texas State Senate, was not covered by Section  5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the language minorities living in  South Texas were not protected at all.   But thanks to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Barbara Jordan was  elected to Congress, giving meaning to the promise of the Voting Rights  Act that all citizens would at long last have the right to cast a vote  for person of their community, from their community, for their  community.   Madam Speaker, it is a source of eternal pride to all of us in  Houston that in pursuit of extending the full measure of citizenship to  all Americans, in 1975 Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, who also  represented this historic 18th Congressional District of Texas,  introduced, and the Congress adopted, what are now Sections 4(f)(3) and  4(f)(4) of the Voting Rights Act, which extended the protections of  Section 4(a) and Section 5 to language minorities.   We must remain ever vigilant and oppose all schemes that will abridge  or dilute the precious right to vote.   Madam Speaker, I am here today to remind the nation that the need to  pass this legislation is urgent because the right to vote--that  ``powerful instrument that can break down the walls of injustice''-- faces grave threats.   The threats stem from the decision issued in June 2013 by the Supreme  Court in Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), which  invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, and paralyzed the application of  the VRA's Section 5 preclearance requirements.   Not to be content with the monument to disgrace that is the Shelby  County decision, the activist right-wing conservative majority on the  Roberts Court, on July 1, 2021, issued its evil twin, the decision in  Brnovich v. DNC, 594 U.S. __, No. 19-1257 and 19-1258 (July 1, 2021),  which engrafts on Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act onerous burdens  that Congress never intended and explicitly legislated against.   Madam Speaker, were it not for the 24th Amendment, I venture to say  that this conservative majority on the Court would subject poll taxes  and literacy tests to the review standard enunciated in Brnovich v.  DNC.   According to the Supreme Court majority, the reason for striking down  Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act was that ``times change.''   Now, the Court was right; times have changed.   But what the Court did not fully appreciate is that the positive  changes it cited are due almost entirely to the existence and vigorous  enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.   And that is why the Voting Rights Act is still needed and that is why  we must pass H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   Let me put it this way: in the same way that the vaccine invented by  Dr. Jonas Salk in 1953 eradicated the crippling effects but did not  eliminate the cause of polio, the Voting Rights Act succeeded in  stymieing the practices that resulted in the wholesale  disenfranchisement of African Americans and language minorities but did  not eliminate them entirely.   The Voting Rights Act is needed as much today to prevent another  epidemic of voting disenfranchisement as Dr. Salk's vaccine is still  needed to prevent another polio epidemic.   As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated in Shelby County v. Holder,  ``[t]hrowing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to  work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella  in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.''   Madam Speaker, in many ways my home state of Texas is ground-zero for  testing and perfecting schemes to deprive communities of color and  language minorities of the right to vote and to have their votes  counted.   Consider what has transpired in Texas in recent past, let alone the  noxious voter suppression bill, SB7, it is currently trying to ramrod  through the legislature.   Only 68 percent of eligible voters are registered in Texas and state  restrictions on third party registration, such as the Volunteer Deputy  Registrar program, exacerbate the systemic disenfranchisement of  minority communities.   These types of programs are often aimed at minority and underserved  communities that, for many, many other reasons (like demonization by  the president, for example) or mistrust of law enforcement are afraid  to live as openly as they should.   In Harris County, we had a system where voters were getting purged  from the rolls, effectively requiring people to keep active their  registrations and hundreds of polling locations closed in Texas,  significantly more in number and percentage than any other state.   In addition, the Texas Election Code only requires a 72-hour notice  of polling location changes.   Next, take what happened here in Texas in 2019 when the Texas  Secretary of State claimed that his office had identified 95,000  possible noncitizens on the voter rolls and gave the list to the Texas  State Attorney General for possible prosecution--leading to a claim  from President Trump about widespread voter fraud and outrage from  Democrats and activist groups.   The only problem was that list was not accurate.   At least 20,000 names turned out to be there by mistake, leading to  chaos, confusion, and concern that people's eligibility vote was being  questioned based on flawed data.   The list was made through state records going back to 1996 that show  which Texas residents were not citizens when they got a driver's  license or other state ID.   But many of the persons who may have had green cards or work visas at  the time they got a Texas ID are on the secretary of state's office's  list, and many have become citizens since then since nearly 50,000  people become naturalized U.S. citizens in Texas annually.   Latinos made up a big portion of the 95,000-person list.   Texas Republicans adopted racial and partisan gerrymandered  congressional, State legislative redistricting plans that federal  courts have ruled violate the Voting Rights Act and were drawn with  discriminatory intent.   Even after changes were demanded by the courts, much of the damage  was already done.   Reversing the position by the Obama administration, the Trump  Department of [in]Justice represented to a federal court that it no  longer believed past discrimination by Texas officials should require  the state to get outside approval for redistricting maps that will be  drawn in 2021.   In addition to affirmative ways to making it harder to vote, we also  know face other odious impediments in Texas.   Those of us who cherish the right to vote justifiably are skeptical  of voter ID laws because we understand how these laws, like poll  [[Page H4403]]  taxes and literacy tests, can be used to impede or negate the ability  of seniors, racial and language minorities, and young people to cast  their votes.   This is the harm that can be done without preclearance, so on a  federal level, there is an impetus to act.   Consider the demographic groups who lack a government issued ID:   1. African Americans: 25 percent   2. Asian Americans: 20 percent   3. Hispanic Americans: 19 percent   4. Young people, aged 18-24: 18 percent   5. Persons with incomes less than $35,000: 15 percent   And there are other ways abridging or suppressing the right to vote,  including:   1. Curtailing or eliminating early voting.   2. Ending same-day registration.   3. Not counting provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct on  Election Day will not count.   4. Eliminating adolescent pre-registration.   5. Shortening poll hours.   6. Lessening the standards governing voter challenges thus allowing  self-proclaimed ``ballot security vigilantes'' like the King Street  Patriots to cause trouble at the polls.   The malevolent practice of voter purging is not limited to Texas; we  saw it in 2018 in Georgia, where then Secretary of State and now  Governor Brian Kemp purged more than 53,000 persons from the voter,  nearly the exact margin of his narrow win over his opponent, Stacy  Abrams in the 2018 gubernatorial election.   Voter purging is a sinister and malevolent practice visited on  voters, who are disproportionately members of communities of color, by  state and local election officials.   This practice, which would have not passed muster under section 5 of  the Voting Rights Act, has proliferated in the years since the Supreme  Court neutralized the preclearance provision, or as Justice Ginsburg  observed in Shelby County v. Holder, ``threw out the umbrella'' of  protection.   Madam Speaker, citizens in my congressional district and elsewhere  know and have experienced the pain and heartbreak of receiving a letter  from state or local election officials that they have been removed from  the election rolls, or worse, learn this fact on Election Day.   That is why I am very pleased that H.R. 4 includes language that I  worked hard to include in the Manager's Amendment to the Voting Rights  Advancement Act of 2019 that strengthens the bill's ``practice-based  preclearance'' provisions by adding specifically to the preclearance  provision, voting practices that add a new basis or process for  removing a name from the list of active registered voters and the  practice of reducing the days or hours of in-person voting on Sundays  during an early voting period.   For millions of Americans, the right to vote protected by the Voting  Rights Act of 1965 is a sacred treasure, earned by the sweat and toil  and tears and blood of ordinary Americans who showed the world it was  possible to accomplish extraordinary things.   Madam Speaker, it is the responsibility and sacred duty of all  members of Congress who revere democracy to preserve, protect, and  expand the precious right to vote of all Americans by passing H.R. 4,  the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.
