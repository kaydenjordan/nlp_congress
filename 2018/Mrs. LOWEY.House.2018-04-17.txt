 Mr. Speaker, our Nation still grieves the loss of a great  New Yorker, Louise Slaughter.   I will never forget when Louise and I, still just junior  Congresswomen at the time, charged up the steps of the U.S. Senate to  demand that Anita Hill be allowed to testify against Clarence Thomas.                                time  1800    Louise never lost that fighting spirit, fearlessness, and commitment  to justice, equality, and women's rights.   She broke barriers, becoming the first woman to chair the House Rules  Committee, and set a strong example of public services and principled  leadership as dean of the New York congressional delegation.   As a leading champion of women's empowerment, she proudly represented  Seneca Falls, the site of the first women's rights convention. It was  an honor to charge alongside Louise up the steps of the Senate that  fall day years ago, and during the many battles we fought together for  America's healthcare, women's rights, opportunity for working men and  women, and so much more.   New York, the Congress, and our country have suffered an immeasurable  loss. I do pray that Congresswoman Slaughter's family and the legions  of staff who served her may find comfort knowing her great legacy and  many accomplishments have improved the lives of so many Americans.
