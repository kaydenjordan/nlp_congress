 Mr. Speaker, despite the rhetoric on the other side of  the aisle, today is an exciting day for those of us who have been  working and fighting to end ObamaCare's reign over this country.   It is race month in Indiana, and I want to remind my colleagues that,  as exciting as today is, today's vote is a green flag, not a checkered  flag. It is the beginning of the race, not the end.   Today, the House will vote to move legislation forward that will  repeal ObamaCare and replace it with something far better. The bill  will surely undergo more changes as we continue this process in the  Senate, but it is on its way to the finish line.   There are some really strong policies in this bill. It cut taxes by a  trillion dollars on the American people, and government spending by  hundreds of billions, too. Despite the rhetoric, it keeps preexisting  condition prohibitions. No one with a preexisting condition will be  denied coverage because of the policies in this bill. Insurance  companies cannot raise premiums on individuals with preexisting  conditions as long as they maintain coverage.   The bill will also make sure 26-year-olds continue to stay on their  parents' healthcare plans as they enter the workforce. Most  importantly, though, the bill unshackles American families from the  mandates, taxes, and penalties that are costing these families  thousands of dollars each year.   Though ObamaCare helped some, we have to remember that ObamaCare made  things worse for millions of America, and that is where the national  anger has come from. I have heard from countless Hoosiers who tell me  the stories of their premiums going from $500 a month to $1,500 a  month, with deductibles that are through the roof, at $10,000-plus a  month. They have to spend $30,000 out of pocket before they even get to  their insurance. For a middle class family, that means they have no  meaningful insurance at all.   We can do better, and we will. That starts today.
