Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 424, the Department of  Homeland Security Clearance Management and Administration Act.   Mr. Speaker, before I begin, let me say I am pleased that we have  reached the end of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. I  am grateful to the women and men of DHS and their families for their  professionalism during this difficult month. We should all recognize  that they continue to serve our country every day by keeping our  citizens safe.   Mr. Speaker, I have reintroduced H.R. 424, the Department of Homeland  Security Clearance Management and Administration Act, to reform how the  department manages its security clearance processes. It is no secret  that the security clearance process is in dire need of change.   Since September 11, there has been massive growth in the amount of  classified material across the Federal Government. In many cases,  material is over-classified where it is kept at a higher classification  level or at a higher classification level for longer than needed. The  explosion in the number of Federal positions requiring security  clearances has driven an enormous backlog in security clearance  background investigations.   As of last Congress, the average waiting period for an initial  background check for a top-secret clearance was 390 days--more than a  year. The average waiting period for a reinvestigation of an individual  holding a top-secret clearance was 518 days--nearly 1\1/2\ years.   The delays caused by this enormous backlog represent very real  barriers to employment and promotion within government. Many  individuals with clearances do not actually need clearances to do their  jobs. According to a 2014 report by the Office of Management and  Budget, 40 percent of all individuals with clearances did not even have  access to classified information as part of their work.   Misclassification of national security positions is not only wasteful  of government resources but creates needless barriers to entry and  advancement. Clearly, the clearance system is in desperate need of  significant reform.   H.R. 424 would help put DHS on a path to rightsizing its ranks by  ensuring that national security positions are properly designated.   H.R. 424 would also require DHS to conform, from time to time, that  its security designations are still appropriate. This would ensure that  the department is not needlessly limiting the applicant pool for  positions that do not require access to classified information.   While the executive branch is exploring ways to improve the way in  which positions are designated for clearances, H.R. 424 would allow DHS  to become a leader in modernizing and streamlining this system.   Finally, H.R. 424 would require DHS to keep applicants' and  employees' personal information safe from data breaches.   Taken together, these reforms represent progress toward fixing the  broken clearance system. It will save DHS money, time, and other  resources by streamlining the clearance and designation systems.   Fundamentally, enactment of H.R. 424 would begin to break down  barriers to employment and promotion that prevent Federal employees  from advancing in their careers.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 424, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 424, which passed by  voice vote in the last Congress, will help improve critical aspects of  DHS' security clearance process.   The truth is that not every position requires a clearance, not every  document needs to be classified. Our intelligence and law enforcement  officials should focus their limited time and resources on protecting  materials that are truly sensitive. Access to those materials should be  granted carefully and appropriately to individuals who actually need to  handle those materials.   Enactment of H.R. 424 would not only make DHS a leader in this space,  but it would help break down barriers to employment and growth within  the Department. Mr. Speaker, I ask for my colleagues' support, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 495) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002  to require an annual report on the Office for State and Local Law  Enforcement.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                  H.R. 495         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Information Resource       to Strengthen Ties with State and Local Law Enforcement Act       of 2017'' or the ``FIRST State and Local Law Enforcement       Act''.       SEC. 2. ANNUAL REPORT ON OFFICE FOR STATE AND LOCAL LAW                     ENFORCEMENT.         Section 2006(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6       U.S.C. 607(b)) is amended--        (1) by redesignating paragraph (5) as paragraph (6); and        (2) by inserting after paragraph (4) the following new       paragraph:        ``(5) Annual report.--For each of fiscal years 2020 through       2024, the Assistant Secretary for State and Local Law       Enforcement shall submit to the Committee on Homeland       Security and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs and the Committee on the Judiciary of       the Senate a report on the activities of the Office for State       and Local Law Enforcement. Each such report shall include,       for the fiscal year covered by such report, a description of       each of the following:        ``(A) Efforts to coordinate and share information regarding       Department and component agency programs with State, local,       and Tribal law enforcement agencies.        ``(B) Efforts to improve information sharing through the       Homeland Security Information Network by appropriate       component agencies of the Department and by State, local, and       Tribal law enforcement agencies.        ``(C) The status of performance metrics within the Office       of State and Local Law Enforcement to evaluate the       effectiveness of efforts to carry out the activities       specified in subsection (a).        ``(D) Any feedback from State, local, and Tribal law       enforcement agencies regarding the Office of State and Local       Law Enforcement, including the mechanisms utilized to collect       such feedback.        ``(E) Efforts to carry out all other responsibilities of       the Office of State and Local Law Enforcement.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 495, the FIRST State and Local  Law Enforcement Act.   I thank my Democratic colleague, Ms. Jackson Lee, for reintroducing  this measure in the new Congress.   H.R. 495 would require DHS to submit an annual report to Congress on  the activities of the Office for State and Local Law Enforcement.   This bill was written, informed by a report I had my staff prepare to  look at DHS' progress at implementing the 9/11 Commission Act on its  10th anniversary in 2017. The report recommended that DHS continuously  refine its information-sharing networks.   Central to this effort is the Department's engagement with State and  local law enforcement. Specifically, H.R. 495 requires an annual report  that highlights the activities of this office.   Pursuant to H.R. 495, each report must contain detailed information  on existing programs and performance metrics to evaluate their  effectiveness. More importantly, each report must include feedback  received from these law enforcement agencies so that future  collaboration can be meaningful.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman  from Texas an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, nearly 18 years after the  September 11 attacks, it is important that we stand together and  recommit ourselves to doing all we can to prevent further terrorist  attacks at the Federal, State, and local levels.   Enactment of H.R. 495, which passed the House on suspension last  Congress, would help ensure that State and local law enforcement know  DHS is a full partner in securing their communities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 495, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
