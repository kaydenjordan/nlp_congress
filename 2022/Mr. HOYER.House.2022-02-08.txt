 Madam Speaker, I thank the chair for yielding, and I want  to thank both Mrs. Maloney, Congresswoman Maloney from New York, the  chair of the committee, and Mr. Comer from Kentucky.   There is nobody covering this right now. There aren't a lot of  Members on the floor. This will pass in a bipartisan fashion. But this  is a piece of legislation on one of the most important agencies of  government, the most important services to the American people, keeping  them in touch, getting them goods and services and prescription drugs  that they need, being able to pay their bills.   This bill is a very important bill. The interest in it in terms of  the public is belied by the fact that it is bipartisan and that,  therefore, it is assumed to happen.   But I tell you, Madam Speaker, this is decades in the making. This  bill has been debated--not this bill, but the reforms that this bill  achieves, have been debated for decades.   As the former chair of the Treasury Postal Subcommittee of the  Appropriations Committee, I know full well how difficult this process  has been, and it doesn't need me to say anything more about the  specifics of the bill, other than to thank Chair Maloney. She has been  tenacious. She has been focused, and she has been indefatigable in this  effort.   Madam Speaker, I want say that this would not have been done without  Mr. Comer, because it is easy to demagogue one part of the issue or  some other part of the issue. But the gentleman working together with  Mrs. Maloney has made this happen, and America will be better. The  Postal Service will be better. Postal workers will be better. And the  American community that utilizes and relies on the Postal Service will  have greater security and greater service.   So Madam Speaker, I thank Mrs. Maloney and Mr. Comer.   I thank all of those who worked on this bill in the committee, and I  urge its overwhelming passage on a bipartisan basis.
