 Madam Speaker, I rise today to protect our democracy.  Today, we take a stand against corruption and abuses of power.   What we are doing here today is not only patriotic, it is uniquely  American. America is a story of ordinary people confronting abuses of  power with a steadfast pursuit of justice.   Throughout our history, the oppressed have been relegated to the  margins by the powerful, and each time we have fought back, deliberate  in our approach, clear-eyed.   Each generation has fought for the preservation of our democracy, and  that is what brings us to the House floor today. Efficient and  effective in the pursuit of our truth.   Congress has done its due diligence. Today we send a clear message.  We will not tolerate abuses of power from the President of the United  States of America. The future of this Nation rests in our hands.   Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart, but a resolved one, and  because I believe our democracy is worth fighting for, I will vote to  impeach Donald J. Trump, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
