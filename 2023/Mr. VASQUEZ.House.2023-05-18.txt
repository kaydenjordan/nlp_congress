 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our local law  enforcement officers in New Mexico and across the country.   These heroes in uniform keep our communities safe. That is why I  voted in support of the POLICE Act because assaulting an officer is  never acceptable--never.   However, I have serious concerns about how this bill was written and  how it can be interpreted. The vague language creates the risk of  wrongfully criminalizing law-abiding people who are legally in this  country.   Let me be clear: Assault is never acceptable, especially when it  comes to our officers of the peace and to our first responders.   Our law enforcement put their lives on the line every single day to  ensure our communities are safe. For that and so much more, they  deserve our respect.   To my constituents, I want them to know that I am committed to  finding solutions to address our public safety issues with my partners  across the aisle and to support local law enforcement.                            ____________________
