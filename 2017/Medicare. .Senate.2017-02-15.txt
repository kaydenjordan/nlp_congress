 . . I'm not going to cut it.    On March 10, 2016, Mr. Trump said:         I will do everything within my power not to touch Social       Security, to leave it the way it is . . . it's my absolute       intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not       increase the age and to leave it as is.        It is my absolute intention to leave Social Security the       way it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as is.    It can't be much clearer than that.   On May 21, 2015, Mr. Trump tweeted:         I am going to save Social Security without any cuts. I know       where to get the money from. Nobody else does.    On January 24, 2015, Mr. Trump said:         I'm not a cutter. I will probably be the only Republican       that doesn't want to cut Social Security.    Those are pretty strong statements. What he just told you, in no  uncertain terms, can't be clearer than that. He doesn't want to cut  Social Security. He doesn't want to cut Medicare and doesn't want to  cut Medicaid. And you know what, millions of people actually believed  what he said. They actually thought that Candidate Trump was telling  the truth.   But now that the election is over, President Trump has nominated a  budget director, Mr. Mulvaney, who would cut Social Security, would cut  Medicare, would cut Medicaid, and would threaten the entire security of  millions of Americans.   We just heard the exact quotes coming from candidate Donald Trump.  Let's now hear the exact quotes coming from Congressman Mick Mulvaney  about his views on these very same issues.   On May 15, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said on FOX Business News:         We have to end Medicare as we know it.    On April 28, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said:         Medicare as it exists today is finished.    On August 1, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said:         You have to raise the retirement age, lower a pay-out,       change the reimbursement system. You simply cannot leave       [Social Security] the way it is.    On May 17, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said: ``I honestly don't think  we went far enough with the Ryan plan'' because it did not cut Social  Security and Medicare ``rapidly enough.''   Just 2 years ago, Congressman Mulvaney voted against the budget  proposed by House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price and House Speaker  Paul Ryan, opting instead to vote in favor of an even more extreme  budget by the Republican Study Committee. The budget that Congressman  Mulvaney supported would have cut Medicare by $69 billion more than the  Price-Ryan budget. It would have cut Social Security by $184 billion  more, and it would have cut Medicaid by $255 billion more than the  budget proposed by Chairman Price and House Speaker Ryan.   In fact, Congressman Mulvaney made it clear during his confirmation  hearing in the Budget Committee that he would advise President Trump to  break his promises not to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.  During that hearing, Senator Corker called President Trump's campaign  promises ``totally unrealistic'' and said that they ``make no sense  whatsoever.''   When Senator Corker asked Congressman Mulvaney if he would advise the  President not to follow through on the campaign promises he made to  seniors, this is what Congressman Mulvaney said:         I have to imagine that the President knew what he was       getting when he asked me to fill this role. . . . I'd like to       think it is why he hired me.    Whoa, what we have been discussing is precisely why so many people  have contempt for what goes on here in Congress and what goes on in  Washington, in general. What is going on here is that a candidate for  President of the United States says one thing in order to get votes,  but the day after he is elected, his tune dramatically changes, and he  nominates a number of people to his Cabinet and to high-level positions  within his administration who intend to do exactly the opposite of what  he campaigned on. Once again, Congressman Mulvaney--and I believe he is  exactly right--said:         I have to imagine that the President knew what he was       getting when he asked me to fill this role. . . . I'd like to       think it is why he hired me.    So the President hires somebody who has been one of the most vigorous  proponents of cutting Social Security, cutting Medicare, and of cutting  Medicaid after he ran his entire campaign telling the American people  he would not cut Social Security, cut Medicare, and cut Medicaid.   Outside of Capitol Hill, where real people live, it turns out, not  surprisingly, that the overwhelming majority of Americans--be they  Democrats, Republicans, or Independents--are opposed to cutting Social  Security. In fact, according to an October 2016 survey by Public Policy  Polling, 72 percent of the American people, including 51 percent of  Republicans, ``support increasing, not cutting, Social Security  benefits by asking millionaires and billionaires to pay more into the  system.''  [[Page S1207]]    As it happens, that is exactly the heart and soul of the legislation  that I will soon be offering. Legislation that I will be offering will  expand Social Security benefits, not cut them. It will do so by asking  the top 2 percent to pay more in taxes, which, it turns out, is not  only the right thing to do, but it is precisely what the American  people want us to do. Various other polls have reached similar results.  The people of our country--once you get outside the Congress and  outside of the Republican caucus, in particular--the American people  know that when millions of seniors, disabled veterans, and people with  disabilities are trying to get by on $13, $14, $15,000 a year, you do  not cut their benefits, while at the same time give hundreds of  billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top 1 percent. That is not  what the American people want.   In my view, we don't need a budget director like Congressman  Mulvaney, who believes that Social Security is a ``Ponzi scheme.'' We  don't need a budget director who once voted to declare Social Security,  Medicaid, and the U.S. Department of Education unconstitutional. He was  in, I believe, the South Carolina State Legislature, State Senate. He  actually voted on a vote--which got very few votes--in the South  Carolina State Senate. He voted to declare Social Security, Medicaid,  and the U.S. Department of Education unconstitutional. This is the  person whom President Trump has nominated to become the head of OMB.    So if you believe Social Security is unconstitutional, if you believe  it is a good idea to cut benefits for people who will be living on  $13,000 or $14,000 a year, I guess Mr. Mulvaney is your choice. If that  is whom my Republican colleagues want to vote for, that is their  business, but my job and the job of everybody is to make it clear to  the American people that the Republicans are far more interested in  cutting Social Security and in giving huge tax breaks to billionaires  than they are in taking care of the needs of the American people.   We need a budget director who understands that we have a retirement  crisis in America today. Today, more than half of older Americans have  no retirement savings. That is just an extraordinary reality. Over half  of older workers in this country have zero in the bank. Think about  what they are feeling when they hear people like Congressman Mulvaney  saying: Hey, you got nothing now. You are going to try to get by on  $12,000, $13,000 a year in Social Security, and we are going to cut  those benefits.   Today, more than half of older Americans have no retirement savings.  More than one-third of senior citizens depend on Social Security for  all of their income. One out of five senior citizens is trying to make  ends meet on income of less than $13,000 a year. I will tell you, I  hope people are able to sleep well, people who think it is appropriate  to give tax breaks to billionaires and cut benefits for people who are  trying to get by on Social Security checks of $13,000 a year.   In my view, we don't need a budget director who believes that ``we  have to end Medicare as we know it,'' nor do we need a budget director  who has said that ``Medicare as it exists today is finished.'' Let's  remember for a moment what things were like before Medicare was signed  into law back in 1965. At that point, about half of all seniors were  uninsured and millions more were underinsured. Today, thanks to  Medicare, about 45 million seniors have health insurance, and the  senior poverty rate has plummeted. Seniors are living healthier, longer  lives. Thank you, Medicare.   In my view, we do not need a budget director who supports cutting  Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, threatening not only the healthcare  of low-income people but also the nursing home care of millions of  vulnerable senior citizens and persons with disabilities. There are  millions of not just low-income families but middle-class families who  today are getting help with the nursing home payments for their parents  through Medicaid. If you make devastating cuts in Medicaid, you are not  only going to take away health insurance from low-income Americans, you  are going to put enormous economic stress on middle-class families who  will now have to pay the full tab for the nursing home care of their  parents.   Finally, there is another issue; that is, Mr. Mulvaney's taxes. After  Congressman Mulvaney was nominated to become the next OMB Director, it  was revealed that he failed to pay over $15,000 in taxes for a nanny he  employed from the year 2000 through 2004. Here is what Congressman  Mulvaney wrote in response to a question I asked him on January 11:         I have come to learn during the confirmation review process       that I failed to pay FICA and Federal and State unemployment       taxes on a household employee for the years 2000 through       2004. Upon discovery of that shortfall, I paid the Federal       taxes. The amount in question for Federal FICA and       unemployment was $15,583.60, exclusive of penalties and       interest which are not yet determined. The State amounts are       not yet determined.    This is a very serious issue. As you will recall, 8 years ago Senator  Tom Daschle withdrew his nomination as Secretary of Health and Human  Services after it was discovered that he failed to pay taxes for one of  his domestic workers.   On this issue, I agree wholeheartedly with Minority Leader Schumer,  who said:         When other previous Cabinet nominees failed to pay their       fair share in taxes, Senate Republicans forced those nominees       to withdraw from consideration. If failure to pay taxes was       disqualifying for Democratic nominees, then the same should       be true for Republican nominees.    Mr. President, here is the irony: Over and over again, Congressman  Mulvaney has sponsored and cosponsored legislation designed to prohibit  people from serving in the government if they fail to pay their taxes.  In 2015, Congressman Mulvaney voted for a bill in the House that  stated: ``Any individual who has a seriously delinquent tax debt should  be ineligible to be appointed or to continue serving as an employee''  of the Federal Government. Congressman Mulvaney cosponsored three bills  when he was in the South Carolina State Senate that would have  prohibited tax cheats from serving in the South Carolina State  government. In other words, it looks like there is one set of rules for  Congressman Mulvaney and another set of rules for everyone else.   In light of this information and in light of Congressman Mulvaney's  extreme rightwing record of attacking the needs of the elderly, the  children, the sick, and the poor, I would urge all of my colleagues to  vote no on this nomination.   With that, I yield the floor.
