 Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Higgins of New York) having assumed the chair, Ms. Underwood, Acting  Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union,  reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill  (H.R. 2740) making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health  and Human Services, and Education, and related agencies for the fiscal  year ending September 30, 2020, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment and  point out that our country really can't neglect vital investments for  the safety and welfare of the American people.   Our bill funds water resource projects that are critical, including  in Texas; supports science and energy technology research activities  necessary to build the future and our future competitiveness; and  responsibly funds a credible nuclear deterrent and important  nonproliferation efforts.   This amendment will harm all of these. It will harm job creation and  reduce protections against flooding and natural disasters that all  parts of our country have been facing.   One can be penny-wise and pound-foolish, and not making these  investments will make the costs in the future even greater.   This amendment will also result in fewer investments in water  resource infrastructure and energy research and development programs,  all of which  [[Page H4739]]  create good jobs, have substantial returns on investment, and position  our Nation for future needs.   We must continue investing in these areas to ensure our national  security on many levels and to remain the global leader in energy and  in science.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to oppose this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment, which really doesn't belong in this bill.   Section 108 prevents the President from siphoning off funds from  critical Army Corps projects to build a border wall. These include  important flood control projects to protect and restore communities  from natural disasters and navigation projects to keep our ports moving  commerce.   Our bill protects more than $20 billion in disaster funding  appropriated since February of last year to rebuild damaged Corps  projects and speed up flood control projects all over the country,  including in my colleague's home State of Texas, which has been so hard  hit.                                time  2000    It also protects funding for Corps projects that are currently  underway, or soon will be, including projects in every district across  America. Without this language, the President can raid funding from any  Corps water infrastructure project he wants and divert those funds to a  border wall.   Earlier this year, when it became public that the President was  considering using the Corps' Civil Works fund to pay for a border wall,  the backlash was swift and strong, with bipartisan opposition.   In fact, a number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle,  including those from Texas, tweeted that they had secured the  commitment of the White House that the President would not raid  disaster funding for their Harvey relief projects. If approved, this  amendment would strike the language in the bill that protects those  projects.   So I remind my colleagues that a ``yes'' vote on this amendment is a  vote signaling that they are fine with the President raiding Corps  water infrastructure projects in their district to build a border wall.   The President, on hundreds of occasions, may I remind you, promised  that Mexico would pay for any border security necessary to restore  order at our shared border. We cannot allow the President to dip into  accounts with infrastructure funds to assist ravaged communities across  our Nation.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.   And I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Napolitano), my esteemed colleague, chair of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Water Subcommittee.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H4741]]         Madam Chair, I would just like to remind the gentleman--I  think he is new to this body--that the President said he was going to  get Mexico to pay for everything. He said that 1,000 times. Didn't  happen.   He is not going to raid our accounts.   The gentleman has communities in his State. Unfortunately, he held up  the money for a long time about a week and a half ago; and so now he  comes to the floor and talks this way.   He is not going to raid the Corps budget under my watch; that is for  sure. Communities across this country need this money.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 436, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Madam Chair, this en bloc includes amendments from  Representatives Wasserman Schultz, Langevin, Grijalva, Castor, Bera,  Boyle, Omar, Lee of Nevada, and Garcia of Illinois. This includes a  number of ideas that were not included in the original bill, and that  we support.   Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the chair of the Military Construction,  Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Garcia).    Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to join me in support of  this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 436, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, this amendment includes a number of bipartisan and  noncontroversial ideas that were not included in the original bill.   Madam Chair, I support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa  (Mr. Loebsack), a highly capable member of the committee.  [[Page H4744]]         Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Lipinski), the indefatigable gentleman on our committee.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Foster), probably one of the top scientists who has ever  served in this Chamber.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ruiz).    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Lamb), a veteran.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin), a hardworking Member from the Wolverine State.    Madam Chair, I rise to ask for support of this amendment.  Thirty-four of our Members, many have come to speak on their particular  interest. I have reached agreement on a bipartisan basis. I think that  speaks for itself, and I ask the membership to support this amendment  en bloc.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Madam Chair, the amendment offered by my colleague from  Oklahoma prohibits the use of funds to prepare, to propose, or to  promulgate any regulation or guidance that references or relies on  analysis of the cost of social carbon.   It is really unfortunate that the Republican flat Earth faction is at  it again. This amendment tells the agencies funded in this bill to  ignore the latest climate change science. Astoundingly, the amendment  denies that carbon pollution is harmful. Wow.   According to this amendment, there is zero cost of carbon pollution.  That is denial at its worst. Ask any power plant operator who is  retired who contracted emphysema because of their work on those power  plants--and these people exist in our society if they haven't died  already--or heavy truck diesel mechanics who worked on retooling  engines when those fumes were in the garages when they gave their lives  to the public sector and they now have COPD, pulmonary disease.   This amendment is tantamount to saying that pollution caused climate  change, has no cost, and no one will ever get hurt. That is simply not  true.   Tell the American citizens who lost businesses, homes, and loved ones  to hurricanes, wildfires, and other recent natural disasters, and those  who continue to face unrelenting flooding in the Midwest that there are  no costs from climate change.   In the latest National Climate Assessment, our Nation's leading  climate scientists reiterated what we have known for years: Climate  change is real. It is evidenced by the climate-related indicators we  have observed, including longer seasons, extreme drought, flooding, sea  level rise, and more violent storms.   This amendment tells agencies funded in this bill to ignore reality  and these scientific findings. This is not only irresponsible, but a  blatant disregard to the well-being and security of this Nation and our  people, whom we are sworn to protect and defend.   The truth is that climate change is having catastrophic social and  economic impacts here in the United States and across our globe. These  are real. Ask the nearest farmer--and I just have been with them this  past week--who can't plant their fields in the Midwest. And those who  are less fortunate face the heaviest impact.   Now is not the time. In fact, that group of citizens who live in the  ninth ward in New Orleans below sea level comes to mind. Now is not the  time to pretend that extreme weather events, rising seas, and more  frequent storms do not have a cost.   Before the Trump administration abandoned common sense, the social  cost of carbon was a very conservative calculation. The full costs of a  rapidly changing climate are almost certainly significantly higher, but  measuring the social cost of carbon is a much better way than believing  the costs are zero. Unfortunately, that is what this amendment would  require the government to assume: zero harm and zero cost from carbon  pollution and climate change.   Pretending that climate change doesn't exist won't make it go away. I  urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, as the designee of Chairwoman Lowey, I move  to strike the last word.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta), my dear colleague.    Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Panetta).    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.             Amendment No. 91 Offered by Mr. Graves of Louisiana     Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.  [[Page H4749]]    I share the gentleman's frustration, but I would like to say that I  think the answer is that so many projects within the Corps have never  had the infrastructure funding that they have needed to move forward,  and our bill does provide a leap forward in that direction.   I think it is an understatement to say that the Army Corps today has  its hands full, and I don't think we need to add any confusion by  trying to tinker around breaking up agencies and so forth at this  moment.                                time  2100    Section 106 of the underlying bill was included in the bill after the  administration proposed breaking up the Army Corps and transferring  parts of it--arms, legs, heads--to other Federal agencies.   I don't really think that is in the Nation's interest. That plan was  met with wide bipartisan opposition from both sides of the Capitol.  Such a plan would require a plan to authorize that proposal, but of  course, the administration never presented Congress with draft  legislation.   Nevertheless, the administration doubled down on its shortsighted and  misguided plan and was set to begin planning efforts until Congress  stepped in last fall. The fiscal year 2019 Energy and Water Development  bill authored by my colleagues from across the aisle, included this  same provision which enjoyed bipartisan, bicameral support.   The Corps is responsible for the management of complex, multipurpose  projects, some vast, requiring expertise in many areas. Instead of  trying to break up and fragment the agency's responsibilities, I would  suggest that the administration focus on how it can make the Corps  successful in its current organizational structure, including deferring  to the technical judgment of the Corps instead of the constant  interference from OMB bureaucrats who have never laid a foundation, nor  operated spillways along the Mississippi or the Missouri, and so many  other responsibilities that the Corps holds across this country.   The Army Corps literally holds the lives and communities of the  American people in its jurisdiction. Let them do their job. And if they  are listening, they are cheering around this country.   I strongly oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to do the  same thing.   I yield to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson).    Madam Chairwoman, I would like to thank the gentleman for  those remarks and to say that I share his deep concern about the way  that OMB, in particular, has a tennis match with Congress when it comes  to the Army Corps of Engineers.   There is not a more important infrastructure agency at this moment in  our country than the Army Corps. The administration said it was going  to come forward with an infrastructure bill. Well, if they can't do  whatever they are calling an infrastructure bill, this is the  infrastructure bill for this country at this time.   The needs are enormous. I can't imagine. We have 8 divisions and 38  districts. I want to thank every single individual out there sworn to  protect and defend the American people who work for the Army Corps of  Engineers and give their lives to this profession across this country.   General Semonite is a great patriot, and as were his predecessors. It  has a long history, and we really need to have more attention devoted  to Corps funding by various administrations that sit over there in the  executive branch and underfund these projects around the country. That  is why Louisiana had so much trouble and that is why other places in  the country have so much trouble.   So I do not support the gentleman's amendment. I urge opposition, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   The Acting Chair. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5  Minutes.    Madam Chairwoman, I rise in opposition to this amendment  because really, it takes us backwards. The gentleman is from Indiana. I  am from Ohio. I think both of us have seen individuals that we  represent go off to war. How many wars have we gotten into over the  issue of oil and the oil supply of the globe?   The Department of Energy has been inventing the future to a point  where now, we are 90 percent self-sufficient inside the boundaries of  this country. This department helps to invent the future and helps  America be more secure. Every one of us has some sense of what is  happening with cyberattacks in our energy systems.   Over the weekend, a major retailer, Target, for whatever reason, all  the cash registers went dead around the country. Was it just a  satellite problem? Was it an attack by a foreign aggressor? I simply  don't know. But I know this department isn't a place where we should be  cutting.   Climate change, whether one wishes to admit it or not, is going to  require a change in our way of life. This department is essential to  help us move in that direction in a very organized manner. Every penny  counts and every step we take to help the American people be more  secure is needed.   This bill funds critical water resource projects and supports science  and energy technology. It helps our businesses be more competitive. It  funds a credible nuclear deterrent where we have commitments and also  nonproliferation, which is important not just to our country, but to  the world.   I think the gentleman's amendment will actually harm all of these  fronts and reduce protections against what the American people are  facing from coast to coast right now.   I think that the gentleman's objectives on balancing the budget are  correct, but I don't think it should be taken out of the hide of these  programs. There are other ways to do that--some of the giveaways to the  billionaire class in this country who have had the privilege of living  a good life and earning a great deal of money in this country.  Everybody has got to pitch in. But I don't think where we are inventing  the future and helping the American people become more secure in our  way of life is the place to hack away.   I urge a continued investment in these areas for purposes of our  national security and to remain a global leader in energy, water, and  science. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I urge opposition to this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.  DeGette) having assumed the chair, Ms. Shalala, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2740)  making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human  Services, and Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2020, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________
