 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in favor of my amendment No. 71 to  H.R. 4368, which prevents American tax dollars from being used to fund  the World Health Organization.   In the bill currently before us, the FDA is seeking to provide  funding to the WHO to advance and expand tobacco product regulation  under the Building Research Capacity in Global Tobacco Product  Regulation grant program.   The United States has consistently been the largest contributor in  the world to the WHO, topping the charts in 2020 at over $116 million,  nearly twice as much as China, which contributed about 12 percent of  the organization's total that same year.   This is the same WHO that refused to act on or publicize warnings  from Taiwan that the new respiratory infection now known as COVID-19  was a threat to humans.                                time  0050     They instead chose to echo the lies coming out of China,  that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission.   Mr. Chairman, my constituents sent me to Washington, D.C., with the  mandate to stop sending taxpayer dollars to the WHO, an entity which  covers for the CCP, helped cover up the COVID outbreak, and routinely  attempts to infringe of the sovereignty of Americans in furtherance of  its globalist agenda.   I say all this to repeat what the American people rightly know. That  the WHO is a corrupt organization which bends to the Chinese Communist  Party and does not deserve a cent of American tax dollars, no matter  through which account this money is distributed.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Houchin).    Mr. Chair, it is simply not in the interest of Americans  to have their tax dollars going toward a program that studies the  health burden of tobacco in other countries.   This is simply an attempt to export the Federal nanny State into  other countries through one of the most corrupt international  organizations ever known.   What we should be focusing on is domestic deregulation, not global  governance. After everything we have been through over the last few  years, after witnessing the WHO's complete and utter incompetence  during the spread of COVID-19, after witnessing them turn a blind eye  time and time again to the CCP's culpability, you would think that we  would have learned that American tax dollars should go to American  priorities and not the priorities of our adversaries.   Having any funding for the WHO in any appropriations bill is  inconsistent with the stated goal of the 118th Congress to defund the  WHO completely.   They are a failed puppet organization of Communist China. I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support my amendment. I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today in favor of my amendment No.  83 to H.R. 4368. This amendment would prevent the Animal and Plant  Health Inspection Service from implementing its proposed rule mandating  electronic identification ear tags, known as EID, for cattle and bison  transported in interstate commerce.   Let me start by saying this: The United States has the highest  quality and safest meat in the world. We currently have a robust,  effective, and affordable animal identification and traceability system  in place that works. Our high standards of disease prevention and  detection make us the leader in world food quality.  [[Page H4558]]    This rule is problematic for many reasons, including the fact that it  sets a dangerous precedent by allowing a Federal agency to dictate how  our ranchers run their operations. Our ranchers do not need the D.C.  bureaucracy to tell them how to manage and identify their livestock.  Yet, that is exactly what this rule allows.   This rule will create a paperwork nightmare, forcing our producers to  hire a slew of compliance officers just to meet the new requirements.   The creation of this federally mandated system will require extensive  data collection and countless reporting obligations.   Last year, Ireland mandated EID ear tags. Today, just 1 year later,  there are an untold number of reports that they must file with the  government.   Ireland is now considering killing off 1.3 million head of cattle to  reach their ``climate targets.'' Their EID mandate will help them carry  out this slaughter.   This rule will increase the cost of food and food production, thereby  hurting the consumer.   This rule will ultimately cost our ranchers millions of dollars in  compliance costs, forcing many of our smaller independent operations to  sell out. It will thus result in further vertical integration of the  food supply chain, making our independent livestock producers nothing  but serfs to the big ranches and meatpackers.   The primary supporters of this rule are the four big packers, two of  which are owned by Brazil and one of which is owned by China, and the  ear tag manufacturing companies.   This rule raises serious privacy concerns for our independent  ranchers. APHIS' estimated cost of this rule is indefensible, and the  minimal amount included in the rule for implementation is entirely  inadequate. The real cost of mandating EID ear tags is exponentially  higher than what APHIS claims, and this is an unfunded mandate.   In short, we simply cannot afford or allow a bunch of unelected  bureaucrats, who have never handled livestock or made an honest living  raising animals, to tell our ranchers how to operate.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Massie).    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reiterate that we already have an  identification and traceability system in place that is effective,  robust, and affordable. Some larger operations have voluntarily  implemented EID because they have the resources and the manpower to do  so.   If small and medium operations are forced into this same system,  however, and without the proper capital, they will be locked out of the  markets.   My colleague just admitted that the funding in the rule doesn't  provide adequate funding to implement the rule, and so it is going to  cost our ranchers literally millions upon millions of dollars to  comply. It is an unfunded mandate.   This proposed rule is based on dubious assumptions. It raises more  questions than answers. It is a solution in search of a problem. It is  dangerous, and it should be stopped.   I will finish with this: My amendment does not touch the cost offset  in the bill. It merely addresses the flawed policy advanced by USDA. It  does not prevent any American rancher, cattle producer, or bison  producer to use EID technology, but it does not allow the USDA to  mandate it.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
