 Mr. President, this shutdown, the longest in our  history, must come to an end. It has already caused far too much harm  for 800,000 dedicated Federal employees and their families who are  struggling to pay bills without paychecks and are on the verge of  missing yet another paycheck. It has hurt the American people who need  to interact with Federal Agencies, including seniors, low-income  families, people with disabilities who worry about their housing  assistance. It is damaging our economy, causing a drop in consumer  confidence and consumer spending.   Ironically, shutdowns always end up costing the government more money  than if we had operated as we should.   I see a glimmer of hope here. We at least have had two votes today on  two different plans. Like the Senator from Alaska and others, I  supported both plans because my priority is to reopen government, but  where I am really optimistic is the fact that 16 Senators are on the  floor, equally divided between the two parties, and willing to  compromise. Compromise is not a dirty word. It is not a sign of  weakness. It is a sign of strength.   Let us compromise to reopen government, address border security, and  get on with the business of this country.   Thank you, Mr. President.
