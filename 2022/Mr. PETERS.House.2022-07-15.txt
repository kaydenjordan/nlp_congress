 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the Ensuring  Women's Right to Reproductive Freedom Act.   After the Supreme Court eliminated the Federal right to abortion,  only 20 States continue to protect a woman's right to choose. Even  before Roe fell, States across the country were working to pass laws  banning abortion even in cases of rape, incest, and when the life of  the mother is at stake. That is not pro-family, and that is not pro- life. That is barbaric.   Republican efforts to criminalize abortion will pit neighbors against  neighbors, punish women for exercising their bodily autonomy, and  imprison doctors who took an oath to protect their patients. That is  happening right here in what is supposed to be the freest country in  the world. That is why I am standing here, today, to protect a woman's  right to travel in search of legal healthcare.   Madam Speaker, if the Supreme Court won't protect Americans, then we  in Congress must do everything in our power to stand up for our basic  freedoms. That starts with this bill, and I urge my colleagues to pass  it.
