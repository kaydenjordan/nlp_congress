 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding and echo  the gratitude for her leadership and the bipartisan leadership of the  subcommittee.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the State and Local  Cybersecurity Improvement Act, a bipartisan bill that I was proud to  help introduce, to deliver urgently needed investments to address the  vulnerabilities that persist in State, local, Tribal, and territorial  cyber infrastructures.   These cyber threats are real, and our communities need help.   I have spoken with a county auditor just recently who said she is  conscious that her systems are constantly targeted.   I have spoken with public power providers who understand that, in the  absence of sufficient cybersecurity, we could see an attack that would  wipe out our critical utilities for citizens and could undermine our  economy.   I have recently spoken with a Tribal leader who said that they have  enough technology challenges without seeing the threat of cyberattack  compound things.   I have spoken with a county hospital in my district that was hit by a  ransomware attack.   This bill is about letting those folks know and the people whom they  serve know that they are not on their own, that the Federal Government  understands that cybersecurity vulnerabilities don't only exist in  marble buildings in Washington, D.C., but that they exist in  communities in every State in our Nation, and with this bill the  Federal Government says: We are going to have your back. That is why I  urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  bipartisan plan. There is no time to waste.
