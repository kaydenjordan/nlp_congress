 Mr. President, if you ask any Republican what kind of  energy policy he or she supports, you will likely hear the phrase ``an  `all of the above' energy policy.'' Today, I want to take a minute to  talk about, first, what we mean by an all-of-the-above energy policy  and second, why we support this kind of policy.   So what is an ``all of the above'' energy policy?   Well, as the name suggests, an ``all of the above'' energy policy is  an energy policy that embraces the full spectrum of available energy  resources, both renewable and conventional. It is important not to  ignore the conventional part, as many of my colleagues across the aisle  would like to do. It is not enough to embrace renewable energy, even  multiple types of renewables. And, for reasons I am going to discuss,  any energy policy that doesn't embrace conventional as well as  renewable sources of energy is insufficient. It places both our energy  security and energy affordability in jeopardy.   Back to my explanation, as I said, an ``all of the above'' energy  policy is an energy policy that embraces the full spectrum of available  energy sources. It embraces wind, solar, hydropower, biofuels, biomass,  geothermal, nuclear, oil, natural gas, and more. That is the  definition.   Now, why is an ``all of the above'' energy policy important? Why not,  for example, eliminate fossil fuels from the mix? Or why not choose one  or two renewable fuels and put all of our energies into advancing those  one or two technologies to hasten the arrival of a clean energy future?   Well, there are a number of reasons why these options or those  options and any option that doesn't embrace the full range of available  energy technologies are a bad idea.   First of all, the fact of the matter is that we are simply not yet at  the point where we can rely solely on clean energy technologies. We  will still need conventional energy, and we are going to continue to  need conventional energy resources and, in particular, natural gas for  the foreseeable future.   My State of South Dakota actually derives a huge portion of our  electricity generation from renewables, notably wind and hydroelectric,  totaling about 82 percent of utility-scale production in South Dakota.  But conventional fuels, nevertheless, play an essential role in  electricity generation in South Dakota.   Wind, like solar and other renewables, by its nature is intermittent,  even in places like South Dakota, where wind is a regular feature. And  because technology has not yet advanced to the point where we can store  up sufficient renewable energy to power an electric grid, even places  like my State that rely heavily on renewables for electricity  generation depend on conventional energy sources like coal and natural  gas to keep the power on consistently.   California is another State with significant production from  renewables, like hydropower and solar, but the availability of those  sources are affected by variables like cloud cover and drought. And  while California generally gets a lot of sunshine, again, the  [[Page S620]]  technology to effectively store energy from those renewables at the  scale necessary to power California's grid is simply not here yet. It  is probably fair to say that one reason California's electricity grid  is known for being unreliable is because the State is overly reliant on  renewables without sufficient backup from conventional energy sources  to meet demand.   Now, I think we are unquestionably going to get to the point where we  can store renewable energy more efficiently and on a large scale, but  we are not there yet. It is important to recognize that fact and to  recognize that the availability of consistent, reliable energy in this  country is still dependent on a consistent, reliable supply of  conventional energy sources.   An ``all of the above'' energy policy isn't just a reliability  imperative. It is also a national security imperative. Having a secure  and stable energy supply is critical to our Nation's security. Our  military bases and hospitals, for example, can't afford energy  blackouts.   Again, having a secure and stable supply requires embracing the full  spectrum of available energy sources, including the conventional energy  sources that ensure the reliability of our Nation's electricity supply.   Furthermore, embracing the full spectrum of available resources  includes developing domestic resources so that we are not overly  reliant on supplies from other countries. The energy challenges and  soaring costs countries like Germany have faced over the past year,  owing to their heavy reliance on Russian energy, are a timely reminder  of the importance of developing domestic--domestic--energy supplies.   Aside from energy security and reliability, an ``all of the above''  energy policy is essential because we don't yet know exactly what a  clean energy future will look like. There are still a lot of challenges  to work out with renewables and clean energy technologies. As I said,  we have not yet developed the technology to store renewable energy on a  large scale without significant efficiency loss.   There are a number of other challenges with clean energy  technologies. Electric car batteries, for example, are heavily reliant  on critical minerals. We currently rely heavily on other countries--not  all of them politically or environmentally friendly--for our critical  mineral supply. Environmentalists are, of course, loathe to tap our own  natural resources. The same constraints affect batteries necessary to  expand commercial and residential energy storage.   And while wind and solar energy are producing record amounts of  electricity, each have their own end-of-life challenges for recycling  and disposal as they are replaced.   Nuclear power provides a valuable source of clean energy, but  construction costs are staggering, and we still haven't fully arrived  at a solution for storing nuclear waste.   And the list goes on.   This isn't to say that American ingenuity won't solve some of these  challenges or that conventional energy has none of its own, but that is  exactly why we need to keep exploring all of these technologies and the  opportunities and challenges that they present.   The fact of the matter is that our country's energy future will  continue to be multifaceted, not reliant exclusively or predominantly  on one or two energy technologies. For one thing, different areas of  the country will have different availability when it comes to  renewables, like the abundance of wind on the Great Plains. Even if we  significantly improve the storage and transmission situation, it is  likely that it will always be most efficient for different areas of the  country to rely most heavily on the energy resources that they have  closest to home.   So, as I said, it is important that we move forward with developing  the full range of energy resources and not attempt to put all of our  eggs in the same basket or to have the government pick winners and  losers. Excessive government direction runs the risk of diminishing or  cutting off innovation in the technologies that could be the future of  clean energy.   We should be encouraging the exploration of all clean energy avenues  and then seeing what the market ultimately gravitates toward, which is  likely to be the technologies that are simultaneously practical,  affordable, and effective.   The clean energy evolution away from coal toward cleaner burning  natural gas, which has been a major driver of emissions reduction, was  driven not by top-down direction from government--certainly not by  government ideologues here in Washington--but by private industry,  which saw the next wave of energy production and harnessed it.   Finally, we need an ``all of the above'' energy policy to keep energy  prices affordable for American families.   Discouraging conventional energy exploration and production--or  forcing a move to renewable sources before we have the technology  available to ensure that renewables can deliver a reliable and  affordable supply--is a good way to make Americans' energy bills  continue to soar.   An ``all of the above'' energy policy is the way to guarantee an  affordable and reliable energy supply, and Members of both parties-- both parties--should be embracing an ``all of the above'' approach to  American energy. Unfortunately, however, that is not the case. Instead,  Democrats are pursuing increasingly extreme, Green New Deal policies  designed to discourage investment in the exploration of and the  production of conventional energy, without regard to whether or not we  are anywhere near to having the resources and technology to move beyond  conventional energy.   The so-called Inflation Reduction Act that the Democrats passed last  August contained a series of tax hikes on conventional energy  production that are driving up Americans' energy bills. It also  contained a lot of funding for Green New Deal fantasies that are likely  to achieve nothing more than wasting taxpayer dollars.   I am a big and a long-time supporter of clean energy. I have a record  that goes back to my days in the House of Representatives, and I am  confident that we will get to a day when we will be able to rely almost  exclusively on clean energy technologies, especially when you factor in  carbon capture paired with clean natural gas. But we are not there yet.  Until that day comes, we need to embrace an ``all of the above'' energy  policy for energy security, for energy reliability, and to keep  Americans' energy bills affordable.   I hope that more of my colleagues across the aisle will come to  realize this reality before they seriously impair the stability and  security of our Nation's energy supply.   I yield the floor.
