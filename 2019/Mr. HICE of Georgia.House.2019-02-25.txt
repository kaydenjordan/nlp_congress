 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on H.R. 1235, the MSPB Temporary  Term Extension Act.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle know that I personally  am committed to ensuring the successful operation of the Merit Systems  Protection Board, also known as MSPB. In fact, last Congress, I  introduced H.R. 6391, the MSPB Reauthorization Act of 2018. My bill  would have reauthorized the Board and made other vital reforms. The  Committee on Oversight  [[Page H2064]]  and Government Reform reported the bill favorably, but without a single  vote from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.   We all know an effective and functional MSPB is important to the  health of our Federal workforce. MSPB's primary responsibility is to  adjudicate appeals of Federal personnel actions. MSPB also plays a  vital role in Federal whistleblower protections.   To be effective and issue decisions, MSPB needs at least a two-member  quorum, but the Board has not had a quorum for over 2 years. In January  2017, Mark Robbins, as my friend mentioned, become the sole remaining  member of MSPB.   Last year, Mr. Robbins' 7-year term came to an end, and he was  granted a 1-year extension as authorized by law, but that extension  ends this week. Starting Friday, the MSPB will be without a single  Board member.   My colleagues claim this bill is an emergency measure to prevent the  MSPB from extending this crisis of leadership, but I disagree. The real  problem is the lack of a quorum.   Without a quorum for the last 2 years, a backlog of undecided appeals  has grown to over 1,700 cases. Mr. Robbins cannot fix that problem on  his own. His continued tenure will not resolve those cases.   In December, the President selected Mr. Robbins to serve as the  general counsel at the Office of Personnel Management, so for the last  10 weeks, he has served in both capacities at OPM and MSPB. Mr. Robbins  is planning to serve at OPM in his full capacity beginning this Friday.   Mr. Robbins has stayed at MSPB as long as he has out of a sense of  duty to MSPB and its mission. I trust that my colleagues do not intend  to use this bill to coerce Mr. Robbins to stay any longer than he wants  to.                                time  1745    I urge my colleagues to join me in applauding Mr. Robbins for his  dedication to MSPB, the Federal workforce, the President, and our  country. I also urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the  Senate's confirmation of President Trump's nominees.   We owe it to our Federal workers to give MSPB a quorum so the board  can do the important job that Congress gave it to do.   In the future, I certainly hope we can work together to provide  certainty to Federal workers and whistleblowers by making MSPB  operational once again.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
