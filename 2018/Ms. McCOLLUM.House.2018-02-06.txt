 Mr. Speaker, I thank our ranking member for yielding me  the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation, a misguided  bill that ignores the urgent needs of the American people.   The Federal Government's fiscal year started October 1, 2017--128  days ago. Instead of using that time to get their work done,  Republicans have focused solely on partisan politics. When it comes to  the essential responsibility of funding the Federal Government, the  Republicans can't be bothered.   Now we are asked, today, to vote for a bill that funds the Pentagon  for the rest of the year while funding our schools and our hospitals  for just 43 days.   Mr. Speaker, our national security begins at home with investments in  the future that keep our families and our communities safe, strong, and  moving forward. This bill ignores those needs. It provides no certainty  for our law enforcement professionals, no long-term funding for urgent  repairs to our crumbling infrastructure, and no confidence for  investments in lifesaving medical research. It doesn't even provide a  full year of funding for veterans' healthcare.   While it is encouraging that Republicans are finally reauthorizing  vital healthcare programs like our community health centers, paying for  these programs with cuts to the CDC's Prevention and Public Health  Fund, which is currently providing lifesaving vaccines in this severe  flu season, is the height of irresponsibility.   Discord and delay is no way to run a government, but under Republican  control, that is exactly what we are getting.   Mr. Speaker, unlike the President, I do not want a government  shutdown. We need a budget agreement that keeps our government open,  protects our national security, and meets our commitments to  hardworking families. So let's stop playing games, get to our work, and  get to it now.
