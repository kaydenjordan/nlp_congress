 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is humbling to be on the floor of the  U.S. Senate with colleagues like Senator Lankford from Oklahoma. It is  an honor to listen to his words, to his heart, on an issue like today  because this is, I believe, a historic day.   On January 31 of this year, I had the great honor of being invited to  the White House when President Donald Trump announced his nominee for  Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch. It was  a professional rollout of this nomination, but it spoke more to the  man, the individual, Judge Gorsuch, than it did to the circumstance  surrounding it.   Today, I want to again discuss Judge Gorsuch's nomination and the  200-plus years of historical precedent put on the line today. As an  outsider of this political process, it is clear to me what is going on  here. It really has nothing to do with Judge Gorsuch.   The minority party today abandoned 230 years of tradition because of  politics, in my opinion. Never before in the U.S. history has a purely  partisan filibuster killed a Supreme Court nomination. Never before, in  the history of our country, has a partisan filibuster killed a district  judge nomination. Never before, and until 2003, has a partisan  filibuster killed a circuit judge nomination. Mr. President, 2003 was  the first time in our history that the rules of the Senate were used in  a purely partisan way to stop a judicial nomination.   In 2003, the Democratic Party threw out over 200 years of precedent  when it comes to circuit judge nominees and killed a circuit judge  nomination. Today they attempted to do the same thing when it comes to  a nominee to the highest Court in the United States.   It should be noted Republicans did not attempt to do this to either  Justice Sotomayor or Justice Kagan when they were nominated by  President Obama a few years ago. Throughout our history, even the most  controversial Supreme Court nominees have gotten an up-or-down vote, a  simple majority vote. On that note, I also wish to point out there is  no longstanding rule or tradition that a Supreme Court nominee must  obtain 60 votes to be confirmed.   Judge Clarence Thomas was confirmed by a narrow 52-to-48 margin. Even  though a single Senator could have required 60 votes to invoke cloture,  and none did. Likewise, Justice Samuel Alito was confirmed by a 58-to- 42 margin. Again, no Senator required 60 votes to invoke cloture.  Neither of those nominees were filibustered to death. They got an up- or-down vote.   Mainstream media outlets have repeatedly fact-checked the minority  party on this. For example, last week the Washington Post said: ``Once  again: There is no `traditional' 60-vote `standard' or `rule' for  Supreme Court nominations, no matter how much or how often Democrats  claim otherwise.''   Even PolitiFact has repeatedly pointed out that ``Gorsuch, like all  other Supreme Court Justice nominees, needs only a simple majority to  be confirmed by the Senate.''   Clearly, outside of this body, it is recognized in the media, and on  both sides of the aisle for that matter, that there is no such thing as  a 60-vote standard when it comes to the nomination and confirmation of  Supreme Court Justices.    Additionally, the notion that the minority party filibustering Judge  Gorsuch's confirmation is the same as our not allowing a vote last  year, that logic doesn't hold up.   Last year, I joined many of my colleagues on the Senate floor in  explaining why we felt it best not to give advice or consent on the  nomination of a Justice to the Supreme Court during a Presidential  election year. The integrity of the process, clearly outlined in  article II, section 2, of the Constitution was at stake. It was about  the principle, not the individual. Unlike the argument that it is  tradition for a Supreme Court nominee to receive 60 votes, there is  actual precedent for the position we took last year on President  Obama's Supreme Court nominee.   Former Vice President Biden, former Minority Leader Reid, and many  other Members of both parties have agreed that the political theater of  a Presidential election year should not influence the process.   The last time a Justice was nominated and confirmed by a divided  government in a Presidential election year was 1888. Clearly, there is  more than 100 years of precedent for the position we took last year in  not giving advice and consent.   We took a position that was consistent with more than 100 years of  actions and comments from Members of both parties. Let's just get over  that. This year stands on its own, independently. The time for debate  on this issue has come and gone.   Furthermore, it is obvious that what is at issue here is not Judge  Gorsuch's qualifications. In 2006, Judge Gorsuch was confirmed to the  Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals by a voice vote in this body with no  opposition. Again, no opposition on the floor of the U.S. Senate, just  10 years ago.   Then-Senator Biden did not object, then-Senator Reid did not object,  then-Senator Clinton did not object, and, yes, then-Senator Obama did  not object. Twelve current Members of this body, including the current  senior Senator from New York, the senior Senator from Illinois, the  senior Senator from California, did not object to Judge Gorsuch's  confirmation in 2006.   It is a simple fact, they had the opportunity to raise an objection,  and they did not do it. It is obvious that what is going on here has  nothing to do with Judge Gorsuch's qualifications. What is at issue is  nothing but pure, unadulterated politics.   This is exactly why I ran for the U.S. Senate, having never been  involved in politics. This is what makes people home very nervous about  the gridlock in this body. This is why President Trump still cannot  meet with his full Cabinet today, months after he was sworn in as our  President. This is the very cause of gridlock that I believe is causing  the dysfunction in Washington.   As I said, Judge Gorsuch was confirmed unanimously by voice vote with  no opposition in 2006. Judge Gorsuch is a principled jurist who is  steadfast in his commitment to defending and upholding the  Constitution.   In my private meetings with him, I have been very impressed that this  is his starting and finishing point: He is there to interpret the law,  not to be an activist for his own personal opinion. He boasts a  unanimous seal of approval from the gold standard, the American Bar  Association.   Throughout his extensive career in both the public and private  sectors and through hour after hour of testimony, Judge Gorsuch has  demonstrated an impartial commitment to the rule of law. This is  another area in which legal  [[Page S2415]]  minds from both sides of the aisle agree.   Harvard Law School Professor Noah Feldman, himself no conservative,  called it a ``truly terrible idea'' to try to force Judge Gorsuch, or  any judge for that matter, to base their decisions on the parties  involved. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, I know that Judge Gorsuch fully  understands that the job of a judge is to interpret, not make, the law.   As he himself said, ``A judge who likes every result he reaches is  very likely a bad judge, reaching for results he prefers rather than  those the law compels.''   This commitment to impartiality, regardless of those involved in  individual cases, is further evidence his nomination should be  confirmed rather than filibustered to death like we have seen today.   Judge Gorsuch's record is evidence enough that he is an impartial  judge committed to the Constitution. The opposition has said he is  outside the mainstream. That also doesn't hold up.   In 97 percent of his 2,700 cases, judges who also heard the cases  unanimously ruled with Judge Gorsuch. In 99 percent of his cases, he  was not a dissenting vote. The other side is consistent in saying he is  not mainstream. Seriously? How much more mainstream does he have to be?   To that point, Judge Gorsuch has drawn praise from both liberals and  conservatives alike. Former President Obama's Acting Solicitor General  called Judge Gorsuch ``an extraordinary judge and man.''   He is not alone in that assessment of Judge Gorsuch. Mainstream media  outlets across the country have praised this nominee to the Supreme  Court. Recently, the USA Today Editorial Board wrote: ``Gorsuch's  credentials are impeccable . . . he might well show the independence  the nation needs at this moment in its history.''   The Washington Post's Editorial Board wrote:         We are likely to disagree with Mr. Gorsuch on a variety of       major legal questions. That is different from saying that he       is unfit to serve.    The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board wrote: ``No one can replace  Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court, but President Trump has made an  excellent attempt by nominating appellate Judge Neil Gorsuch as the  ninth justice.''   As I have noted, the minority party's move to filibuster Judge  Gorsuch is not rooted in any actual precedent in the U.S. Senate. It  also clearly has nothing to do with Judge Gorsuch himself. By any and  all objective measure, he is a mainstream, well-qualified nominee to  the U.S. Supreme Court.   That is a point agreed upon by liberals and conservatives alike. Yet  here we are still today throwing out almost 230 years of tradition,  purely because of politics. This body must rise above the self- manufactured gridlock.   Our last President, according to constitutional law professor  Jonathan Turley, created a constitutional crisis. It was caused by  shutting down the Senate and creating the fourth arm of government, the  regulators, and threatening the very balance of our three-branch  system. It allowed the former President, through regulatory mandates  and Executive orders, to basically fundamentally change the direction  of the country without Congress.   Given this threat to the Constitution, at this point in our history,  we absolutely need a jurist on the Supreme Court who will bring a  balanced view and impartial commitment to the rule of law. It is  imperative we confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch tomorrow--a principled,  thoughtful jurist--to the U.S. Supreme Court.   If we can't confirm this individual, who is absolutely in the middle  of the profile agreed to by past Democrats and Republicans alike, who  in the world will we ever be able to confirm?   Seriously, if we can't get together on this individual, who is in the  mainstream in the middle of the profile? How in the world are we ever  going to save Social Security, Medicare, all the other critical issues  that are before this body? Bipartisan compromise is what this body was  built on. I call on my colleagues to put self-interest and even party  interest aside for the Nation's interest.    I count it an honor to be in this body. It is a sobering  responsibility, but I am very optimistic when men or women of the  character of a Neil Gorsuch are willing to go through this grueling  exercise that we put them through in order to serve. Because of that, I  am proud tonight to be a part of a majority that stood up and precluded  this from happening.   I am so excited that tomorrow we will confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch as  the next Associate Justice to the United States Supreme Court.   I yield back my time.
