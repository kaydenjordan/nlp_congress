 Madam Speaker, I would like to take this time to recognize  one of my constituents, Armand Kuykendall, who was named Putnam  County's 50th Annual Spelling Bee winner on January 18, 2019.   Armand is currently in the fifth grade at the Middleton-Burney  Elementary School, where he is a straight-A student. During his young  life, he has faced many obstacles. Armand has excelled at school with  the support of his teachers and family.   In order to compete in Putnam County's spelling bee, Armand spent his  free time studying and memorizing over 450 words. His winning word was  ``apricot.''   His family, friends--as I am--are extremely proud of Armand for  competing and winning the spelling bee. I would like to congratulate  him for his outstanding accomplishment.   Armand now moves on to participate in the First Coast Spelling Bee at  Jacksonville University on February 19, 2019. Best of L-U-C-K, Armand.                            ____________________
