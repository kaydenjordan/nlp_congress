 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, there was a time--and it really wasn't  all that long ago--when securing the border had bipartisan support. It  was actually a bipartisan goal--now, I think that made a lot of sense-- but it is not now.   It also wasn't all that long ago that, in 2006, Congress passed  something called the Secure Fence Act of 2006. What that piece of  legislation did was to authorize 700 miles of what was supposed to be  double-layered fencing. In the end, only 36 miles of actual double- layered fencing was constructed. Another 613 miles that consisted of  about 299 miles of vehicle fencing--in other words, people could just  walk right through it--and another 314 miles of single-layered  pedestrian barrier fencing were actually built. I think we have seen  that unfortunately the fencing did not fulfill the requirements of the  Secure Fence Act of 2006, and it also didn't work.   What is interesting to know about the passage of the Secure Fence Act  is that it passed overwhelmingly in this Chamber by a vote of 80 to 19.  There were 26 Democratic Senators who joined 54 Republicans in voting  yes. It also passed the House by a pretty overwhelming margin as well-- 283 to 138--with 64 Democrats joining the Republicans. So the total  count in Congress was 363 votes to build a fence and secure the border  versus 157 people who, apparently, didn't have an interest. In other  words, 70 percent of the Members of Congress who voted on the Secure  Fence Act, who voted for border security, voted yes. Again, that was  with the support of 90 Democrats.   By the way, some pretty notable Democrats voted to secure the border  by building 700 miles of double-layered fence, including those who are  current President Biden; former President Barack Obama; the current  majority leader of the Senate, Senator Schumer; former Secretary of  State Hillary Clinton; my chairman and ranking member of Homeland  Security, Senator Tom Carper; the chairwoman of the Judiciary in the  past, Senator Feinstein; the current chairman of the Finance Committee,  Senator Wyden. At the time, the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Brown, was a  Member of the House, and he voted for it in the House. Again, that was  only 14, 15 years ago when securing the border was actually a  bipartisan goal.   What happened? Why isn't that the case now? Why has securing the  border become a partisan issue?   Well, politics happened.   I wasn't here between 2006 and 2011, but I know there were multiple  good-faith efforts to pass an immigration bill. They often referred to  it as ``comprehensive immigration reform.'' I remember, when I got  here, that this effort was still going on, and we actually passed, in  this body, a comprehensive immigration bill. I remember talking to  Senator McCain, who was one of the leading proponents. I did suggest  that I would stop using the word ``comprehensive'' and that I didn't  think we did a very good job with things comprehensively here and that  we ought to take a step-by-step approach. Senator McCain was not really  happy with my comment, but I made it anyway. I still think, quite  honestly, that the test of time has probably proven me right.   Bipartisanship pretty well ended the efforts when that effort failed  in the House. It didn't move it any further. We had a split Chamber. So  the Obama administration got impatient. I understand the frustration. I  certainly want to fix the problem. I want to take care of--now they are  probably adults--those who came here as children through no fault of  their own, the DACA kids. I think most Members of the Chamber want to  do that, but you have to do it in a legal way, and you have to do it in  a step-by-step approach, starting with securing our border.   I will talk about that a little bit further, but let me just talk  about what the effect the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals had.   It is pretty obvious, by this chart, that you can see this goes back  to 2007. The red bar is just talking about unaccompanied children  apprehended at the southwest border. You can see, through 2011, that,  at most, we had a little over 4,000 unaccompanied children coming  across the border illegally and being apprehended. Then, obviously, as  Americans, we have to take care of them because we are compassionate.   In June of 2012, the Obama administration issued the DACA memorandum.  The result was almost immediate. It was a magnet. It was a pull factor.  It was used by the coyotes in Central America. They would tell people  who would want to come to America--and let's face it. Who wouldn't want  to be in America? I am highly sympathetic with the people who want to  come to America and take advantage of this land of opportunities. The  coyotes would tell the migrants down in Central America: They changed  their laws. Come with us. We will take you up to the border. We will  get you across the border, and then you will get slip, called a  permiso, which is really a notice to appear.    So they came. They came in such quantities that, in 2014, more than  51,000 unaccompanied children flooded our border, and President Obama  rightly declared it a humanitarian crisis, and it was. That  humanitarian crisis, at that point in time, entailed about 2,000 people  coming and being apprehended at the border--2,000. You can see the  result. There were some ups and downs.   Quite honestly, what ended up happening is the Obama administration  started to detain families, for example. They put in a consequence, and  it actually had an impact. I can show you this a little bit better on  this chart that really just shows cause and effect. This chart picks up  in 2012 with the passage of DACA. You can see that President Obama, in  2014, declared it a humanitarian crisis. That is, by the way, when they  built that McAllen facility to which we went down as bipartisan Members  of the Senate and sung CBC's praises for trying to deal with this  crisis in such a humane fashion. Four and five years later, we have the  same facility with the same conditions and a bigger crisis, but now  that facility is  [[Page S3181]]  being referred to as keeping kids in cages.   You can see what ended up happening here. President Obama actually  had a family detention policy that kept the families together, but then  a court reinterpreted the Flores decision. It interpreted unaccompanied  children within the Flores decision, in terms of how you treated  children and how you had to hand them over to HHS in a short period of  time, and applied that to accompanied children.   So now a tough decision had to be made: Do we actually separate the  children so they can be handed over to HHS while we detain the parents  who came here illegally?   The decision those in the Obama administration made--and I really  can't blame them--was to keep the families together. What I blame them  for is they dispersed them into America--most of them never to have an  immigration hearing. When you don't have a hearing, you can't have your  asylum claim adjudicated properly. We know that a very high percentage  of the asylum seekers here do not qualify for asylum. Even as generous  as our policies are, they still don't qualify. Of the claims that are  adjudicated, the people come here, and they stay. Then they communicate  with other people in Central America, and it feeds upon itself.   It takes a while. It takes a few years. It took until 2018, 2019 that  the word really got out. When Donald Trump was elected President, he  was dedicated to securing the border, and we were going to fix this  problem. You could tell immigration really dropped off following his  election. People really felt that he was serious about it. By the way,  he was, but he had no cooperation either by Congress or the courts of  enforcing our laws and securing our borders. So word got out over a  couple of years, and we had an explosion of illegal immigration  primarily fueled this time by families.   President Trump--again, with no help from Congress and no help from  the courts--fixed the problem. You may agree or disagree with the  Migrant Protection Protocols Program, otherwise known as ``return to  Mexico,'' but there was a consequence. Because of that consequence,  combined with the fact that we also made agreements with Mexico and  Central America, people stopped coming. We had pretty well stopped the  flow. We had reduced dramatically the flow of unaccompanied children  and family members coming to the border. We pretty well had had this  problem solved before COVID hit. Throw on COVID and the invocation of  title 42, and we really had this problem solved until the Presidential  debates, and you had all Democratic Presidential candidates say they  were going to stop deportations and offer free healthcare.   You can see the number of adults. By the way, we have a colored  chart. Gold is single adults. Blue is family units. Red is children.   So we had this enormous crisis, first of all, surging that began with  single adults. Then, of course, on his first day in office, President  Biden dismantled the Migrant Protection Program. He ended those  agreements. He made good on his promise to end deportations until the  court said he couldn't do that, but the word was out. The crisis came  back with a vengeance. In the last 2 months, there have been, on an  average basis--daily--almost 6,000 people per day being apprehended at  the border.   This crisis is out of control, but this crisis is also manmade. It is  a manmade crisis by President Biden's policies.   Last week we had a hearing with Secretary Mayorkas, Secretary of the  Department of Homeland Security. It was actually surreal. First of all,  they blamed this on President Trump, said this was an inherited crisis.  No, it wasn't. It is the Democratic Presidential candidates who started  the spike of single adults. It was President Biden's dismantling of  President Trump's successful policies that sparked and was the catalyst  for the renewed crisis of family units and unaccompanied children  coming here illegally to exploit our very generous asylum laws.   So it was surreal to listen to the Secretary and, quite honestly, the  chairman of our committee talking about that this was an inherited  crisis but that things were improving. But the only reason they could  claim things were improving is--and Secretary Mayorkas said this  repeatedly--they are getting more efficient. ``We are getting more  efficient''--not at solving the problem; at processing and dispersing  the illegal immigrants coming into this country. Guess what that is  going to do. It is just going to cause more to come.   This crisis isn't going to end anytime soon until we return to having  consequences and we actually have the goal of reducing or stopping the  flow, and that is not happening right now.   I was disappointed. Under my chairmanship, we almost always had a  second round of questions, but we were denied that. I am sure there  were time constraints. But in a second round of questions, this is what  I wanted to ask Secretary Mayorkas. I wanted to ask him whether he was  aware that human traffickers sell children to adults so they can  exploit our asylum laws by posing as a family unit.   Understand, these policies that are being instituted to be more  humane do the exact opposite. It leads to all kinds of human  degradations, all kinds of inhumanity. I knew it full well. We held  hearings on this in 2018. Vice President Harris had to know as well;  she was on my committee.   I wanted to ask Secretary Mayorkas whether he was aware that we heard  testimony during my chairmanship that a child was sold for $84.   I wanted to ask him whether he is aware that children are recycled,  that they are sent back over the border to be used by another adult to  pose as a family unit and exploit our asylum laws.   I wanted to ask, are they verifying that a child actually belongs to  an adult? Are they doing DNA tests? If so, what percentage of those are  actual family units?   I wanted to know whether he was aware of the fact that human  traffickers throw children out of rafts when they are interdicted by  law enforcement.   I don't have the picture here. I honestly wouldn't even want to show  it. I showed it in our committee hearing 3 or 4 years ago. It was hard  enough showing it at that point in time. It was a father and his 2- year-old daughter who drowned in the Rio Grande.   I went down to the border with 18 of my Republican Senate colleagues.  We saw a dead body floating in the Rio Grande the day after a 9-year- old girl drowned in the Rio Grande. I wanted to know whether Secretary  Mayorkas, whether President Biden, whether Vice President Harris was  aware of this.   I wanted to know whether the Secretary was aware of the fact that  migrant girls are given birth control because they know that such a  large percentage will be raped during the dangerous journey when they  are put in the hands of these human traffickers.   I wanted to know whether the Secretary is aware of the kidnappings  and the beatings, the abuse, the additional ransoms demanded by human  traffickers.   I wanted to know whether he knows how much the human traffickers  charge for their human prey and whether he is knowledgeable of how that  debt is paid off. You realize the border is almost 100 percent secure  on the Mexican side of the border. Nobody crosses into America without  either paying the human traffickers or being indebted to them. I wanted  to know whether the Secretary knew how they pay off those debts.   I wanted to know whether he knew how many young girls are forced into  the sex trade and how many young men are forced into involuntary  servitude, used to traffic drugs, or become part of gangs.   I wanted to know whether the Secretary--I would like to know whether  the chairman of our committee is aware of the fact that President  Biden's policies created this crisis, and they are facilitating the  multibillion-dollar business model of probably some of the most evil  people on the planet.   I wanted to know, but I didn't get a chance to ask those questions.   Beyond the human toll, beyond the human tragedy, from a standpoint of  legislation, what is the real tragedy is that we were so close to  taking that first step, that necessary step of making America confident  that we are taking border security seriously, that we will secure our  border, because until we do that, we really can't move on. Without  creating greater incentives, we  [[Page S3182]]  can't move on to fix the problem of DACA; we can't set up a legal  immigration system that works best for everyone.   You know, it is not good for Central America. I have been there. I  have talked to their Presidents. They ask us to fix their laws. It is  not good that their countries are being depleted of the people they  need to rebuild their economies. It is not good for them. It is not  good for us. It is certainly not good for the migrants who are put in  the hands of the most evil people on the planet and left to their  tender mercies.   We were so close. President Trump had stopped the flow, largely, of  unaccompanied children, of family units, and he was doing the final  step, which was complete the wall. Walls work   Take a look at what happened here after January 6--double layers of  fencing, concertina wire tipped. We obviously thought they worked here  for us in Congress; they will work at the border as well.   What my amendment would do is simply complete the wall that President  Trump started. He wanted to build 800 miles; he built 450. Two hundred  and fifty miles of that wall has already been contracted for. It will  be paid for whether it is built or not. About 100 miles wasn't  contracted.   So, American taxpayer, you need to understand this: You will be on  the hook for a couple billion dollars, you know, tens of thousands of  tons of steel that has already been produced. All that waste--all that  waste, and we won't even get the 250 miles of wall. Isn't that absurd?  Isn't that ridiculous? All because securing the border has become a  partisan issue, when it was not a partisan issue in 2006.   So my amendment, amendment 1518, is really pretty simple, just two  pages. It is very common sense. It just says: Complete the wall that we  have already contracted for, that we are going to have to pay for  whether we build it or not.   Now, in a rational Senate in reasonable times, this ought to pass 100  to 0. I fear this is going to be decided strictly on party lines, and  that is a real shame.   If there is one thing that we ought to be bipartisan about, it is  about national security, it is about securing our homeland, and part  and parcel of securing our homeland is having a secure border. One  element of that, in addition to instituting consequences, like the  Migrant Protection Protocol, like something I proposed with the Senator  from Arizona, Senator Sinema, Operation Safe Return, there has to be a  consequence to reduce or stop this flow.   But we also need barriers. Technology alone is not going to work. We  can't hire enough Border Patrol agents. They are already being  dispirited. We are going to have a hard time hiring enough people just  to come up to the quota levels we want to hire. We can't do it with  personnel. We can't do technology. We need the fence. We bought and  paid for it; let's construct it.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask for a minute to respond.   First of all, let me reiterate--the dollars will be spent regardless.  The dollars would be completely wasted and no wall whatsoever. Of  course, this reconsideration of their policies--we can already see the  disastrous consequences of what they have already done. God help us in  terms of what the results will be of future policies as well.   So, again, I ask that my amendment be considered.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1518    I ask support for it, and I ask for the yeas and nays.
