 Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a  distinguished lawyer, educator, and loving husband, father, and  grandfather, Ralph Bennie ``Ben'' Graham, Jr. Ben passed away on  February 3, 2022. He leaves behind a powerful legacy of public service  and dedication to Nevada's criminal justice system and legal community.   A Washington State native, Ben moved to Las Vegas in 1977 and worked  as a prosecutor at the Clark County District Attorney's Office. After  31 years, Ben retired as chief deputy district attorney. Throughout  this time, Ben also represented the Nevada District Attorneys'  Association, the Nevada Supreme Court, and the Administrative Office of  the Courts in the Nevada Legislature. In these roles, he lobbied to  improve Nevada's criminal laws and the State's judicial system. Outside  the courtroom, Ben taught courses on criminal justice at UNLV's William  S. Boyd School of Law and the Community College of Southern Nevada,  providing invaluable lessons for our Nation's next generation of  lawyers.   Throughout his career, Ben placed a great focus on the well-being of  members of Nevada's legal community. In 1986, he cofounded Lawyers  Concerned for Lawyers, LCL, a confidential program dedicated to helping  members of the Nevada bar recover from substance abuse issues. In large  part due to Ben's mentorship, countless attorneys were able to obtain  the assistance they needed to heal and move forward in their legal  careers. Ben received numerous awards in recognition of his service  with the program.   Nevada has benefited immensely from Ben's commitment to the legal  profession and community. Earlier this year, Nevada Governor Steve  Sisolak recognized Ben's contributions to the State by proclaiming  February 17, 2022, as ``a day in honor of Ben Graham.'' Many in the  Nevada Legislature remember Ben for his kindness and generosity, as  exemplified through his famous chocolate chip cookies, which he  annually gifted to colleagues and friends. Whether it was through his  baking skills or charitable efforts, Ben improved the lives of those  who knew him in the Silver State.   I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering Ben for his significant  impact in Nevada. I celebrate Ben's legacy, and I extend my deepest  condolences to his wife, Elana; his children; grandchildren; and his  family and friends during this difficult time.                            ____________________
