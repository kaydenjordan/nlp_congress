 Mr. President, responding to the coronavirus continues to  be one of our top priorities here in Congress, I think, as evidenced  that yesterday the Senate moved a bill across the floor of the Senate  that will be on its way now to the President's desk for his signature,  previously passed by the House, that makes some modifications to the  PPP program--things that were sought by both sides, improvements, I  think, that enable that program to be used with greater flexibility,  extending the amount of time in which those dollars that have been  received can be used, and allowing some greater flexibility in how they  are used.   So I think that is evidence, again, that this body, and both  Democrats and Republicans working together, can get things done for the  American people that address the very direct needs and challenges they  face right now as a result of the coronavirus.   I credit the authors of that--Senators Collins and Rubio on our side,  along with their Democratic counterparts--for working together to  structure a program that has not only helped many businesses stay in  business--millions of businesses stay in business--but has kept tens of  millions of people in this country employed at a time when we  desperately need to keep those jobs.   So, again, I think it is evidence of this body's and our Senate  majority's focus on the coronavirus and things we can do to help assist  those who have been most harmed economically by that, as well as  addressing the very real health emergency that we need to continue to  focus on in terms of finding those therapeutics and vaccines that will  enable the American people to have confidence, once again, that they  can go out.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Carolina (Mr. Burr).    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Carolina (Mr. Burr).    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3893         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
