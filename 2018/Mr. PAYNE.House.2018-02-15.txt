 Mr. Speaker, what will it take? What will it take for this  body to finally grapple with this issue?   Columbine wasn't enough. West Virginia wasn't enough. Colorado, in a  movie theater, wasn't enough. A nightclub in Orlando wasn't enough.  Newtown wasn't enough.   Mr. Speaker, this has become a national disgrace. Ninety-five percent  of the American people say that they believe in sensible gun reform,  gun laws that make sense. Ninety-five percent. The minority party does  not represent 95 percent of this Nation.   You are in that number as well, yet you still turn your back on the  American people. The NRA stands for ``no Republican action.''                            ____________________
