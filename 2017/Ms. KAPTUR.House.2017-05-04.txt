 Mr. Speaker, TrumpCare is another false promise.  Actually, it is musical chairs. Millions of Americans will be left out  and priced out, especially the sick, the old, the pregnant, and the  mentally ill. Health insurance means life or death.   In this concoction, who is eligible? How much will it cost? Who will  be left out?   There is no budget score from the Congressional Budget Office.  Republicans aren't guaranteeing affordable coverage. Everybody knows  even a one-word change in your insurance policy can make a gigantic  difference in your coverage.   Why not give Americans a chance to calculate the bill's true cost and  how it will impact them?   As a result of the Affordable Care Act, 1 million Ohioans now have  health  [[Page H4148]]  insurance who didn't have it before. Here we are at the end of our long  voting week with a major proposal that will rip away the health  insurance benefits or make them unaffordable for millions of Americans.  Musical chairs is not the way to run the people's House nor the life- and-death affairs of a great nation. TrumpCare sets up a cruel game of  musical chairs. Shame, shame, shame.
