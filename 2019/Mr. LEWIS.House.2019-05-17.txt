 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from New York for yielding.   I thank David, my friend and my brother, for his leadership.   Today is May 17. On May 17, 1954, the United States Supreme Court  issued a decision. I remember that decision. I was 17 years old. I  thought I would be attending the segregated school. It never happened  for me.   Today, on this day, we have an opportunity to send a message now, to  help end discrimination in our country and set all of our people free.                   Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
