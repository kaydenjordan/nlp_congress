 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Tioga Central  and Waverly High School football teams. They are making history.   This is the first time two football teams from upstate Tioga County,  New York, are competing simultaneously in State title games.   Tioga football's resounding 63-16 victory in the semifinals marks  their third consecutive State title game appearance.   With 39 consecutive wins, they are not only chasing a third straight  State championship but also their fourth title since 2015.   Just as remarkably, Waverly football's dominant win of 42-0 in the  semifinals earned them a spot in the Class C State final for the first  time in school history.   This historic moment is a testament to the dedication of our student  athletes, the guidance of their coaches, and the unwavering support of  our community.   I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in congratulating these  young athletes, their coaches, their families, and the entire Tioga  County community.                            ____________________
