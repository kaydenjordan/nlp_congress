 Mr. Speaker, as we wait for a vote on a bill  to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I want to remind my colleagues that  51 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of the Affordable Care  Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That is more than the  support for Congress or the President.   More importantly, a recent study from Kaiser found that the ACA  markets are stabilizing and insurers are regaining profitability. Yet  we continue to hear false arguments saying that markets are collapsing  or in a death spiral. That is not true.   If the majority Republican is serious about fixing our healthcare  system and cutting costs to healthcare, they should give up plans to  repeal and start putting solutions over politics.   I have said for years that the ACA is not perfect. No bill this  Congress ever passed is. But in order to fix it, we need to work  together on a bipartisan basis.   The bill that the Senate and House GOP has proposed will undermine  protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. Now we are  hearing there is an amendment on the Senate side that will essentially  allow for the sale of policies with skimpier benefits, so long as  insurers offer an option that covers all ACA-mandated benefits. We know  where that goes. We will not be able to afford those benefits.                            ____________________
