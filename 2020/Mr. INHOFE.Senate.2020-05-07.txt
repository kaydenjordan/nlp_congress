 Mr. President, this is one of the rare places where you  can be in an institution with someone you dearly love and yet disagree  with so strongly. That is the relationship that we have. I have a lot  of respect for my friend from Virginia, but I think this has been  twisted around in a way to make the President look bad. In his heart,  he knew what he was doing at the time.   You know, we have to keep in mind--and I would even suggest--that  this is probably the boldest defense policy decision of his Presidency  to date. He authorized an airstrike against the leader of Iran's Quds  Force, Qasem Soleimani, in accordance with, I still believe, his  privilege and responsibilities under article II of the Constitution.   Now, let's remember who Soleimani was. It has been awhile now and a  lot has happened since then, but he was a terrorist. He was responsible  for the training and funding of militias across the Middle East, the  very militias that had targeted American personnel, facilities, and  partners for decades. He was a monster--nothing less.   Some people out there want to believe that his action was a rush to  war. Nothing could be further from the truth. Instead, looking at the  facts, they pushed ahead with the War Powers Resolution, and instead of  making war less likely, it made it more likely.   Let me tell you how.   The resolution was shortsighted and dangerous in February, but the 4  months since then have only confirmed that it was not necessary. We are  clearly not at war. Not only that, but an airstrike is not war.  Defending American lives is not war. The President has made it clear  that he doesn't desire war. We all know that. Nobody here wants war.   At the same time, nobody should want a policy that would leave  Americans vulnerable to the whims of Iran's terrorist-supporting  regime. If we do that, if we tie the President's hands so that he  cannot defend American lives, we leave ourselves more vulnerable and,  therefore, make war infinitely more likely, and accordingly, we must  all vote to sustain the President's veto.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S2313]]     Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator  Reed, we come to the floor today to ask our colleagues to join us in  recognizing Mr. Sarkis Tatigian, who began his Navy career at the age  of 19 during World War II and didn't end it until he passed away last  month at age 97.   At the time of his death, Mr. Tatigian, after nearly 78 years of  service, was the longest serving civil servant in the history of the  DOD. He was the only WWII sailor still serving in the Navy Department.   Eligible for retirement since 1973, Mr. Tatigian continued to honor  America through his faithful service as the Naval Sea Systems  Command's, NAVSEA, small business advocate, championing our Navy, our  small businesses, and our country.   Mr. Tatigian began his civilian career with the Navy in July 1942 as  a junior radio inspector at the naval aircraft factory in the  Philadelphia Navy Yard and the Navy Office of Inspector of Naval  Aircraft in Linden, NJ. He left his position as an inspector in March  1943 and entered the uniformed Navy as an Active-Duty sailor in April  1943. In June 1944, as an aviation electronics technician's mate, he  aided in the development of the Navy's first guided anti-ship munition,  the ASM-N-2 ``BAT'' glide bomb. The BAT became an operational weapon in  January 1945 and was used to sink two Japanese warships later that  year.   In 1943, Mr. Tatigian began his service at NAVSEA, then called the  Bureau of Ordinance. After World War II, he transitioned from the  Active-Duty to the civil service working on guided munitions.   In 1951, Mr. Tatigian saw the need to expand the Navy's industrial  base and believed that small business was the answer. He developed a  small business mobile exhibit that traveled coast to coast, visiting  all State capitals and cities with populations exceeding 400,000. For  his organizational efforts on the exhibit, Tatigian received  congressional recognition. His work expanded the small business  industrial base with more than $100 billion in contracts awarded to  diverse, small businesses.   Over his unprecedented career, Mr. Tatigian received numerous awards,  including the Navy's Superior Civilian Service Award in 2007. In  recognition of his exceptional accomplishments in service, the Navy has  even named an award after him, the Sarkis Tatigian Small Business  Award, which recognizes outstanding performance through organizational  culture and command climate.   Mr. Tatigian's life of dedication and service to his country is truly  inspirational. On behalf of a grateful nation, we thank you, Mr. Sarkis  Tatigian, for all you have done for our people, our government, and our  Navy.                            ____________________
