 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of  Samuel Eason Balch of Birmingham, AL, who passed away peacefully at his  home on April 14, 2018. He will be long remembered for his love of life  and his ability to maintain a positive outlook despite any adversity  that came his way.   Mr. Balch's industrious spirit began showing at a young age. While  attending high school, he tended to his family farm and worked at a  local drugstore. Following graduation, Mr. Balch entered the University  of Alabama School of Commerce, where he quickly became involved in the  political scene and the campus social scene. After earning his bachelor  of science in business, Eason enlisted in the U.S. Army.   Mr. Balch began his military career by entering the Army Officers'  Training Corps, OTC, exhibiting his dedicated work ethic from the  start. He was quickly commissioned second lieutenant. After graduating  from OTC, he was transferred to Fort Pickett, VA, where he was promoted  to captain and shipped out to La Havre, France. Eason finished his time  in the Army as a major. It will not be forgotten that Mr. Balch spent  much of the first half of his life serving our great Nation, proving  his honor and dedication to service.   Following his years of service to the Army, Eason attended the  University of Virginia School of Law. After receiving his law degree,  he and his family moved to Birmingham where he joined the law firm  Martin, Turner, and McWhorter, which is today known as Balch and  Bingham. Mr. Balch played an integral role in developing and growing  the firm and went on to become a highly respected, valued adviser for  many young lawyers throughout Alabama. I, along with many others,  considered Eason to be one of the top utility lawyers in the United  States.   Outside of his professional career, Mr. Balch held a national  presence in the Public Utility Bar and served on the board of directors  for the Alabama Power Company for over 20 years. He was also a devoted  member of the Cathedral Church of the Advent in Birmingham, AL, for 70  years.   Eason and his lovely wife, Betsy, were good friends to my wife,  Annette, and me for many years. I will always remember his ability to  entertain any audience. Eason never met a stranger.   I offer my deepest condolences to Eason's children and to all of his  loved ones as they celebrate his life and mourn this great  loss.                            ____________________
