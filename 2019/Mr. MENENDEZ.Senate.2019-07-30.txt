 Madam President, let me thank my colleague from  Illinois, who has been a clarion voice in this regard, a strong  proponent of human rights and democracy in Venezuela and in other parts  of the world, but in this case, in Venezuela; who has traveled there at  a time when people could not travel--certainly from the Congress--in an  effort to see if there was a pathway forward and to see the plight of  the Venezuelan people. I really appreciate his cosponsorship with me on  this temporary protected status for Venezuelans. His leadership is  critically important, not only as the Democratic whip but also as a  senior member of the Judiciary Committee that I hope can take up this  legislation.   I will say this: I regret that our colleague from Utah, No. 1,  objected, and No. 2, left. I would just make two observations on his  comments. No. 1, there was a strong bipartisan vote in the House of  Representatives. So, no, there was not unanimity, but there was a  strong bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives. Secondly, this  legislation has been over here in the Senate for some time. We have  offered it for some time, so it is not new.   Thirdly, I would just say as to whether we get to legislate in this  Chamber, that depends on the majority leader and his side of the aisle,  who control the floor. We would like to see legislating take place. We  would be happy to have a debate on the fierce urgency of this as it  relates to this issue of TPS, temporary protected status.   I fear my colleague was unaware of what he objected to. This is  urgently needed legislation that would have granted that temporary-- underline temporary--protected status. This is a class of people who  need to be protected, the approximately 200,000 Venezuelans currently  residing in the United States.   As we all know, the Maduro regime has created an unprecedented  humanitarian crisis in Venezuela that has now forced more than 4  million Venezuelans and migrants to flee their homeland--more than 4  million. Think about it. This is on the verge of becoming one of the  greatest humanitarian catastrophes in a refugee situation that we have  in the world--and that is something considering what has happened in  Syria and other places in the world--right here in our own hemisphere.   In response to this humanitarian tragedy, last December--this has  been around several months--Senator Durbin offered the first bipartisan  bill to provide TPS for Venezuelans, which we reintroduced in February.  Last week, the House passed their own bipartisan version of the  legislation with support of dozens of Republican Members. It is an  unconscionable moral failing for the Senate not to approve this  legislation.   Earlier this month, as the senior member of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, I traveled to the Venezuela border to see the  crisis firsthand. I returned convinced that we cannot afford to sit on  the sidelines any longer. My colleague, I think, would not have  objected to TPS for Venezuelans if he saw what I saw.   During my trip to Cucuta, I walked on the Colombian side of the Simon  Bolivar International Bridge, between Colombia and Venezuela, amidst  thousands of Venezuelan refugees--30,000 cross each and every day--and  migrants who cross into Colombia each and every day. I joined thousands  of Venezuelans who were fleeing hunger as they sought food at the  Divine Providence soup kitchen.   I visited patients seeking medical care that is no longer available  in Venezuela. By the way, Venezuela should be one of the wealthiest  countries in the Western Hemisphere. It has huge oil and natural gas  reserves, but despite that they can't get medical care in Venezuela  because the hospital system has completely collapsed. When I was there  in Colombia at the border, the United Nations High Commissioner for  Human Rights issued a report decrying that the Maduro regime's security  forces had murdered nearly 7,000 Venezuelans in the last 2 years-- 7,000. My colleague cannot possibly want to return Venezuelans to the  cruel conditions they are fleeing. That is what temporary protected  status is all about.   I have applauded--I don't find too many times in which I am in  agreement with the Trump administration, but I supported their efforts  on sanctions and other efforts around the Maduro regime so we can  restore democracy and human rights, but how can you say and do all the  things you are doing in Venezuela and then have a deportation force  that wants to round up these people who have done nothing wrong and  send them back to the country where 7,000 have been killed by Maduro?   These extraordinary conditions have scattered millions of Venezuelans  in countries across the Americas. Today 1.3 million reside in Colombia,  750,000 in Peru, 250,000 in Ecuador, and the numbers keep growing.  Colombia and its neighbors have largely welcomed Venezuelans as they  flee a devastating humanitarian catastrophe.   By not approving this bill today, the United States is failing to  match their efforts and failing to approve temporary protected status  for the vulnerable of Venezuelans already living in our country.   For those who doubt whether TPS would make a difference for these  Venezuelan families, let me share with you a few stories provided to my  office by the respected Venezuelan human rights group Foro Penal.   Yuley Gomez is the mother of Luis David, a 4-year-old who has a  delicate heart condition. In Venezuela, Yuley asked for help from  everyone she could, but all she received was a prescription for  painkillers. In a closed-door meeting, she was told privately to wait  for the inevitable death of her child, a 4-year-old. Just imagine being  told to wait for a son or daughter to succumb to a treatable illness.  No parent would do that.   After great personal sacrifice, Yuley made it to the United States  and admitted her son into Boston Children's Hospital. Three years  later, David is  [[Page S5156]]  thriving, but he requires frequent checkups and treatments that remain  unavailable in Venezuela to this day.   Then there is Leila Calderon, who resides in my home State of New  Jersey. Her nephew, who once lived with her in Caracas, is a pilot in  the Venezuela Armed Forces. He was wrongly arrested for plotting to  overthrow Maduro. In the absence of evidence, he was released from  jail, but on his way home, he received a call warning him that military  counterintelligence agents were waiting for him. When he tried to hide,  security forces arbitrarily arrested his mother, his girlfriend, and  his father-in-law. The following day, he was detained and charged once  more, again with no evidence. He remains imprisoned today.   Even Leila, who has publicly advocated for his release, has been  labeled as a ``terrorist'' on national television by the regime thug  Diosdado Cabello.   Let me share the story of Omar Acosta. His brother, Captain Rafael  Acosta Arevalo, was detained on June 21, 2019, by members of the  Venezuela military counterintelligence. After being forcibly imprisoned  for a week, on June 28 of 2019, Captain Acosta was rolled into an  arraignment hearing in a wheelchair, visibly affected by torture. He  died the following day. The kind of torture that took Captain Acosta's  life is one of the many dangers Venezuelans in the United States would  need to fear if we don't approve TPS.   The Maduro regime's unthinkable abuses have created a full-blown  refugee crisis in our own hemisphere. These extraordinary, and what we  pray are temporary, conditions prevent millions of Venezuelans from  safely returning home, including nearly 200,000 in our own country.   There has been a broad bipartisan support for the Trump  administration's effort to confront the Maduro regime. However, as we  confront Maduro, we cannot turn our back on the Venezuelan people.  Unfortunately, today the Senate has chosen not to act. We could have  sent legislation to the President's desk that ensures that vulnerable  Venezuelans in the United States are not sent back into harm's way-- into potential death or imprisonment. Instead, we did nothing.   This is a tragedy in its own right. This is what we could have  avoided today. I am sure Senator Durbin and I will continue to push  forward. We will both challenge the leadership here to allow us either  to have this passed or give us a vote. I think the community should  know who stands on their side and whether they are willing to protect  them temporarily from the enormous humanitarian catastrophe--the great  risk of the loss of life or liberty that exists for Venezuelans in the  United States who have fled to freedom.   We are going to go out of session the end of this week. That means  all these people will languish for the summer, not knowing whether, in  fact, they can be deported back to a country in which they may well  lose their life or their liberty. That is pretty outrageous. If we  can't get it done this week, I hope to God we can get it done in  September. If not, I worry about a continuing crisis that will only  lead to greater uncertainty and create greater risk to those simply  fleeing freedom and who are being, by the way, very productive citizens  here while they are temporarily in our country.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, one final comment to my colleague. The  7,000 who have been killed by Maduro's secret police is reflective of  the fact that those who are here are some of the earliest opponents of  Maduro--those who tried to create change but fled. They have a  heightened reason why, in fact, going back--in addition to the chaos  and in addition to the danger--they are particularly threatened, at the  end of the day, because they are the ones who were trying to create  change and found a situation in which the threat of their life was at  risk so they came to the United States.   Getting protected status--if there was ever a moment in which  temporary protected status was envisioned, it is for this situation.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise in opposition to the nomination  of Ms. Kelly Craft to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador to the United  Nations.   As a firm believer in the strength and power of U.S. diplomacy, there  are three main reasons I oppose Ambassador Craft's nomination.   First and foremost, she lacks the experience necessary to stand up  for American values and promote our national security on the global  stage.   Second, during her brief diplomatic tenure in Canada, she posted so  many absences that I cannot describe it as anything less than a  dereliction of duty.   Ambassador Craft has also been unable or unwilling to convince the  Senate that she will fully separate her professional obligations from  her family's business interests. We cannot have an ambassador to the  United Nations who risks using this incredibly influential position in  ways that could benefit her own family's finances.   This position is one of the most important diplomatic posts in our  government. It is a global stage, and every leader who serves in this  role must always put country first.   Since its founding, some of our most distinguished public servants  have represented the United States at the U.N.: George H. W. Bush,  Jeane Kirkpatrick, Thomas Pickering, Madeleine Albright, John  Negroponte, Susan Rice, and Samantha Power.   These Americans brought to the table years of experience as former  Ambassadors, senior State Department officials, National Security  Council staff, and more. Ambassador Craft simply cannot match the  foreign policy and national security expertise offered by these  distinguished leaders.   Before serving as the U.S. Ambassador to Canada, she had no previous  significant foreign policy experience or executive experience at all.  It would seem that her most relevant credential is that she, along with  her husband, contributed more than $1 million to the President's  campaign.   During the confirmation process, Ambassador Craft's performance  suggested a deep lack of knowledge and applicable experience.   I want to be clear. This is not a judgment on her character. This is  merely an assessment of her ability to represent the United States of  America on the world stage where she will grapple with some of the most  complex and challenging foreign policy issues of our time.   When asked at her hearing to identify the most pressing issues facing  the U.N. and comment on how the United States could leverage the U.N.  to pursue our national foreign policy priorities, Craft displayed no  sophisticated understanding of the many challenges confronting our  country.   She failed to mention North Korea's aggression on nuclear  proliferation. She failed to mention ongoing threats from Iran. She  failed to mention China's growing power and Russia's continued malign  influence. When asked about the two-state solution, she could not  articulate a viewpoint. When asked by Senator Paul whether she believed  the Iraq war was a mistake, she replied that she was ``not going to  second guess the . . . Bush administration.''   In response to Senator Cardin's question about the threat of climate  change, she said that the United States does not need to be a member of  the  [[Page S5183]]  Paris climate agreement in order to show leadership. All the more  disturbing are her past comments on climate change, such as when she  said, ``I believe there are scientists on both sides that are  accurate.''   Taken together, these answers should alarm anyone who hopes that the  United States can use our power, our influence, and our leadership  position to promote our interests and answer the great challenges of  our time. Simply put, never in our Nation's history has a President  nominated such an underqualified person to this critical post just for  being a donor.   Ms. Craft also lacks the professionalism needed to be the U.N.  Ambassador. As our Ambassador to Canada, she had one job: to represent  the United States in Canada. Yet, during her time in Ottawa, the  defining characteristic of her service appears to be how little time  she actually spent there.   The numbers speak for themselves.   During the 608 days she served as U.S. Ambassador in Ottawa, she  spent 357 days outside of Canada. Let me repeat that. During her 21  months assigned to Ottawa, she spent an entire year out of Canada.   For my colleagues who insist she was engaged in trade negotiations,  the State Department's own records suggest otherwise. Indeed, the  record shows she spent only 40 days on travel related to USMCA. She  did, however, spend 210 days at her homes in Kentucky or Oklahoma. I  repeat, she spent 7 of her 21 months as our Ambassador in Canada at  home in the United States. The last time I checked, not a single round  of the USMCA negotiations took place in Kentucky or Oklahoma.   Additionally, while Ms. Craft claims that she always received  approval from her travel, records show that she spent at least 11 days  out of the country without State Department approval. Should she be  confirmed as Ambassador of the U.N., I think it is very fair to say  that if an international crisis erupts, we might more likely find her  in Kentucky than New York City.   Ambassador Craft's absences represent a total abdication of her  responsibility as the head of the U.S. Embassy in Canada--one of our  Nation's most vital allies.   In one troubling instance, during the month when the Trump  administration shut down the Federal Government, Ambassador Craft was  in Ottawa for only 2 days. Rather than provide leadership to Embassy  personnel during uncertain times, she was at home in Kentucky. Perhaps  she thought she was nonessential personnel.   Finally, Ms. Craft has also displayed a lack of diligence when it  comes to preventing conflicts of interest. I know this administration  has sunk to some new lows when it comes to mixing family business with  national security, but that doesn't mean it is OK. Norms are only as  strong as our will to stand up and defend them. That is why we must  push back against self-promotion at the expense of the American people.   We also know that Ambassador Craft's husband, Joe Craft, runs the  second largest coal producer in the Eastern United States and has  lobbied the EPA to roll back regulations against air and water  pollution. Ms. Craft insisted to the committee that her husband ``plays  no role whatsoever in official U.S. government business,'' but email  and calendar records tell a different story. When Ambassador Craft  needed information about a U.S. environmental project, she asked her  husband--not Embassy employees--to connect her to former EPA  Administrator Scott Pruitt. When the EPA sent the requested information  to the Ambassador, they included her spouse on the response. In  addition, according to official calendars, Mr. Craft participated in at  least four meetings with U.S. or Canadian Government energy and  environmental officials. The potential conflicts of interest are  staggering.   The nomination of Ms. Craft to this position underscores the Trump  administration's total lack of respect for the work of diplomacy, for  our diplomats, and for the United Nations.   Taken together, Ambassador Craft's lack of experience, her  dereliction of duty and excessive absences in Ottawa, and her  unwillingness to address potential conflicts of interest render her  unfit to serve as our Ambassador to the United Nations.   In a world of growing challenges, the American people deserve a  serious, thoughtful, and proven leader to represent their interests at  the United Nations. They deserve a leader who can leverage the United  Nations to advance our national security interests and ultimately build  a safer, more stable, prosperous world. They deserve a leader who will  put the interests of the people over the profits of their family. Kelly  Knight Craft is not that leader. For those reasons, I will vote no on  this nomination and urge my colleagues to join me.                            ____________________
