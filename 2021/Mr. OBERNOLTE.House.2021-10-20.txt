 Madam Speaker, I rise this evening deeply concerned  about the pressures that have been brought to bear on America's supply  chains and the effects that those pressures are having on inflation and  on the constituencies that we represent.   Every day, I talk to members of the community from my district who  are struggling in paying their bills. They are struggling because, just  in the last year, they are being asked to pay over $20 more in my  county to fill their gas tanks to get to work. They are being asked to  pay substantially more for commodities like milk and eggs and bacon.   Madam Speaker, economists say that this inflationary pressure is  greatly exacerbated by the irresponsible spending decisions that have  been made right here in this Chamber in the last 18 months. That is  important to talk about tonight, because we are considering the largest  spending bill in the history of our country.   In fact, if you take the version of that bill that is in print and  the spending it represents, combined with the extra Federal spending  that has been approved over the last 18 months, added together, that  exceeds the combined annual wages of every single American. I find that  a stunning statistic. I am also very concerned about the possible  impact that this spending will have on our national debt.   Now, the administration just this week has said that this spending  package will be fully paid for and will not add a single dollar to our  deficit. My response to that is: prove it.                                time  1715    Speaking charitably here, it strains credibility to believe that that  would be the case. It is certainly not the case that the current  version of the spending bill that is in print is fully paid for. But if  the new version will be paid for, prove it. Wait to vote on the bill  until the Congressional Budget Office has had a chance to score it and  verify that that claim is accurate.   Madam Speaker, even if that is the goal, I would submit that America  does not have a revenue problem. In fact, last year we collected more  in tax revenue than in any year in our entire country's history. We do  not have a revenue problem, Madam Speaker. We have a spending problem.   Even if you believe, as some of my colleagues do, that the problem is  that we don't tax people enough and that we need to enact the largest  tax increase in the history of our country, which is what this bill  would do, then my question would be, why would we not use that extra  revenue to shore up the social safety programs that are already in  danger of failing, programs that people depend on, like Medicare and  Social Security?   Why would you not use that extra revenue to pay down the $2 trillion  of deficit that we currently have every year and the almost $29  trillion of national debt that we will be passing on to our children  and their children?   Madam Speaker, I pray that we will get our fiscal house in order and  stop this reckless Federal spending.
