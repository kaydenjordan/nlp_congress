 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address my concerns with  the GOP tax bill.   Calling this bill the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is simply wrong.   Adding $1.5 trillion to our deficit and assuming--and basically  hoping--corporations will create jobs is irresponsible. There is no  guarantee jobs will be created and no incentive for job training. This  is wrong.   In America, we have a skilled trade crisis. We cannot continue to  operate our economy and jobs without skilled trades. We must give  incentives to invest in new technology and equipment for our  corporations, but we must do that while demanding that they also invest  in skilled trade training and investment.   Tax reform was a real chance to close the skills gap, reinvest in our  workers, and create a 21st century job training program.                            ____________________
