 Madam Speaker, I rise today also in opposition to S.J.  Resolution 15, the Congressional Review Act repeal of the Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency's true lender rule.   The United States has the most vibrant and innovative financial  system in the world. Recent advancements in technology have fostered  products and partnerships that expand access to credit to large swaths  of the population that previously couldn't access basic financial  services.   Many of these innovations faced challenges from regulatory red tape  or confusing and often conflicting rules. The OCC's true lender rule  gave needed clarity to banks and their partners, fixing the disastrous  Madden rule.   The OCC's true lender rule gave that clarity, but unfortunately, the  effort in the House today threatens to undermine the progress that we  have made and compromise underbanked individuals' and small businesses'  access to financial services.   I spoke with a local Kentucky bank that partners with a nonbank  fintech lender to provide credit to consumers, including many  underbanked populations. They told me that absent the true lender rule,  they will once again be buried in compliance costs to keep track of the  patchwork of cases that dictate the rules of the road.   Rather than embrace innovation to deliver cost savings to their  customers, many of whom have trouble accessing traditional financial  services to begin with, the bank will need to retain thousand-dollar- an-hour New York lawyers just to keep everything straight. And guess  what? Those costs get passed on to the consumer through higher prices  or reduced product availability.   This is yet another example of the Democrats sacrificing good policy  for the sake of political points, all under the guise of consumer  protection.   Contrary to some of the rhetoric from my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle, a vote for this CRA will actually harm the very people  they purport to be helping.   Madam Speaker, one final point. I include in the Record an April 14,  2021, letter to the chair of the Financial Services Committee from the  former OCC Acting Comptroller Blake Paulson.                                          Office of the Comptroller                                                 of the Currency,                                     Washington, DC, April 14, 2021.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Patrick McHenry,      Ranking Member, Committee on Financial Services, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member McHenry: On March       26, 2021, H.J. Res. 35 was introduced, providing for       Congressional disapproval under the Congressional Review Act       of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC)       final rule, entitled ``National Banks and Federal Savings       Associations as Lenders,'' commonly referred to as the ``True       Lender'' rule. As you and other members consider the       resolution, I want you to be aware of the rule's intended       effect and the adverse impact of overturning the rule.        On October 27, 2020, the OCC issued its final true lender       rule to provide legal and regulatory certainty to national       banks' and federal savings associations' (banks) lending,       including loans made in partnerships with third parties. The       OCC's rule specifies that a bank makes a loan and is       considered to be the true lender of the loan if, as of the       date of origination, it (1) is named as the lender in the       loan agreement or (2) funds the loan. The rule clarifies that       as the true lender of a loan, the bank retains the compliance       obligations associated with making the loan, even if the loan       is later sold, thus negating concerns regarding harmful rent-      a-charter arrangements. Our rulemaking prevents potential       arrangements in which a bank receives a fee to ``rent'' its       charter and unique legal status to a third party with the       intent of evading state and local laws, while disclaiming any       compliance responsibility for the loan. These schemes have       absolutely no place in the federal banking system, and this       rule helps address them.        The rule makes clear banks' responsibility and       accountability for the loans they make and facilitates the       OCC's supervision of this core banking activity. Disapproval       of the rule would return bank lending relationships to the       previous state of legal and regulatory uncertainty, which, as       nearly 50 preeminent economic and finance scholars explained       in January 2021, adversely affects the function of secondary       markets and restricts the availability of credit.        Legal and regulatory certainty facilitates access to       responsible credit and clarifies responsibility and       accountability in lending involving third-party partnerships.       Bank third-party partnerships help banks better serve their       communities by expanding access to affordable credit products       from mainstream financial service providers. Such access is       particularly important as individuals and small businesses       across the country work to recover from effects of the COVID-      19 pandemic. Banks seek partnerships with third parties for a       variety of legitimate reasons, including reaching additional       markets, benefiting from specific expertise or technology,       and improving the efficiency and cost of their own       operations. The OCC's third-party risk management guidance       and supplemental exam procedures make clear to banks that       they retain the risks for activities conducted through       relationships with third parties.        With the legal and regulatory certainty provided by the       rule, lending by banks made in partnership with third parties       can be assessed as part of the ongoing supervision of these       banks, including as part of the OCC's examinations to       evaluate bank compliance with applicable laws and regulations       that ensure consumer protection, Bank Secrecy Act and anti-      money laundering compliance, required disclosures, and other       obligations associated with making loans. The OCC clarified       examiner responsibilities in assessing true lender activities       in third-party relationships in 202l. This clarification       addressed considerations related to assessing banks' due       diligence on the lending product or activity (e.g., terms and       scope) and the third party; credit risk management, including       underwriting practices; model risk management; compliance       management systems; and ongoing monitoring of the lending       activity and the third party's performance.        If a bank fails to satisfy any of its compliance       obligations, the OCC will not hesitate to use its supervisory       and enforcement authorities to correct the deficiencies,       protect consumers, and ensure the federal banking system       operates in a safe, sound, and fair manner.        As you consider the Congressional Review Act resolution,       you should be confident that the OCC issued this rule with       the intent to enhance its ability to supervise bank lending.       The rulemaking conformed to the Administrative Procedure Act,       and the agency considered all stakeholder comments provided       during the rulemaking process. The resulting rule is       consistent with the authority granted to the agency by       Congress.        It is also important to dispel misperceptions of the rule,       many of which are repeated by opponents of the rule. To be       clear, the rule does not change banks' authority to export       interest rates. That authority is granted by federal statute.       Nor does the rule permit national banks to charge whatever       rate they like; national banks and federal savings       associations have the same authority as state banks regarding       the exportation of interest rates. Both federal and state-      chartered banks must conform to applicable interest rate       limits. Disparities of interest rates from state to state       result from differences in the state laws that impose these       caps, not OCC rules or actions. States retain the authority       to set interest rates, and rates vary from state-to-state.        The rule does not limit states' ability to regulate the       conduct of state-licensed and regulated nonbank lenders,       which engage in the vast majority of predatory lending.       States are the primary regulators of nonbank lenders,       including payday lenders. Nonbank lenders are generally also       subject to the rules and enforcement actions of the Consumer       Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  [[Page H3108]]         It is also important to understand why demand exists for       short-term, small-dollar credit products and why many       consumers rely on nonbank sources of such credit, including       payday lenders. Unfortunately, mainstream service providers,       including commercial banks, largely abandoned short-term       small-dolJar lending over the past two decades. The resulting       lack of choice and fewer options pushed up the cost of these       products and forced consumers to seek services on less       favorable terms. Because millions of U.S. consumers do not       have sufficient savings or access to traditional credit, they       borrow nearly $90 billion each year in short-term small-      dollar loans typically ranging from $300 to $5,000 to make       ends meet and to address things like emergency car repairs       and other unexpected expenses. That is why the OCC has       remained vocal about encouraging banks to provide consumers       with more safe and affordable options to meet these small-      dollar needs. In providing these products, banks should       consider the ``Interagency Lending Principles for Offering       Responsible Small-Dollar Loans,'' published in May 2020.       Banks should also consider the full and actual cost of a       credit product and its affordability. Fees associated with       short-term loans may range from $10 to $30 per $100 borrowed,       and the imputed annual percentage rate (APR) of those loans       can appear to exceed 100 percent or more. But often, the fees       and total cost of these loans to the consumer can be less       than that of loans made with a 36 percent APR, when such       loans are available at all.        As you consider the Congressional Review Act resolution,       please keep in mind what may be an unintended consequence of       a Congressional Review Act disapproval. Disapproving the       OCC's true lender rule will constrain future Comptroller       ability to address the true lender issue and may limit the       OCC's ability to take supervisory or enforcement actions       against banks that would have been deemed to have ``made''       the loan under the true lender rule. Rather than vacate the       rule, limit future Comptrollers from taking up similar rules       or possibly hamstring the OCC's enforcement authority,       changes to the rule, if any, should be made through the       agency's rulemaking process and in accordance with the       Administrative Procedures Act.        Enclosed is a fact sheet that provides additional       information for your awareness. If you have any questions or       need additional information, please do not hesitate to       contact me or Carrie Moore, Director, Congressional       Relations.            Sincerely,                                                  Blake J. Paulson,                                Acting Comptroller of the Currency.     The point I want to highlight is that the former Acting  Comptroller was making the point that disapproving the OCC's true  lender rule will constrain a future Comptroller's ability to address  the true lender issue and limit the OCC's ability to take supervisory  or enforcement actions against banks that would have been deemed to  have made the loan under the true lender rule; meaning that the way the  CRA law operates, if the House passes this resolution, we will have a  permanent problem in the credit markets that will deprive low- and  moderate-income Americans of the financial products that they  desperately need.   That is why I urge all my colleagues to reject this misguided  proposal.
