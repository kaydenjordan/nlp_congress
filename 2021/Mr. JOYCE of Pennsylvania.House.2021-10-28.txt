 Madam Speaker, tomorrow we will recognize  World Psoriasis Day. Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are diseases  that affect over 125 million people worldwide.   As a practicing dermatologist for 25 years, I have seen firsthand the  toll that this condition can have on patients. This disease can often  have serious and long-lasting consequences, including anxiety,  depression, diabetes, and even cardiac issues.   In the past, we were often, unfortunately, unsuccessful in treating  the symptoms that the men and women battling psoriasis face each and  every day.   Recently, however, we are seeing new treatments and therapies that  have dramatically improved our fight against psoriasis.  [[Page H5962]]    Finding new and more effective treatments or finding a cure to this  disease will take all of us. It will take doctors, it will take  legislators, researchers, patients, and advocates working together to  find solutions.   It is my promise that I will continue working to address the disease  of psoriasis.                            ____________________
