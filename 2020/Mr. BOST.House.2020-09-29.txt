 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Davis for yielding.   You know, that is true, I have known   John Shimkus since he was  actually a treasurer in Madison County, where he was the one that held  the spot after it had been 10 years since a Republican had held the  spot, and he took that.   I was a State legislator, and I kept hearing about this guy,   John  Shimkus from Madison County. I actually came to know him as I ran for  State representative. And then all of a sudden, they said he is going  to run for Congress, and I thought, what a wonderful thing.   You know, each one of us in our districts when we see that and as we  are local elected officials, we think, oh, that is going to be good,  but we didn't realize how great it would be.   At this time, when we would like to joke with John because we love  him, the reality is he has served his district well. He hasn't just  served his district  [[Page H5045]]  well. He has served the State well, he has served the Nation well, and  he has made differences in the world.   I would like to harass him about the fact that he is an Army guy, as  a Marine, but the reality is that he served well in the Army as well.   He is a man of integrity. He is a man of faith. He loves his family.  And, really, that is what our Nation is about.   He is going to be missed terribly in this body.   We want to joke about the fact that he is quitting. But you know  what? He didn't quit. He stood up. He stood up in tough times. He stood  up in good times. But the people of this Nation are better because this  man has served in Congress.   He is a close friend. You can hear that with the people that are  talking here.   He is a father who loves his children. He is a husband that loves his  wife. He is a man that loves his God. Who could ask for anything more?   John, thank you.
