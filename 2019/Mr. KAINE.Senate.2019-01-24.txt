 Mr. President, for Democrats, antipathy to the President  is not the issue. The issue is antipathy to shutting down the  government.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes.    The issue isn't antipathy to the President. It is that  Democrats don't believe in shutting down government.   I appreciate my colleague from South Dakota stating the issue the way  he did at the beginning of his talk: Democrats will not engage in  negotiations to reopen the government.   Let's be plain. Democrats think the Government of the United States  should never close. Democrats think that using a shutdown as leverage  to get something else is illegitimate and beneath the oath of office.  The President, on the other hand, said that he is proud to shut  government down and is willing to use the suffering of more than  800,000 employees and millions of American citizens to get his way.   The difference here is not on the immigration topics; there are  differences that can be resolved. But the difference that is hard to  resolve is a President and a party that believe in government shutdowns  and a party that rejects the idea of government shutdowns.   I will state complete willingness to negotiate with this President  and my colleagues over border security. We--8 Democrats, 8  Republicans--introduced a proposal in February with border security  investments, protections for Dreamers; 46 out of 49 of Democrats  supported a $25 billion border security investment, and only 8 of 51  Republicans did. The President blew up the deal.   So the issue is not about negotiation over border security. We have  been a more reliable party in making border security investments than  the majority party has been. The issue is this: Is it or is it not  illegitimate to shut down the government of the greatest Nation on  Earth and inflict needless pain on hundreds of thousands of workers and  millions of citizens when you don't get your way? That is what is at  stake.   Is the proposal that is on the table offered by the President a  ``compromise''? If it were a compromise, the President would have  talked to us about it. If it were a compromise, the majority would let  us offer amendments about it. If it were a compromise, the majority  would have had a hearing about it so that we could have asked questions  about it.   Introducing a 1,200-page bill on Tuesday and calling a vote on  Thursday and giving Democrats no opportunity to ask questions or  propose amendments is not a compromise. It is my way or the highway.  What we should be doing to show that we respect the President's  proposal is referring it to the committee of origin, having committee  hearings and markup next week, and putting it on the floor the  following week. If the President means it as a compromise, he should  allow the Democratic Party--minority here and majority in the House--to  have an opportunity to shape it.   It is my hope that my Republican colleagues will vote to reopen  government this afternoon, through February 8, so that we would use  next week to have a committee process to consider the President's  proposal and the following week consider it on the floor. These are  important enough topics that it would seem giving it a 2-week review by  committee and by Senators on the floor is not asking too much.   Briefly, before yielding to my colleague from Missouri, I will say  that I just returned from Reagan National Airport, where I met with air  traffic controllers, TSA agents, airline safety specialists who  maintain the radar and other safety equipment at this and other  airports. They talked about how this shutdown in which they are working  but not being paid is starting to fray them as they are working  overtime, as they are trying to get jobs when they are not working 10- hour shifts to try to cover the bills they have to cover for  babysitters and rent and medical appointments. They are talking about  the degradation of the safety of American air traffic because of air  traffic controllers not being paid, TSA agents not being paid, airline  safety specialists not being paid and, in some instances, furloughed.  If nothing else, we should care about the safety of commercial  aviation. That is one reason, among many, that we should end the  shutdown.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today is day 34 of the longest shutdown of  government in United States history. We must end this shutdown. We must  reopen government right away. Today, I want to talk about legislation  that would provide some assistance to the Federal workers who are  suffering from this unnecessary shutdown, the Emergency Relief for  Federal Workers Act of 2019.   Tomorrow, 800,000 Federal workers who work hard and just want to  serve their Nation will not receive a paycheck. They have not received  a paycheck since December 28th, 2018. However, more than 400,000 hold  positions so essential to our Nation that they must go to work  regardless of their pay status.   Thus shutdown hurts these workers. I have talked about the personal  stories of Virginians who serve our Nation in the Coast Guard, the  Environmental Protection Agency, and the Forest Service. This shutdown  means families that have jobs cannot pay their mortgages or rent. They  cannot buy food to feed their families. They cannot afford to refill  prescriptions critical to the health of their children. This shutdown  threatens Federal workers with financial ruin. Again, we must reopen  the government immediately.   We have passed legislation to provide retroactive pay to these  workers when the shutdown ends, but we do not know when that will  happen. So today, I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues to  introduce the Emergency Relief for Federal Workers Act. This  legislation would allow federal employees who are in desperate  financial straits directly because of this shutdown to borrow from what  is, for many, their largest financial asset, their retirement account.   This legislation would allow Federal workers in the Thrift Savings  Plan to access their savings without immediate penalty to meet the  financial hardships caused by the government shutdown. It would allow  them to pay for basic necessities during the shutdown and allow them to  replenish their savings after the shutdown ends.   I do not know how much longer 800,000 families will have to wait to  be made whole after this manufactured crisis. And I do not advocate  irresponsibly borrowing from retirement savings. But I believe we must  act to help the people who make our federal government function in this  time of need they are in through no fault of their own.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Thank you, Mr.  President.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Barrasso, Mrs.          Blackburn, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Cramer, Mr.          Crapo, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Daines, Ms. Ernst, Mrs. Fischer, Mr.          Gardner, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hoeven, Mrs. Hyde-Smith, Mr. Inhofe,          Mr. Isakson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Moran, Mr. Risch,          Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rounds, Mr. Young, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Rubio, and          Mr. Perdue):   S. 215.
