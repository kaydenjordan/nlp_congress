 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deep  misgivings about the recent healthcare proposals put forth by the  Senate. This bill, like the American Health Care Act, proposes drastic  cuts to Medicaid and would saddle my constituents and Americans with  skyrocketing premiums and deductibles.   We are placing our hardworking families and young children, our  elderly, veterans, and Native Americans in harm's way by making  coverage unaffordable and unattainable.   The cost of this legislation will be paid by those who can least  afford it. Recent reports show that the cost of Medicaid cuts in this  bill would cost Arizonans more than $7 billion. This means hundreds of  thousands of people, including nursing home patients who rely on  affordable, lifesaving coverage, will be kicked off their Medicaid  coverage.   From the beginning, these pieces of legislation have been crafted  behind closed doors without input from doctors, nurses, and healthcare  leaders.   While we play partisan games, the health and well-being of our  families, friends, and neighbors are at risk. If we want to get serious  about fixing our healthcare system and bringing down costs, we must  work together on bipartisan legislation.                            ____________________
