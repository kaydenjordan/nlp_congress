 Mr. President, I want to add to Senator Nelson's comments.  First, let me just say, in a time when there is a lot of noise and news  about the divisions in American politics, despite differences of  opinion on issues, this is what I believe the people of Florida want us  to do; that is, to come here and work together on the issues we can  work together on. I must say, the ability to work with Senator Nelson  on this has been invaluable, to have two different Senators from two  different parties singing from the same song sheet about the priorities  that are critical to our State.   What is unique about this storm and disaster relief is, the impact  wasn't just on Florida, it was also the impact on Puerto Rico.   When the House passed its relief package at the end of December, it  had a lot of good things in it. The President came out with his  proposal, and it had some good things, but it needed work. The House  took it, and the House added a few things to it.   Over the last 2 months, we have had the ability to work in the  Senate, not in front of the cameras and not, obviously, through a  series of press conferences, but in the way legislation is put  together. The way we worked together and our offices worked together,  we were able to come out with a concise, unified position on the needs  of both Florida and Puerto Rico, working with the leadership of the  Democratic Party on his side and the Republican Party on ours.   I have to tell you, in a place where it is very hard to get 60  percent of what you want--and that is a win--when you start to go  through some of the items that are going to be in this relief package,  it would be hard to complain.   With perhaps a small exception here or there, virtually all of the  things that are critical for disaster relief for Florida--and to a  large extent as well for Puerto Rico--are going to be included. I  think, while a lot of us are very concerned about how long it took--we  should have done this 4 weeks ago or 3 weeks ago--there are other  reasons why it was held up. It wasn't disaster relief that was holding  it up, it was the other issues at play that were holding it up. In  fact, this was being held until the other things were agreed upon.   Now we are able to move forward. I have to state that while no one  wants to have a hurricane and no one wants to have a natural disaster,  this is a response we should be happy about. I think it is a testament  to the sorts of things we can achieve in the Senate when we can put  aside our differences on other issues and work together on this.   By the way, I want to state, because I don't want anyone to read into  what I said about big differences, that although we may vote  differently on a lot of issues, Senator Nelson and I have cooperated on  a host of things, from judges to anything that impacts Florida. I hope  we can get to doing that more as a Senate, not just for us in Florida.  Maybe Senator Nelson and I are just always in a good mood because it  doesn't snow in Florida, and it is warm when everybody else is cold,  but I think the people of Florida should be pleased with our ability to  work together.   Some highlights, and Senator Nelson touched on a lot of them. I will  start on the Puerto Rico part because it is the one we still see the  impact of on a regular basis.   Let me just, as an aside, say that Jenniffer Gonzalez, the Resident  Commissioner, who is basically the Member of Congress representing  Puerto Rico in the House, is an extraordinary advocate for Puerto  Rico--not a good one, not a great one, an extraordinary one. She is  tireless, nonstop. I am talking about Sunday evenings, Sunday nights,  early Monday morning, she is constantly working. She is an incredible  partner in this endeavor, and the things she has been able to achieve-- because even when we had agreement on many items in the Senate, we had  to go to Jenniffer for her help to make sure the leadership in the  House would be on board. The respect that House leadership has for her  was instrumental.   In the end, the way this is now lined up, no matter what we agreed to  here, if we send it over there, and they don't want it, we couldn't do  it. Her ability to get the House to go along with these changes is  invaluable, and I just need to say that publicly. So much of this is  due directly to her. She is the voice of  [[Page S687]]  Puerto Rico in Washington. To the extent these things are happening  above and beyond what would have already happened, it is, in large  respect, due to having her here. She is just phenomenal, and the  ability to work with her has made this possible.   Senator Nelson talked about the Medicaid cliff Puerto Rico faces.  Last year, we were able to fill that gap for 1 year. This measure does  it for 2 years, at 100 percent--called FMAP. Now, for the next 2 years,  Puerto Rico doesn't have to worry about that. They can focus on other  issues.   There is money in disaster relief to repair infrastructure and money  to repair hospitals and community health centers. There is $75 million  for displaced college students who had to leave their school in Puerto  Rico or in the Virgin Islands, for that matter. There is $11 billion  for CDBG-DR funds, which will go directly to Puerto Rico and the Virgin  Islands, including $2 billion for repairing the electrical grid. There  is $45 million to restore the Customs House in San Juan. There is money  for Job Corps centers to help retrain and get people going again, to  get employment functioning.   There is money for Coast Guard repairs. The U.S. border in the  Caribbean is Puerto Rico, so we have the Coast Guard there not only to  respond to disasters at sea but to be able to enforce law and prevent  drug smuggling. If someone smuggles drugs into Puerto Rico, you are in  the United States. There is no Customs from that point forward. It is  so critical.   There is also help to repair clinics that were serving women,  infants, and children; HHS funding; transportation funding,  particularly improvements to the FAA and the facilities at the airport  and the Federal highways. Everything that is important is in there.   There is more to do. Next week, we will have a new initiative--and I  am not prepared to discuss it yet--in addition, that is separate from  disaster relief, to help Puerto Rico not just to recover from the storm  but to set itself up for long-term success, and I look forward to  unveiling that next week.   For the time being, this is perhaps the first good news the people  from Puerto Rico have gotten from Washington since the storm hit, and I  just want to say it is due to the partnership of Senator Nelson and  myself but also frankly the extraordinary assistance of the leadership  of my party in the Senate, Senator McConnell, the Appropriations staff,  and Members on both sides of the aisle who have all, from the very  beginning, expressed a willingness to be helpful. We don't often come  to the floor to talk about the good news of our process, but we  couldn't be more pleased.   Senator Nelson talked about the impact on Florida. We will rapidly go  through some of those.   We have come to the floor multiple times to talk about the need to  help the Florida citrus industry, Florida's signature crop. This has  the money to do so. This will be an incredibly large effort for the  Secretary of Agriculture to administer this, but I know I speak for  Florida's growers when I say this is important work. Feeding our Nation  is important work, and I stand committed to working with the Secretary  and with our commissioner of agriculture, Adam Putnam, who is aware of  this and has been instrumental in putting together this package--really  important.   There is important funding for the Emergency Watershed Protection  Program, Emergency Conservation Program, rural development water and  wastewater grants, Emergency Food Assistance Program, funding to repair  the Agricultural Research Service facilities. There are four of these  damaged in Florida. Those are the facilities that are going to innovate  the cures we need to save Florida citrus in the long term.   There is money for education, particularly educational infrastructure  repairs to help displaced students and to hire new teachers. This is  especially important. We have now seen thousands of U.S. citizen  students who have come from Puerto Rico to Florida to get their  education. There is money to help higher education facilities, to  rebuild facilities that were damaged in the storm. There is money to  help displaced higher education students.   There is $35 million for Project SERV, which are education-related  expenses for local education agencies and higher education institutions  to help them recover from violent or traumatic events. There is $25  million to assist homeless students, and $650 million for Head Start. I  will note there are 45 damaged Head Start facilities in Florida.   There is relief for the community block grant funding to the tune of  $28 billion, of which $16 billion will be directed for unmet needs and  $12 billion for mitigation to prevent the loss of these facilities in  the future.   The list goes on. There is more. We will be putting out even more  details. The Army Corps has a lot of important projects in Florida, but  there is one in particular that if we go through it, there is over $600  million for repairs to the operations and maintenance funds, $810  million in flood control and coastal emergencies funding.   We had Everglades restoration projects going on in Florida that were  damaged by the storm, including these large retaining ponds which are  basically lakes--enormous bodies of water that are used to clean out  phosphates. Some were overrun and flood-damaged. This helps.   In addition, there is funding to expedite the completion of the  Herbert Hoover Dike, which is critically important to the people living  in the Glades communities just south of Lake Okeechobee. This expedites  that. This wasn't part of the budget in the beginning. This is a  project that has already been authorized, but the ability to move that  forward is critical because it will help free up funds and time for all  the other important projects in regard to restoring the Everglades and  preventing the overflow of Lake Okeechobee, which could kill people.   There is one project in particular, the ``South Atlantic Coastal  Study.'' It is a Federal project that looks at vulnerabilities of  coastal areas to sea level rise and things of that nature. That is  going to be a part of this because ongoing in the future we will  continue to see the threat posed by storm surge and the like, and there  is language in there modeled after a bill I filed that gives the  Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response direct hiring  authority to ensure that HHS has the necessary emergency medical  personnel to respond to another natural disaster because the hurricane  season is about 5 months away.   There is $60 million for community health center repairs. There are  about 28 in Florida and nearly 100 in Puerto Rico, and $50 million for  NIH for specific grants and infrastructure repairs. Within the topline  numbers for FEMA in this, there will be a total of $33 billion for  Stafford reimbursable costs, and we are involved in ongoing discussions  with the administration, which is responsible for directly coordinating  with the Governors in the States in regard to this, but this should be  more than enough to pay the unmet costs for hospital repairs, medical  services, et cetera.   A couple more points. We have a massive debris problem, particularly  in Monroe County. These canals in the Florida Keys have refrigerators,  lawn furniture, sunken boats, and this has money in there to help clean  that up. Local governments ran out of money, and they can't do it. This  repairs Coast Guard facilities that were damaged by the storms.   There are funds in the amount of $1.65 billion for Small Business  Administration loans. The National Park Service--I recently toured the  Everglades with Secretary Zinke--this has $207.6 million for  construction that will include repairs to the destroyed facilities of  the National Park Service. Funding under the Department of  Transportation will include $140 million for Florida. That includes $8  million for FAA facilities, $100 million just for Florida's Federal  Highway Administration, $27 million for Florida's Transit  Administration. Finally, under FEMA, the Disaster Relief Fund is fully  funded to meet the unmet needs. This money will ensure that FEMA has  the resources needed to assist disaster survivors as well as to repair  and restore damaged infrastructure in Florida and in Puerto Rico.   I hope we can get support for this. I saw the Senator from Texas here  a few moments ago. I imagine he may speak to this at some point. Texas  also suffered terribly. The Virgin Islands suffered. California had the  fires.  [[Page S688]]    I would state, it took longer than we wanted to, but I think the  people of Florida should be very pleased with the disaster relief  package the Senate is about to present and hopefully will pass and pass  in the House. This is good news. I was grateful to be a part of it.   I thank my staff. They worked incredibly hard to help advance this.  We have been waiting for this day. We are excited this day is finally  here. It makes our service here really meaningful when we can take our  actions and turn them into progress and results.   This is one of the reasons I ran for reelection, when at one point I  didn't think I would. It was to come back and make a difference. Today,  I know working with so many others, including Jenniffer Gonzalez in the  House and Senator Nelson and our leadership in the Senate, we are about  to make a real difference. It makes our time here rewarding. I am  excited to have been a part of it, and I am looking forward to doing  more.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
