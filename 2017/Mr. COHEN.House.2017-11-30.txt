 Mr. Speaker, Franklin Roosevelt was a great President of  the United States. He said once: ``The test of our progress is not  whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much, it is  whether we provide enough for those who have too little.'' That is  still true today for people who follow morality and Judeo-Christian  thought.   Yesterday in Missouri, the President said that the tax bill, which is  in the Senate now--and unfortunately passed this House--would not  benefit him at all. He said: Believe me, it won't benefit me.   You can't believe that. It benefits the billionaires, the  millionaires, and the wealthy, and that is what it is about. The  disparity in wealth in this country is growing and growing, and we  can't continue to have that. The middle class needs major tax relief,  and the wealthy don't. We could draw a bill to do that, and we could do  it together.   Our country is in danger. We need more help in the inner cities to  fight crime. We need help all over to fight against natural disasters.  People all over our country need help.   As Paul Simon said: A nation turns its lonely eyes to you. Jeff  Flake, Bob Corker, and John McCain, save America.                            ____________________
