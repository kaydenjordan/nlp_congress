 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 1381.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1381) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to take  actions necessary to ensure that certain individuals may update the  burn pit registry with a registered individual's cause of death, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1381         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Burn Pit Registry       Enhancement Act''.       SEC. 2. BURN PIT REGISTRY UPDATES.         (a) Individuals Eligible To Update.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall take actions necessary to ensure that the burn pit       registry may be updated with the cause of death of a deceased       registered individual by--        (A) an individual designated by such deceased registered       individual; or        (B) if no such individual is designated, an immediate       family member of such deceased registered individual.        (2) Designation.--The Secretary shall provide, with respect       to the burn pit registry, a process by which a registered       individual may make a designation for purposes of paragraph       (1)(A).        (b) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) The term ``burn pit registry'' means the registry       established under section 201 of the Dignified Burial and       Other Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2012 (Public Law       112-260; 38 U.S.C. 527 note).        (2) The term ``immediate family member'', with respect to a       deceased individual, means--        (A) the spouse, parent, brother, sister, or adult child of       the individual;        (B) an adult person to whom the individual stands in loco       parentis; or        (C) any other adult person--        (i) living in the household of the individual at the time       of the death of the individual; and        (ii) related to the individual by blood or marriage.        (3) The term ``registered individual'' means an individual       registered with the burn pit registry.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, in celebration of today say ``laissez les bons  temps rouler.''   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1381.   During Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom and in other  parts of the world where American servicemembers were deployed, the  Department of Defense exposed brave Americans to toxic fumes and  dangerous chemicals by burning waste in open-air burn pits. Some of the  waste burned in these open-air pits were human waste, Styrofoam,  lithium batteries, tires, medical waste, and other toxic substances.  Servicemembers had no way to avoid inhaling the smoke from these burn  pits that were located on their bases, sometimes right next to their  barracks.   When this committee held a hearing last year on burn pits, we heard  from Leroy Torres, the founder of Burn Pits 360, who breathed in burn  pit smoke while stationed in Balad Air Base in Iraq in 2007. When he  returned home in 2008, he needed immediate hospitalization for lung  disease.   Mr. Torres and other veterans suffering from medical conditions  believed to be caused by exposure to burn pits are still fighting to  receive healthcare and benefits because illnesses potentially caused by  burn pit exposure still aren't recognized by the VA.   Research to understand the harmful effects these toxic substances may  have had on military servicemembers is now underway. However, the  totality of harmful health effects this dangerous practice may have had  on servicemembers is yet to be fully known and understood, and it may  take years for clinicians and scientists to understand the health  effects or discover effective treatments for those who were exposed.   In an effort to better track the health effects these exposures had  on deployed troops, Congress required the VA to create the open burn  pit registry in 2012 to compile self-reported data on veterans who  believed they were exposed to open-air burn pits while serving in Iraq  and Afghanistan.   This registry allows VA to easily communicate with this population of  veterans, as well as track trends within the population that may  indicate a need for further research into certain health concerns.  However, the registry failed to provide, in it, the ability to report  cause of death for veterans who are registered and then subsequently  pass away.   Congressman Ruiz's bill, the Burn Pit Registry Enhancement Act, would  allow an individual designated by the veteran during the registry  process or an immediate family member to update the veteran's file on  the registry with a cause of death.   These additional data will allow researchers and the VA to identify  trends, similarities, and correlations in this population that will  better inform our research efforts on the impact these open-air burn  pits have on the servicemembers who served in combat zones.   With the addition of more data to the burn pits registry, we hope  this will help VA conduct groundbreaking research that will lead to  prevention and treatments for toxic exposures, including exposure to  toxic substances inescapably connected to military service.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments from my colleague,  the ranking member, about regular order. I can assure you we will  discuss this subject further, and I appreciate and take to heart his  comments.   At this time, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Ruiz), my good friend and the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Cunningham), my good friend and a member of the  House Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see that we have three  doctors who are either now or were associated with the Veterans'  Affairs Committee and that they have supported this legislation.   I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close, so I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I fully associate myself with the remarks of the  minority member of the committee. Again, I want to express my gratitude  to the professionally trained physicians who have weighed in on this  legislation and further commented about the importance of the  electronic health records and the important oversight that was begun in  the last Congress, which will continue in this Congress under my  leadership.   I agree it is really important that we get those records to work  properly and that the communication between the Department of Defense  and the VA is functional.   I also think it is very important to make sure that we get those  legacy records from the DOD wrapped into this whole package, because  the service history, where our military servicemembers have served and  what they  [[Page H2335]]  were exposed to, will provide a very important piece of information  that will help us understand how toxic exposures have affected our  veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 1381,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 1271.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1271) to establish in the Department of Veterans Affairs a  pilot program instituting a clinical observation program for pre-med  students preparing to attend medical school.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1271         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans-Specific Education       for Tomorrow's Health Professionals Act'' or the ``Vet HP       Act''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS                     AFFAIRS PILOT PROGRAM FOR CLINICAL OBSERVATION                     BY UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS.         It is the sense of Congress that the pilot program       described in section 3(a) should be designed to--        (1) increase the awareness, knowledge, and empathy of       future health professionals toward the health conditions       common to veterans;        (2) increase the diversity of the recruitment pool of       future physicians of the Department; and        (3) expand clinical observation opportunities for all       students by encouraging students of all backgrounds to       consider a career in the health professions.       SEC. 3. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS PILOT PROGRAM FOR                     CLINICAL OBSERVATION BY UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS.         (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall       carry out a pilot program for a one-year period, beginning       not later than August 15, 2021, to provide certain students       described in subsection (d) a clinical observation experience       at medical centers of the Department of Veterans Affairs.        (b) Medical Center Selection.--The Secretary shall carry       out the pilot program under this section at not fewer than       five medical centers of the Department. In selecting such       medical centers, the Secretary shall ensure regional       diversity among such selected medical centers.        (c) Clinical Observation Sessions.--        (1) Frequency and duration.--In carrying out the pilot       program, the Secretary shall--        (A) provide at least one and not more than three clinical       observation sessions at each medical center selected during       each calendar year;        (B) ensure that each clinical observation session--        (i) lasts between four and six months; and        (ii) to the extent practicable, begins and ends       concurrently with one or more academic terms of an       institution of higher education (as defined in section 101 of       the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001)); and        (C) ensure that the clinical observation sessions provided       at a medical center have minimal overlap.        (2) Sessions.--The Secretary shall ensure that the pilot       program consists of clinical observation sessions as follows:        (A) Each session shall allow for not fewer than five       students nor greater than 15 students to participate in the       session.        (B) Each session shall consist of not fewer than 20       observational hours nor greater than 40 observational hours.        (C) A majority of the observational hours shall be spent       observing a health professional. The other observational       hours shall be spent in a manner that ensures a robust, well       rounded experience that exposes the students to a variety of       aspects of medical care and health care administration.        (D) Each session shall provide a diverse clinical       observation experience.        (d) Students.--        (1) Selection.--The Secretary shall select to participate       in the pilot program under subsection (a) students who are--        (A) nationals of the United States;        (B) enrolled in an accredited program of study at an       institution of higher education; and        (C) referred by their institution of higher education       following an internal application process.        (2) Priority.--In making such selection, the Secretary       shall give priority to each of the following five categories       of students:        (A) Students who, at the time of the completion of their       secondary education, resided in a health professional       shortage area (as defined in section 332 of the Public Health       Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254e)).        (B) First generation college students (as defined in       section 402A(h)(3) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20       U.S.C. 1067q(a))).        (C) Students who have been referred by minority-serving       institutions (as defined in section 371(a) of the Higher       Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1067q(a))).        (D) Veterans (as defined in section 101 of title 38, United       States Code).        (E) Students who indicate an intention to specialize in a       health professional occupation identified by the Inspector       General of the Department under section 7412 of title 38,       United States Code, as having a staffing shortage.        (3) Assignment to medical centers.--The Secretary shall       assign students selected under paragraph (1) to medical       centers selected under subsection (b) without regard for       whether such medical centers have staffing shortages in any       health professional occupation pursuant to section 7412 of       title 38, United States Code.        (e) Other Matters.--In carrying out the pilot program under       this section, the Secretary shall--        (1) establish a formal status to facilitate the access to       medical centers of the Department by student observers       participating in the pilot program;        (2) establish standardized legal, privacy, and ethical       requirements for the student observers, including with       respect to--        (A) ensuring that no student observer provides any care to       patients while participating as an observer; and        (B) ensuring the suitability of a student to participate in       the pilot program to ensure that the student poses no risk to       patients;        (3) develop and implement a partnership strategy with       minority-serving institutions to encourage referrals;        (4) create standardized procedures for student observers;        (5) create an online information page about the pilot       program on the internet website of the Department;        (6) publish on the online information page created under       paragraph (5) the locations of such centers, and other       information on the pilot program, not later than 180 days       before the date on which applications are required to be       submitted by potential student observers;        (7) identify medical centers and specific health       professionals participating in the pilot program; and        (8) notify the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House       of Representatives and the Senate of the medical centers       selected under subsection (c) within 30 days of selection, to       facilitate program awareness.        (f) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the completion       of the pilot program under subsection (a), the Secretary       shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the       House of Representatives and the Senate a report on the       results of the pilot program, including--        (1) the number and demographics of all applicants, those       accepted to participate in the pilot program, and those who       completed the pilot program; and        (2) if participating institutions of higher education       choose to administer satisfaction surveys that assess the       experience of those who completed the pilot program, the       results of any such satisfaction surveys, provided at the       discretion of the institution of higher education.       SEC. 4. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out the requirements of this Act. Such requirements       shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized to be       appropriated.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1271, the Vet HP Act.  The Department of Veterans Affairs reported last month that it has  48,985 vacancies. That means about 10 percent of the positions at VA  are unfilled.   Sadly, a majority of these vacancies are Veterans Health  Administration vacancies. VA does not have enough doctors, nurses,  nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and other medical  [[Page H2336]]  providers and support staff to make sure veterans have timely access to  the high quality healthcare delivered by VA. With shortages in areas  like mental health and primary care, it can become increasingly  difficult to maintain a facility's efficiency and quality. That is why  it is so important that VA does everything it can to fill every last  vacancy.   The committee is not blind to the challenge of meeting this laudable  goal. Hospital systems throughout the country also face health provider  shortages. Rural areas and some urban areas are often the most in need  of providers. However, that should not be an excuse for inaction, and  relying solely on community providers who also face shortages and lack  the expertise and cultural competency to provide for veterans' specific  healthcare needs is an incomplete, problematic, and high-cost solution.   The VA must work to recruit and retain talented and mission-driven  clinicians and employees who are guided by one goal: to provide the  best possible care to veterans when they need it.   The bill offered by Congresswoman Kaptur from Ohio is a creative and  necessary step towards ensuring VA is able to fill each vacant  position. The Vet HP Act seeks to expose undergraduate students  considering careers in medicine to experience the VA healthcare  environment directly. By allowing undergraduates to observe the work of  staff at VA medical centers firsthand, the department can begin  recruiting early--by sowing interest in students about the VA's mission  and the healthcare, research, academic, and professional opportunities  available to clinicians at VA medical centers. As an educator of 70  percent of the Nation's healthcare providers, VA can create an early  familiarity with VA among students thinking about or preparing for  careers in medicine.   Our Nation's future healthcare providers may be more likely to choose  residencies at academic affiliates of VA medical centers and careers at  VA if they are more familiar with VA's mission and are able to observe  the improvements VA clinicians are able to make in the lives of those  who have served our Nation.   Moreover, as the veteran population becomes increasingly more  diverse, VA should strive to recruit students from backgrounds as  diverse as the military and veteran population so that VA staff and  clinicians reflect that growing diversity and are better equipped and  able to understand the needs of the veterans they serve.   In an effort to create a pipeline of diverse, mission-focused  students, this bill focuses specifically on students who graduated from  high schools in health professional shortage areas, students who attend  Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other institutions of  higher education that serve minorities, and first-generation college  students.   Giving students this exposure to VA's mission will help address the  VA's 48,985 vacancies so that it can continue to provide the healthcare  veterans need.   I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), who is my good friend and the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my colleague, the ranking  member, about our effort to insert 1,500 medical residencies into the  Choice bill. That was one of the great accomplishments of that  particular Congress.   I would point out that we still face shortages nationally of  physicians and specialists, and we face a great challenge with our  medical workforce and our healthcare workforce, and that impacts the  VA's ability to fill these positions.   I particularly want to highlight the gentlewoman from Ohio's comments  about young people who do not have the connections to medical  professionals, or they are not necessarily connected to the  professional segments of our society where they might be exposed to  what it means to be a medical professional and what it means to serve  the VA's mission. I think that her insights and her experience and what  she brings to this bill is a tremendous understanding of the need for  those of our young people who come from lower incomes or who come from  segments of society that could be left behind. We have Americans of  great ability whom we need to recruit and expose to the opportunities  that await them in organizations like the VA.   Let me just say that filling these vacancies is going to be a high  priority of the committee and to poke, prod, cajole, and urge the VA to  do what it needs to do to reform itself in order to make sure that  these positions are filled. Let me emphasize that these positions are  funded, that these are funded positions. They are empty, and that, to  me, also indicates that we have a workforce training challenge before  us.                                time  1715    H.R. 1271, offered by my colleague, Ms. Kaptur, is one of the  necessary steps that we need to take in order to fill those vacancies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 1271,  the Vet HP Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on S. 49.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 49) to designate the outstation of the Department of Veterans  Affairs in North Ogden, Utah, as the Major Brent Taylor Vet Center  Outstation.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 49         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Major Brent Taylor began his military service following       the attacks of September 11, 2001. He joined the Army       National Guard in 2003, three days after his engagement to       his wife, Jennie. Five of his brothers would eventually serve       in the Armed Forces following the deadly attacks.        (2) During his time in the Army National Guard, Major       Taylor distinguished himself in service to the United States       and the State of Utah. He received a commission as a second       lieutenant from the Brigham Young University Reserve Officer       Training Corps in 2006, while graduating as a member of the       National Society of Collegiate Scholars.        (3) During his impressive career with the Utah National       Guard, Major Taylor distinguished himself in multiple       specialties, including Intelligence and Military Police. One       of his earliest assignments included analyzing foreign       language documents in support of the Defense Intelligence       Agency. He also led document exploitation efforts in multiple       European and South American languages for a variety of       intelligence community customers. Major Taylor also managed a       team that assessed security vulnerabilities at high-profile       facilities across the United States, all while maintaining a       successful private sector career in Utah.        (4) Major Taylor was continuously ready to take up a call       to arms from the United States and deployed four times in       support of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. His deployed       duties varied from Platoon Leader and Combat Advisor to Chief       of Staff to the Special Operations Advisory Group,       responsible for leading a joint task force advising and       assisting an elite Afghan special operations unit.        (5) Throughout his deployments, Major Taylor distinguished       himself on several occasions, earning a multitude of awards       including the Bronze Star. The citation credits the ability       of Major Taylor to think calmly and decisively to keep his       subordinates safe while traversing 600,000 miles of roads in       Iraq, laden with improvised explosive devices (commonly       referred to as ``IED'') and ripe for ambush.        (6) During one particularly harrowing mission, Major       Taylor's vehicle was struck by an IED. Although he survived       the attack, the wounds he received earned him the Purple       Heart.        (7) Major Taylor's amazing record of service was not       limited to the battlefield. In 2010, he served as a member of       the North Ogden City Council and, in 2013, Major Taylor was       elected mayor. His steadfast leadership led to the city being       recognized as ``Business Friendly'' by the Governor of Utah,       and as one of the safest, freest cities in the United States       by several organizations. His initiatives included       improvements to public works and infrastructure, attracting       businesses to the area, developing a local community center,       and increasing transparency. His action led his constituents       to reelect Major Taylor in 2017.        (8) In 2018, Major Taylor placed himself on a leave of       absence from his mayoral duties in order to deploy to       Afghanistan, explaining to his constituents, ``Service is       what leadership is all about.''.        (9) While serving in Afghanistan, a dear colleague, Afghani       Lieutenant Kefayatullah, was killed shortly before the Afghan       elections. Major Taylor wrote, ``The strong turnout at that       election, despite the attacks and challenges, was a success       for the long-suffering people of Afghanistan, and for the       cause of human freedom. I am proud of the brave Afghan and       U.S. soldiers I serve with. Many American, NATO and Afghan       troops have died to make moments like this election       possible.''. He also extolled the American public to embrace       its civic duty, stating, ``I hope everyone back home       exercises their precious right to vote. And that whether the       Republicans or Democrats win, that we all remember that we       have far more as Americans that unites us than divides us.''.        (10) Tragically, on Saturday, November 3, 2018, Major       Taylor was killed in an attack in Afghanistan. He was       survived by his wife,  [[Page H2338]]       Jennie, and his seven children, Megan, Lincoln, Alex, Jacob,       Ellie, Jonathan, and Caroline.        (11) The impression that Major Taylor left was indelible.       An Afghan officer who had served with Major Taylor penned a       letter to his wife, stating, ``Your husband taught me to love       my wife Hamida as an equal and treat my children as treasured       gifts, to be a better father, to be a better husband, and to       be a better man.''. That officer further commented that, ``He       died on our soil but he died for the success of freedom and       democracy in both of our countries.''.        (12) It is only well and fitting that, as a tribute to the       amazing life of Major Taylor, Congress name a facility in       honor of Major Taylor's shining example of service and       sacrifice.       SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF MAJOR BRENT TAYLOR VET CENTER                     OUTSTATION IN NORTH OGDEN, UTAH.         (a) Designation.--The outstation of the Department of       Veterans Affairs located at 2357 North 400 East Washington       Boulevard, North Ogden, Utah, shall after the date of the       enactment of this Act be known and designated as the ``Major       Brent Taylor Vet Center Outstation''.        (b) Reference.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be considered to       be a reference to the Major Brent Taylor Vet Center       Outstation.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember the life of Major Brent Russell  Taylor, who was killed in Afghanistan on November 3, 2018.   I thank my colleague, Mr. Bishop of Utah, for bringing this bill  before us so that we all may be able to pay tribute to a selfless  public servant.   Brent was born on July 6, 1979, in Ogden, Utah, the second of eight  children of Stephen and Tamara Jones Taylor. Five of his brothers  joined him in his military service in the Army National Guard.   At an early age, Brent showed his passion for business and politics.  During his senior year at Chandler High School, he earned his Eagle  Scout award and was elected student body president. He graduated in  1997.   Brent was a man of faith. He was a lifelong member of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and he spent 2 years serving as a  missionary for the church in the Brazil Maceio Mission from 1998 to the  year 2000. This time of full-time service largely impacted the course  of the rest of his life.   After his mission, Brent attended Brigham Young University, where he  met Jennie Kristin Ashworth on a blind date less than a month after she  returned from her own full-time service as a church missionary in the  Chile Santiago North Mission.   They enjoyed a sweet courtship and were engaged on a Saturday in June  of 2003. Brent enlisted as a soldier in the Utah National Guard the  following Tuesday, with Jennie proudly by his side. They married on  September 18, 2003.   In 2006, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant from Brigham  Young University. He went on to work for the Defense Intelligence  Agency, the National Ground Intelligence Center, and the Department of  Homeland Security. Over the course of 15 years, he served in the Utah  Army National Guard, deploying four times in support of operations in  Iraq and Afghanistan.   In 2009, he was elected to further serve his community by sitting on  the North Ogden City Council, and in 2013, he was elected mayor of  North Ogden, Utah.   In 2018, Major Taylor, a Purple Heart recipient, left on his fourth  deployment, acting as an adviser to the Afghan Border Police. He was  the first known sitting mayor in Utah history to deploy for wartime  service.   Tragically, on November 3, 39-year-old Major Taylor was killed in an  insider attack by an Afghan trainee he was trying to help.   In addition to his wife, Jennie, Major Taylor is survived by seven  children: Megan, Lincoln, Alex, Jacob, Ellie, Jonathan, and Caroline.  He is also survived by his parents and several siblings.   In letters to his wife, Jennie, and his children, his comrade, Afghan  Air Force Major Abdul Rahman, said of Major Taylor: ``He died on our  soil, but he died for the success of freedom and democracy in both of  our countries.   ``Your father was a loving, caring, and compassionate man whose life  just wasn't meaningful; it was inspirational.''   In his last message to his community on October 28, 2018, Major  Taylor wrote: ``It was beautiful to see over 4 million Afghan men and  women brave threats and deadly attacks to vote in Afghanistan's first  parliamentary elections in 8 years. . . . Many American, NATO allies,  and Afghan troops have died to make moments like this possible.   ``As the USA gets ready to vote in our own election next week, I hope  everyone back home exercises their precious right to vote,'' he wrote,  ``and that whether the Republicans or the Democrats win, that we all  remember that we have far more as Americans that unites us than divides  us.''   As lawmakers, the least we can do to honor Major Taylor is to come  together to pass S. 49 into law. His legacy of fighting to protect  democracy and freedom and working to unite his community and all  Americans must never be forgotten.   We can all learn from Major Taylor's example to serve, as he would  say, ``whenever and however I can.''   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I owe a debt of gratitude to Major  Brent Russell Taylor and the entire Taylor family for their service and  sacrifice to our Nation.   I fully support this bill naming the Department of Veterans Affairs  Vet Center in North Ogden, Utah, as the Major Brent Taylor Vet Center  Outstation and urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say to my friend and colleague, the  gentleman from Utah, that our hearts go out to the families.   When I read the names of the seven children, it was a very difficult  moment for me, and we certainly are paying tribute today to his family,  his children, and his community of North Ogden, where he served as  mayor. It is our tribute to him.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record three letters--a letter from  Frank Maughan, Commander of the Disabled American Veterans, Department  of Utah; a letter from G. Hayes Stromness, Commander of the American  Legion, Department of Utah; and a letter from Nick Flake, Commander of  the VFW, Department of Utah--all in support of S. 49.                                                  November 9, 2018.      Chairman Phil Roe, M.D.,      House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Tim Walz,      House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz: Please accept       this letter as demonstrating the total support of the Utah       Department of the Disabled American Veterans, in recognition       of the ongoing initiative to change the name of the Veterans'       Center in Ogden, Utah to the Major Brent Taylor Veterans'       Center, in memory of Army National Guard major and North       Ogden mayor, Brent Taylor.        Major Taylor's model of selflessness in the areas of       military service and civic responsibility should be a shining       example for all Americans to follow.        Major Taylor began his military service in 2003, and later       received a commission as a second lieutenant from Brigham       Young University in 2006. He served in the Utah Army National       Guard for 15 years, during which he deployed four times in       support of US operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. His life of       service, however, was not limited to the armed forces, and in       2013 he was elected mayor of North Ogden, Utah. His devotion       to duty as a citizen soldier, in the tradition of George       Washington, Ulysses Grant and Dwight Eisenhower. In 2018,       Major Taylor left on his fourth deployment, acting as an       advisor to the Afghan Border Police. Tragically, on Saturday,       November 3rd, Major Taylor was killed in an apparent insider       attack. He leaves behind his wife and seven children.        Today, the state of Utah, and the nation, grieve for Major       Taylor. We would like to honor his amazing legacy. To that       end we offer our full support, and encourage the committee to       support legislation renaming the Ogden facility as the Major       Brent Taylor Veterans' Center.            Sincerely,                                                  Frank Maughan,                              Commander, Disabled American Veterans,      Department of Utah.                                   ____                                                   November 9, 2018.
