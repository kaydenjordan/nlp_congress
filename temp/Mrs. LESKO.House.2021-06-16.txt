 Mr. Speaker, there is growing evidence that COVID-19  originated in a lab in Wuhan, China, which the liberal media and Big  Tech dismissed as a conspiracy theory.   Time and time again, the Chinese Communist Party has lied and covered  up the origins of COVID-19. Republicans have repeatedly called for a  full, thorough investigation into this virus, but these calls have  fallen on deaf ears.   It is unclear why my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have  refused to hold Communist China accountable. They refuse to allocate  any resources to support a full investigation or even hold a hearing.  They are allowing China to get away with its deadly lies.   Over 600,000 Americans have died from COVID-19. It is time to stop  pushing the America last agenda that prioritizes the Chinese Communist  Party over giving the American people the answers they deserve.
