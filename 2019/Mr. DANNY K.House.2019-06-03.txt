 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2940) to extend the program of block  grants to States for temporary assistance for needy families and  related programs through September 30, 2019.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2940         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF THE TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY                     FAMILIES PROGRAM AND RELATED PROGRAMS THROUGH                     SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.         Activities authorized by part A of title IV and section       1108(b) of the Social Security Act shall continue through       September 30, 2019, in the manner authorized for fiscal year       2018, and out of any money in the Treasury of the United       States not otherwise appropriated, there are hereby       appropriated such sums as may be necessary for such purpose.     DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2940 is bipartisan legislation that extends the  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, TANF, and the Child  Care Entitlement to States, CCES, through September 30, 2019. This  legislation will allow the Department of Health and Human Services to  make on-time payments to States, Tribes, and territories for the fourth  quarter of the fiscal year.   I thank my friend and ranking member, Mrs. Walorski, for her support  of parents and grandparents and for partnering with me to ensure that  there is no disruption in help for families or promised funding to  States.   States depend on Federal TANF and childcare funding to help  struggling parents and grandparents work and to provide basic  necessities for children. Without the funding we are extending today,  States would likely reduce access to childcare assistance,  transportation, and job training, and delay or reduce assistance  families use to buy basics like food, housing, and diapers.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this letter from the bipartisan  leadership of the National Governors Association urging Congress to  quickly enact H.R. 2940.                                  National Governors Association,                                       Washington, DC, May 30, 2019.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Schumer,       Speaker Pelosi, and Minority Leader McCarthy:        We write to urge you to support and pass H.R. 2940,       introduced by Chairman Davis and Ranking Member Walorski of       the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Worker and Family       Support, which would extend the Temporary Assistance for       Needy Families (TANF) program through September 30, 2019. As       you know, the program funding is currently slated to expire       on June 30, 2019.        TANF is a critical program for states and served 3.1       million recipients, including 1.2 million families in 2018.       TANF provides vital cash assistance, job training, child       care, and other critical services for families and children.       The program provided a total of $16.5 billion in 2018 in       federal dollars for these services for the 50 states, the       District of Columbia, the territories, and American Indian       tribes. States also are required to contribute at least $10.3       billion in state funds per year under the maintenance-of-      effort requirement.        We ask that Congress act quickly and pass H.R. 2940, a       clean TANF extension, and send it to the President for       signature in order to avoid any lapse in funding for states       and to mitigate any adverse impacts to American families.       While continued short-term extensions make it challenging for       states to allocate resources strategically, we look forward       to working with you on a long-term reauthorization bill in       the near future.            Sincerely,      Governor Kate Brown,        Chair, National Governors Association, Health and Human       Services Committee.      Governor Charlie Baker,        Vice Chair, National Governors Association, Health and       Human Services Committee.     DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, in my home State of  Illinois, we use more than half of TANF dollars to provide childcare to  working parents and grandparents, and almost a fourth of it is for  child welfare services to reduce child abuse and neglect. If the  Federal Government fails to make TANF and CCES payments on time, it  will affect our State budget, but it will also harm the most vulnerable  families.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu).    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell).    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member, Representative  Walorski from Indiana, and all of my colleagues who have supported and  who cosponsor and support this legislation. Congress can and should do  far more to reduce child poverty and help hardworking families to make  ends meet.   For example, a recent study by the National Academy of Sciences found  multiple paths to reducing child poverty by 50 percent in just 10 years  using well-known evidence-based tools like the earned income tax  credit, the child independent care tax credit, and the Child Care and  Development Fund.   Mr. Speaker, I hope to work with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to find new ways to support the parents and grandparents who are  working so hard. But while we are looking for ways to make sure that  States and the Federal Government do more, we should certainly not  allow a funding lapse that would result in States having to do less.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this simple,  bipartisan legislation to allow us to meet our commitments to State  governments and to families in need across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge full support, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
