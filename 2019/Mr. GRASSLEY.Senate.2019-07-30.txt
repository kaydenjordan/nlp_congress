 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 1 minute in morning business.    Madam President, I want to take our Nation and my  colleagues back to the Revolutionary War.   More than 240 years ago, sailors aboard the warship Warren disclosed  significant misconduct by the commander of the Continental Navy. The  Congress then recognized these brave whistleblowers' valuable  contribution to our brandnew Republic because, on this day--today--in  1778, Congress passed this resolution, saying: ``It is the duty of all  persons in the service of the United States . . . to give the earliest  information to Congress or other proper authority of any misconduct,  frauds, or misdemeanors committed by any offices or persons in the  service of these states.''   That is the beginning of the government recognizing whistleblowers as  valuable patriots.   Following in their footsteps, this Senate has also unanimously agreed  to designate today as National Whistleblower Appreciation Day.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for 15 minutes.    Madam President, I want to inform my colleagues and the  American people about some progress that has been made on a very  important bipartisan piece of legislation, plus what a couple other  committees are doing along the same line of keeping healthcare costs  down--that we are making progress to reduce the price of prescription  medicine for the American people.   I have been tilling the fields of legislative policy long enough to  know that we have our work cut out for us. The ranking member and I of  the Finance Committee started out 6 months ago to cultivate a  bipartisan consensus for much needed reforms. We knew that we had a  long row ahead. Our efforts to reduce drug prices face big-time  opposition from Big Pharma.   As we worked side by side in a Republican and Democratic way, we  planted the seeds to grow a strong bipartisan coalition--one strong  enough, I believe, to withstand the influence of moneyed special  interests.   Now, it should be no surprise to anybody that Big Pharma and other  stakeholders in the drug supply chain are working six ways from Sunday  to throw sand in our gears. We know they will continue to fight us  during the August work period.   As a lifelong farmer from Iowa, I learned a long time ago that the  fruits of one's labor will not be worth a hill of beans without proper  groundwork. For months, we have been tilling the soil and fertilizing  the legislative fields to bear fruit at harvest time. We have teamed up  with leadership of other key committees of jurisdiction.   Together with the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Health  Committee, Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray, and the chairman  and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senators Lindsey  Graham and Dianne Feinstein, the Senate has a real opportunity this  Congress to deliver meaningful reforms that would yield real savings  for what Americans spend on healthcare.   Both the Health and the Judiciary Committees have advanced  legislative packages that help address drug prices, including bills I  have sponsored, such as the CREATES Act, the Stop STALLING Act, and the  Prescription Pricing for the People Act.   Since January, the Finance Committee, which I chair, and Senator  Wyden is the ranking member, has held a series of hearings to examine  the vulnerabilities in the drug supply chain that are ripe for abuse.  We don't have the answers to all the problems, but it is really crystal  clear that a strong dose of transparency is desperately needed to shed  light on a convoluted pricing system when dealing with prescription  drugs.   From the drug manufacturer to the patient's medicine cabinet, the  drug supply chain is shrouded in secrecy and is exceedingly complex.  This opaque pricing system has allowed exorbitant price hikes to climb  higher and higher and higher, with no end in sight.   Don't forget, the taxpayers of the United States foot the bill for  the lion's share of prescription drugs through Medicare and Medicaid.   The woolly drug supply chain allows taxpayers to be fleeced year  after year. We need to let the sunshine in to help root out their  abusive practices. Secrecy in the supply chain has grown into a noxious  weed, damaging our free market ecosystem.   Transparency is needed to help rein in unsustainable costs  threatening the fiscal viability of Medicaid and Medicare. Seniors,  individuals with disability, and low-income Americans depend on these  programs for lifesaving medicine and innovative cures.   Last week, the Senate Finance Committee approved the bipartisan  Prescription Drug Price Reduction Act. The carefully sown Grassley- Wyden bill limits seniors' out-of-pocket costs without limiting access  to lifesaving cures Americans expect. It injects reasonable incentives  in government prescription drug programs for drug manufacturers and  insurers to keep prices low. Pharmaceutical companies and insurers need  to have more skin in the game to keep prices down. It also fixes flawed  policies that distort free market principles to lower the lid on  spending.   We all know in the town meetings and other places we go that  Americans have spoken very loudly on this subject. They want high  prescription drug prices addressed. Furthermore, Americans want  Congress to act and to act now.   The Senate Finance, HELP, and Judiciary Committees have acted. Now it  is time to get the job done.   As my fellow lawmakers go home over the August recess, I encourage  each of you to share the good news with your constituents. Americans  are fed up with sticker shock at the pharmacy counter. We have the  opportunity to deliver a badly needed legislative remedy.   First, we have to drain the swampy special interests blocking the  path to victory. The moneyed players in the drug supply chain will use  the August recess to unleash a public relations blitz against our  bipartisan efforts. You can bet the farm that Big Pharma, hospitals,  and pharmacy benefit managers will whip themselves into a real frenzy  to kill these bipartisan reforms.   Let's remember why we started down this path in the first place. It  is simply democracy working, representative government working.   Americans are demanding relief at the prescription counter. We hear  it from our constituents in our town meetings, in our letters, in our  emails, and in the phone calls we get. Unchecked drug prices are  putting Medicare and Medicaid in financial peril. The payment structure  is unmoored from fiscal reality, and the American taxpayer is on the  hook. Congress has a real opportunity to do something about the  spiraling of drug prices.   For my colleagues who are on the fence about our bipartisan  proposal--and there is nothing wrong with being on the fence because  you have plenty of time to become acquainted with an issue you hear  from your constituents all the time and to become acquainted with our  solution--here are a series of questions I want you to ask yourself: Do  Americans want us to act to reduce runaway drug prices? Do Americans  want to keep access to breakthrough drug therapies and innovation? Do  older Americans want protection from coverage gaps and out-of-pocket  costs? Do people with disabilities and poor and elderly Americans who  depend on Medicaid deserve access to innovative cures and next- generation therapies?   The answer to all of these questions, I think, is a resounding yes.   Farmers are smart enough to make hay while the Sun shines. Let's  apply that time-tested farm lesson in the Congress. Don't bail out on  the opportunity to make a meaningful difference for the people whom we  are elected to serve. Too many Americans are rationing or skipping  doses because they can't afford their prescription medicines.   I will finish as I started out by saying, on behalf of Senator Wyden,  Senator Alexander, Senator Murray, Senator Graham, Senator Feinstein,  and others, I suggest to our colleagues that this is our Goldilocks  moment. Let's not let it be a gridlock moment. Our legislative reforms  are not too far right and not too far left. That is what makes our  bipartisan remedy to lower prescription drug prices just exactly right  for the American people.   I yield the floor.
