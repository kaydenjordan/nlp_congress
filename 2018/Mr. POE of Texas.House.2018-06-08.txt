 Mr. Speaker, for most students here in the United  States, recess is a time for recreation. For the pupils of Balkumari  Primary School in Kathmandu, Nepal, recess is the only opportunity for  them to get water.   For decades, the school relied on a tiny stream as its only source of  drinkable water, a 20-minute walk away. In 2013, however, the stream  dried up, leaving the school without access to drinkable water. So the  education stopped.   Mr. Speaker, the story has a happy ending because the Balkumari  Primary School received U.S. aid for water. Now with water access,  students scramble out of the schoolyard, learning and developing with  an education, as normal kids should.   This is why the Water for the World Act that Representative  Blumenauer and I authored is so important, which is now the law of the  land. The legislation requires a comprehensive plan for the United  States to aid other countries in securing clean water.   We have it within our power to help kids like the Balkumari Primary  School because, Mr. Speaker, water is life.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
