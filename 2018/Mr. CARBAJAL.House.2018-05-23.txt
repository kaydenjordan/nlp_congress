 Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Thornberry  and Ranking Member Smith for their bipartisan leadership, and the Armed  Services Committee and the Rules Committee for bringing my amendment to  the floor.   My amendment is simple. It not only urges the Department of Defense  to pursue more innovative measures to train servicemembers, but also to  train them in a more cost-effective manner.   This amendment urges DOD to transition training manuals, emergency  guidance, and other training publications to applications on mobile  telephones to enable interaction and improve and update the training  experience for servicemembers. It provides a cost-efficient mechanism  for less printing and less distribution costs while making the  materials more readily accessible.   The Air Force has already started utilizing such applications, and my  amendment would urge the Secretary to utilize such technology  throughout all the services.
