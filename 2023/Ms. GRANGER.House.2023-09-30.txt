Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5860, a  bill that keeps the government open until November 17.   While I would rather be here speaking on the floor about final  appropriations bills, I want Members to understand why passing a short- term funding bill today is so important.   First, I want to explain how we find ourselves in this situation.  Just 9 months ago, when Republicans took back the majority in the  House, our commitment was to regular order for appropriations, no more  omnibus measures released in the dead of night, no more Christmas Eve  votes on thousands of pages of text that Members of Congress had not  read.   Unfortunately, there were a few stumbling blocks as we sought to  change the process. For example, the administration's budget request  was more than a month late. It then took months for the President to  come to the table on the debt ceiling negotiations. Even before the  debt ceiling agreement spending framework was in place, the  Appropriations Committee got to work. In fact, this year, we held more  than 70 hearings, reviewed roughly 80,000 requests from Members,  listened, and then acted.   We began markups in May, 5 months ago, and then made adjustments to  reflect changes in the law that set spending caps for the year. The  appropriations bills moved through the subcommittees and then the  floor. Even though a few bills have more steps to take in the process,  I am proud of the work we have done.   As of today, we have sent four appropriations bills to the Senate,  totaling roughly 70 percent of funding needed for this year. The Senate  has not sent us any bills yet. The House has now laid down a marker on  what I believe are our highest priorities.   It should be crystal clear to the American people that House  Republicans support what is in our national security. Most importantly,  we are focused on our troops and our veterans as well as defending our  homeland and our interests abroad. At the same time, the bill we have  drafted demonstrates that we must stop government overreach and the  out-of-control spending of the last few years.   These are the most conservative appropriations bills in history, and  we simply need more time to get our important work done.   While a continuing resolution is not ideal, it prevents a harmful  government shutdown, gives us more time to pass the appropriations  bills on the floor of the House, and allows us to start negotiations on  final, full-year bills with the Senate.                                time  1130    Yesterday, I voted for a different version of a short-term funding  bill that included key border security measures. I strongly support  these efforts and will continue to fight for them as this process moves  along.   Today, the most important priority is keeping government open while  we work on full-year appropriations bills that reflect conservative  priorities.   Passing this bill is the best way for us to move the process forward.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Lawler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York, (Mr. Molinaro).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. D'Esposito).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquiare as to the time remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Nevada (Mr. Amodei).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.
