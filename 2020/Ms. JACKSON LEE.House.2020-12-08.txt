 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for his  leadership. I also thank my fellow Texan, Mac Thornberry, for his  service to the Nation as he continues his journey.   Let me say how important this legislation is as it relates to basic  pay, incentive pay, and hazard pay for our military families, many of  whom are in my congressional district; the work that has been done on  the maternity uniform pilot program; and also the work on reenforcing  NATO; the sexual assault prevention and response that is so important,  particularly in our community in Texas, for the horrible acts at Fort  Hood against Vanessa Guillen, causing her to lose her life along with  many others. This is a legislation that focuses on the personnel and  that focuses on the security of our Nation.   I am very grateful to Congressman Brown for his leadership on joining  with other Members to ensure with Chairman Smith that we remove these  Confederate names from the names of military bases that represent all  people. I am very grateful that my language indicates that profound,  dignified, qualified, and heroic African-American soldiers have the  right to have their names listed on these particular bases.   I ask America to send in the names of your relatives. Call my office.  Send it to the Armed Services Committee.  [[Page H6929]]  Let us have a base where soldiers go that reflects everyone. I am  thankful that my language was put in to name bases after African- American soldiers and other diverse persons.   Mr. Speaker, I ask support of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in strong support of all the Jackson Lee  Amendments made in order for consideration of the William M. (Mac)  Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.   I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Thornberry and their staffs  for working with me and my staff in consideration of several Jackson  Lee Amendments.   I am particularly thankful to Chairman Smith for taking up the  challenge of removing the stain of confederate traitors being honored  by the naming of bases and military installations in their name.   It has been too long that African Americans guarded their communities  from the hidden racism that existed under the guise of the confederate  flag and knowing through oral history the brutality of those who served  voluntarily in the confederate army and whose names were on bases and  military installations.   This bill is ushering in a new era where the names of confederates  who served voluntarily to take up arms against the United States will  have their names removed from places of honor such as military bases or  installations and these individuals be placed in historical context  where historians and scholars may study ad understand their place in  American history.   It is also time that African Americans and Native Americans be  recognized for their contributions in defense of our nation.   The history of African Americans and Native Americans serving in the  military date back to the colonial period of our nation to the present  day.   In every war waged from the Battle of Lexington to the Battle for  Fallujah, African Americans and Native Americans have honorably  answered the call to duty, and served with great valor and distinction  in America's armed forces.   At decisive moments in our nation's history, the United States  military and its citizens warriors, were there and made the difference:   The Revolutionary War (1776-1783),   The War of 1812 (1812-1814),   The Mexican-American War (1836),   The Civil War (1861-1865),   The Spanish-American War (1898),   World War I (1914-1918),   World War II (1941-1945),   The Korean War (1950-1953),   The Vietnam War (1965-1975),   The Gulf War (1991), and   The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as conflicts in other  theaters of war.   The military is there defending our nation when attacked by hostile  nations or adversaries.   But it is also there when needed to respond to attack from natural  elements like floods and Hurricanes like Hurricanes Irma, Harvey and  Katrina.   The military was there doing a job no other branch of our nation's  government could do--in the face of overwhelming calamity when the  lives of thousands of American citizens were on the line--they came.   Our thanks to the military for being always ready to answer the call  of duty--whether that call comes in the dead of night or the light of  day--we know that we can count on you.   The names and faces of millions of African Americans who have served  our nation in uniform may fade from memory, but this evening we have  the opportunity to remember and see them in the faces of the young  people who have answered the call to duty by becoming members of the  armed forces.   I offered several amendments to H.R. 6395 to improve the bill.   I thank my colleagues: Representatives Bennie Thompson, William Lacy  Clay, Gregory Meeks, A. Donald McEachin, Marc Veasey, Stanford Bishop,  Andre Carson, and Jahana Hayes for joining as cosponsors of this  Amendment.   The fact that military bases have been named after Confederate  military leaders or soldiers is hard to imagine given that they were  fighting to end the United States.   The Confederacy was not something that should be held up for honor by  the United States or our nation's military.   There is no shortage of honorable replacement candidates to receive  the honor of having a military base, installation or facility named in  their honor.                              United States Army    1. Gen. Roscoe Robinson Jr.   General Robinson was a 1951 graduate of West Point who attended the  service academy before the Army was desegregated. Robinson served in  Korea and Vietnam, with valor decorations in both conflicts, and as a  training officer as part of the U.S. military support mission in  Liberia. He went on to become the first black commander of the 82nd  Airborne Division, deputy chief of staff for operations in U.S. Army  Europe, commander of U.S. Forces Japan, the U.S. representative on the  NATO Military Committee, and the first black four-star general in the  Army.   2. William Harvey Carney   William Carney was the first African American recipient of the  Congressional Medal of Honor, which he received for his actions on July  18, 1863 at Fort Wagner, SC while a member of the 54th Massachusetts  Regiment in the Civil War--the state's first all-black regiment.   The 54th Massachusetts was the subject of the film, ``Glory,''  starring Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman.   3. Lieutenant Colonel Charity Edna Adams   Lieutenant Colonel Charity Edna Adams was appointed to lead the  African American Women's Army Corps unit designated as the 6888th  Central Postal Directory Battalion, which became known as the ``Six  Triple Eight.''   This unit was instrumental in establishing and maintaining morale  because it assured that mail from the battlefront and the home-front  flowed efficiently and timely.   4. Lt. Col. Margaret E. Bailey   In 1964, Margaret E. Bailey, Army Nurse Corps, was the first nurse to  be promoted to lieutenant colonel.                              United States Navy    5. Dorie Miller Messman First Class and Admiral Michelle Howard.   Dorie Miller, Messman First Class was serving in a noncombat role in  the Navy, Dorie Miller responded heroically when the battleship West  Virginia was attacked at Pearl Harbor. He was the first African  American to be awarded the Navy Cross, the third highest honor awarded  by the US Navy at the time.   6. Admiral Michelle Howard   Admiral Michelle Howard is a four-star Admiral and one of the  highest-ranking African American women ever to serve in any branch of  the military. Admiral Howard is also the first African American woman  to command a U.S. Navy ship, the USS Rushmore.   She is the Navy's second highest ranking officer and is currently  serving as the commander of U.S. Naval Forces Africa, commander of U.S.  Naval Forces Europe and commander of Allied Joint Force Command Naples.                                The Air Force    7. Lt. Col Shawna Rochelle-Kimbrell   In 2012, Lieutenant Colonel Kimbrell became the first female African  American fighter pilot in the Air Force history. Her flights in  Northern Watch marked her as the first female pilot to fly combat  missions for Misawa's 35th Fighter Wing, and the first African American  woman to employ ordinance in combat. She has more than 1,110 hours in  the F-16, including 176 hours of combat time.   8. Colonel Ruth A. Lucas   Colonel Lucas was the first African American woman in the Air Force  to be promoted to the rank of colonel. At the time of her retirement in  1970, she was the highest-ranking African American woman in the Air  Force.   9. Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Jr   In 1959 General Benjamin O. Davis became the first African American  Major General in the United States Air Force. In 1943, he organized and  commanded the 332nd Fighter Group known as the Tuskegee Airmen. General  Davis received many decorations during his career, including two  Distinguished Service Medals and a Silver Star. On December 9, 1998,  General Davis was awarded his fourth general's star by President Bill  Clinton.                               The Coast Guard    10. Alex Haley   Chief Petty Officer Haley is best known for writing letters for his  shipmates and his short stories and articles, which got him promoted to  Chief Journalist of the Coast Guard in 1959. Haley ultimately received  a number of military honors, including the American Defense Service  Medal, World War II Victory Medal and an honorary degree from the Coast  Guard Academy. And most of you know him also as the author of  ``Roots.''   11. Bobby C. Wilks   In 1957, Captain Bobby Wilks became the first African American Coast  Guard aviator. He later became the first African American to reach the  rank of Captain and the first to command a Coast Guard air station. He  accumulated over 6,000 flight hours in 18 different types of aircrafts.   Twenty-five percent of the today's military is comprised of persons  of color, of which 17.8% are African American.   In 2017, blacks made up 17% of the DOD active-duty military--somewhat  higher than their share of the U.S. population ages 18 to 44 (13%).  Blacks have consistently been represented in greater shares among  enlisted personnel (19% in 2015) than among the commissioned officers  (9%).                               Native Americans    The amendment I offered during House consideration of the NDAA was  expanded to include Native Americans.   It is without doubt that the military has a storied history of Native  American contributions to  [[Page H6930]]  the securing our nation since colonial times to the present.   One famous example of their contributions occurred during World War  II when the U.S. military developed a specific policy to recruit and  train Navajo speakers to become code talkers.   A code talker is the name given to 29 Navajo Natives who used their  tribal language to send secret communications on the battlefield.   The Marines formed the Navajo Code Talkers, who created a code based  on the complex, unwritten Navajo language.   The code primarily used word association by assigning a Navajo word  to key phrases and military tactics.   This system enabled the Code Talkers to translate three lines of  English in 20 seconds, not 30 minutes as was common with existing code- breaking machines.   The Code Talkers participated in every major Marine operation in the  Pacific theater, giving the Marines a critical advantage throughout the  war.   During the nearly month-long battle for Iwo Jima, for example, six  Navajo Code Talker Marines successfully transmitted more than 800  messages without error.   Marine leadership noted after the battle that the Code Talkers were  critical to the victory at Iwo Jima.   At the end of the war, the Navajo Code remained unbroken.   Our Native American brothers and sisters are more than worthy to be  so honored by having their names considered for military bases and  installations.                           Boogaloo and Proud Boys    A Jackson Lee Amendment included in the House version of the NDAA  directed the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress the extent, if  any, of the threat to national security posed by domestic terrorist  groups and organizations motivated by a belief system of white  supremacy, such as the Boogaloo and Proud Boys extremists is reflected  in the Conference bill.   The NDAA conference identified that the FBI is under statutory  obligation, established by Section 5602 of the NDAA FY 2020 (Public Law  116-92), to complete a report that would better characterize the  domestic terrorist threat by requiring the FBI and the Department of  Homeland Security in consultation with the National Counterterrorism  Center (NCTC), to produce a set of comprehensive reports over 5 years.   The report is to include: a strategic intelligence threat internal to  the United States; metrics on the number and type of incidents, coupled  with resulting investigations, arrests, prosecutions, and analytic  products, copies of the execution of domestic terrorism investigations;  detailed explanations of how the FBI, DHS and NCTC prioritize the  domestic terrorism threats and incident; and descriptions regarding the  type and regularity of training provided by the FBI, DHS, or NCTC to  other Federal, State, and local law enforcement.   The conferees note that the report has not been delivered to the  appropriate committees and they urge the FBI Director to deliver the  report without delay.   The Jackson Lee Amendment to the NDAA FY 2021 sought the same  information that is required under the NDAA FY 2020 because of the  threat posed by accelerationists and militia extremists who comprise a  range of violent anti-government actors, movements, and organizations,  some of which branch out of decades-old ideologies and others of which  are relatively new has led to violent engagement of law enforcement.   My concern is that in the aftermath of a historic national election,  the activity of violence influencers like Boogaloo Boys or Proud Boys  will increase and lead to attacks becoming more frequent.   In 2018, we saw too many instances of violent extremists searching  for opportunities to sow violence and disrupt democratic processes.   Boogaloo and Proud Boys are targeting constitutionally protected  activity for cooption or to provide cover for attacks.   Jackson Lee Amendment 179 implements a recommendation made by the  Cyberspace Solarium Commission to require the Secretary of Homeland  Security to develop a strategy to implement Domain-based Message  Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) standard across  U.S.-based email providers to increase the security of email.   I thank my colleagues Congressmen Langevin, Gallagher, Katko, and  Joyce for joining this bipartisan amendment to the FY 2021 NDAA.   The security of email has grown in importance as it has become in  many ways the primary way that businesses, consumers, government  communicate.   The Senate bill also addressed this important issue and the language  of the final Conference concurs.   I urge my colleagues to support the Conference for the NDAA FY 2021.    Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary,  Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8161, the ``One Stop Shop  Community Reentry Program Act of 2020,'' which creates a new grant  program that will provide money to States, Tribes, local governments,  and community-based non-profits to create one-stop reentry centers to  assist people who were recently released from jail or prison.   The bill would also create a grant program for a toll-free hotline  for returning individuals to access reentry services.   As one who has worked on community reentry and recidivism reduction  for most of tenure on this Committee, I am proud to join Crime  Subcommittee Chair Karen Bass (D-CA) as a cosponsor of this  legislation.   There are currently over 2.1 million people incarcerated in local,  state, and federal correctional facilities, a number that represents a  [[Page H7007]]  more than 500 percent increase in the incarcerated population over the  last 40 years.   Over 95 percent of people currently incarcerated will eventually be  released back to their communities.   In fact, approximately 600,000 people are released from custody every  year and at the end of 2016, an estimated 4.5 million adults were under  community supervision, which includes probation or parole.   Reentry services are essential for this population, to ensure that  these individuals transition smoothly out of jail and prison and to  keep recidivism to a minimum.   The recidivism rates for individuals leaving prisons remain high, and  a large number of those released from prison will ultimately find  themselves back in the criminal legal system.   A 2018 study found that 83 percent of people released from prisons in  2005 were arrested at least once during the nine years following their  release, and of those released from state prisons, 44 percent were  arrested at least once in the year immediately following their release.   Lack of access to resources upon release leads to a cycle of rearrest  and reincarceration that some scholars call the ``revolving door'' to  prison.   This cycle of recidivism has tremendous financial consequences--the  United States spends over $80 billion dollars a year on incarceration-- not to mention the human toll it takes on families and communities.   The cycle of release, rearrest, and reincarceration, also costs state  and local communities over $100 million in policing and judicial  administration costs.   While some returning individuals have a release plan, many people are  released from custody with only their personal property, little money,  and no place to go.   The result of not having a reentry plan can be ruinous.   In the last decade, policymakers have begun to measure the effects of  reentry on returning individuals, their families, and their  communities.   Studies show that most people enter the prison system with low levels  of education, limited work experience, substance abuse issues, and  mental health infirmities, and that these same issues are still present  when a person is released from prison.   Without appropriate reentry services to assist them, many returning  citizens find themselves back in the criminal justice system.   H.R. 8161 provides grants to community-based organizations for the  creation of one-stop reentry centers, which would combine the provision  of various reentry services in one location, thus making it easier for  returning citizens to access them.   The one-stop shop model that this legislation promotes would aim to  provide complete reentry services to address the critical elements of  the reentry process that promote long-term reentry success.   The one-stop centers would include support personnel, who themselves  are formerly incarcerated individuals, to provide direct support for  recently released individuals.   In addition, where reentry services may not logistically be able to  be placed in a single geographic location, this legislation authorizes  the Attorney General to fund States and local jurisdictions to  establish 24/7 reentry service assistance hotlines that direct recently  released individuals to appropriate reentry resources.   I urge all Members to join me in voting for H.R. 8161, the ``One Stop  Shop Community Reentry Program Act of 2020.''    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary,  Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 683, the ``Puerto Rico  Recovery Accuracy in Disclosures Act of 2019'' or ``PRRADA Act,'' which  conditions compensation of professional persons retained under the  congressionally passed ``Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and  Economic Stability Act'' (``PROMESA'') upon the applicant providing  certain disclosures similar to those required under Bankruptcy Code  section 327.   In response to dire fiscal issues facing Puerto Rico at the time,  Congress passed Pub. L. 114-187, the ``Puerto Rico Oversight,  Management, and Economic Stability Act'' or ``PROMESA'' in 2016,  legislation I strongly supported and cosponsored.   The Act established the Financial Oversight and Management Board  (Board), a fiscal control board comprised of seven members that would  have control over Puerto Rico's budget, laws, financial plans, and  regulations.   It empowered the board to propose a budget for Puerto Rico and  restructure its obligations owed to bondholders, estimated to be $6.5  billion, and other creditors.   Although largely patterned on chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code,  PROMESA did not incorporate all facets of chapter 11 and other relevant  provisions of the Code. For example, although the Board is authorized  to retain and compensate professional persons in connection with its  efforts to reorganize Puerto Rico, PROMESA does not include certain  restrictions that the Bankruptcy Code requires for such purposes.   For example, Section 327 of the Bankruptcy Code, unlike PROMESA,  authorizes professional persons, such as attorneys, financial advisors,  appraisers, and others, to be retained in connection with the  administration of a bankruptcy case provided they meet the following  conditions: first, such a person must not hold or represent an interest  adverse to the bankruptcy estate; and second, the professional must be  a ``disinterested person.''   As I indicated at the outset, H.R. 683, the ``Puerto Rico Recovery  Accuracy in Disclosures Act of 2019'' or ``PRRADA,'' conditions  compensation of professional persons retained under PROMESA upon the  applicant providing certain disclosures similar to those required under  Bankruptcy Code section 327.   In addition, it would require the United States Trustee to review  such I disclosures and submit comments in response to the court as well  as authorize the United States trustee to object to compensation  requested by professionals. Further, the measure would apply  retroactively to professionals who have previously been awarded  compensation.   Finally, H.R. 683 would authorize the court to deny allowance of  compensation for services and reimbursement of expenses accruing after  the bill's enactment date if the professional person did not comply  with the disclosure requirement, was not a disinterested person, or  represented or held an interest adverse to the bankruptcy estate.   I urge all Members to join me in voting for H.R. 683, the ``Puerto  Rico Recovery Accuracy in Disclosures Act of 2019.''    Mr. Speaker, I thank the manager of the bill for his  leadership continuously on issues of technology as well as his very  fine work on the issues of antitrust.   Mr. Speaker, let me thank the manager of this legislation. As well, I  thank the Senate and the Senate sponsor for some very important  legislation.   It is interesting that we would be able to bring this legislation up  in a time when our children, in particular, are wedded to virtual  technology or virtual learning all over America, leaving them  vulnerable in terms of what has the opportunity to become a predator.   So, I couldn't think of a more important moment to bring up S. 134,  the Combat Online Predators Act, making it very clear the lack of  tolerance for practices that would create harassment of children.   Clearly, now, with virtual learning being at the cornerstone of the  survival of education for our children with COVID-19 raging, it seems  an appropriate initiative.   The legislation calls for the Attorney General and the Department of  Justice to produce an evaluation of Federal, State, and local efforts  to enforce laws relating to stalking and to identify and describe  elements of these efforts that constitute best practices.   Our intent here is to save lives and, as well, to protect our  children, protect their minds, protect their thoughts, protect the  information that might draw them to leave home. We know that that  certainly has been a basis for many of our children running away,  because someone caught them on the internet.   At the same time, Mr. Speaker, I want to express my appreciation to  the United States Senate because this was a difficult amendment to be  able to craft and to understand, and that is that we recognize that  children can be children.   In essence, this legislation also has, for parents to understand, a  provision that if children are within a certain age and the stalker is  not much older than a child over 15 and under 17 and they engage in the  kind of play that teenagers might engage in--we call it Romeo and  Juliet--that those individuals would be exempt from the criminal  aspects of this legislation.   I think it is a very important exception inasmuch as we want parents  to be engaged as much as we can in teaching teenagers and young people  and overseeing their activity, making sure they don't do things that  would create a criminal liability or criminal acts.   So, I support this legislation because of its fairness; because of  the recognition by the Senate of the importance of that exemption; and,  most of all, to be able to make a national statement while we are in  the midst of COVID-19, and our children are facing virtually  everything, that we want to combat online predators.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this act, S. 134, to  protect our children.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary,  Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8354, the ``Servicemembers  and Veterans Initiative Act of 2020,'' which would permanently  establish the Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative (SVI) within the  Department of Justice's (DOJ) Civil Rights Division.   I thank my colleague from Texas, Congresswoman Escobar (TX-16), for  introducing this important legislation, which I am proud to be a  cosponsor.   The Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative Act details SVI's  responsibilities to promote the legal interests of servicemembers,  veterans, and their families within the Department of Justice.   Among the responsibilities of the SVI would be to make policy on  behalf of the Attorney General on legal issues that impact  servicemembers, veterans, and their families and appoint a liaison to  the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division to coordinate  Federal prosecutions involving cases of fraud against servicemembers.   SVI currently has no formal statutory authorization so assigning a  liaison in SVI to coordinate criminal fraud prosecutions is critical to  protecting servicemembers.   Civil actions initiated by DOJ have not, thus far, stemmed the rising  number of fraud schemes, in housing in particular, that target  servicemembers.   Criminal prosecutions, available under the current fraud statutes,  would provide a strong deterrent to widespread efforts to defraud  servicemembers.   By giving SVI a permanent home in DOJ's Civil Rights Division, this  bill would ensure that DOJ will continue to provide outreach to  servicemembers, will provide the Attorney General with policy  recommendations on servicemember-related matters, and will enforce the  Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, the  Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986, and the  Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, among other laws.   Mr. Speaker, fraud schemes that target servicemembers and their  families are especially pernicious.   Within just the preceding five years, the FTC received over 163,000  reports of fraud targeting military retirees and veterans, and nearly  13,000 fraud reports from active duty service members.   More shamefully, the FTC ascertained that the median loss in these  cases was significantly higher for servicemembers and veterans than for  their civilian counterparts.   Establishing this direct link to the Criminal Division will enable  the Justice Department to be more effective in addressing civil and  criminal frauds against servicemembers and their families.   A significant number of military veterans live in Houston, Texas.   They are business owners, laborers and community servants who  continue to contribute to the local economy.   It is estimated that 18.5 million veterans live in the United States,  of which 282,511 call Houston home.   In fact, the Houston metropolitan area is home to nearly one-fifth of  Texas' veterans.   Houston-area servicemen and women have served in the Gulf wars, the  Korean War and World War II.   But the largest percentage of the Houston veteran population served  in the Vietnam War. Most of them are between 35 and 54 years old.   I call on my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of H.R. 8354 to  provide much needed support for our nation's veterans.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary,  Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8235, the ``Open Courts Act  of 2020,'' which would centralize and modernize the federal judiciary's  court records systems (called CM/ECF) and would eliminate the paywall  (called PACER) that currently forces the public to pay to access these  records.   The new system will provide a centralized, easily searchable site to  file and read court records and monitor docket activity, and equally  important, make all public court records on the site available free of  charge.   Every year, the public pays the federal judiciary more than $100  million in fees so they can read the motions, briefs, orders, exhibits,  calendar entries, and other court filings that make up the overwhelming  majority of federal litigation and bankruptcy practice.   These fees are used to maintain and operate the judiciary's  electronic court records systems (called ``case management and  electronic court filing systems'' or ``CM/ECF'') that judges, court  employees, and the parties before the court use to file documents,  issue decisions, and generally manage proceedings.   Although many parties before the court pay a fee to initiate a  proceeding or otherwise file a document (generally called ``filing  fees''), these fees do not support the electronic courts records  systems they rely on.   Instead, those systems are subsidized by the public.   The fees the public pays to view federal court records are officially  called ``electronic public access'' or ``EPA'' fees.   More commonly, they are called ``PACER'' fees, after the paywall  system the public must use to pay for and access those records.   The Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system charges  users 10 cents per page to view, download, or search for public court  records.   The per-document fee is capped at $3.00; audio files of court  hearings, if they exist, cost $2,40.   Judicial opinions are free, as are the first $30 of charges per  quarter.   As several retired judges have argued, ``openness serves a structural  role in our republican system of self-government'' and that ``opening  up judicial records by removing the PACER paywall would be consistent  with the best traditions of judicial transparency.''   PACER functions as a paywall that the public must pass through to  access the judiciary's electronic court records systems.   These systems are highly decentralized--every one of the 94 district  courts, 13 courts of appeals, and 90 bankruptcy courts have their own  CM/ECF system.   Until recently, for example, a user was required to have a separate  username and password for every CM/ECF system--today, some, but not  all, courts allow a user to have the same password and username.   Seamus Hughes, the Deputy Director of George Washington University's  Program on Extremism, has spent years researching terrorism cases in  the United States, Europe, and in the Middle East. As he researches  individuals and entities charged with providing material support to  foreign and domestic terrorist organizations.   As part of those investigations, he developed expertise in searching  the federal court records system and in testimony last year, described  the consequences of this set up:   Quite simply, it is not easy to access public court records on PACER.  PACER provides access to federal criminal records and is organized by  federal districts in each state . . . To use the system you need to  apply for a PACER account, get a password, and know what district in  each state you want to search. Each search requires the user to know  what they are looking for and where. Even then the cost is not always  tied to a result.   For example, if you are a terrorism researcher and want to review  every case that charges material support to a terrorist organization,  you would have to go to 94 different individual court websites and  conduct a new and separate search on each website.   Mr. Speaker, in addition, some public court records, including trial  exhibits and unsealed documents, are routinely unavailable because they  are not posted on a court's CM/ECF system, and documents are difficult  to find because there are no uniform tags or naming conventions.   Mr. Speaker, the Open Courts Act of 2020 addresses these problems and  helps ensure that the public and free access to the American judicial  system remains available.   Section 2(a) of the bill requires the Director of the Administrative  Office of the United States Courts to, in coordination with the  Administrator of General Services, consolidate all federal court  records into one system within 2-3 years.   Section 3(a) requires the Director of the Administrative Office of  the United States Courts to, in coordination with the Administrator of  General Services, make all court records on the system established by  section 2 freely available to the public.   Section 3(b) grants authority to the Judicial Conference to  designate, after notice and  [[Page H7021]]  comment, certain categories of records that will be subject to up to a  5-day delay before they are made publicly accessible.   Any such designation must be no broader than necessary and be based  on a determination of a specific and substantial interest in  restricting the public right of access to court records. Any  designation expires after 3 years unless renewed via notice and  comment.   Section 3(c) requires the Director of the Administrative Office of  the United States Courts, in coordination with the Administrator of  General Services, to ensure that the public can search for and access  court records, similar to the requirements under Section 2 of this act.   Finally, section 3(d) establishes the dates when all PACER fees must  be eliminated and court records are made freely available to the public  within two years from enactment unless the Director of General Services  certifies that an additional year is needed.   This is needed legislation and I support it.   I urge all Members to join me in voting for H.R. 8235, the ``Open  Courts Act of 2020.''
