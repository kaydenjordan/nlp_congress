 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  childhood cancer research and the organization Hyundai Hope on Wheels,  which is celebrating its 25th anniversary.   Before serving in Congress, I began working with Hyundai Hope on  Wheels in my role as a Hyundai dealer. Today, I am proud to work with  this incredible  [[Page H4959]]  charity in my role as co-chair along with  Mike McCaul of the  Congressional Childhood Cancer Caucus.   Every time a Hyundai is sold, $22 of each new vehicle goes toward  Hyundai Hope on Wheels to fund pediatric cancer research. Since 1998,  this organization has raised over $225 million. It truly makes Hyundai  not only a great company but a good company.   Now, I work with dealers Tom O'Brien and Don Reilly, and these are  the men who started this incredible charity. It has played a crucial  role in creating hope and saving lives in the battle against childhood  cancer, fueling nearly 1,300 research studies at more than 175 medical  institutions.   They are dedicated to supporting pediatric cancer research that finds  innovative approaches, creates discovery, and improves care for  children fighting cancer.   Their milestone came during an important week last month. As they  held their annual event here on Capitol Hill, the Congressional  Childhood Cancer Caucus held its annual Childhood Cancer Summit  simultaneously.   Here in Congress and through the work of our caucus, we have made  great legislative strides that have turned bills into laws and hope  into action.   Last year, we passed the Childhood Cancer STAR Reauthorization Act.  Since it was first passed in 2018, this bill has expanded opportunities  for childhood research, improved efforts to identify and track  childhood cancer incidences, and enhanced the quality of life for  childhood survivors.   Since its inception, the Congressional Childhood Cancer Caucus has  had four landmark pieces of legislation signed into law: The Childhood  Cancer STAR Act, the Creating Hope Act, the RACE for Children Act, and  the Global Hope Act. Our work is not done.   Thanks to their work, and thanks to our partnership in Congress, we  have made great strides in funding childhood cancer research. Most  importantly, I believe we are getting closer to the day when no parent,  no family, will ever again have to hear the words: ``Your child has  cancer.''    I also will take a moment to share a success story from the Hyundai  Hope on Wheels program. Each year, Hyundai Hope on Wheels has a youth  ambassador, and a few years ago, we met Hannah Adams. She was several  years removed from battling cancer herself, and she shared with us some  incredible and impactful stories.   Hannah is now 13 years cancer-free, and this summer, she was an  intern in our Washington, D.C., office. She is now a junior at the  University of Alabama, double majoring in political science and public  relations, and we know she will accomplish so much.   It is my honor to have worked alongside Hannah and all of our youth  ambassadors over the years.   You can understand why we have a youth ambassador. If you or I were  to go into a cancer hospital and try to talk to a child, it looks like,  in my case, their grandfather came in. Hannah was their age. The youth  ambassadors are their age, and they connect with children in a way that  says to them: Look, I was once in the same position you were in. You  can beat this. You can beat this, and we will work with you to do it.   Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge that October is Breast Cancer Awareness  Month. As co-chair of the House Cancer Caucus, I also make a commitment  to those who are currently living with or who have lived with breast  cancer. Congress will continue to fight for you by providing the  necessary funding for research and support in the hope that someday we  can find a cure.                            ____________________
