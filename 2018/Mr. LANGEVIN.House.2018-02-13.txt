 Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the bipartisan Career and  Technical Education Caucus, I rise in recognition of National CTE  Month.   CTE programs train students of all ages for jobs in high-skill, high- demand, and high-paying fields. By establishing partnerships between  educators and industry leaders, CTE helps build a well-educated and  skilled workforce ready to meet local business needs.   In Rhode Island, the Westerly Education Center, by way of example,  collaborates with Electric Boat to train pipefitting students like  Stephanie and Richard to build our Nation's next generation submarines.   The Genesis Center partners with CVS, Building Futures, and  Apprenticeship Rhode Island to train workers, including Kathia, Jidma,  and Lim, to become pharmacy technicians. Cindy was recently offered a  job by CVS soon after she finished an apprenticeship.   CTE is good for students, businesses, the Rhode Island economy, and  economies everywhere because it narrows that gap between what we are  teaching in schools and what the needs of businesses really are.   I am proud to introduce a resolution celebrating CTE Month with my  friend, colleague, and caucus co-chair, Representative G.T. Thompson.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring H. Res.  730.                            ____________________
