 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn this  administration's latest attempt to do away with the healthcare provided  by the Affordable Care Act.   The Department of Justice's decision to go after the healthcare of  millions of Americans by seeking a ruling that the Affordable Care Act  is unconstitutional underscores their belief that healthcare should be  a luxury reserved for the privileged few, only now we have moved from  repeal and replace to just flat-out repeal. I could not disagree more  strongly.   In my home State of Pennsylvania, the ability to get health insurance  regardless of chronic illness has saved countless lives. Tens of  thousands of my constituents have gotten healthcare for the first time  under the Affordable Care Act. Those with preexisting conditions have  received peace of mind, and many, myself included, have been able to  keep their children on their health plans even as they become adults  themselves.   The administration's callous decision to continue undermining the  Affordable Care Act endangers my constituents, just as it endangers the  lives of Americans in every district of our country.   We were chosen to serve in this House to protect Americans who need  us most, and that means protecting their healthcare. Mr. Speaker, I  urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' on this  important resolution.
