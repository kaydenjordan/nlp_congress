 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman  from California for bringing this bill to the floor and giving me the  opportunity to comment on it.   I rise in strong support. I grew up across the river from Mississippi  in the State of Arkansas. I happened to be the same age as Emmett Till  when he was murdered; I was 14, he was 14.   Then I had the opportunity to work with his mother, Ms. Mamie Till- Mobley, who lived in Chicago. The church, Roberts Temple, is now in my  district, where his funeral was held, so I have always felt close to  the situation. I have always felt a part of it.   Ms. Mobley, Emmett Till's mother, was a premier activist in Chicago.  She lived in Bobby's district, Congressman Rush's district, but she was  all over the city, all over the country, all over the world, hoping to  bring attention to the situation.                                time  1500     DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (S. 2834) to amend title XVIII of the Social  Security Act to preserve access to rehabilitation innovation centers  under the Medicare program.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2834         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 2834 is named in honor and memory of the departed  former president and CEO, Dr. Joanne Smith, of Shirley Ryan AbilityLab,  who died last year on September 6.   She was a visionary and transformative figure in the field of  physical medicine and rehabilitation by shifting the focus from  rehabilitation to the outcome of ability. It means the capacity to  transcend beyond one's physical setbacks and circumstances in  recovering and to live a healthy and meaningful life.   Dr. Smith was a compassionate doctor, loving wife, and wonderful  mother. She was the driving force behind the development, building, and  implementation of the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab that opened in my  district in 2017.   Dr. Smith stood on the shoulders of the late Dr. Henry Betts and his  legacy at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, which was before the  name change to Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. He was a tireless advocate for  the rights of people with disabilities and served as medical director  and CEO of the rehabilitation institute for many years.   People come from all over the world to be seen by our expert staff  and researchers to receive cutting-edge technology from the hospital's  medical discoveries. This facility was ranked number one in  rehabilitation by U.S. News & World Report for the 31st year in a row.  What a hospital.   In the United States, there are nearly 1,200 inpatient rehabilitation  facilities. As we know, many of these institutions are small and are  driving the  [[Page H9935]]  future of rehabilitation medicine and patient recovery. This unique  category of comprehensive rehab hospitals treats the most complex  conditions, such as traumatic brain injury, stroke, spinal cord injury,  childhood disease, burns, and wartime injuries. They treat veterans,  the elderly, the disabled, victims of violence, and children with birth  defects.   In addition, they conduct research that drives the entire industry  and take on a greater share of training of the next generation of  clinicians. These unique facilities are advancing the practice and  standards of rehabilitation across the field of medicine and helping to  disseminate best practices throughout the country.   For years, I have worked with colleagues in both parties and in both  Chambers to support, study, and share the wonders of these leading  rehab hospitals. They provide hope to countless patients and their  families.   S. 2834 is the companion bill to H.R. 9271, which received bipartisan  and bicameral support. This legislation, which I am honored to partner  on with Representatives Jan Schakowsky and Darin LaHood from Illinois,  recently passed the Senate on a bipartisan voice vote, and it was led  by my friend Senator Durbin and Senator Cassidy, Republican of  Louisiana.   I am pleased that we are considering it today. S. 2834 would direct  CMS to study this class of rehab hospitals and provide recommendations  on how to preserve patient access to these leading facilities. This  will help share best practices, promote new research, and improve  patient care across the entire medical field.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for S. 2834,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1515     DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she  may consume to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), one of  the authors of this legislation and my dear friend and delightful  colleague.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  [[Page H9936]]         DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, as I prepare to close,  this may be the last time that I have an opportunity to be on the floor  with former Chairman Brady, Ranking Member Brady, and I just want to  say to him that it has been a pleasure working with him and observing  his leadership on the Ways and Means Committee. Hopefully, the wind  will always be at his back and the Sun will shine warmly upon his face.   Having a bill that is going to help continue to provide that kind of  research--having this legislation on the floor here today, I was  reminiscing a bit with myself of some of the many wonderful  opportunities to have dialogue with Dr. Henry Betts, who was a guru in  rehabilitation medicine, as was Dr. Smith. Dr. Betts and I often used  to ride on the airplane together, coming from Chicago to Washington for  whatever, and he was the most passionate man, most creative.   On a personal note, my former office manager and secretary had a  stroke, and she was out for more than a year, but she went to the  Rehabilitation Institute, came back, worked until she retired, is now  living a very meaningful life as a retired person having all of her  facilities.   The Rehabilitation Institute did that. Rehabilitation medicine did  that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
