 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Affordable  Interior Systems, or AIS, of Leominster, Massachusetts, a company that  normally manufactures office furniture, but which has organized  volunteers from across the United States to create an amazing new  initiative called Sew the Masks.   Like so many other patriotic Americans, when the AIS team began to  see the terrible toll the coronavirus pandemic was inflicting on our  country, they jumped into action. Affectionately drawing on the  inspiration of World War II icon Rosie the Riveter, AIS leveraged their  expertise and retrofitted a chair production line to produce high- quality, reusable masks.   Then they mobilized their own employees, as well as volunteers from  across the country, affectionately known as Rosies, to sew high-quality  reusable masks for first responders and other essential employees.   Madam Speaker, I find their dedication to helping their neighbors in  the fight against COVID-19 nothing short of awe-inspiring, and I hope  you will join me in recognizing the amazing work of AIS and their  volunteers from across the country.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Texas  (Mr. Castro) for yielding, but also for his commitment to human rights,  not only with regard to the repression that is going on in China, but  all around the world.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6210, the Uyghur  Forced Labor Prevention Act. I am proud to have authored this  legislation to address human rights and forced labor abuses against  Uyghur and other Muslim groups in China.   There is strong, diverse, bipartisan, and bicameral support for this  legislation, including from my colleagues on the Congressional- Executive Commission on China. Senator Marco Rubio, Representative  Chris Smith, and Representative  Tom Suozzi all helped draft this  legislation. I thank Speaker Nancy Pelosi for her longtime advocacy for  human rights in China and for her leadership in getting this bill to  the House floor. I thank Chairman Engel, as well as Ranking Member  McCaul, Chairman Neal, and Chairwoman Waters for the support of their  committees.   The Congressional-Executive Commission on China, of which I serve as  the chair, held the first congressional hearing on this topic a year  ago, followed up with a groundbreaking staff report, and then held an  expert roundtable event on this issue. We found that the evidence of  systematic and widespread forced labor in Xinjiang is astounding and  irrefutable and includes evidence from camp detainees, satellite  imagery of factories being built at internment camps, and public and  leaked Chinese Government documents. All the evidence we accumulated  led to the introduction of this bipartisan, bicameral legislation in  March 2020.    It is time for Congress to act. Over the past several years, we have  watched in horror as the Chinese Government first created and then  expanded a system of extrajudicial mass internment camps. As many as  1.8 million Uyghurs and members of other predominantly Muslim ethnic  minority groups have been arbitrarily detained in the camps and  subjected to forced labor, torture, political indoctrination, and other  severe human rights abuses.   Reports published during the past year detailed an expansive and  systematic policy of forcibly separating ethnic minority children from  their families. A Chinese Government policy document stated that nearly  half a million schoolchildren were attending boarding schools. The  forcible displacement of children is in violation of the Chinese  Government's law on the protection of minors and the U.N. Convention on  the Rights of the Child.   Investigations during the past year detailed a policy of forcibly  separating ethnic minority children from their families and the use of  forced birth control and sterilization, which may be in contravention  of the U.N. Convention on Genocide to which it is a party. The United  States Holocaust Memorial Museum had already determined that crimes  against humanity may have been committed.   In July, I joined a bipartisan letter signed by over 75 Members  calling on the Trump administration to make an official determination  as to whether atrocity crimes, including genocide and crimes against  humanity, are being committed. We have yet to hear back from the  administration.   It is time for Congress to act. We know forced labor is widespread  and systematic, and it exists both within and outside the mass  internment camps. These facts are confirmed by the testimony of former  camp detainees, satellite imagery, and official leaked documents from  the Chinese Government. We know that many U.S., international, and  Chinese companies  [[Page H4663]]  are complicit in the exploitation of forced labor and specific products  include textiles, electronics, and food products.   Audits of supply chains are simply not possible because workers  cannot speak freely and honestly about working conditions, given heavy  surveillance and intimidation.   Current U.S. law states that it is illegal to import into the United  States ``goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or  manufactured wholly or in part'' by forced labor. Unfortunately,  products made with forced labor are still making their way into global  supply chains and our country.   The Trump administration has taken some actions, including sending  out a business advisory and placing withhold release orders on some  businesses and entities in China. But these piecemeal actions fall far  short of addressing a regional economic system that is built upon a  foundation of forced labor and repression.   Further, we should all be disturbed by reports that President Trump  gave a green light to President Xi by telling him that building the  camps was ``the right thing to do.'' Ending forced labor was not even  discussed as part of the ``Phase One'' trade deal.   It is time for Congress to act. The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention  Act prohibits imports from Xinjiang to the U.S. by creating a  ``rebuttal presumption'' that all goods produced in the region are made  with forced labor unless U.S. Customs and Border Protection certifies  by ``clear and convincing evidence'' that goods were not produced with  forced labor.   The legislation also authorizes targeted sanctions, requires  financial disclosures about involvement in the region, and requires a  State Department determination about whether crimes against humanity or  genocide are occurring.   For more than 2 years, U.S. and international companies have been  aware of forced labor throughout the Xinjiang region. It is long past  time for these companies to reassess their supply chains and find  alternatives that do not exploit labor and violate human rights.   Their failure to do so has led U.S. consumers to unwittingly purchase  goods made with forced labor. That must end.   Effective enforcement would mean that workers and farmers would no  longer have to compete against forced labor from Xinjiang. For too  long, the world has been silent while Uyghurs and other Muslim groups  suffered under severe repression.    Madam Speaker, I believe the lack of any international  response for so long allowed the Chinese Government the space to impose  this extreme system of repression. But now the world has woken up.   Today, the U.S. House of Representatives is taking the strongest  action yet. I am proud to stand in solidarity with the Uyghur people  and, indeed, all the people living under the rule of the Chinese  Government, in their struggle to live freely, practice their religious  beliefs freely, and speak their own languages freely.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to the passage of this legislation,  continuing our bipartisan work together to support human rights in  China.
