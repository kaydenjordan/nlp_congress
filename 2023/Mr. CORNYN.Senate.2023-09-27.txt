 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, more than 4\1/2\ months ago, title 42  expired. That was on May 11 of this year. Title 42, just to refresh  everybody's memory, was a public health order that was designed to  prevent the spread of COVID-19, particularly from people entering the  country from other countries around the world.   In the lead-up to title 42's expiration, the Biden administration  rolled out its plan to address the expected surge in migration. This  plan was called the Circumvention of Lawful Pathways rule, and it was  sold as a way to discourage illegal immigration and restore some sense  of order along the border.   As I and countless others have pointed out, this wasn't a real  solution. This was a shell game. It was an attempt to conceal the scope  and scale of the border crisis and to process migrants into the United  States at an unprecedented rate. Let me just paraphrase that. This was  not designed to deter people from illegally immigrating to the United  States. It was a way to greet them and welcome them and then invite  them to enter into the United States without following the legal rules  and laws that Congress had passed.   Well, despite the people who pointed out that this was really a  ruse--a Trojan horse, if you will--the administration moved forward  with the plan. Just days before title 42 was lifted, Homeland Security  Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas tried to assure the American people that  the Biden administration was in control.   He said:         The border is not open; it has not been open; and it will       not be open subsequent to May 11.    Well, at the time, it was clear that at least two parts of his  statement were false. The border was open. That is why more than 10,000  migrants a day were crossing the southern border in the final week of  title 42. How do you say the border is not open when 10,000 people are  traversing the border each day without going through our legal  immigration system? And the border had been open, and that is why the  United States broke nearly every record in the book for border  crossings on President Biden's watch. So it was open, and it had been  open, and it is clear today that the border is still open even with the  administration's new plan in place.   Despite the initial drop in border crossings after title 42 was  lifted, illegal border crossings have surged once again. In August,  Customs and Border Protection apprehended just under 233,000 migrants,  setting the record for the busiest month this calendar year. As you  might have predicted, the cartels simply sat back to assess the lay of  the land and this new state of affairs and adapted their operations to  exploit the rule's numerous loopholes.   Unfortunately, the challenges at the border have only grown since  August. Over the last few weeks, areas along the entire U.S.-Mexico  border have experienced a new surge in immigration. One area that is  under tremendous strain is the west Texas town of El Paso. Last week,  more than 8,000 migrants crossed into Eagle Pass. Excuse me--Eagle  Pass. This isn't a major city. In fact, I mentioned El Paso by mistake.  Eagle Pass is actually a much smaller town. This isn't a major city  with extensive resources. Eagle Pass is a small border town with a  population of roughly 28,000. It doesn't have the resources to house,  feed, or transport thousands of migrants each week. Eagle Pass is  bearing the brunt of this surge, but it is not alone. El Paso, that I  mentioned earlier, is also experiencing a massive influx.    Several weeks ago, El Paso, in far west Texas, was seeing roughly 350  to 400 border crossings per day. In recent days, that number has  skyrocketed to more than 2,000 a day.   Customs and Border Protection is releasing more than a thousand  migrants a day into the community. And these aren't people,  necessarily, who are claiming asylum. They are simply just trying to  keep the line from stacking up and overloading the processing  facilities of Customs and Border Protection.   So what are they doing? They are simply releasing them into the  community, and they are on their own but for the help of some of the  nongovernmental organizations that are trying to provide humanitarian  assistance.   The city of El Paso has limited resources to care for migrants, and  those resources are quickly being depleted. Over the weekend, El Paso  Mayor Oscar Leeser said the city had reached a ``breaking point'' due  to the growing number of migrants. That may sound familiar. That sounds  like another mayor, Mayor Eric Adams of New York City, who said the  influx of migrants into New York City is creating extreme danger and  reaching the breaking point.   I am, generally speaking, a pretty optimistic person. But I don't see  any indication that anything is going to change in the Biden  administration's abdication of its responsibility to secure the border  and have orderly, safe, and legal immigration.   People around the world see that America's southern border is wide  open, and they are making their way to the United States.   I have mentioned this story before, but when four of our colleagues  on the Democratic side of the aisle and four on the Republican side  went to Yuma, AZ, with Senator Sinema and Senator Kelly, who represent  that State, we found a sleepy little agricultural community where the  chief of the Border Patrol sector there welcomed us saying: Last year  we encountered people from 174 different countries speaking more than  200 languages. Senator Kelly, one of the Arizona Senators, pointed out  that there was an airport in a northern Mexican city called Mexicali  and that, evidently, people  [[Page S4694]]  were just flying into that city and then literally Ubering over to the  Yuma sector and claiming asylum.   The New York Times reports that in August, nearly 82,000 migrants  have passed through what is known as the Darien Gap, which is the sole  land route to the United States from South America, describing it as  ``by far the largest single-month total on record.''   The border crisis has had--and continues to have--a major impact on  border communities in my State, but the scale of the Biden border  crisis means the burden is now being shared more broadly with  communities across the country.   Liberal enclaves, self-styled sanctuary cities like New York and  Chicago have been longtime supporters of open-border policies, I  suspect, primarily because it hasn't affected them in a negative way  like it has always done in my State and my communities.   These cities proudly identify themselves as sanctuary cities and have  even criticized commonsense measures to enforce our immigration laws.  But as more and more migrants have poured into these liberal cities,  the narrative has changed, as I pointed out a moment ago.   Mayor Adams of New York City, for example, issued a stark warning,  saying it will ``destroy New York City.''   The Democratic Governor of New Jersey, who once vowed to turn New  Jersey into a sanctuary State, now says the State is at capacity. We  have seen the same story play out in Boston, Chicago, and even right  here in Washington, DC.   Even major sanctuary cities that are more than a thousand miles from  the southern border can't keep up with the volume of migrants from the  Biden border crisis. As our colleagues know, this is more than a  humanitarian crisis. This is a public safety crisis as well.   When border agents are pulled off the frontlines to process,  transport, and care for migrants, it creates a vulnerability for  cartels and criminal organizations to then move illicit drugs across  the border. They are given a clear pathway--literally, a multilane  highway--to smuggle fentanyl, heroin, and other dangerous drugs across  the border and into cities and communities all across this country.   This isn't news to the cartel. This is their business model: Flood  the zone with people, divert law enforcement, and then move the drugs  into the United States. Last year alone, 108,000 Americans died as a  result of those drugs.   The cartels know that this game that they are playing--or this  business model--inures to their benefit. We saw this 2 years ago, when  15,000 migrants crossed into Del Rio in a matter of days. Del Rio is  this little city of 35,000 people. They had an influx of 15,000  migrants--mostly Haitians--in just a matter of days.   It looks like we are seeing this history repeat itself. Border Patrol  Chief Jason Owens said he believes the surge last week was by design.  As I said, cartels and these criminal organizations know they can flood  the zone with migrants and distract law enforcement. It creates open  corridors for drug traffickers, human smugglers, maybe even terrorists,  and criminals of all stripes to sneak across the border.   When talking about the threats posed by fentanyl and criminal  organizations, Chief Owens said:         It's about as bad as I've ever seen it.    This is somebody who has given his professional lifetime to serving  the country as a member of the Border Patrol.   Communities across our country are being ravaged by the overdose  epidemic, which is killing more than 110,000 Americans a year, and  President Biden seems content to let the carnage continue. He has shown  no interest in securing the border and cutting off the cartels' illicit  trade corridors.   I can't reach any other conclusion but to think that President Biden  doesn't care. If he did care, he would do something about it. But he,  obviously, hasn't done anything about it, and the only obvious  conclusion is that he doesn't care.   We are seeing clear and convincing evidence, both at the southern  border and major cities, that President Biden's border plan--if you  could call it that--isn't working. Apprehensions are on the rise,  detention facilities are over capacity, and cities and nonprofit  organizations are stretched beyond their limits to deal with the  migrants with weak or nonexistent claims for asylum who never should  have been released in the first place. The so-called Circumvention of  Lawful Pathways rule has made the border crisis worse, not better.   In many ways, that seems to be the theme repeated over and over  again: taking a bad situation and making it worse. And nowhere is that  more evident than at the border.   What we have seen is the Biden administration is using this rule to  funnel migrants into unlawful parole programs, essentially creating  another class of immigrants with flimsy immigration status.   Rather than deliver consequences for illegal immigration, the  administration is simply creating a new set of magic words migrants  have to say in order to avoid immediate removal.   This rule is riddled with loopholes. And when too many migrants claim  to fit within these loopholes, they will once again overwhelm DHS  capacity. It is not fair to the migrants who have been led to believe  that they can depend on these parole programs long term, and it is not  fair to those with legitimate claims for asylum--which are maybe 10 to  15 percent of the people claiming asylum--to have to wait in line for  years upon years with people who have no legitimate claim to asylum.  And the reason they have to do that is because of the backlog in the  immigration courts.   As we have seen with DACA, which is Deferred Action on Childhood  Arrivals--these are the Dreamers, people who came as children with  their parents into the country and for whom I have complete sympathy.  We don't hold children responsible for what their parents do. Yet these  migrants will face years of uncertainty and heartache as a result of  the procedures employed by President Obama at the time, which have now  been litigated in court for 10 years. Right now, the current status is  the courts have said that what President Obama tried to do was illegal.  He didn't have that authority.   It is time for Congress to intervene. We, obviously, can't depend on  leadership--or even participation at this point--from the Biden  administration.   This summer, I introduced a Congressional Review Act resolution that  puts an end to President Biden's shell game. We know from the press  that immigration groups, both on the right and the left, oppose the  Circumvention of Lawful Pathways rule. Earlier this year, some of our  Democratic colleagues said that they were deeply disappointed with the  administration's decision to move forward with the rule.   I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have raised  concerns over this policy will support the effort to overturn it.   Our colleagues know the impact of the border crisis, and they know  that it is being felt far beyond the U.S.-Mexico border. Cities across  the country, from El Paso to New York City, are overwhelmed by the  burden of caring for these migrants who have no plausible claim to be  in the country legally. Yet by sheer volume, they have overwhelmed the  system.   Mayors and Governors are sounding the alarm over the unbearable  weight of this crisis. They can't look for help at the White House; so  they ought to be looking to us to do our job and provide that help.   At the same time, communities across the country are being terrified  by the destruction and the death caused by the fentanyl crisis. On  Monday, I sat down with parents, students, and first responders in  Dallas, TX, who really drove home this point.   Each of our colleagues should have a vested interest in ending  policies that are fueling the humanitarian and public safety crisis  that begins at the border and yet reaches into every community across  America. I didn't think it was possible for the Biden border crisis to  get worse, but it clearly has.   Congress needs to act before the situation gets even more dangerous  and worse and to force the Biden administration to put forth a serious  plan that actually discourages illegal immigration and doesn't just  invite migrants without any plausible or legitimate claims to being in  the country and in the great American heartland.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, following the devastating shooting in  Uvalde just a little over a year ago, Congress passed the Bipartisan  Safer Communities Act. As we know, this legislation invested in mental  health, school safety, and commonsense measures to prevent dangerous  individuals--namely, those with mental health problems or with criminal  records--from carrying out acts of violence.   Importantly, it did all of this without impacting the Second  Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. That was a red line.  Unfortunately, the Biden administration has misinterpreted a section of  this law and is using it as a pretext to defund hunter education and  archery programs, which is ironic because one of the things that many  people have advocated is, let's teach people how to safely use firearms  for recreational or hunting purposes. Yet they want to somehow stop  those very programs?   Well, these programs are offered in school districts across Texas and  equip  [[Page S4708]]  students with invaluable skills, including, as I suggested, firearms  safety and wildlife management. They are teaching students to be  responsible gun owners and good stewards of the environment, something  I would think we would all want.   These programs have overwhelming bipartisan support, and Congress had  no intention of impacting them or curbing their availability in any  way. Members of Congress worked together in good faith to pass this  legislation that will build stronger, safer communities. But the fact  that the administration is stretching the law--the words of the law-- beyond any meaning that we intended is unjustifiable. When this  happens, it undermines the good will between Congress and the White  House. It makes it difficult, if not impossible, to legislate on  important and contentious issues like this.   The Biden administration is attempting to take creative license with  the law, and Congress needs to step in and correct the situation  immediately. That is what we are doing today. Senator Sinema, Senator  Tillis, and Senator Murphy were my partners in negotiating this  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. We came together with Senator Capito  and immediately started working on a new bill to clarify congressional  intent on this legislation given the overreach by the administration.  We worked with our colleagues on the House side to craft a bill that  could pass both Chambers of Congress.   The Protecting Hunting Heritage and Education Act clarifies that  Federal funds can be used to support archery, hunting, and other  valuable enrichment programs in schools.   This legislation passed the House yesterday evening by a vote of 424  to 1, an overwhelming show of bipartisanship. I hope the Senate will  follow suit today and send this legislation to the President's desk to  clarify, once and for all, that the Biden administration cannot ignore  the express will of Congress.   This is the Biden administration, not the Biden kingdom. The wishes  and whims of the President and his staff do not outweigh Congress's  intent. I am eager for President Biden to sign this legislation and  acknowledge that this interpretation of the clear words of the  legislation that we passed on a bipartisan basis were totally in  conflict.   Once again, Congress has reclaimed its right as a separate, coequal  branch of government in a bipartisan way to pass legislation that  expresses not the will of the staff at the White House or some  administrative Agency but the will of the Members of Congress. I am  glad the House acted quickly to correct this shameful behavior, and I  hope now the Senate will follow suit.   Madam President, I see the Senator from Arizona here on the floor,  and I yield to her.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 5110, the Protecting  Hunting Heritage and Education Act, which was received from the House.    I further ask that the bill be considered read a third  time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
