 Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Nevada's Third  District, I rise today in support of the Great American Outdoors Act.  This bill, which I cosponsored, will finally secure full, dedicated  funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund.   This fund helps to conserve some of southern Nevada's most precious  public lands, like Red Rock Canyon, Sloan Canyon, and Lake Mead.   Coming together on such a vital issue is a reminder that Congress has  the  [[Page H3670]]  ability to rise above partisanship and find solutions that benefit us  all. There is no issue more universal to all Americans and all people  than protecting our planet. We can't keep kicking this can down the  road. This is the time to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation  Fund.   In closing, my time was short with Congressman John Lewis, but I will  forever be impacted and am eternally grateful for his leadership.                            ____________________
