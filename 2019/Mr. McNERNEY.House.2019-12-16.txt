 Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives is vested by  the Constitution with the power of impeachment to provide a balance to  the power of the Presidency. Without this essential duty, the President  could exploit the sacred office without any regard for the law.   On January 3, 2019, every Member of the House swore an oath to defend  our Constitution, and this week, we are being asked to do just that.   President Trump tried to undermine the 2020 election; and when the  House exercised this duty to investigate this abuse of power, the  President refused to cooperate and forbade his administration from  doing so, obstructing Congress from carrying out our sworn  responsibility.   If these actions bear no consequences, future Presidents may act  without constraint, and American democracy will be at an end.   Therefore, compelled by my sworn duty to defend the Constitution, I  will vote to impeach this President, and I urge the Senate to remove  him from office.
