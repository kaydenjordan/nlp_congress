 Mr. Speaker, incorrigible little Kim and his  minions are rattling their sabers once again.   While U.S.-South Korean exercises were underway, North Korea launched  four land-based missiles. The missiles traveled over 600 miles. North  Korean Army bases are purposely positioned to strike U.S. bases in  Japan and South Korea.   It is time to put an end to North Korea's mischiefmaking. The United  States' hopeless appeasement policy with North Korea has not worked.   In 2008, the administration removed the warmonger from the State  Sponsors of Terrorism list with little Kim's promise to stop their  nuclear weapons program. Well, guess what? Kim Jong-un lied.   We must return North Korea to where it belongs: the State Sponsors of  Terrorism list. Senator Cruz and I have filed legislation to do just  that. Then real sanctions and blocking of financial transactions are  necessary.   The United States cannot underestimate the war-prone lunacy of Kim  Jong-un. He needs a clear message from America to leave us alone and  leave our allies alone.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
