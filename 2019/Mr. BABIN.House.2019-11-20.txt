 Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear colleague for having this.   Since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941, every U.S. President has  declared the week of Thanksgiving to be National Bible Week. Next week,  we will, once again, celebrate this beloved book, which continues to  mold the lives of millions and even billions around the world.   It is fitting that we take time today to bring attention to the very  book that was so influential in the founding of our Nation. The Holy  Bible was perhaps the most accessible book to our Founding Fathers. Its  principles gave them invaluable insights into human nature, civic  virtue, political authority, and the rights of citizens.   Personally, I consider it a huge and great privilege to speak on the  House floor today about a book that has had such a profound influence  on my life and on the life of our country, and it continues to do so  daily.   As a believer in Christ, the Bible has shaped the way that I have  lived my life, whether conducting my business as a dentist in  Woodville, Texas, raising my family, or serving the good people of the  36th District of Texas right here in the House of Representatives.   I believe that the Bible is more than a book of inspiration and  comfort or a compilation of moral teachings. I believe that it really  is the Holy Word of God that contains the truth and teachings of His  love for us and His plan for redemption through faith in Jesus Christ,  His Son.   In history's greatest love story, the Bible tells us that God  sacrificed His Son to redeem us from depravity. In John 3:16, we read:  ``For God so loved the world, He gave His only begotten Son that  whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting  life.''   Centuries before, in one of my favorite passages, the Book of Job  prophesied of Christ the Redeemer who is to come:       For I know that my Redeemer lives,      And He shall stand at last on the Earth;      And after my skin is destroyed, this I know,      That in my flesh I shall see God,      Whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and             not another.      How my heart yearns within me.    Whenever I read these words, I am reminded of my Lord's steadfast  love for me and His promise to always be with and guide me through  every chapter of my life.                                time  1800    As we approach the 78th National Bible Week, I want to encourage my  fellow Americans out there to take a moment to open the Bible and to  read these profound words. No matter if it has been a while since you  have read the Bible or you read it every single day, may each of us  spend time reminding ourselves of the Word of God, especially during  this season of thanks.
