 Madam Speaker, after Hurricane Sandy, thousands of  homeowners throughout the New York region learned that they were  ineligible for federal disaster assistance because they lived in a co- op or a condo; not in a single family home.   According to the FEMA's policy, co-ops and condo associations are  ``business entities''--not eligible for federal assistance that can  reach up to $30,000 per household.   As a result, community associations are often faced with the daunting  task of cleaning up and rebuilding after a major natural disaster-- without the help or resources that other homeowners receive from the  federal government.   To help bring fairness to the federal disaster relief process, my  colleague Jerry Nadler and I introduced H.R. 1684, the Disaster  Assistance Support for Communities and Homeowners Act.   Our bill directs FEMA to provide technical assistance to help  community associations qualify for disaster assistance grants.   It also directs FEMA to provide recommendations to Congress, within  12 months, on additional ways that co-ops and condos can become  eligible for assistance.   I encourage swift passage of H.R. 1684 to help ensure that all  community association  [[Page H5146]]  homeowners have access to federal disaster benefits.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1684,  the Disaster Assistance Support for Communities and Homeowners Act of  2017.   This bill directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to  provide technical assistance to Common Interest Communities to ensure  they are eligible to apply for public assistance.   H.R. 1684 also instructs FEMA to provide legislative proposals to  Congress in order to make condominiums and housing cooperatives  eligible for disaster assistance in the future.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1684 addresses an outstanding issue many  Americans face in the aftermath of natural disasters because they are  ineligible for FEMA assistance based on the type of home they live in.   The glaring discrepancy and inequity in FEMA's policy were revealed  as communities struggled to recover and rebuild from the ravaging  effects of Hurricane Sandy in 2012.   In addition to causing the deaths of 72 U.S. citizens, Hurricane  Sandy was the second-costliest hurricane in United States history,  destroying 651,000 housing units in New York and New Jersey and  exacting a staggering $19 billion in damages for New York City alone.   However, due to FEMA's unfair policy towards community associations,  thousands of New Yorkers found themselves ineligible for federal  recovery assistance needed to repair their homes because under current  federal law, condominiums, housing cooperatives, and homeowners  associations are classified as businesses.   H.R. 1684 corrects this unfairness by authorizing FEMA to provide  direct disaster relief to these communities in the form of technical  assistance and monetary reimbursements.   Further, the legislation directs FEMA to submit to Congress within 90  days of enactment a plan to make common areas of condos and co-ops  eligible for disaster assistance.   Madam Speaker, this legislation is particularly beneficial to my  congressional district since Houston ranks among the most disaster- prone cities in the country.   Many of my constituents can recall with horror the devastating  effects of Hurricane Ike in 2008, which killed 37 people and destroyed  100,000 homes in Texas.   Over the course of this massive natural disaster, FEMA played a vital  role in responding to the needs of impacted areas and victims.   Unfortunately, FEMA's response to Hurricane Ike was also beset by a  lack of clear communication between appointed officials and regional  emergency managers on the ground.   Improving federal policy for disaster relief is a bipartisan issue  and H.R. 1684 is endorsed by the Community Associations Institute, a  leading membership organization with more than 34,000 members and 70  chapters nationwide.   Madam Speaker, legislation like H.R. 1684 is crucial to ensuring that  all Americans receive the relief and assistance they deserve in the  wake of natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy that destroy lives and  leave local economies in tatters.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1684.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Graves) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 1684, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I join Chairman Royce and all of my  colleagues in welcoming President Moon of the Republic of Korea as he  travels to Washington this week.   Across 135 years of diplomatic ties, the United States and the  Republic of Korea have forged a strong and unshakable relationship. Our  countries have sacrificed together in war--from the Korean war to  Vietnam, to the Persian Gulf, to Afghanistan--and we have prospered  together in peace.   Our alliance, enshrined in the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1953, has  been a pillar of stability and security for both of our countries. That  alliance is especially important in light of the grave threat just 35  miles from Seoul: the dangerous regime controlled by dictator Kim Jung- un in North Korea.   America grieves with the Warmbier family over the tragic death of  their young son, Otto. His unjust detention, abuse, and death haunts  all of us. We must do all we can to secure the safe return of the three  Americans still detained in North Korea.   I trust that President Moon's visit will deepen an understanding  between Washington and Seoul in these trying times so that we may face  this challenge as we have others: in lockstep, side by side.                            ____________________
