 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to voice my strong support for the  nomination of Wilbur Ross to be Secretary of Commerce. We held a  hearing on his nomination on January 18, 2017. Mr. Ross has also  completed the required paperwork and responded to all of the committee  questions for the record. Five weeks ago, on January 24, the Commerce  Committee acted by voice vote to favorably report his nomination to the  floor. We invoked cloture on Mr. Ross's nomination by a vote margin of  66 to 31 on February 17, with 15 Democratic Senators voting to invoke  cloture.   I am glad the Senate will finally confirm his nomination today after  a long and unnecessary delay. When he is confirmed, Mr. Ross will bring  decades of business, entrepreneurial, and civic experience to this  important position.   Mr. Ross is perhaps best known for his expertise in revitalizing  distressed businesses, such as those in the U.S. steel industry. At a  time when most investors had abandoned the industry, he organized the  International Steel Group in 2002, and through acquisitions, he made it  the largest integrated steel company in North America. Later, it merged  with Mittal Steel to form the largest steel company in the world. It is  for this reason that all of the major steel-industry labor unions also  support his confirmation.   I ask unanimous consent that the letter of support for the  confirmation of Wilbur Ross from the United Steelworkers, dated January  9, 2017, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.   Mr. Ross's nomination is also supported by a bipartisan group of  former Secretaries of Commerce, including Secretary William M. Daley,  who served as Commerce Secretary under President Clinton, and later as  Chief of Staff to President Barack Obama.   Mr. Ross's strong record of achievement in business led Bloomberg  Businessweek to name him one of the ``50 Most Influential People in  Global Finance'' in 2011. It is also why he is the only person elected  to both the Turnaround Management Hall of Fame and the Private Equity  Hall of Fame.   Mr. Ross's nomination comes at an important time in our Nation's  economic recovery. I believe his extensive management experience in the  private sector and his understanding of the challenges faced by workers  and businesses alike will equip him well for the job of leading the  Department of Commerce.   This large Department, which has 12 different bureaus and nearly  47,000 employees located in all 50 States and around the world,  oversees a diverse array of issues, from trade to fishery management  and from weather forecasting to the Census Bureau. Mr. Ross's  experience turning around businesses should help them anticipate and  mitigate the risk of major programs like FirstNet, the independent  authority charged with creating a nationwide broadband network for  first responders and the acquisition of critical weather satellites by  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.   I would also like to underscore that the collaboration between the  public and private sectors is one of the hallmarks of the Department's  work, as exemplified by the ongoing development of cyber security best  practices and standards, which the Commerce Committee has strongly  endorsed. I look forward to Mr. Ross continuing his collaboration and  strengthening it where necessary.   I believe Mr. Ross's business know-how and intelligence make him an  excellent candidate to serve as the next Secretary of Commerce. I  strongly support his nomination. I hope my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle will support his nomination as well. It is high time we got  this position filled and got this experienced person--someone who has a  wide range of know-how all across the business sector and our economy-- into a position where he can make a difference in helping to create  jobs and grow this economy for our country.   I see that my colleague from Florida, Senator Nelson, the ranking  Democrat on the Commerce Committee, is here as well. I would love to  yield the floor to him and hear what he has to say about this  nomination.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                            United Steelworkers,                                    Pittsburgh, PA, January 9, 2017.      United States Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator: On behalf of the United Steelworkers (USW)       representing hundreds of thousands of American workers, we       urge you to support Wilbur Ross, Chairman and Chief Strategy       Officer of WL Ross & Co., LLC, to serve as Secretary of the       U.S. Department of Commerce.        Mr. Ross has shown a deep commitment to the future of our       domestic manufacturing sector. Many of us have seen firsthand       how he has worked to keep production and manufacturing jobs       here in the U.S. The USW worked directly with Mr. Ross to       save thousands of jobs in the steel industry at a time of       crisis. In fact, there are now thousands of our members in       the steel and auto parts sectors that are working because of       our ability to work together to save a critical piece of       America's industrial base.        He knows what it takes to get the economy back on track,       create jobs, and keep jobs from leaving the United States and       build a framework so that American workers and companies are       competitive and innovative in the 21st Century. There is much       work to be done to restore America's manufacturing base and       the good jobs it supports. As Secretary, Wilbur Ross will be       someone who has a deep understanding of the challenges this       vital sector faces.        We urge the Senate to move swiftly on his nomination and       look forward to working with him to create more jobs for       American workers.            Sincerely,                                                     Leo W. Gerard,                                       USW International President.     Madam President, 2 weeks ago, major health insurer Humana  announced its decision to completely withdraw from ObamaCare exchanges  for 2018. The company decision was not particularly surprising. Humana  had already sharply reduced its participation in the exchanges for  2017, but the decision did confirm yet again that President Obama's  healthcare law is on its last legs.   Choices on the exchanges declined sharply for 2017 as insurer after  insurer cut back on participation. Nearly one-third of U.S. counties  have just one choice of insurer on their exchange for 2017. Meanwhile  premiums on the exchanges are soaring. Exchange premiums increased a  staggering 25 percent on average for 2017. That is a 25-percent premium  increase for just 1 year. How many working families can afford a 25- percent increase in their healthcare premiums for 1 year?   Things are even worse in some States. Seven States saw an average  premium increase of more than 50 percent for 1 year. It is no surprise  that many people who have ObamaCare insurance have found they can't  afford to actually use their plan. Well, Democrats can talk about  coverage all they want, but coverage doesn't mean much if you can't  afford to actually take advantage of it.   It is time to give the American people some relief. Over the next few  weeks, Congress will continue with the process of repealing and  replacing ObamaCare. Our priority is replacing ObamaCare with  personalized, patient-centered healthcare that is affordable for every  American. ObamaCare was supposed to lower healthcare costs for  Americans, but it has spectacularly failed to do so. Our reform efforts  will focus on keeping healthcare affordable, including increasing  competition, expanding innovation, and increasing flexibility.   ObamaCare has defaulted to a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes  to healthcare. That means that many Americans have found themselves  paying for healthcare that they don't need or want.   We need much more flexibility in insurance plans. A thriving  healthcare system would offer a wide variety of choices that would  allow Americans to pick a plan that is tailored to their needs. We also  need to give Americans the tools to better manage their healthcare and  to control costs. Along with keeping healthcare affordable, we are  going to focus on restoring decisionmaking power to the American  people.   ObamaCare has put Washington bureaucrats in charge of healthcare  decisions that should be made by individuals in consultation with their  doctor. We are going to move control away from Washington and give it  back to individuals. We are also going to ensure that States have the  power to innovate and embrace healthcare solutions that work for  individuals and employers in their States.   Our healthcare system wasn't perfect before ObamaCare--nobody is  denying that--but ObamaCare has just made things worse. The American  people are ready for healthcare reform that actually works, and that is  exactly what Republicans are going to give them.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
