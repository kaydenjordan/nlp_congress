 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the  inhumane treatment of immigrants at detention centers around the  country.   Recently exposed documents paint a gruesome picture of ICE custodians  abusing the practice of solitary confinement on immigration detainees.  Often these detainees have not violated rules or shown dangerous  behavior, but, in some instances, are being held in isolation because  they are disabled or because they identify as gay.   Even under ICE's own guidelines, solitary confinement is a serious  step that requires careful consideration of all alternatives. Yet, ICE  is using this practice as a tool of first resort, not last resort. One  detainee noted that the strain of the isolation made him lose his mind.   These reported cases reveal what we already feared: that this  administration is committed to widespread abuse of human beings simply  because of who they are and where they come from.   Mr. Speaker, I learned at an early age that we are all God's  children. This is not the way to treat God's children.  [[Page H4401]]                                ____________________
