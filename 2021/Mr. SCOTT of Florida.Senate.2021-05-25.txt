 Madam President, I rise today in remembrance  and recognition of the tremendous sacrifice of America's fallen  military members who have given their life in service to our Nation and  defense of our freedoms.   As we commemorate Memorial Day this year on Monday, May 31, we honor  and remember the brave men and women whose lives have been lost in  defense of the freedoms we hold dear. Without their incredible  sacrifice, our Nation and the very ideals of democracy, freedom, and  liberty we so proudly represent would not have endured.   On this occasion, as we express our Nation's gratitude to our fallen  heroes, we remember the words written by President Abraham Lincoln to  Mrs. Lydia Bixby following the loss of her five sons. In his letter,  dated November 21, 1864, President Lincoln wrote, ``I pray that our  Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave  you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn  pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the  altar of freedom.''   Our Nation can never fully repay the debt of gratitude owed to these  fallen heroes and their families. Each year, on Memorial Day, we pledge  that their service and sacrifice will never be forgotten.   We also take this opportunity to thank the many men, women, and  organizations that work every day to support our military and veteran  community, as well as the families of fallen heroes. I especially would  like to recognize the work of American Legion Post 135, in my hometown  of Naples, FL. The work American Legion Post 135 and the many other  veterans and military organizations do to support our families and  communities is greatly appreciated.   I ask that all Floridians and all Americans join me today in pausing  for a moment to reflect on the sacrifice of America's great heroes and  all who have made the ultimate sacrifice in service to us and this  great Nation.                            ____________________
