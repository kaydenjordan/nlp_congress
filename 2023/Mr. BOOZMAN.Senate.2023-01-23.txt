 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 1973  Vaster High School basketball team on the 50th anniversary of its  overall state championship game performance and the way it continues to  inspire many Arkansans to this day.   From the small, rural Jefferson County community of Moscow, and with  a first-year head coach, the Vaster basketball team had a remarkable  season, earning the Class B title and advancing to the finals in the  overall tournament. Vaster defeated bigger and better teams to earn the  right to play in the overall championship contest against the  powerhouse players of Little Rock Central High School.   The Vaster squad was certainly the underdog, but they played hard and  kept the game close through late in the fourth quarter. In the final  moments, they came up short, but despite the crushing defeat, the  Vaster players held their heads high and fans rallied around these  young men who proudly represented their community. They revealed wisdom  beyond their years in learning from the loss, taking pride in all they  had achieved and still displaying true sportsmanship.   Stories like theirs bring communities together and create memories  and friendships that last a lifetime. Their performance at the end of  the 1973 season has forged a bond between the players, coaches, and  spectators that still sparks passion today.   I applaud the coaches and players for their ability to show such grit  and resilience on the court and grace in defeat. By overcoming  challenges they faced along their hard-fought journey, the Vaster team  demonstrated the power of uniting to achieve a common goal. Even 50  years later, this game represents something bigger than just basketball  in the lesson it provides--anyone can face long odds, and even suffer a  defeat, but still be considered a winner.                            ____________________
