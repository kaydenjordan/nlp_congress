 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chairwoman, there are many problems in our  healthcare system. We have heard about a number of them today, but we  are here for one simple, specific reason, because of the guidance that  the administration issued last year that allows States to expand the  availability and duration of junk, short-term insurance plans.   Now, the administration and its defenders will not say this because  it has become politically impossible to do so, but these plans are  cheaper precisely because they deny coverage to people with preexisting  conditions and for, what any reasonable person would agree are  essential benefits, like maternity care and prescription drugs.   That is what they mean when they use the euphemism ``flexibility.''  Will these plans take hold? Here is what happens, in plain language, if  you have a preexisting condition. You have a choice. Either stay in  your ACA plan and see your premiums rise as healthy people move to  cheaper, junk insurance, or you sign up for a junk plan yourself and  risk getting gouged when the services you need aren't covered.   You end up with a two-tiered healthcare system in America: one for  healthy people, and one for sick people. Now, the underlying bill  rescinds that guidance. The amendment I have submitted would prohibit  the administration from taking any other action that would reduce the  affordability of comprehensive coverage for Americans with preexisting  conditions.                                time  1700    Now, this would not in any way prevent States from using section 1332  waivers to make healthcare better and more affordable. Many States, as  we have heard, have done so in ways that have lowered health insurance  premiums without, in any way, undermining protections for people with  preexisting conditions.   Yes, section 1332 has a clear directive that States must maintain the  benefits, affordability, and coverage provided by the ACA, but it is  clear that the administration has disregarded these standards and could  do so again to remove protections for vulnerable groups, to promote  expansion of health plans that are not compliant with the ACA, and to  take other steps that would increase costs, especially for women and  older adults.   This amendment, along with the overall bill, makes sure that we keep  our promise to the American people. It makes clear that, when we say we  are going to protect everyone with a preexisting condition, that is not  an empty slogan that means whatever we want it to mean. Those words  mean something, that every American deserves quality health insurance,  and no American should be forced to pay more for good coverage because  of a preexisting health problem.   Madam Chair, that is what H.R. 986 and my amendment guarantee. I urge  my colleagues to support both, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I will close by saying there is no  question whatsoever what the administration intends to do. They have  been trying from day one, from January 2017, to repeal the Affordable  Care Act and its essential protections for the American people.   The only thing that has changed is that it has become politically  impossible for anyone in America to say that  [[Page H3543]]  you are opposed to protecting people with preexisting conditions, and  so a war against healthcare protections is being covered up by a war  against the English language.   Everyone says, ``We are for preexisting conditions,'' yet every  single step the administration and its supporters take is designed to  weaken those protections. This amendment and the underlying bill say  that you can't do that anymore. They guarantee, going forward, that the  ACA's protections are respected and that any experimentation by the  States will have to be consistent with those protections.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues' support for the amendment and the  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
