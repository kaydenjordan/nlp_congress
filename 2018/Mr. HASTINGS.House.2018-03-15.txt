 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I thank the gentleman from Colorado for yielding me the customary 30  minutes for debate.   Madam Speaker, today's bills would roll back important consumer and  financial protections by undermining the effectiveness of financial  regulators' ability to conduct important stress tests, create  unnecessary hurdles for regulators to contend with in the future, and  limit the Federal Reserve Board's flexibility in determining the health  and stability of our financial institutions.   Madam Speaker, including these two measures, the Rules Committee will  have considered 30 Financial Services bills this Congress, 15 of which  were considered under closed rules. Those 15 are part of a much larger  closed process that Republican leadership has wielded with brute force  to push through the legislative priorities of powerful special  interests. Indeed, this week, we witnessed the 73rd closed rule for  this Congress, a style of legislating that is as brazen as it is  broken.   This critique of the majority's reliance on a closed process is not  just some technical point, but, rather, an important one; because when  you close out those on your side of the aisle who are not in leadership  and those on our side of the aisle from offering amendments, you do not  simply silence us, you silence the American people.   And what has this process wrought for the American people?   Well, let's take a look. Bear with me because it is a doozy   First, we witnessed the majority--in what I believe was the most  chaotic and convoluted process during my 25 years in the House of  Representatives--try to take away healthcare from 23 million Americans.  [[Page H1620]]    When they couldn't get that done, the majority then honed in on a tax  giveaway to corporate America and the ultrawealthy not only at the  expense of the middle class, but also to the detriment of future  generations, as that bill will explode our national debt by an  estimated $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years.   Just last week, we watched as our Republican friends attacked Clean  Air Act protections to give a handout to specified industries to emit  more pollution into the air.   Is this what my Republican friends were sent here to do: To take away  healthcare from millions of people? To remove important environmental  protections that keep America's air and water safe? To limit the amount  of stress tests the Federal Reserve Board should run on our biggest  financial institutions so that we can avoid another financial meltdown?   Footnote right there. If these stress tests are so bothersome to  these big old banks, how is it that they are making all of this big old  money?   They don't seem to have any hindrance when it comes to sopping up the  resources of this country.   Madam Speaker, my constituents haven't been calling me or writing or  emailing my office asking that we consider or pass any of the measures  the House will consider this week. On the other hand, they have written  to my office asking what Republican leadership is going to do about  addressing the gun violence epidemic ravaging our country. I was  meeting in my office just an hour ago with officials from Tamarac,  Florida, and we received an alert that two schools near the Parkland  school were on lockdown.   My constituents have asked about what Republican leadership will do  to ensure that the DACA recipients have a pathway to citizenship. They  have asked what Republican leadership will do to address our Nation's  needs for serious and sustained investments in our infrastructure.  Unfortunately, the answer is little to nothing.   Footnote right there. When I came to this Congress 25 years ago,  there were 14,000 bridges in the United States of America in need of a  repair. Today, there are 56,000 bridges in this country in need of  repair.   Madam Speaker, since 2014, there have been over 1,360 mass shootings  in America. Let me let that soak in. Since 2014, there have been over  1,360 mass shootings in America.   In 2018 alone, nearly 500 teens and over 100 children have been  killed or injured by guns. Last month, 14 students and 3 teachers were  gunned down at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School by a former student  using an AR-15 that he bought legally.   And just 2 days ago, American citizens took to the grounds of this  Capitol and placed 7,000 pairs of shoes on the front lawn here at the  Capitol. Citizens placed a pair of shoes for every child killed by gun  violence since the Sandy Hook massacre. Regardless of your views on  this subject, please let that number sink in: 7,000 pairs of shoes.   Madam Speaker, we should not be considering a bill to reform the  Financial Stability Oversight Council. We should not be considering a  measure that limits the frequency of stress tests on our financial  institutions.   What we should be doing is considering a ban on bump stocks. We  should be considering a ban on weapons of war. We should be considering  protective orders allowing people to petition a court to temporarily  remove firearms from an individual in crisis.   We should be considering a measure to provide for comprehensive  background checks, and maybe this time try not to sabotage it by  attaching a controversial concealed carry provision to the measure.   Madam Speaker, the Republican majority is also ignoring the plight of  22,000 Dreamers who have lost their protected status since President  Trump ended DACA, and the other hundreds of thousands of Dreamers who  remain in legal limbo. Every day, 120 of them lose their status.   Madam Speaker, 25 times--25 times--House Republicans blocked a vote  on the bipartisan Dream Act, which protects innocent Dreamers from this  cruel Republican inaction. Every day of inaction on the part of my  friends across the aisle means another day that families are needlessly  made to live under the threat of being torn apart.   Madam Speaker, all across America, our infrastructure is in need of  repair and greater investment. Every Member in the House of  Representatives likely received a visit from members of the National  League of Cities around the United States of America, and every one of  them is talking about infrastructure needs. Every one of them. Yet the  Republican majority has stalled on presenting a single infrastructure  bill.   Even President Donald John Trump's infrastructure plan faces an  obstacle: his own budget cuts.   President Trump claimed the Federal Government was investing $1.5  trillion to our infrastructure, but, in reality, the White House's plan  actually only proposed $200 billion in Federal funding. At the same  time, he proposed slashing critical infrastructure funding to the  Department of Transportation by nearly 20 percent, and the Army Corps  of Engineers' budget by 22 percent.   How does that work, Madam Speaker?   The truth is, it doesn't.   Madam Speaker, we stand here today with a to-do list a mile long and  an ocean wide. I suggest the following: that we stop being forced to  spend our time checking off items on the wish lists of powerful  corporate special interests, and we turn to the business of the  American people--Republican and Democrat, independent, conservative,  and liberal American people.   For starters, we could work together to end our country's gun  violence epidemic, bring relief to DACA recipients, and bring thought- out and serious legislation to the floor that will invest in our  infrastructure.                                time  1245    Now, I am sure that my friend is either thinking or likely to say  that we are here about financial services measures, and he is correct.  That is what these rules call for. But what these rules are about, in  the final analysis, is a diversion from things that we know are more  critical.   Why, then, are we not dealing with prioritized matters that we know  that the American people want, rather than those that the corporate  greedy, needy, big old businesses want?   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, it has been one month since the tragic events at  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The district  that I am privileged to serve is adjacent to that school, and I have  two of my remaining cousins in life that live in Parkland, and I live  within 30 minutes of where that school is situated.   A gunman killed 17 innocent students and teachers. Since that  heartbreaking day, Americans from coast to coast have raised their  voices and said: Enough is enough.   Yesterday, thousands of students from across our country walked out  of their classrooms to protest this body's inaction. Two days ago, as I  said earlier, 7,000 empty pairs of children's shoes were laid on the  Capitol lawn to commemorate all the children who have been tragically  killed by gun violence since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School  shooting. I might add, not only at schools, but in Nevada, in  California, in Texas, in South Carolina, in churches, in Orlando bars,  these mass shootings are occurring. People don't think it is an  epidemic.   My friends on the other side of the aisle did bring a bill to the  floor yesterday that I voted for that was also cojoined by my friend,  Ted Deutch, whose district is where the Parkland school is. He, too,  was involved with that legislation, but it was done to improve school  security. Much more needs to be done, and it needs to be done now.   So, today, I offer my colleagues yet another opportunity to show the  American people that they value their safety and the safety of their  children over the lobbying of the National Rifle Association and the  gun manufacturers.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to bring up four commonsense gun safety bills: H.R. 4240, the  Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act; H.R. 3464,  the Background Check Completion Act; H.R. 2598, the Gun Violence  Restraining Order Act; and H.R. 1478, the Gun Violence Research Act.   These bills would close the dangerous gun show and internet sale  background check loopholes, prevent the sale of guns without a  completed background check, ensure that people who are a danger to  themselves or to others can be prevented from possessing a gun, and  lift the prohibition on government-sponsored scientific research on  causes of gun violence.   Let me send a message to gun owners in this country. I own a gun. I  believe in the Second Amendment. I don't want anybody to take anybody's  gun; but nobody can persuade me that anybody, other than military and  police officers, are deserving of having in their possession automatic  weapons. I believe every American feels the same way.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.     Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), my very good friend that I knew before we  came to Congress together, and the distinguished assistant Democratic  leader.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Carbajal), a member of the Armed Services and Budget  Committees of this House of Representatives.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Mrs. Murphy), my colleague who represents my home area  that I was born in, a member of the Armed Services and Small Business  Committees.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I would advise the previous speaker that I knew Jay  Dickey, I served with him here, as did many other Members; and my  understanding is that, before his death, he indicated that he thought  that his measure that has carried forth was a mistake.   Madam Speaker, my friends across the aisle have clearly demonstrated  where their priorities lie. And for the benefit of the American public,  if it looks like we are ships passing in the night, then doubtless we  are when it comes to priorities.   I would ask anyone in this country and anyone in this House: Which do  you think should be a priority? Addressing the gun epidemic in this  country or bailing out big old banks with more opportunities to  potentially carry us to yet another financial disaster by simply  disallowing them having to undergo the stress test that they need?   I listened to my friend when he talked about stress tests, that they  don't know how they are going to be tested or what part they are going  to--well, my goodness gracious. Kids in school don't know what is going  to be on the test; so why should the bank know what is going to be on  the test?   But in the deal, when it goes down, whether they know or not, they  still are making a ton of money; and, therefore, the regulations aren't  affecting them in the way that we make it sound here. And there again,  I ask the question: Which is your priority, America? Whether we address  gun violence in this country and the epidemic that it is or whether we  address these financial services regulatory measures that are more for  corporate America than they are for you?    Americans working hard to make ends meet need answers--working hard  to get their kids off to school, working hard to make sure they can put  food on the table at the end of the day, working hard to ensure that  they can put a little money aside for their child's education, working  hard to ensure that they can put some retirement money aside.   Footnote there. What are we doing to protect the pensions of people  in this country? We are not addressing that. We are addressing big  banks.  [[Page H1623]]    That they don't have to keep working two or three jobs for the rest  of their lives, that is what Americans are looking for.   Well, if they are working hard, then we need to be working hard, and  we need to be working hard for them. It is with their interests in mind  that we are sent here, and we do a disservice to them and to our  country when we abandon that responsibility and consider bills like  those put before us today rather than addressing the many, many needs  that this country has.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
