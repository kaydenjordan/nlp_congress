 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Williams, for  introducing H.R. 4324, the Strengthening Oversight of Iran's Access to  Finance Act. This act is needed.   Tonight, we are not here to rehash the failings of the JCPOA, but we  are really here to honor Secretary Kerry's commitment of oversight of  Iran outside that agreement. He made it quite clear to Congress in his  briefings that we would monitor the world's largest exporter of terror  around the world; that we would do everything outside the agreement to  enforce sanctions; that we would not stop reviewing their behavior.   This piece of legislation comes at an important time, as the Trump  administration is taking significant steps to protect our homeland by  reviewing actions around rogue regimes and sponsors of terror around  the world, including Iran.   Now, my friend from Washington brought up the subject of the American  worker, and, of course, we all are blessed by the brilliance and  success of Boeing. We couldn't come to our jobs without them.   But there are 5,000 airlines in the world, Mr. Speaker. There are  10,000 Boeing aircraft in service, and there are 5,700 airplanes on  order from the Boeing corporation to help make up that $41 billion of  annual revenue.   The question here is not about selling airplanes, the question here  is about protecting the homeland and interests of our country around  the world.   Unfortunately, civil aviation is commingled with military Quds Force  action; not just in what has been said tonight about transporting  military action to Syria, supporting a war that has killed some 500,000  people, but what about Boeing transport from Damascus to Caracas?                                time  1815    What about the Boeing aircraft operated by the Iranian regime back  and forth between Russia and Iran, back and forth between Tehran and  Damascus, between Damascus and Venezuela?   It is not just the civilian aircraft, Mr. Speaker, and that is why we  want to be alert, and our American citizens need to know if their bank  deposits are being used to extend credit to a regime that seeks  pleasure in murdering innocent people, murdering our men and women in  uniform and even innocent civilians in their own country.   We may differ on our views on the JCPOA, but we can all agree that  nothing in the nuclear deal prevents the sharing of information between  an administration and this Congress about financing aircraft for the  world's largest state supporter of terrorism. That is what this piece  of legislation is trying to achieve. That is what Mr. Williams' point  is in bringing it to the floor, and I appreciate his thoughtful work to  implement this much-needed policy and to help keep the citizens in my  district safe from Iran's global terror advance.
