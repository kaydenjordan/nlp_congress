 Madam Speaker, I rise to deliver a clear message: The  United States must stand shoulder to shoulder with the State of Israel.  The choice for the politicians in this Chamber should be simple.   On one side, you have Hamas, a terrorist organization that fired  thousands of rockets at civilians in Israel. Their founding charter  even calls for Israel's destruction.   On the other side, you have Israel, the only democracy in the Middle  East. They are our longtime friend and ally, and they are a force for  stability in the region.   The deescalation of this conflict should begin and end with Hamas.  They must stop their terrorist attacks on Israeli citizens immediately.   Until they do, Israel has every right to defend themselves, and the  United States of America should have their back.                            ____________________
