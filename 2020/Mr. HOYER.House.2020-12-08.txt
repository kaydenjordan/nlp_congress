 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank both Mr. Smith, the chairman  of the committee, and Mr. Thornberry, who I have had the opportunity to  work with through the years. Both of them are leaders who have focused  on America's well-being, America's national security, and the well- being of our troops who serve in uniform and support those who are at  the point of the spear.   I believe that we have and our country has been advantaged by the  leadership of both and by the fact that they have been able to work  together collegially to accomplish objectives on behalf of the country,  not on behalf of party.   So, I thank both Mr. Smith, the chairman, and Mr. Thornberry, the  ranking member who was the chairman. They have both held the  responsible positions of leading this committee and its work.   I rise in strong support of this year's authorization bill. Let me  say at the outset, as the majority leader, I schedule legislation for  the floor. Mr. Smith and I have had long conversations, and Mr.  Thornberry and I have had conversations in the past.   This bill should not be on the floor in December. This bill has  historically passed in May through the committee and has been to the  floor before we break for the August break. I have had discussions with  Mr. Smith and will tell successors on the Defense Committee that it  will be my intention to urge the committee to mark up its bill and have  it ready to report to the floor by May.   Now, there have been exigencies from time to time which made that  impossible. That was certainly the case when the government was shut  down, and it has been this case through the pandemic, which has  obviously slowed up our work as well.   But I am hopeful, Mr. Speaker, that I will be able to bring this  bill, at the instance of the chairman and the ranking member, to the  floor either in late May or very early June, the first week in June  before, frankly, we get to the appropriations process, which is really  how the process ought to work, as opposed to the other way around.   Mr. Speaker, this is a major piece of legislation, one of the most  important we pass each year and one, frankly, that we need to pass each  year.   I just said we need to do it in a timely fashion, but it is never too  late to do the right thing. What we are doing today is the right thing,  passing a bill which provides for the security of our country.   Again, I want to thank both of those leaders who I have referenced.  This conference report will ensure that our men and women in uniform  can continue to protect our Nation and meet global challenges.   Now, I hope that President Trump does sign this bill. He ought to  sign this bill. This is about our national security. It is not about  partisanship. Taking issue with one provision or another in such a  large and important bill is no reason to block the whole of it. That is  particularly true when this bill would take a major step forward to  right a historic wrong.   But let me say, with respect to a veto, I hope the President does not  veto this. I hope that we have, as previous speakers have said,  overwhelming bipartisan support on both sides of the aisle.   Of course, there are specifics in a bill this large where one can  say: ``I don't like that provision.'' Well, I don't think there is a  bill that you can't have a significant number or one of us say: ``I  wish that provision were different.'' But we ought not to have our  focus on the doughnut hole. We ought to have our focus on the doughnut,  on the whole of what makes this bill so critically important for our  country.   In our founding document, it states that all are ``created equal,  that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights,  that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.''   It said: ``All men are created equal.'' None of us would argue that  all men should be exclusively perceived as being created equal. We  believe that all human beings are created equal, whether they are men  or they are women, or they are Black or they are White, or they are  yellow or they are red. Whatever the differences may be, it is our  perception and articulation in this Declaration that it is God who  created the soul that is colorless, that is genderless, that is of no  one nation.   It is the soul that is imbued in us, as we say in our Declaration, by  our creator. While these rights may have been self-evident, I tell  people, they are not self-executing. It fell to future generations of  Americans to secure them in practice.   Less than a century after our Nation's founding, it was torn apart by  a Civil War, with Southern States waging war to protect the evil  institution of slavery. All of us would agree that one human being  owning another human being is untenable. But it is what we fought a war  over.   The names of those who fought violently to perpetuate slavery and who  rebelled against the United States do not deserve the honor of being  associated with the installations housing, training, and equipping  those who serve today under our flag of freedom and democracy.   Now, without getting into that argument, it would have been perverse  to drop an amendment adopted by 93 percent of the Senate, not because  they voted on the individual amendment but because it was included in  the bill and 93 percent of the Members of the United States Senate  voted for it.    It simply says what is the right thing to do: remove a name from a  base on which an African-American sailor, an African-American soldier,  an African-American marine, an African-American coastguardsman serve.  An African American of whatever service, at whatever time, should not  have to serve on a base named for somebody who believed that person  ought to be enslaved.   I congratulate both the chairman and the ranking member for making  sure that that language was kept in. I know the President has said he  doesn't like that language, but as I said, I am convinced that any one  of us could point to something in this bill we don't like. But we need  to keep our eye on the ball, the national security of our country.   This National Defense Authorization Act requires the military to  remove the names. I think that is appropriate, and I congratulate them  for leaving that language whole.   I had made it clear that I felt this bill needed to pass. But I felt  that if that provision were left out, it would be inappropriate to put  it on the floor.   Additionally, I also want to mention that this conference report will  ensure that all Federal employees can access 12 weeks of paid parental  leave. That is now the practice in most, if not all, certainly, but  many of the largest corporations in our country. Why? Because they  believe it is good for their employees. They believe it is good for  their children. They believe it is good for America. We have now  adopted that, and I praise the committee for doing so.   Unfortunately, some Federal employees were left out last year when we  enacted paid parental leave, and we have now included them. Today, we  are fixing that and making sure that it applies to all Federal workers.   Mr. Speaker, it is also important that we are able to include  language in the conference report that will close corporate loopholes,  which were referred to by Ms. Waters, the chair of the Financial  Services Committee, eliminating loopholes which allowed  [[Page H6928]]  dark money to enter the U.S. financial system from Russia and other  malign actors.   That beneficial ownership provision is a major win in the fight  against foreign kleptocrats and oligarchs seeking to undermine  America's security and fund those who wish to do us harm.   Congratulations to Mr. Smith, congratulations to the ranking member,  and congratulations to the committee for that.   Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity today to do right by our  servicemembers and by the principles they uphold. Let us do so by  passing this conference report and doing our part, as President Lincoln  said, to bind up the Nation's wounds.   I urge all of my colleagues, not because they will come to the  conclusion that this is a perfect bill--there are no perfect bills. But  it is a bill essential for the defense of our values, our people, and  our land. This bill needs to pass overwhelmingly.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote for it.    Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Chairmen Jerry Nadler and  Hank Johnson, Rep. Doug Collins, Ranking Members Jim Jordan and Martha  Robey, Director of the Administrative Office of the Courts Jim Duff,  and their respective staffs for their efforts  [[Page H7020]]  to develop and improve this important legislation. A number of  improvements have been made over the last several days to the Open  Courts Act as reported out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote in  September. This bill would mandate the development of a modern public  records access system that would also relieve the general public, small  law firms, and other modest users of having to pay fees to access  public documents filed in federal courts. Among other priorities, the  bill would provide for the adoption of a progressive fee schedule  applying to aggregators and large law firms, which are the biggest  consumers of public court records and use these materials for profit- seeking ends.   I recognize the press of other business may prevent this bill from  being enacted before the end of this Congress. Whatever course awaits  the Open Courts Act after today's passage, I look forward to continuing  working with all the parties to react to any new information that we  may receive and continue refining the bill in mutual discussions.    Mr. Speaker, we will, in short time, remember our friend  Paul Sarbanes, but another friend of mine, whom I have not known as  long but I have known well, is the gentlewoman from Montgomery,  Alabama, with whom I went on the pilgrimage sponsored by Faith and  Politics and led by our beloved John Lewis. She welcomed us so  graciously to Montgomery.   She is a graduate of NYU, a graduate of Stanford Law School, and is  extraordinarily proud of her father, the chief judge of the court of  appeals of their circuit. Her husband, Riley, and their two children I  have known, and they have joined us.   Regrettably, she will be leaving the Congress at the end of this  year. I say regrettably because she was a Member of Congress who worked  across the aisle and who worked positively and constructively on behalf  of her district, on behalf of her State, and on behalf of her country.  We will miss her.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Alabama.                                time  1915     Mr. Speaker, I know that I speak for every Member of the  House, particularly those of us who have had the privilege of knowing  Martha Roby well and spending time with her, she is a decent and  good representative. She is a wonderful representative of her State,  and she has made this House a little better, and this country a little  better, and we thank her for her service.                  Honoring the Life of Senator Paul Sarbanes     Mr. Speaker, we were saddened to learn the other night  when John called me and told me that his father had passed away. John  Sarbanes, of course, is our colleague. He told me of the passing of a  wonderful human being, with a great intellect, a wonderful wit, a sense  of decency, great integrity and a sense of country, Paul Sarbanes.   He was a gifted legislator, a wise adviser to all who sought his  council. He brought great courage to his efforts for the people and  great compassion for all who struggled to survive and succeed in their  pursuit of happiness. I know that all of us serving in this House  expresses our heartfelt condolences to his entire family, including his  son, our colleague, John Sarbanes, a son of whom his father was  extraordinarily proud.   I went with John to see his dad not so long ago, and I was so glad I  took the opportunity when I was in Baltimore to see him. A number of us  had a wonderful opportunity to serve with Senator Sarbanes in the  Congress. I had the privilege of serving with him for 4 years in the  Maryland General Assembly and for 30 years in the Congress of the  United States.   Mr. Speaker, my friendship with Paul went back to the time when we  were elected to the Maryland General Assembly in the same freshman  class of 1966, before you were born, or close.   Paul was elected to the House, and I was elected to the State Senate.  Over the years, we came to look differently at which body was more  important. He originally served in the House in Maryland, and I served  in the Senate. We changed our perspective on which was the most  important body.   Serving together in the Maryland Congressional Delegation, we  continued our partnership working for the people of our State and  standing up for the principles we shared. And Paul was, at his core, a  man of principle. Raised with the ethics of his immigrant parents, the  foundation of his Greek Orthodox faith, and the values of his Baltimore  neighborhood.   Paul believed his first responsibility as a legislator was to ensure  that government was always accountable to the people it served. He  never wavered in that mission. When he saw evidence of the destruction  of justice by President Nixon, he was the first to file Articles of  Impeachment.   In the Senate, he was an architect of what is now known as the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which sought to protect investors from fraud in our  financial markets, and to protect consumers as well. Transparency,  accountability, and ethics were the watchwords of Paul Sarbanes.   He was also a champion for a cleaner and healthier Chesapeake Bay. He  understood that the bay is one of Maryland's and America's greatest  treasures and most extraordinary asset.   Mr. Speaker, I was proud to partner with him on efforts to protect  the bay, as well as on so many other issues important to our State,  including robust investment in education, protecting and enhancing  civil rights, and making quality healthcare more affordable and  accessible.   Paul Sarbanes will be remembered as a man of substance and principle,  of decency and warmth, of insight and vision. He left an indelible mark  on this institution in which he served, and on the millions of people  in Maryland and across our country, whose lives he enriched.   As dean of the Maryland Delegation, it is my honor to open this hour  of tribute and to yield to my friend and colleague, his son, of whom,  as I said, he was so very proud, and we share his father's pride in his  service in this institution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the son of a great man, who that  great man would say is a great son. He loved John, but he respected  John. He believed that John was enhancing the Sarbanes legacy, and he  was right.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, with the  expectation that Mr. Trone from our State will continue to recognize  other Members from our delegation who want to speak.                            ____________________
