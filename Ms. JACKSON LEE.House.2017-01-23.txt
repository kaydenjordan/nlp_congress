 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 511, the  ``Power and Security Systems Act of 2017, which will revise energy  conservation standards for devices operating in standby mode.   In the early 1970s, I recall, as many of my colleagues do, the impact  to our nation's economy when OPEC nations withheld oil from the United  States causing one of the greatest peace-time energy shortages in  United States history.   One of the remedial steps taken by the Carter Administration was the  promulgation of regulations that required large appliances and  equipment that used electricity to default to a power down mode when  not in use.   Today, we take for granted that machines power down when not in use,  but this one change in energy policy over the last 4o years has saved  taxpayers, which includes businesses and private homes, billions of  dollars in energy costs.  [[Page H568]]    This was only one policy solution that was used to reduce our  nation's dependence on foreign oil so that energy could go to vital  services like fuel for electricity generation, gasoline, heating fuels,  and diesel oil.   H.R. 511, the bill before us would extend energy conservation to  digital technology that can operate in standby mode.   Most digital device technology manufactures already provide sleep  mode on their devices to assist their users in conserving power on  cellphones, smartphones, MP3 players, e-book readers, as well as  desktop and laptop computers.   Today, 68 percent of U.S. adults own a smartphone, up from 35 percent  in 2011, and tablet computer ownership has edged up to 45 percent among  adults, according to newly released survey data from the Pew Research  Center.   Considering not just smartphones, but all types of mobile phones, Pew  notes that cellphones continue to top of the list.   Roughly nine-in-ten American adults or 92 percent own a mobile phone  of some kind.   Although these mobile devices are ubiquitous today, the share of  adults who own one has risen substantially since 2004.   Smartphone ownership is nearing the saturation point with some  groups: 1. 86 percent of those ages 18-29; 2. 83 percent of those ages  30-49; and 3. 87 percent of those living in households earning $75,000  and up annually own smartphones.   These facts highlight the importance of energy conservation for  mobile communication users.   The battery life for these devices is limited and without power they  are of no use to the user.   This bill will help users remain connected as long as possible  because the energy consumption on their cellphones and other digital  devices will be minimized when they are not in use.   Energy conservation will also assist consumers during times when  power outages may occur due to weather or other electricity disruption.   The longer power life for cellphones will benefit consumers by  reducing the amount of electricity needed to recharge their personal  devices.   This bill will also benefit businesses that often have many computers  that when in use can consume electricity if left on after business  hours--especially over weekends.   For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  511.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 587, the  ``Fair Ratepayer Accountability, Transparency, and Efficiency Standards  Act'' (Fair RATES Act), which amends the Federal Power Act to permit  administrative and judicial review of any rate change filed by a public  utility that takes effect without the approval of the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission (FERC).   The need for this change became evident in the wake of a New England  Forward Capacity Market Auction in 2014, which occurred at a time when  FERC only had 4 Commissioners.   When the New England Forward Capacity Market Auction issue was  addressed by FERC, the Commissioners split evenly over the question of  whether the auction results were just and reasonable.   Since FERC did not disapprove the auction results, wholesale  electricity prices in New England increased dramatically; and   So, while rates went up, none of the affected parties could challenge  the decision or resulting rate increase, and, therefore, no rehearing  or judicial review was possible.   H.R. 587 provides those who want to challenge similar rulings or non- decisions by FERC the ability to challenge the decision  administratively or in the courts.   The bill ensures that stakeholders have recourse when a non-decision  by FERC has very real consequences for consumers, producers and others.   This bill would also improve the process by which FERC votes are  reconsidered.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 587.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 588,  ``Securing Access to Networks in Disaster Act'', which requires the  Federal Communications Commission to submit to Congress and publish on  the FCC website a study on the: public safety benefits, technical  feasibility, and cost of providing the public with access to 9-1-1  services during times of emergency when mobile service is unavailable.   As a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am well  aware of the importance of telephone service during disasters.   The Securing Access to Networks in Disasters (SANDy) Act seeks to  ensure the resiliency of the nation's communications networks during  emergencies.   Acquiring cellphone service during a massive natural or manmade  disaster is often difficult, if not impossible, and this is why this  piece of legislation is so essential.   During the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that destroyed the  World Trade Center in New York City, cellphone service was severely  disrupted, forcing many callers to repeatedly dial to get through to 9- 1-1 emergency services.   On that day, some of the most tragic, heart wrenching calls came from  those trapped in the Twin Towers.   It is not only during terrorist attacks that cellphone services are  severely disrupted, but also natural disasters such as Hurricane  Katrina, which claimed the lives of over 1,800 people.   The SANDy Act would ensure that during an emergency, consumers' cell  phones work on other carriers' networks if a consumer's own network  goes down.   H.R. 588 would give priority to calls to 9-1-1 services and emergency  alerts.   It also would increase coordination between wireless carriers,  utilities, and public safety officials by creating a directory of the  contact information for relevant disaster response officials.   The bill would require the FCC to report to Congress regarding  whether additional outage data should be provided in times of  emergency.   In addition, the bill requires the FCC to report to Congress on the  viability of providing 9-1-1 services over Wi-Fi hotspots during  emergencies.   H.R. 588 would be of immense benefit to the 18th Congressional  District and the greater Houston area.   On April 17-18, 2016, Houston experienced a historic flood event that  claimed the lives of eight people; damaged over 1,150 households;  disrupted hundreds of businesses; closed community centers, schools,  and places of worship due to flood waters.   On April 25, President Obama granted the request for federal  Individual Assistance for Harris County residences and business owners  who were affected by severe weather and flooding.   Unfortunately, that was not the end of the story of flooding in  Houston for 2016--in early June another record setting rainfall led to  catastrophic flooding throughout the Houston area.   I am grateful to President Obama and the great work of those at the  Department of Homeland Security who worked tirelessly to help people  after both 2016 flood events.   I spoke on the House Floor several times about the floods and the  suffering caused by the waters that came through our communities-- damaging homes, our schools, places of business, and our places of  worship.   The flooding problems in the Houston area are frequent, widespread,  and severe, with projects to reduce flood risks in place that are  valued at several billion dollars   In 2015, the Houston and surrounding area experienced widespread  historic flooding.   The importance of being able to contact emergency responders in the  case of natural disasters is critical in order to save the lives of  those directly affected by such events.   The SANDy Act would provide telecommunication access to victims of  natural and man-made disasters.   The SANDy Act amends the Stafford Act to ensure that all  communications providers:   1. Have the ability to access relevant disaster stricken areas during  emergencies to restore service; and   2. Are included in the universal credentialing program for essential  service providers   The SANDy Act would recognize the critical role that all  communications providers--broadcasters, cable, and telecommunications-- serve in emergencies, but most notably, the bill would ensure consumers  have access to wireless service even if their cellphone service  provider's wireless network goes down.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 588, the  ``Securing Access to Networks in Disaster Act.''    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 460, the  ``Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act of 2017'', which  amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require voice communications  that charge users to register with the FCC, and comply with service  quality standards to be established by the FCC.   The bill, should it become law, prohibits long-distance providers  from using an internet provider to transmit voice communications and  signals unless the intermediate provider is registered.   H.R. 460 would require the FCC to:   1. Ensure the integrity of voice communications to all customers in  the United States,   2. Prevent unjust or unreasonable discrimination across areas of the  United States in the delivery of voice communications; and  [[Page H586]]    3. Make a registry of intermediate providers publicly available on  the FCC website.   H.R. 460, the Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act of  2016, would seek to ensure that calls to Americans living in the rural  areas of our country actually make it through to the intended receiver.   Making sure a call goes through, regardless of where it is being  made, is fundamental to our communications system.   H.R. 460 would require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to  establish basic quality standards for providers that transmit voice  calls to consumers, among other things.   The Senate Commerce Committee adopted an amendment in the nature of a  substitute (AINS) that made the following changes:   1. Extends deadlines for service quality standards for intermediate  providers from 180 days to one year,   2. Exempts intermediate providers that have been certified as a safe  harbor provider; and   3. Amends the definition of intermediate provider.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 460, the  ``Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act of 2017.''    Mr. Speaker, having worked for the Southern  Christian Leadership Conference and been engaged with many of the foot  soldiers that studied under Dr. Martin Luther King, I love and cherish  nonviolent protests and the rights for people to petition.   I hold up a beautiful and powerful statement by way of a picture,  powerful together, as thousands marched across the Nation, upwards of 1  million and maybe even more. I am particularly proud of those in  Houston, Texas, and particularly ``Across Texas, marchers `just can't  be silent anymore.' ''   Congratulations to those who marched safely, securely, and  nonviolently. Congratulations to the Houston organizers. Yes, it is  your right to fight against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the  ignoring of the funding of access to women's health care. It is your  right to fight for educational opportunity. It is your right to  recognize that we have rights as women, but we have rights as  Americans; and it is your right to seek a nation that will be  representative of all of the people, no matter where they come from,  what their religious background is, what regions they live for.   It is beyond the wonderful Midwest that the Nation needs to be  represented. It is in the far corners of the east and the north, yes,  down in Houston, Texas, far to the west. We cannot isolate and say we  won with few votes from this region. America is a country for all  people, and I look forward to this Congress and this White House  representing all of us.                            ____________________
