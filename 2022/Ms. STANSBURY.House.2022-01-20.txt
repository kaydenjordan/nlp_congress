 Mr. Speaker, the history of New Mexico and our rural  communities predate the founding of our great Nation. Our communities  carry rich traditions and ways of life, from our tribal communities, to  our land grants, to our farmers and ranchers and small towns that dot  the plains, mountains, and river valleys of our beautiful State.   They are diverse, resilient, vibrant, and full of grit and  determination. For far too long, our rural communities have been left  behind in critical infrastructure, which is why I am deeply proud that  our bipartisan infrastructure bill is already delivering for New  Mexico, investing millions in rural roads, bridges, and airports,  broadband, our electric grid, and life-giving water, creating thousands  of jobs, and supporting rural economic development across our State,  because our rural communities are the backbone of New Mexico.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud that we are working together to invest in  infrastructure, to invest in jobs, and the well-being of our future and  our communities.                            ____________________
