 Mr. Speaker, I rise to announce this week  that I am reintroducing the FAIR Act: the Forced Arbitration Injustice  Repeal Act.   Forced arbitration has been a concern of mine for some time, and that  is why I have always been in support of sponsoring this legislation  which would strip away what powerful corporations have imposed upon  consumers and workers. That is forced arbitration.   These forced arbitration clauses are everywhere. Americans sign away  their rights when they buy a cell phone or sign an employment contract.  They are forced into arbitration, which is a private, for-profit  dispute resolution process, and it bans claimants from banding  together. The deck is always stacked against the little guy. That is  why I have been championing this legislation since 2007. Momentum is  shifting to our side.   President Biden signed a law last year invalidating forced  arbitration clauses. We have a lot of work to do, and we will continue  that with the FAIR Act.                            ____________________
