 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to pay tribute  to a devoted public servant from my home State of Iowa. Congressman  Leonard Boswell passed away this month after a long battle with cancer.  A decorated military officer, he served 20 years in the U.S. Army, a  dozen years in the Iowa Senate, and 16 years in the U.S. House of  Representatives.   That adds up to nearly a half-century in service to the country he so  dearly loved and served with honor and distinction. After being drafted  into the U.S. Army, Leonard rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel and  served two tours of duty as an assault helicopter pilot in Vietnam. His  distinguished service in uniform groomed him for political battles on  the campaign trail and in public office at the State and Federal level.   In civilian life, as well as in both the military and political  arenas, Leonard Boswell was an officer and a gentleman. He brought  integrity to the campaign trail and to the halls of Congress. Anyone  who underestimated Congressman Boswell failed to appreciate the gritty  combination of a decorated war veteran and a cattle farmer from  southern Iowa. In fact, an armed intruder who broke into the  Congressman's farm home in 2011 found out right quick. At age 77,  Leonard's instincts to protect his family kicked into overdrive, and he  tackled the intruder to the ground.   Notwithstanding those instincts, Leonard Boswell was widely known as  folksy and plain-spoken. He was Iowa through and through. That included  answering the call to help his neighbors and a local grain elevator  struggling during the 1980s farm crisis. From there, he threw his hat  into the ring for public office.   Congressman Boswell's funeral service was last Saturday, and  unexpectedly, it became a double ceremony as his beloved wife of 63  years died just hours before the service, 8 days after Congressman  Boswell passed. Leonard and Dody's life together was filled with deep  faith, love of family and friends, and service, as she taught  elementary school for 37 years, mainly in Lamoni. Dody's family rightly  described her as spiritual, adventurous, vibrant, with a wonderful  sense of humor who lived with love, tenacity, and compassion.   Although Congressman Boswell and I were members of two different  political parties, we shared many things in common as lifelong Iowans,  farmers, octogenarians, and outspoken champions for rural America.   On many issues of the day, we had different points of view on how to  achieve a particular goal, but at the end of the day, we shared an  unequivocal commitment to work on behalf of Iowans, especially farmers  and veterans. From farm bills to transportation and infrastructure  spending, Leonard and I largely saw eye to eye on legislation that  would help Iowans weather the storms of natural disasters or downturns  in the farm economy.   As members of the Iowa congressional delegation, there is an unspoken  understanding that, when it comes to matters important to Iowa, we work  all for one and one for all. I recall when Leonard first came to  Washington in 1997, he was the only Democrat in the Iowa House  delegation. Shortly after his swearing in, Congressman Boswell invited  my staff and me to his office to get acquainted. We enjoyed his Iowa  hospitality very much and returned the invitation shortly thereafter.  After our initial meet-and-greets, it was understood that our doors and  lines of communication were always open. We shared a very good working  relationship during our service together in Congress.   There is one particular piece of legislation that we worked on  together in our respective Chambers of Congress. I was the lead Senate  Republican cosponsor, and he was the principal author in the House of  Representatives. It is called the Joshua Omvig Suicide Prevention Act.  We named the bill for an Iowan who took his own life in 2005 after  returning from duty in Iraq. Our bill was enacted in 2007. It sought to  improve mental health services for veterans. Here in the Senate, I will  continue working to carry out our shared mission of suicide prevention  for servicemembers. As a decorated war veteran and longtime advocate  for the veteran community, Congressman Boswell cared deeply about  fulfilling the promises made to America's veterans. The law he worked  to enact has paved  [[Page S5952]]  the way for even more resources and programs to get veterans in crisis  the help they need.   In closing, I salute a widely respected patriot, whom I am proud to  call my friend. Leonard leaves behind a legacy of service, civility,  and integrity. Barbara and I extend our deepest condolences to the  Boswell family as they mourn the loss and celebrate the lives of  Leonard and Dody. God bless them both.                            ____________________
