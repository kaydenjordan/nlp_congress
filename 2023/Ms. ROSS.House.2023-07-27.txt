 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the  U.S. Women's National Soccer team which is currently playing in the  World Cup. It was quite the match last night.   Mr. Speaker, I give special recognition to the five players on the  team  [[Page H4043]]  who have connections to my home State of North Carolina: Aubrey  Kingsbury, who played at Wake Forest University; Lynn Williams, who  played on the North Carolina Courage in my district; Casey Murphy, who  currently plays on the North Carolina Courage; and Emily Fox and  Crystal Dunn, who played at UNC and are currently on the North Carolina  Courage.   As we cheer them on and while they are representing the USA abroad,  it is important that we also support them at home. We must ensure that  all women athletes receive the same pay, treatment, and resources as  their male counterparts.   Mr. Speaker, I am so proud of all the strong, talented women on our  national team. We are rooting for them.                            ____________________
