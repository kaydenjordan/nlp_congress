 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy  heart to mourn the loss of Pennsylvania State Trooper Landon Weaver,  who was killed in the line of duty on Friday, December 30.   Trooper Weaver had been on patrol for 1 year with the Pennsylvania  State Police. He was investigating a domestic incident in Juniata  Township, Huntingdon County, in Pennsylvania's Fifth District, when the  situation turned deadly and he was fatally shot by the suspect. Flags  throughout Pennsylvania are flying at half-staff in honor of Trooper  Weaver being taken from us too soon.   I rise today to speak about who Trooper Landon Weaver was: a son, a  brother, a husband, a friend, a hero.   Trooper Weaver's law enforcement career had just begun. He was 23  years old, and he married his high school sweetheart, Macy, in June.  They graduated from Central High School in  [[Page H58]]  Martinsburg in 2012, and he went on to study criminal justice at  Indiana University of Pennsylvania. He was proudly on the dean's list.   In December 2015, he enlisted to join the Pennsylvania State Police  Academy in Hershey, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the State Police  Academy in June, was assigned to Troop G of the Pennsylvania State  Police, and served at the Huntingdon Barracks. He loved his family, and  he loved being a police officer.   Trooper Weaver attended Zion Lutheran Church and enjoyed spending  time with his family, and especially his wife, Macy. To him, family was  everything.   Trooper Weaver is the 97th member of the Pennsylvania State Police to  be killed in the line of duty.   In addition to his wife, he is survived by his parents, Eric and  Christine Weaver of East Freedom; his brother, Larett Weaver of East  Freedom; his paternal grandparents, Merrill and Christine D. Weaver; as  well as other family members and friends. He grew up in a small town  where there is a deep sense of community. Many hearts are broken over  this tragic, senseless situation.   One of Trooper Weaver's teachers at Central High School in  Martinsburg remembered Trooper Weaver from his days as a student.  Teacher Joe Logan said Trooper Weaver was a ``great kid'' whom you  could call on during times of need and he would be there. He said he  was ``beside himself with grief and sadness.''   He went on to say: ``He would do anything for you. He was humble,  dedicated, and a loving person to his wife and family. You'd be proud  to call him a colleague or friend.''   Trooper Weaver was one of Pennsylvania's finest. He was committed to  his family, to his profession, and to the community that he loved. His  dedication to service embodies the values of law enforcement officers  across the Nation. Our law enforcement officers risk their lives every  day to help people.   Trooper Weaver put on his uniform that day and went to work like he  had done so many days before, knowing that any moment he could be in  harm's way. That is a commitment our officers make to serve and protect  the public and uphold the law. That is the commitment that Trooper  Weaver made to serve the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   May we all honor Trooper Weaver's memory. He was a young man just  starting out in life. He was a newlywed with so much to look forward  to. In one moment, he was gone.   On behalf of the Congress of the United States and the people of the  Fifth Congressional District of Pennsylvania, I offer my sincere  condolences and prayers to his family, especially to his wife, Macy,  during this tragic and difficult time. He risked his life to keep all  of us safe.   Trooper Landon Weaver is a hero who was taken from us too soon. May  we mourn his loss and honor his memory. May God bless Landon Weaver and  his family.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about  the Pennsylvania Farm Show that opens this weekend in Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania. This weeklong event is the largest indoor agricultural  expo in the country. It showcases 6,000 animals and thousands of  agricultural exhibits.   There will be a Member listening session on Saturday, January 7, at  1:30 p.m. Proudly, Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway and I  have organized a public forum for Members to hear directly from farmers  and farm families.  [[Page H88]]    We invite all Members of the House to join us at this tremendous expo  that celebrates Pennsylvania's rich history and the agriculture  industry. We will tour the show and visit various exhibits.  Pennsylvania Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding will also join us.   Agriculture is the number one industry in Pennsylvania and generates  nearly $6.9 billion in agricultural cash receipts. Almost half a  million jobs are tied to this industry in the Commonwealth. This show  has been widely attended for generations. In fact, this year marks the  101st show.   Come join us Saturday in Harrisburg as we celebrate the prominence of  the agriculture industry in Pennsylvania and its importance to this  Nation. We hope to see you there.                            ____________________
