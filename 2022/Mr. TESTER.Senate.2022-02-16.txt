 Mr. President, I want to thank my friend, the Senator  from Kansas, Senator Moran, the ranking  [[Page S734]]  member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.   When we started this Congress, the No. 1 issue that was put forth by  the veterans service organizations representing the veterans in this  country was toxic exposure. It was incumbent that the Veterans' Affairs  Committee do something about toxic exposure. We created the bill called  the COST of War.   We are at a point now where we are going to try to implement that  bill in phases. The phase we are working on today has six major  components to it. No. 1, it expands the screening period of healthcare  eligibility for combat veterans who served after September 11, 2001,  from 5 years to 10. No. 2, it provides an open enrollment period for  any post-9/11 combat veteran who is more than 10 years from separation.  No. 3, after we do the first two things, it tells the VA to have an  outreach plan to contact veterans who did not enroll during their  initial period of enhanced eligibility so that they can sign up for the  potential benefits. It directs the VA to incorporate a clinical  screening regarding a veteran's potential exposures and symptoms  commonly associated with toxic substances. The fifth thing it does is  it mandates toxic exposure early education and training for healthcare  and benefits personnel who work at the VA. And, finally, it strengthens  Federal research on toxic exposure.   This is a big bill; it is an important bill; and it does right by our  veterans in this country. Toxic exposure is not something that is new.  We have dealt with it since World War I, World War II, Agent Orange,  and the Vietnam war, and, right now, toxic exposure due to burn pits.   When we get done with this process, it is not going to take an act of  Congress to get the benefits they need to get moving into the future.  This is a giant step forward in that regard.   So I want to thank both the minority and majority staffs, the Senator  from Kansas, who has been an incredible help to be able to work  together to get this to the point where it is today.   Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No.  263, S. 3541.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________
