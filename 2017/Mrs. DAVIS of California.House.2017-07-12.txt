 Mr. Speaker, many people think of human  trafficking as a problem that is happening abroad, but what they don't  realize is that hundreds of thousands of victims are being trafficked  within our own borders.   It is hard to imagine such an injustice occurring in your own  neighborhood. When I learned that my city of San Diego is considered a  high-intensity region for child trafficking, I knew I needed to take  action.   In San Diego, we have an incredible community antitrafficking task  force. They told me that a gap in the fight against trafficking is in  our schools. This is why I wrote the Empowering Educators to Prevent  Trafficking Act. I am proud to see it included in the Frederick  Douglass Trafficking Victims Protection Act that is before us today.   My bill will fund programs to train teachers across the country to  recognize and respond to signs of trafficking so that they can identify  victims and get them the help they need. Teachers, in turn, can teach  their students how to protect themselves from becoming victims.   With this training, our Nation's schools can be an important line of  defense against this terrible injustice.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Chris  Smith and Karen Bass, for spearheading this important bill and for  really putting tremendous energy into it.   Mr. Speaker, far too often, it is our children who fall victim to the  horror of human trafficking. As you have heard this afternoon, we must  do everything that we can to stop this injustice.   Often it has been said of human trafficking that it is hiding in  plain sight. Advocates and survivors are always telling me that it is  important to punish traffickers, but we also need to focus on  prevention.   The reauthorization of the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims  Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act strengthens what we need  in this holistic approach. It includes my bill, the Empowering  Educators to Prevent Trafficking Act. This language in the bill creates  a training program that I think you have heard about that empowers  educators to spot the signs of trafficking and, in turn, teach their  students how to protect themselves from becoming victims.   With the passage of this bill, our schools can join the resistance in  the fight against trafficking. Armed with knowledge, students and  teachers can join the battle lines against the injustice of modern-day  slavery.   I want to thank all those who have participated in this bill, and I  urge my colleagues to support it.                                time  1630     Mr. Chairman, I rise to commend the  dedicated bipartisan work of the House Armed Services Committee in  recognizing our subcommittee chairs, members, and the staff as well in  bringing this critical bill to the floor.   But as it has been stated earlier, the budget numbers that we are  talking about contained in the bill are, unfortunately, aspirational.  We have not passed a budget resolution, and the Budget Control Act is  still the law of the land.   While it is true that the BCA was a bipartisan failing--we can all  take credit for that--pointing fingers does not solve the problems. We  are on an uncertain and dangerous path, one where we have not been  honest with ourselves on many levels and where we continue to play  games with our men and women serving in the military.   We must recognize that the only path to solving these issues is  bipartisan collaboration and legislation to repeal the BCA. Continuing  resolutions and unrealistic, deeply partisan budgets amount to nothing  more than professional malpractice.   I have to say, Mr. Chairman, that I was encouraged to see that the  Senate included a proposal similar to the one I introduced during  markup to continue paying the widows of servicemembers who died in  defense of our Nation. Their personal compensation is not just a small  gesture but our fundamental responsibility.   I am also encouraged by the promise our chairman made regarding this  issue. He said that the issue ``has to be fixed and will be,'' but  there are, as he acknowledged as well, ``difficult tradeoffs that have  to be made.'' I completely agree. We will all have to contribute to the  solutions. I am prepared to do that, and I know that my colleagues are  as well. We all have to hope together that we move forward and be  prepared to do that.
