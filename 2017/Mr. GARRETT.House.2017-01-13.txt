 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to make a clarification  because while I support this resolution, I oppose the description that  some here have used. They are calling it a budget. This isn't a budget.  It is a paper trail of crimes our government commits against the future  of our Nation vis-a-vis overwhelming debt. We need to be honest. We are  sitting on $20 trillion in debt, and aside from starting the repeal of  the unaffordable care act, this does nothing to address that.   Reluctantly I will vote for it to repeal the monstrosity that is the  unaffordable care act.   We were told we need to pass the bill so that we could find out what  was in it. Well, we found out what was in it. We saw premiums  skyrocket; we saw families lose their plans and their doctors, even the  ones they liked and they wanted to keep; and we saw businesses  struggle. Now we are left in a position where we need to pass this  resolution to get rid of what we found.   Liberty and self-determination are the lifeblood of this Nation, and  the Nation is terminally ill. Our debt is a cancer that continues to  grow; and like a cancer, it doesn't discriminate. It is colorblind, it  is gender neutral, and it doesn't care about your political affiliation  or what State you are from. It is here, and it continues to grow.  [[Page H500]]    Our children are being encumbered, packaged, and sold to the gallows  by way of unprecedented debt. This is an unprecedented treatment, but  if we continue down the ObamaCare unaffordable care act path that we  are on, the results are guaranteed.   Today's resolution provides treatment for some of the symptoms, but  it is about time that we started getting to the root causes of the  disease. The more government encroaches on the lives of its citizens,  the more debt grows, the less our liberties can breathe, and the sicker  we become. I may be new here, but in Virginia we keep a balanced  budget; and it is about time we got serious about one in D.C.                                time  1215    I will vote to pass this here today, but I refuse to call it a  budget. I refuse to ignore the problems the unaffordable care act was  meant to address. Problems aren't political, solutions are, and we can  provide a better way.
