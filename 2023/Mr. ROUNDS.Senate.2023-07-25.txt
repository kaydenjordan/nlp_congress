 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 813 and ask  that it be reported by number.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S3512, July 25, 2023, in the second column, the  following appears:  Mr.  President, I call up my amendment No. 813 and ask that be reported  by number.    ========================= END NOTE =========================       Mr. President, China and Russia are our near-peer  adversaries, and North Korea and Iran are no friends of the United  States.   In just a few minutes, we will vote on an amendment that I proposed  with Senator Tester that would ban China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran  from purchasing American farmland or ag businesses.   In recent years, our country has seen, firsthand, attempts by our  near-peer competitors to acquire land adjacent to our military bases.   In 2020, a Chinese-linked company planned to build a wind energy farm  project near Del Rio, TX, only miles away from Laughlin Air Force Base,  where U.S. pilots are trained.   In 2022, a Chinese-linked company attempted to build a corn milling  plant on farmland near a sensitive Air Force base outside Grand Forks,  ND. Treasury later determined that they did not have the proper  jurisdiction to take action in this case, which demonstrates the need  for this amendment.   My amendment would require the Committee on Foreign Investment of the  United States, CFIUS, to prohibit China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran  from purchasing ag land and ag businesses in the United States and make  modest reforms to the CFIUS process to improve our country's ability to  protect our national security.   I want to thank my friend from Montana, Senator Tester, for his hard  work on the amendment and our original bill, the PASS Act.   I would also like to thank our cosponsors on this amendment: Senators  Daines, Kennedy, Lummis, Kramer, Hoeven, Ernst, Britt, Brown, and Cruz.   This is a commonsense provision that will make our homeland more  secure.   I yield my time.                          Vote on Amendment No. 813    I ask for the yeas and nays.
