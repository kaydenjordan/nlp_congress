 Mr. President, I rise to speak to the Kigali Amendment  to the Montreal Protocol.   I thank the leader for bringing this important legislative initiative  to the Senate floor, and I want to thank our Republican colleagues who  have joined in a bipartisan effort to send a very strong message that  this is about America's competitiveness; this is about America's  security; this is about challenging China.   For more than 20 years, U.S. manufacturers have been hard at work  pioneering new technologies for our refrigerators and air-conditioners.  They defined the global standard, and they have the competitive  advantage over companies in China and India which have doubled down on  yesterday's technology.   Our companies want and need the Senate to support them so that they  can continue to lead, to create jobs, and to export their goods to  global markets.   So this is why I come to the floor today, to urge my Senate  colleagues to provide advice and consent to the Kigali Amendment, the  fifth technical update to the incredibly successful Montreal Protocol,  a treaty amendment that passed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  by bipartisan voice vote--a bipartisan voice vote. That just shows the  depth and scope of bipartisan support. Each of the four prior updates  were approved by the full Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support,  and I urge my colleagues to do the same for Kigali.   The amendment is a success story of business and government working  together, dating back to the George W. Bush Administration. It is an  update that will ensure U.S. leadership in exports into the future, and  it is the only way--the only way--to keep our businesses from being  locked out of markets across the world.   American businesses are clear. It is time to phase down antiquated  chemicals, known as HFCs, which American manufacturers want to leave  behind. It is time to usher in a new era in which the modern products  are purchased all over the world.   Our companies already lead in this space. They have been investing  billions of dollars to develop new technologies--alternatives to HFCs-- and they have done so in ways that will ultimately decrease costs-- decrease costs--for U.S. consumers. That is why, for the time being, we  have the competitive advantage over China and others.   So the choice on this is clear: Ratifying Kigali means ensuring U.S.  companies dominate the export markets. Failure to ratify means a wasted  investment and a missed opportunity. Ratifying means we will see  thousands more domestic manufacturing jobs--33,000, according to  industry estimates. Failure to ratify means U.S. businesses that employ  tens of thousands of people across the country will not--will not--be  able to sell many of their products in key countries. We are talking  about $4.8 billion annually--annually--  [[Page S4840]]  of increased exports; $12.5 billion of increased economic output per  year. So do we want billions of dollars a year in more exports and  economic output or do we want to have lost jobs? Do we want lost  exports? Do we want our companies suffering needlessly?   Beginning in 2033, the nations all around the world that have already  joined Kigali--137 of them and counting that have already done this-- will be required--required--to block the imports of most HFCs from the  countries that have not joined Kigali. So we would be blocked if we  don't, in fact, ratify this amendment.   We don't want U.S. manufacturers to be on the outside looking in.  They employ thousands of people all over the country. We don't want  them to be unable to sell products that they had been at the forefront  of developing. Adopting this treaty amendment is the only way to keep  our businesses from being locked out of global markets.   So let's not waste the engagement and encouragement by the Bush  administration that led U.S. manufacturers to develop alternatives to  these harmful chemicals. Let's not waste the accomplishments made by  the AIM Act, which President Trump signed into law. We need to remember  that the AIM Act provides for the exact same chemical phasedown  required by Kigali, which means that we have already taken the required  steps domestically.   This means that we wouldn't be required to do anything more--anything  more--if we ratify Kigali, but we will miss out on billions in exports  and thousands of jobs if we fail to do so.   That is the essence. That is why manufacturers all over the country  in States like Wisconsin, Texas, and Kentucky support Senate approval  of Kigali. That is why there has been an outpouring of support from the  business community, including major employers like Walmart, Carrier,  Trane, Lennox, and others.   That is why the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce, and the impacted industries all support this  practical and bipartisan Senate action.   So, in closing, I ask my colleagues to fulfill our constitutional  role in the treaty process by providing advice and consent to the  Kigali Amendment. That requires 67 votes. I think we are well on our  way there. Let's support American businesses. Let's continue to be the  global leader. Let's support American consumers. Let's make sure the  United States stays ahead of the competition. And let's beat China,  instead of help China, at the end of the day. We can do all of that and  so much more by adopting today's amendment.   And I want to thank so many who have worked on this in a bipartisan  effort. Senator Kennedy has been working very hard. I want to thank my  colleague Senator Carper, the chairman of the Environment and Public  Works Committee, who has been so passionate about the Kigali Amendment  and such a force to bring us to this moment today.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.
