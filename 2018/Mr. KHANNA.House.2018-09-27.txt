 Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge support for the Food and  Agribusiness Merger Moratorium and Antitrust Review Act of 2018. I am  proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill introduced by  Representative Pocan and an original founder of the Congressional  Antitrust Caucus.   This bill is good for our farmers. It would place a short-term  moratorium on the large agribusiness mergers that we are seeing across  our Nation. Fewer farmers mean fewer choices for consumers and higher  prices.   Agricultural consolidation is a huge problem. Today, the top four  beef packers control 82 percent of the market. Missouri had 23,000 hog  farms in 1985, but only 2,200 in 2012. Four companies control 85  percent of soybean processing. I could go on and on.   We need to temporarily stop these big mergers, and we need to start  looking out for our farmers again. When the farm bill expires this  week, small family farmers should be first.                            ____________________
