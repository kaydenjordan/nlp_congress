 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Since President Trump's draconian budget was released, Democrats have  warned Republicans that a bipartisan budget agreement was needed to  adequately invest in American families and communities.   Without a budget agreement, programs as diverse as Head Start, job  training, and terrorism prevention grants are in danger of inadequate  funding at best, yet Republican leadership and the White House have no  appropriations strategy other than endless continuing resolutions.   Mr. Speaker, the most powerful country in the world now being  completely run by a Republican government can't keep the lights on  longer than 4 weeks at a time. How did we get here? If this bill  passes, is there any reason to believe we will not be back in the same  place next month?   Stumbling from one crisis to another is an irresponsible way to  govern. Attempting to avoid a shutdown every month denies Federal  agencies budget certainty and wastes taxpayer dollars.   Several of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have lamented  the damage that the CRs inflict on our military. I agree with them, yet  time after time, they vote for the exact same strategy they bemoan.   I encourage my colleagues to take action; hasten agreements on  immigration and spending caps that would lead to responsible funding  bills that keep Americans safe.   It is also unconscionable that, instead of helping advance a solution  to this impasse, the President personally reneged on his word and  rejected a bipartisan compromise on immigration. Protection of American  teens and young adults from impending deportation to a country they  don't know is the key to unlocking a responsible, bipartisan spending  agreement. How can we expect to ever fund the government responsibly  when the President cannot be trusted to keep his word?   The majority has failed to address a number of high-priority items,  like funding to combat the opioid epidemic, pension protections, and  funding for community health centers.   The continuing resolution lacks an important anomaly requested by the  administration to provide additional disaster loans for the Small  Business Administration while the disaster supplemental is stalled in  the Senate. Without this language, the Small Business Administration  will run out of funds by the end of January and will be unable to  continue approving loan applications from Puerto Rico.   Mr. Speaker, this is not how the appropriations process is supposed  to work. It is time to protect young Americans, lift budget caps, and  allow Chairman Frelinghuysen and all of our committee members to roll  up our sleeves and get to work.   Instead of wasting dollars on time, on further CRs, we should,  instead, immediately pass a budget agreement and help DREAMers, which  would facilitate full-year funding bills the committee could begin  writing today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H527]]    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.

Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the ranking member of the Energy and Water  Development Subcommittee.    I yield the gentlewoman from Ohio an additional 30  seconds.    I yield the gentlewoman from Ohio an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the well-informed ranking  member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), the ranking member of the Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee of the Committee on  Appropriations.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation,  which ignores the urgent need of the American people. The Federal  Government's fiscal year started October 1 of last year.   But instead of fulfilling their responsibility to fund our government  in a timely manner, President Trump and the Republicans spent months  working to pass their tax scam.   Now, because they didn't do their jobs, Mr. Speaker, Republicans are  asking us to vote to kick the can down the road again. This is no way  to run a government.   The American people deserve immediate action on the critical issues  that matter to our country. We need a budget agreement in order to do  that. We need to keep our government open. We need to protect our  national security, and we need to meet the needs of our community and  these hardworking families.   We need to protect workers' pensions by enacting responsible reforms  that will save struggling pension plans. We need to provide disaster  relief to our fellow Americans who were hit hard by hurricanes and  wildfires last year. We need to reauthorize the Special Diabetes  Program, which funds treatment and prevention programs for Native  Americans. And, yes, we need to pass a Dream Act, which protects  children from President Trump's cruel termination of DACA.   The American people overwhelmingly support these priorities, but you  won't find them in this bill. Instead, Republicans have turned this CR  into a tax bill that has provisions that didn't make it in their  original tax plan.   While this legislation does finally reauthorize the Children's Health  Insurance Program, it abandons our community health centers, where  parents take their children to get the care that they need.   Make no mistake, this bill will cause layoffs at clinics, which means  fewer people in my district throughout Minnesota will get the care that  they need.   Mr. Speaker, the Republican Party has total control in Washington,  but instead of working for the American people, President Trump and his  allies in Congress are ignoring them.  [[Page H530]]    Minnesotans and Americans deserve a better deal than the one that  they are getting from this Republican Congress. It is time for  President Trump and the Republicans to end the chaos, to truly work  across the aisle to find ways that we can fund this government  responsibly, and to address our national priorities.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the Labor, Health and  Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this continuing resolution. It is  staggering that yet again we are punting one of our core obligations as  a Congress: funding government programs.   We should be negotiating spending levels for 2018 for both defense  spending and nondefense spending. We should have spent the last few  months fulfilling our responsibility as legislators by writing  bipartisan bills to fund programs that help working families and the  middle class and the vulnerable, to support evidence-based scientific  research, and to help working people get the skills they need to find  good jobs with good wages.   Instead, Republicans have continued their irresponsible trend of  continuing resolution after continuing resolution. They fail to govern.  They create chaos.   This bill fails to support community health centers, which serve as  the primary healthcare provider for over 27 million people, including  disproportionately rural and low-income populations.   In 2016, over 376,000 patients across Connecticut received care at  the Connecticut Community Health Center. They cut taxes for insurance  companies while failing to fund community health centers. It is  shameful.   They won't work with Democrats to set budget numbers and ensure  parity for defense and nondefense spending. They put services and  investments critical to families and our communities at risk; from  apprenticeships to education for students with disabilities, to  childcare, to afterschool programs that help working families make ends  meet, and to financial aid for students attending college.   They include an extension for the Children's Health Insurance  Program, but they cut out the Medicare extenders and other healthcare  programs. But they should be ashamed of the months of fear and turmoil  they have caused to children and their families who will be unable to  get help at community healthcare centers.    They had the time to cram a tax scam through the Congress before the  end of the year.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut.   Ms. DeLAURO. Yet, for the vulnerable children, we have dragged our  feet for months. Shameful.   Let me just say, the President Trump and the Republican majority who  try to cast the blame for this shutdown on the Democrats--let me just  remind this body and the American people that 9 months ago the  President said: Our country needs a good shutdown in September to fix  this mess.   Well, the President may get what he wants and what he desires as a  government shutdown, but it is not because of the Democrats. It is  because of the intractability of the Republican majority in this House  and this administration to move forward on behalf of the American  people. It is not the Democrats. President Trump has called for a  shutdown of this government.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the ranking member of the  Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs,  and Related Agencies.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this continuing  resolution, which is, yet again, a complete abdication of our  responsibilities.   Instead of adopting fully funded appropriations bills or an omnibus  with an actual chance of passing this Congress, we are mired in this  unbreakable habit of passing continuing resolutions.   The Republicans' most recent proposal does nothing to renew funding  for the more than 1,400 community health centers across the country or  the 25 million Americans they serve after they let funding run out in  September.   According to the National Association of Community Health Centers, if  Congress does not act soon, 28,000 sites could close, 50,000 staff  could be laid off, and 9 million Americans could lose access to care.   When did this program, which has always had bipartisan support in  this body, become a partisan issue?   These abdications are simply immoral. Our Republican colleagues say:  We don't have the money to fund these programs, but somehow they were  silent on that issue when they gave a handout to giant corporations  that add more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit.   While their donors rested peacefully over the holidays knowing that  their tax cuts were safe, Republicans continued to torment 800,000  hardworking young people by refusing to pass the Dream Act. 122  DREAMers lose their protected status every day, and Republicans have  not been brave enough to do what is right.   These courageous individuals are teaching in our schools, working in  our communities, and serving in our military.   I have had the privilege of meeting DREAMers in south Florida and in  the Halls of this Capitol. Their hopes and hard work signify what is  best about America, and by any reasonable definition, they are  Americans. This is their home.  [[Page H531]]    It is past time for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  work on a bipartisan spending package that promotes the middle class,  protects DREAMers, and finally assures the American people that their  government is working.   I simply will not support any spending bill that fails to do so. Make  no mistake, Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White  House. A government shutdown will land squarely in their lap.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Washington.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pallone), who is the ranking member of the Committee on  Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to close.   Mr. Speaker, Congress has a responsibility to invest in initiatives  to defend the country and grow the economy. Instead of continuing down  a rudderless path of CR after CR, we must pass a bipartisan budget  agreement and protect DREAMers, which will enable the Appropriations  Committee to responsibly write full-year funding bills.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.                                time  1800
