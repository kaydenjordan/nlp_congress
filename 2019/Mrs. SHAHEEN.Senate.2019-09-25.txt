 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, for the past couple of weeks, New  Hampshire and many other States across the country have been flooded  with millions of dollars' worth of dark money advertisements. These ads  have been all over TV and social media.   Let me just be clear. They haven't been running just against me in  New Hampshire; they have been running against Democrats and Republicans  in competitive races across this country.   We have also had flyers that have been jammed in the mailboxes all  across New Hampshire. I even got several of the flyers myself. This is  an example of one. I will read it in just a minute.   I want to point out that the goal of this campaign has been to stop  Congress from acting to address surprise medical bills.   For example, this flyer makes the dishonest claim that addressing  surprise medical bills would lead to hospital closures and doctor  shortages. In fact, you can see, it says:         Imagine if the care we needed wasn't there when we needed       it the most. Rate setting is a healthcare nightmare--hospital       closures, doctor shortages, windfall profits for big       insurance. Say no to rate setting. Don't put big insurance       companies in charge of our healthcare. Stop surprise medical       bills.    Then you turn it over, and it says:         Tell Jeanne Shaheen to stop rate setting. Say no to putting       big insurance in charge of our healthcare. Say no to making       it harder to see our chosen doctors when we need them the       most. Say no to big insurance profits at our expense. Tell       Senator Jeanne Shaheen to put patients first.    You read that, and you think I am all about trying to put insurance  companies ahead of patients. It doesn't tell you who is sending it. But  you look at it--and we did a little digging, and we found out that the  ads say that they are paid for by an organization called Doctor Patient  Unity. You read that, and you think, well, they are worried about  patients. You look at that, and you think they are worried about  hospital closures. This is from Doctor Patient Unity, so this must be  someone who cares about patients. Don't believe it.   The truth is, these flyers and the ads that have been running in New  Hampshire and across the country are paid for by two private equity  firms on Wall Street. They don't care about patients. They care about  profits.   They have spent over $2 million in New Hampshire. If you look across  the country, they have spent tens of millions of dollars. Just imagine  that instead of trying to pad their own bottom line and worrying about  surprise medical billing, they had put those tens of millions of  dollars into improving healthcare for the people of this country.   The public doesn't know this because they have been left completely  in the dark. Due to the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision,  special interests can spend unlimited amounts of money and stay  anonymous. So the average person throughout the country who gets one of  these flyers is not going to know who paid for these ads. They are not  going to know who is getting the benefit of the costs from surprise  medical billing.   This ad campaign is not only confusing to voters; it is exhibit A in  how our campaign finance system is broken. The voices of Granite  Staters who are struggling to pay surprise medical bills are being  drowned out in this case by private equity firms on Wall Street that  are making billions off of the status quo.   Here is how these private equity firms are exploiting patients.  First, surprise medical bills usually occur when a patient visits an  in-network hospital. Let's say my insurance says that I can go to the  hospital in my hometown. As part of the treatment, I go to the  hospital, but the doctor who sees me is not a doctor who is in the  network of my insurance company. So unbeknownst to me, as I go into the  emergency room, that doctor is what is called out of network. These  doctors often are working for physician staffing companies that have  gone out of network so they can aggressively pursue surprise medical  bills. These physician staffing companies are also using these surprise  medical bills to negotiate--to command in-network payments from  insurers that are often twice as high as the average, which can result  in higher premiums for everybody.   So they have these surprise medical bills, and you pay more for  those. The insurance companies and the physician staffing companies go  to the insurers and say: Look, these doctors are getting paid this much  from surprise medical bills, so you have to raise your payments for  doctors in your network, and everybody is going to pay more as the  result of that.   Again, this is frequently done at the behest of private equity firms  that own the physician staffing companies.   Surprise medical bills can be a tremendous shock to patients. This is  what happened to Donald and Kathy Cavallaro. They live in Rye, NH. Don  works at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. When Kathy needed emergency  surgery, Don's insurance covered the hospital costs, but the doctor  performing the surgery was out of their insurance network. The result  was that they got a surprise medical bill for $5,000. Now they are  appealing that cost.   Unfortunately, what the Cavallaros are going through isn't a rare  occurrence. One in six emergency room visits in New Hampshire results  in a surprise bill for Granite Staters who have large employer  coverage.   Nationally, the average cost of a surprise bill from an emergency  room visit is more than $600, and the average surprise bill for  inpatient care is over $2,000. So we can see what is happening as a  result of surprise medical bills. Surprise bills like these can easily  put a family budget in the red, and Congress desperately needs to put a  stop to them.   Today, I strongly encourage my colleagues in the Senate to move this  effort forward. The special interests that are pushing these surprise  medical bills and pushing up all of our healthcare costs have to be  tuned out.   This is about making sure that when a Granite Stater or any American  goes to a hospital, they can have faith that their insurance is going  to cover their costs. We should not--we must not--let private equity  firms on Wall Street bully Congress or derail the bipartisan efforts  that are taking place in this body to address surprise medical bills.   These advertisements should also serve as a reminder that Congress  has to reform our broken campaign finance system. Special interests  shouldn't be able to hide behind nice-sounding front groups like Doctor  Patient Unity.   We know these private equity firms are responsible for these ads only  because of investigative reporting that was done by Bloomberg, the New  York Times, and some others. Sadly, this is the exception rather than  the norm because usually dark money never gets exposed.   In closing, I want to send a very clear message: I don't care how  many ads these special interests run, how many  [[Page S5686]]  mailers they send out, or how many millions they spend. Granite Staters  who have had their family budgets upended by surprise medical bills  must be prioritized over the special interests who want to profit off  of them. Healthcare costs are out of control, and tackling surprise  medical bills must remain at the top of the Senate's agenda.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
