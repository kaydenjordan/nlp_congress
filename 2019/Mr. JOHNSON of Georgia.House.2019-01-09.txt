 Madam Speaker, I rise today for our veterans  and government employees out of work due to the Trump shutdown. On day  one, House Democrats took steps to restore certainty to people's lives  by passing a complete funding package to reopen the government.   Now we are preparing further action to reopen government, so that we  can meet the needs of the American people, protect our borders, and  respect our workers.   In fact, one of my constituents who works for the IRS and specializes  in helping hurricane victims told me that he and his wife, who is also  a Federal employee, both are affected by the shutdown, and they cannot  pay this month's mortgage and their other bills.   Madam Speaker, he worked 12 hours a day in the aftermath of Hurricane  Michael. He was there for the people of Georgia. It is past time we  reopen the government and be there for our Federal workers.                            ____________________
