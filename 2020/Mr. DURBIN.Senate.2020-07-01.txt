 Madam President, I come to the floor this morning on an  issue that is topical. It is an issue that, over the last several days,  has become a national centerpiece of conversation.   It reflects a decision of just a few days ago by the Supreme Court  that rejected President Trump's efforts to repeal deportation  protections for Dreamers--young immigrants who came to the United  States as children. In an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts, the  Court held that the President's decision to rescind DACA, the Deferred  Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, was ``arbitrary and  capricious.''   It was 10 years ago that I joined with Republican Senator Dick Lugar,  of Indiana, on a bipartisan basis, to call on President Obama and beg  him to use his legal authority to protect Dreamers from deportation.  President Obama responded by creating the Deferred Action for Childhood  Arrivals Program, known as DACA. It provided for Dreamers temporary  protection from deportation--2 years at a time--if they registered with  the government, paid substantial fees, and passed criminal and national  security background checks. More than 800,000 Dreamers came forward and  received DACA protection.   DACA unleashed the full potential of these Dreamers, who are  contributing to our Nation in a variety of ways--as soldiers, as  teachers, as nurses, as small business owners. More than 200,000 DACA  recipients are currently ``essential critical infrastructure workers.''  That is not my term. It is the way President Trump's Department of  Homeland Security describes the work of these DACA recipients now-- 200,000 of them ``essential critical infrastructure workers.'' Among  those DACA recipients, 41,700 of them are in the healthcare industry.  This includes doctors, intensive care nurses, paramedics, and  respiratory therapists. They are the healthcare heroes we salute, and  at the same time, they are the DACA recipients this President loathes.   On September 5, 2017, President Trump repealed DACA. Hundreds of  thousands of Dreamers faced losing their work permits and faced being  deported to countries many of them barely remembered, if they  remembered at all. Thankfully, the Supreme Court stepped in and  rejected that strategy by President Trump.   What was the President's reaction?   To no surprise, the President responded by attacking the Court and  threatening to try to repeal DACA, even again, in the closing months of  his first term.   Congress must step in immediately.   After that Supreme Court decision, President Trump tweeted, ``I have  wanted to take care of DACA recipients better than the Do Nothing  Democrats, but for two years they refused to negotiate.''   Here is the reality. The President has rejected numerous bipartisan  proposals to deal with DACA and the Dreamers.   May I be specific?   On February 15, 2018, the Senate considered bipartisan legislation  that was offered by Republican Senator Mike Rounds and Independent  Senator Angus King--a bipartisan measure. The bill, which included a  path to citizenship for Dreamers, was supported by a bipartisan  majority of the Senate. Why did it fail to reach 60 votes? Because  President Trump openly opposed it. That is why. He said: I have a  better idea.   On the same day that the Senate voted on the President's immigration  proposal, we found his so-called ``better idea'' failed by a bipartisan  supermajority of 39 to 60.   On June 4, 2019, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 6--on June  4, 2019, which was more than a year ago. H.R. 6, the Dream and Promise  Act, is legislation that would give Dreamers a path to citizenship, and  it passed the House with a strong bipartisan vote.   The Dream and Promise Act has been pending in the Senate for more  than a year. I have come to the floor, day after day, and heard the  Republican leader, Senator McConnell, bemoaning the fact that we are so  busy here in the Senate and that the House just isn't doing its work.  Yet the House has sent some 400 pieces of legislation to Senator  McConnell's desk--90 percent of it bipartisan. He refuses to consider  it. He refuses to bring it to this empty  [[Page S4086]]  Senate floor so that we can do our work. One of those measures, sadly,  is the Dream and Promise Act--the bill that would solve at least part  of the immigration challenge we now face in America. Last week, I sent  a letter, signed by all 47 Democratic Senators, calling on Senator  McConnell to immediately schedule a vote after the Supreme Court  decision. As of today, the Senator has not replied.   Over the years, I have decided that the only way to tell the story of  the Dreamers and the story of DACA is to introduce them here in the  Senate. I have asked them to come forward, if they wish, provide me  with photographs, and let me tell their stories. This is the 124th  story I am going to tell. It is the story of a remarkable young woman  named Cinthya Ramirez.    Cinthya Ramirez came to the United States from Mexico at the age of  4. She grew up in Nashville, TN. She wrote me a letter. Here is what  she wrote about growing up:         Moving to the United States gave me the gift of education.       I learned English by the first grade, and that is when I       learned that I loved school and I loved learning.    While in high school, Cinthya was on the track team and was a student  council representative and a great student. She graduated at the top of  her high school class with the highest honors. Cinthya went to Lipscomb  University, which is a private Christian college in Nashville, and she  graduated with a nursing degree. Today, thanks to DACA, Cinthya works  as a cardiac registered nurse at Vanderbilt University Medical Center-- the largest hospital in Nashville, TN. Cinthya is on the frontline of  the COVID-19 pandemic.   Here is what she writes about this experience:         I am a very spiritual person, and I pray a lot. I remind       myself that this is the job that I was meant to have. If the       time comes for patients to die and they cannot have their       families with them, we have to be there for them.    Cinthya's greatest fear is that of bringing the coronavirus home to  her family when she comes home after her nursing shifts at the  hospital.   Here is what she writes:         I take every precaution before entering the house. I take       off my clothes, clean my phone, go straight to the shower.       The rest is in the hands of God.    I thank Cinthya Ramirez--a DACA recipient--for her service. She is an  immigrant healthcare hero. She is a DACA healthcare hero. She is  putting herself and her family at risk to save the lives of others. She  should also not have to wake up every morning in fear that actions  taken by the Trump administration will lead to her being deported back  to a country she can barely, if at all, remember.   This is a classic example of this debate and what it is about--and to  think that, in a year, we have not even taken up this issue that was  sent to us by the House while it winds its way through our judicial  process all the way to the highest Court in the land, where the ruling  was in favor of Cinthya and the DACA recipients who have this  protection.   In that year, did we step forward in the U.S. Senate--the so-called  greatest deliberative body on Earth--to even debate the bill that  passed the House of Representatives? No. No, there was no time for  that. As you can see, we are so busy here on the floor of the U.S.  Senate.   There is so much more that we could do here. Shouldn't we start with  the highest priority--protecting Americans in the midst of this  pandemic?   This woman, Cinthya Ramirez--undocumented, protected by DACA--risks  her life every single day because of this pandemic. Can we risk  ourselves politically for a minute in the Senate and actually take up a  measure that could have a direct impact on the lives of the 800,000  DACA recipients and the thousands of others who could have applied for  that protection during the months that we have debated this in court?   Sadly, we have been unable to do that, and it is all because of a  decision being made by the President of the United States and by the  Republican majority leader, and it is a decision which needs to be  addressed directly.   In a few moments, I am going to offer a unanimous consent request,  when it comes to moving this bill, that was sent over by the House of  Representatives more than a year ago. I am really going to call the  bluff of this President, who asks: Why doesn't Congress act? Why don't  you come up with a bipartisan proposal?   Mr. President, here is our chance. Here is an opportunity.   We have a bill that has been sitting here for a year that would  address Cinthya Ramirez's future and the future of thousands of others.  The question is whether or not the Members on the other side of the  aisle, on the Republican side of the aisle, will at least let us  address this issue now.   Give us an opportunity to bring before the U.S. Senate a measure  which is no surprise, nothing revolutionary or new. It is a measure we  have considered in various forms over the last 20 years, but it is a  measure that would address this issue and do it in a thoughtful way.   This is an opportunity which we should seize. Wouldn't it be  remarkable, maybe a headliner, if the Senate actually did something--if  we actually took an issue of the day that affected real people, real  lives, in the middle of this coronavirus epidemic and actually decided  that this young woman and thousands like her were worth the effort   I think America would be shocked that this U.S. Senate responded that  way, and don't tell me we have better things to do. I am all for doing  the military authorization bill. We can get that done and be back in 2  weeks and take this up immediately. We know the bill is here. We know  that the bill is prepared and covers the areas that would protect this  young lady and so many others and give them a future in the United  States of America. At this point, it is really up to us.   Now, there may be an objection when I make this unanimous consent  request. Listen carefully to the objection. It has nothing to do with  resolving the issue before us--the issue of the future of this young  woman and thousands of others just like her.   But we are in a position at this moment where we have to act. I am  awaiting the arrival of a Republican Member, who I hope is on the way,  and so at this point I am going to suspend and yield the floor with the  hopes that we can return to another colleague coming to the floor  momentarily.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I want to thank my colleague and friend  Senator Schumer. We have been fighting this battle for a long time,  Senator.   Eight of us who came, four Democrats and four Republicans, put  together a comprehensive immigration reform bill which should have  passed 7 years ago--68 votes on the floor of the U.S. Senate. It was a  bipartisan measure, which we joined with Senator McCain to put together  to bring to the floor.   I thank you for your heartfelt comments.   I am going to speak a little longer and make a unanimous consent  request.   This measure I am asking for unanimous consent on, the American Dream  and Promise Act, was introduced by Representative Lucille Roybal- Allard, Democrat of California, on March 12, 2019, with 202 original  cosponsors.   It would provide Dreamers, temporary protected status recipients, and  individuals with deferred enforcement departure with protection from  deportation and an opportunity to obtain permanent legal status in the  United States if they meet certain requirements.   It passed the House of Representatives 237 to 187--7 Republicans  joined the 230 Democrats who were present to support the legislation.   Protections in the American Dream and Promise Act would allow nearly  700,000 DACA recipients, as well as another 1.6 million eligible  Dreamers brought to the United States as children to stay in our  country legally.   The bill's protections would also allow over 300,000 temporary  protected status holders and 3,600 individuals that I described earlier  with the same opportunity.   It would create a conditional permanent resident status valid for up  to 10 years that would protect Dreamers, including DACA, from  deportation and allow them to work legally in the United States.  Cinthya Ramirez could continue working as a nurse long after this  pandemic is gone.   To qualify for this, the Dreamers would need to meet requirements.  They must have come to the United States before the age of 18--she came  at the age of 4--and continuously lived here for at least 4 years.   They must demonstrate they have been admitted to an institution of  higher education, earned a high school diploma or equivalent, or are  currently in the process of doing that. She is a graduate of Lipscomb  University with a degree in nursing.   They must pass government and background security checks, submit  biometric and biographic data, demonstrate good character with no  felonies, misdemeanor offenses of domestic violence, or multiple  misdemeanor convictions, and they must register for the Selective  Service, if applicable--she has already met all these standards by the  examination she has been put through for DACA--and, of course, pay  their application fee.   DACA recipients and other DACA-eligible Dreamers who still meet the  requirements needed to obtain DACA would automatically qualify for  conditional permanent resident status.   When the President ended DACA in September of 2017, we stopped  accepting applications from those who were eligible. Now these young  people would have the chance, if they meet the requirements and the  test that is required of them.   They must complete one of three tracks: graduate from college or  university or complete at least 2 years of a bachelor's or higher  degree program in the United States; complete at least 2 years of  honorable military service or have worked for a period totaling at  least 3 years while having valid employment authorization; maintain  continuous residence in the country; demonstrate an ability to read,  write, speak English; understand American history, principles, and form  of government.   It is a high standard, but it is one they are prepared to meet and  they should meet to become part of America's future.   How important are they? Well, they are extremely important in every  single State. We know that there are some 780,000 DACA recipients  across the United States. There are 109,000 of them in the State of  Texas--109,000. The average age of arrival for them is 7. They came  here as kids. Their annual tax contributions are in the millions. I  could read the numbers.   In the State of Texas, there are 30,000 of these DACA recipients who  have been characterized by the Trump administration as essential  workers--30,000--4,300 DACA healthcare workers in the State of Texas.   The States of Texas, Arizona, California, Florida, and others are  going through a resurgence of infection and death from this pandemic.  These DACA young people--many of them are on the frontline fighting  this disease, as Cinthya Rameriz is in Tennessee.   The notion that we want them to leave now--4,300 leave Texas now-- healthcare workers? Unimaginable. It makes no sense.   It is time for us to do something. At a minimum, for goodness' sake,  in this empty Chamber, can we come together and debate this issue?   The President has challenged us to do it. Let's do it--not be afraid  of it. Put it through an amendment process on the floor. I have lived  through that before. It actually would resemble the U.S. Senate, which  many people remember from the history books, where people actually came  to deliberate and vote on amendments. That is all we are asking for.  Bring this under unanimous consent to the floor. Let's do it. The  President has challenged us.   I am going to make a unanimous consent request. I see the Senator  from Texas is on the floor here, and I want to make sure I get the  right copy. Here it is.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 112, H.R. 6, the American  Dream and Promise Act; further, that the bill be considered read a  third time and passed; that the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate    Madam President, it my understanding that the Senator  from Texas was going to offer a consent request.    I think this is the moment to do it.    Madam President, reserving the right to object.    Madam President, listen carefully to what we just heard  from the Senator from Texas. First he talked about amnesty. Amnesty as  I understand it is a blanket forgiveness for the commission of a crime.   Cinthya Ramirez has DACA--the DACA protection that I described--2  years at a time. She was brought here to the United States from Mexico  at the age of 4. She has paid her fee, has gone through her background  check, and receives 2-year protections to continue in this country.  According to the Senator from Texas, that is amnesty for a crime-- amnesty for a criminal. It is certainly not that.   This young woman has been as open with our government as she could  possibly be, and for it she has received 2 years at a time to build a  life, and what a life she has built. Undocumented and uncertain of her  future, a person who is doomed by the Trump administration's policy  finishes her medical education in nursing school at Lipscomb  University, a Christian college in Nashville, and works at one of the  best hospitals in the whole region, saving the lives of people who are  facing COVID-19, and in the eyes of the Senator from Texas, she is just  another criminal looking for amnesty. Really? I am sorry, that doesn't  add up. It doesn't add up at all   To say today that because we are seeking help on DACA, Democrats do  not value American workers--another statement made by the Senator from  Texas--may I remind the Senator that all of the people we are talking  about in the DACA Program are currently in the United States legally  working because of DACA? It is not as if they are taking jobs away by  coming into this country and displacing others. Many of them are  unemployed because of the economy too. She is doing work people are  afraid to do, exposing herself to the coronavirus every single day.   You heard the routine she goes through when she comes home from work:  taking off her clothing, rushing into a shower, washing off her cell  phone, cleaning it before she sees her family. This is a person who is  a criminal? She is a criminal for what she does, Cinthya Ramirez-- really? I don't understand the thinking.   To call the decision last week--the week before--before the Supreme  Court disgraceful is to say that she should have no chance. She should  be gone. What has she got to offer to the United States of America, to  the State of Tennessee, to our future? She has a lot to offer, and most  Americans, even an overwhelming majority of Republicans, get that part  of it.   Now the Senator comes before us today with a consistent record on  Dreamers. Every moment that he has been in the U.S. Senate, whenever he  has been given a chance--whenever--to help the Dreamers or to help  DACA, the junior Senator from Texas has voted no, time and time and  time again. He is consistent. Bless him for his consistency.   Today he is not even offering an alternative that would give this  woman a chance--no alternative to the Dream and Promise Act. Instead he  offers his own bill, which has nothing whatsoever to do with DACA and  the Dreamers. The Cruz bill would increase penalties for immigration  offenses, but anyone who commits any of the offenses that have been  described by the Senator from Texas is already ineligible under DACA-- ineligible. DACA requires applicants to clear criminal and national  security background checks. Cinthya Ramirez has done that. To say that  she is even close to committing a crime is an outrage.  [[Page S4089]]    Let's be clear. The junior Senator from Texas is in the majority in  the U.S. Senate. If he were serious about advancing his bill, he could  ask the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold a committee  vote on the bill. The Senator from Texas serves on that committee. Then  he could ask the majority leader to schedule a floor vote. But he  hasn't done that. This bill that he brings to the floor today he has  not even introduced as a bill in this session of Congress.   In this session of Congress, with the Republicans in the majority,  the immigration subcommittee chaired by the other Senator of Texas has  held one hearing. The Senate Judiciary Committee has voted on one  immigration bill. There has not been a single vote on an immigration  bill on the floor of the U.S. Senate.   Clearly, the Senator from Texas has no intention of trying to advance  this bill that he passionately defended on the floor. He is offering it  today to try to muddy the waters and somehow tie up this wonderful  young nurse in Tennessee with a horrible crime that was committed in  California. She had nothing to do with it. There is nothing in her life  that is even close to that crime, and to put that as the alternative to  DACA and the Dream Act is fundamentally and totally unfair.   As long as I am in the Senate, I will come to the floor of the Senate  to advocate for Cinthya Ramirez and all of the Dreamers. What an  American tragedy it would be to deport this brave and talented young  nurse who is saving lives in the midst of this pandemic.   America is better than that. We must ensure that Cinthya and hundreds  of thousands of others in our essential workforce are not forced to  stop working. We need them now more than ever, and we must give them  the chance they desire to let them become citizens of the United  States.   Madam President, I object to the unanimous consent request by the  Senator from Texas.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr.  Markey), and the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray) are necessarily  absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4139         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
