 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 4302) to authorize public housing agencies to share  certain data regarding homeless individuals and families for the  provision of housing and services, and for other purposes, as amended.  [[Page H187]]    The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4302         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Homeless Assistance Act of       2019''.       SEC. 2. LIMITED AUTHORITY TO SHARE INFORMATION REGARDING                     HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WITH                     APPROPRIATE ENTITY WITHIN CONTINUUM OF CARE.         Section 2 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42       U.S.C. 1437) is amended by adding at the end the following       new subsection:        ``(c) Limited Authority to Share Information Regarding       Homeless Individuals and Families With Appropriate Entity       Within Continuum of Care.--Notwithstanding section 904 of the       Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of       1988 (42 U.S.C. 3544), a public housing agency may disclose,       to the collaborative applicant of the local Continuum of Care       or designee of the collaborative applicant within which the       jurisdiction of the public housing agency is located,       information regarding individuals and families who are       homeless (as such term is used in section 103 of the       McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11302)) or       at risk of homelessness (as such term is used in section 401       of such Act (42 U.S.C. 11360)), but only--        ``(1) for the purpose of facilitating the identification,       assessment, and linkage of housing and supportive services       for such individuals and families to ensure continuity of       care, to the extent allowable under State Law;        ``(2) if the public housing agency takes appropriate       measures to ensure that the privacy of the individuals and       families is protected and that the information, including any       personally identifiable information, is used only for the       purpose described in paragraph (1); and        ``(3) if the public housing agency takes appropriate       measures to ensure clients' information and confidentiality       is protected pursuant to section 41411(c)(4) of the Violence       Against Women Act of 1994 (34 U.S.C. 12491(c)(4)), and any       regulations promulgated pursuant to such section.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material  thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4302, the Homeless  Assistance Act of 2019. This bill would allow public housing agencies  to share data exclusively with local continuums of care to better  coordinate housing and supportive services for people experiencing  homelessness.   Homelessness has reached a crisis level in our country and continues  to grow. According to HUD's newly released point-in-time count, over  568,000 people have experienced homelessness on any given night in  2019, representing a 3 percent increase from the previous year.  California, for example, saw a 21 percent increase in homelessness and  the city of Los Angeles saw a 13 percent increase.   These homelessness issues, Madam Speaker, extend not just throughout  our 50 United States but into our various territories as well.   Given the growing crisis, we need every tool in the toolbox to help.  Sharing data between local agencies to help coordinate housing  placements and services is one of those tools.   While local governments are working hard to help people experiencing  homelessness, bureaucracy can get in the way. Individuals often have to  resubmit the same information and paperwork to various local agencies  when seeking assistance, which can delay or prevent them from getting  the help they need.   H.R. 4302, the Homeless Assistance Act, would help remove this  barrier so that public housing authorities and continuums of care can  share data and target appropriate interventions to improve the  collaboration and coordination of housing and supportive services.   This type of information sharing and coordination can ultimately help  reduce the overall number of people experiencing homelessness. In fact,  research from the Pew Institute demonstrated that data sharing among  agencies reduced the number of veterans experiencing homelessness.   This legislation also takes a special precaution to ensure the  privacy of individuals whose information is being shared, especially  victims of domestic violence. It is not made public.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Sherman, for introducing  this critical legislation, which I know will be very helpful to local  entities across the country that are doing everything they can to deal  with the homelessness crisis.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on this important  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   H.R. 4302 is important legislation that will better assist local  agencies in coordinating and providing services to people experiencing  homelessness.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important piece of legislation. I thank our colleagues on the other  side of the aisle for their support as well.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 4335) to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to  require the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue rules that  prohibit officers and directors of certain companies from trading  securities in anticipation of a current report, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4335         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``8-K Trading Gap Act of       2019''.       SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN TRADING IN ANTICIPATION OF A                     CURRENT REPORT.         The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.)       is amended by inserting after section 10D the following:       ``SEC. 10E. PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN TRADING IN ANTICIPATION OF                     A CURRENT REPORT.         ``(a) Prohibition.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this section, the Commission shall issue rules       that require each issuer that is subject to reporting       requirements under section 13(a) or 15(d) to establish and       maintain policies, controls, and procedures that are       reasonably designed to prohibit executive officers and       directors of the issuer from purchasing, selling, or       otherwise transferring any equity security of the issuer,       directly or indirectly--        ``(1) with respect to an event described in sections 1       through 6 of Form 8-K, between--        ``(A) the occurrence of such event; and        ``(B) the filing or furnishing of a current report on Form       8-K with respect to such event; and        ``(2) with respect to an event described in section 7 or 8       of Form 8-K, between--        ``(A) the date on which the issuer determines that it will       disclose such event; and        ``(B) the filing or furnishing of a current report on Form       8-K with respect to such event.        ``(b) Permissible Transactions.--In issuing rules under       subsection (a), the Commission--        ``(1) may exempt certain transactions that the Commission       determines is appropriate, including those that--        ``(A) occur automatically;        ``(B) are made pursuant to an advance election; or        ``(C) except as provided in paragraph (2), involve a       purchase or sale of equity securities that satisfies the       conditions under section 240.10b5-1(c) of title 17, Code of       Federal Regulations;        ``(2) may not exempt from those rules a transaction made by       an executive officer or director of an issuer under a plan       that--        ``(A) is described in section 240.10b5-1(c)(1)(i)(A)(3) of       title 17, Code of Federal Regulations; and        ``(B) was adopted--        ``(i) with respect to an event described in sections 1       through 6 of Form 8-K, between--         ``(I) the occurrence of such event; and        ``(II) the filing or furnishing of a current report on Form       8-K with respect to such event; and         ``(ii) with respect to an event described in section 7 or 8       of Form 8-K, between--         ``(I) the date on which the issuer determines that it will       disclose such event; and        ``(II) the filing or furnishing of a current report on Form       8-K with respect to such event; and         ``(3) shall exempt from those rules--        ``(A) issuers required to adopt and administer a code of       ethics pursuant section 270.17j-1 of title 17, Code of       Federal Regulations, and any other issuers registered under       the Investment Company Act of 1940 whose investment advisers       are required to adopt and administer a code of ethics       pursuant to section 275.204A-1 of title 17, Code of Federal       Regulations; and        ``(B) any event where such event is described in sections 1       through 6 of Form 8-K and the issuer has announced such event       in a press release or other method of dissemination that       complies with the requirements of section 101(e)(2) of       Regulation FD (17 C.F.R. Part 243.101(e)(2)).''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material  thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Maloney, the chair of the  Committee on Oversight and Reform and a member of the Financial  Services Committee, for authoring H.R. 4335, the 8-K Trading Gap Act, a  commonsense bill that would close a loophole in our securities laws  that has been exploited by corporate insiders.   Currently, public companies must disclose significant corporate  events, such as bankruptcy or major cybersecurity hacks, to investors  and the public on Form 8-K. However, the law gives them 4 business days  after the event occurs to make this disclosure. As a result, corporate  executives have the benefit of knowing material, nonpublic information  for 4 days before investors and the rest of the public.   This is a problem because there is no rule prohibiting these  executives from buying or selling the company's securities during this  4-day gap, and there is evidence that certain executives have done so  and profited handsomely. According to a 2015 study, over a 6-year  period, insiders who traded during this 4-day gap successfully earned  $105 million in above-market returns on these trades.   H.R. 4335, the 8-K Trading Gap Act, fixes this loophole by requiring  public companies to put in place policies and procedures that are  reasonably designed to prohibit officers and directors from trading  company stock after the company has determined that a significant  corporate event has occurred and before the company has filed a Form 8- K disclosing such event.   I support this commonsense fix and encourage my colleagues to join me  in supporting the bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), chairwoman of the Oversight  and Reform Committee and the sponsor of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, investor confidence and market integrity are built on  the premise that our markets are fair and transparent. H.R. 4335 will  help ensure that this is the case by preventing corporate insiders from  unfairly taking advantage of significant corporate events before they  are disclosed to the public.   For that reason, the bill is supported by investor groups, like the  Council of Institutional Investors, as well as our State securities  regulators, which are represented by the North American Securities  Administrators Association.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in their  support of H.R. 4335. I thank our colleagues on the other side of the  aisle for their support.   With publicly traded companies, Madam Speaker, nobody should have an  advantage over the public. I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
