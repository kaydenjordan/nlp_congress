 Madam Speaker, I rise today to stand against  the vile war for reproductive rights of the women in America.  [[Page H6639]]    Just under 50 years ago, Roe v. Wade established that every woman  holds autonomy over her own body and her reproductive choices. To  reject this critical ruling one-half century later at a time when  America's maternal healthcare standards are so disgracefully abysmal,  particularly for Black and Brown women, is as hateful as it is cruel.   We will not stand for this blatant and brazen attempt to control  women. We will not stand for yet another assault that diminishes women  by taking away their autonomy of their bodies. We will not stand by and  watch extremists erase us from our Constitutional protections.   No. We will not stand for it today. I and my Democratic colleagues  will pass the Women's Health Protection Act of 2022 and the Ensuring  Women's Right to Reproductive Freedom Act of 2022.   Madam Speaker, I urge our Senators to find the compassion, courage,  and their humanity for the women of America by doing the same.
