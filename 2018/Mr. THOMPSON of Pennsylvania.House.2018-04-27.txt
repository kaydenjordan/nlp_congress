 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today during  National Park Week to celebrate America's treasures, our national  parks.   For 1 week each April, the National Park Service joins with the  National Park Foundation, the official charity of America's national  parks, to celebrate National Park Week. This is a time to explore  amazing places, discover stories of history and culture, and take in  all the beautiful public lands our Nation has to offer.   National Park Week began last Saturday, April 21, and runs through  Sunday, April 29. The theme for National Park Week in 2018 is ``Park  Stars,'' celebrating everything from starry skies to superstar  volunteers, park features, and resources.   Parks, programs, and partners nationwide invite people everywhere to  explore stories, experiences, and sites that brighten the national park  system and public lands. Parks across the  [[Page H3710]]  country have hosted a variety of events throughout the week. Today is  Military and Veteran Recognition Day. The National Park Service employs  more than 5,800 Active-Duty veterans in a wide array of careers.   Mr. Speaker, our national parks are truly remarkable, and I encourage  everyone to experience their breathtaking beauty.   Happy National Park Week.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking  member for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   We have been down this road before, and yet, again, we are witnessing  attempts to remove rural America's connectivity to the national air  transportation system. Those who would look to scrap the Essential Air  Service program often fail to acknowledge reforms that have been put in  place to modernize and streamline the program. This reauthorization  does the same.   Mr. Chairman, for too long, rural America has received the scraps of  our suburban and urban counterparts. Last year, the Airport Improvement  Program, another program, not the Essential Air Service, issued more  than $264 million in grants to 95 airports in 31 States.   Among them, $2 million was issued for Sacramento International  Airport in Sacramento, California, to purchase five zero-emission  electric shuttle buses to take passengers between the airport parking  lots and the terminal buildings. Mr. Chairman, these types of projects  are nice, but the fact is that $2 million is about equal to the amount  a small rural airport requires for commercial service for 2 years.   Let's get serious here. Striking the Essential Air Service program is  bad for rural America. It is time to stop the witch hunt on rural  America.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.
