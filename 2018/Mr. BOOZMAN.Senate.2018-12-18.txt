 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  career of Edward ``Sandy'' Sanders who is retiring as Mayor of Fort  Smith, AR, capping a lifetime of service in the public and private  sectors.   Sandy Sanders received his bachelor's and master's degrees from the  University of Oklahoma and spent 32 years with Whirlpool Corporation,  retiring as the human resources manager in the Fort Smith Division.  During his corporate career, Sandy was well known as a volunteer and  leader among countless community organizations and events. Locally he  served as the chair and president of numerous charitable boards  including the Fort Smith Symphony, the Old Fort Days Rodeo, Bost Human  Development Center, Leadership Fort Smith Alumni, the Fort Smith Port  Authority, and the Fort Smith Park Board.   His leadership skills were also appreciated at the State level and  beyond. He was appointed by the Governor to the Arkansas Aeronautic  Association and also served as President of the Arkansas-Louisiana  District Exchange Clubs and National President of the Association of  Community College Trustees.   Sandy has always looked for ways to improve opportunities for young  people and create a well-educated workforce. His efforts included  serving on the Governor's Apprenticeship Coordination Steering  Committee and the Southern States Apprenticeship Committee. He was a  member of the board of directors of the Fort Smith Chamber of Commerce  and continuously provided a bridge between business and community  needs.   After his retirement from Whirlpool, Sanders was called over and over  to fill positions of need in the community. First, as interim director  of the Children's Emergency Shelter and then as first executive  director of the Fort Chaffee Redevelopment Authority, which was created  to transition former military property into a job-creating asset for  the region. This was supposed to be a temporary position, but Sandy  stayed for 6 years and laid the groundwork for what we now know as  Chaffee Crossing.   He probably thought he was officially retired when he left that  position. However, the community called again, this time to run for  public office. Sandy was elected mayor of Fort Smith in 2010. His  combination of experience in the private and public sectors made him  the ideal person to lead the city, help the area attract new jobs and  improve services to the community. During his tenure, the city has seen  impressive growth and success in business and the arts.   I know he is especially proud of the events he led during his last  year in office to celebrate Fort Smith's bicentennial. In many ways,  his leadership illustrates everything he hoped to highlight about the  city. He has a rich history in the area, but has always looked forward.   Sandy has received many accolades for his work over the years, but I  know from our visits that he is more interested in the success of  others. His work to promote education and provide opportunities for  young people will continue to benefit generations to come.   He is a man of great faith who uses his gifts however they are needed  at St. Luke's Lutheran Church, whether that is serving on the building  committee or singing in the choir. He and his wife, Dr. Sandi Sanders,  have been married for 54 years and are very proud of their two  daughters and six grandchildren. Beyond all of his personal  accomplishments, he would tell you that his family is his greatest  legacy.   I appreciate Sandy's friendship and am grateful for his years of  service and efforts devoted to the State of Arkansas.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 424, S. 2200.
