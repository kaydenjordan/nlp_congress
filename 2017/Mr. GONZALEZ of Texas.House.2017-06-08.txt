 Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking Member Waters  for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, today I rise in opposition to H.R. 10.   While this bill may contain some language that I would agree with and  that is helpful to our community banks, as well as some of our credit  unions, it would be very harmful to our seniors and the elderly.   Additionally, the Financial CHOICE Act, as written, would be dead on  arrival in the U.S. Senate and a monumental waste of time for this  Chamber. As a public servant, we are called to serve the citizens of  our great Nation, those who raised us; those who consistently told us,  ``it is more important to have the will than to have mere ability,''  ``hace mas el que quiere que el que puede;'' those who forged a new  path and a better way of life.   One of the best measures of a nation is how it cares for its elderly.  As a country, we made a promise to our elderly, to protect them and  ensure that they would have reliable access to resources, and the  support they need to live a dignified life in their later years.   In my book, a promise made should be a promise kept.   Today, my colleagues in support of the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act seek to  renege on this promise and leave millions of elderly Americans  vulnerable to financial exploitation schemes. One in every five  Americans have been victims of financial abuse, accounting for a cost  of over $36 billion annually. We cannot abandon our elderly when their  resources and, ultimately, their independence is threatened. We must  stand with them and enable the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to  continue to protect our elderly.
