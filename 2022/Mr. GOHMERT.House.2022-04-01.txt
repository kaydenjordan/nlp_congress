 Madam Speaker, there is so much going on these days, so  much to comment on. At this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from Iowa  (Mrs. Miller-Meeks), my friend, whenever she is ready.                     Kevin McKee Is an Incredible Athlete     Madam Speaker, I notice the skill and adroitness of Mrs.  Miller-Meeks making her way hurriedly around the rows, through the  rows. She must have picked up something from such a great sled hockey  player.   Madam Speaker, I want to turn my attention to some recent criticisms  of an amazing man. I agree with some who have clerked at the Supreme  Court, that Justice Clarence Thomas may be easily the most intelligent  Justice on the Court. That fact actually turned him from his days at  Yale Law School--actually he started at Harvard for, I think, a day or  so, but he felt like Harvard was too conservative, so he dropped out  and applied to Yale and was pleased it seemed more liberal in its  thinking.                                time  1315    But Yale was able to take a brilliant person like that, and according  to his book, he began to notice how liberals who were White seemed to  look down on him with an arrogant view of Clarence Thomas that, gee, if  it weren't for us liberals, a Black man like Clarence Thomas would not  have even gotten into this school, when actually he had the raw  intelligence to do that regardless and had done well everywhere he had  been, including Holy Cross when he originally went there thinking he  might be a priest at some point. Those are my recollections from his  autobiography, a splendid read, ``My Grandfather's Son.''   That kind of arrogance, looking down on him like he couldn't do this  on his own if it weren't for us liberals, turned him off. That, along  with other issues, drove him to become quite conservative.   The clarity with which he sees issues is a real treasure for the U.S.  Supreme Court.   Now, just as when he was nominated to the Supreme Court, he has come  under grave attacks from these same liberals that used to look down on  him when he was a liberal, thinking he couldn't possibly be as smart as  they were when, actually, he exceeded their level of intelligence.   That was what was called a soft form of discrimination. What he  experienced in the hearings for his confirmation and since he has been  on the U.S. Supreme Court, clearly, has not been soft discrimination.  It has been overt, radical, mean-spirited, evil discrimination. Nothing  soft about it. How dare that man come off the plantation and dare to  have any point of view that was not provided to him by other liberals?  The man thinks for himself, and he is brilliant.   These same liberals that are now coming after him seek not only to  discriminate against him because he is a Black conservative who is  brilliant, but they also want to assert a marriage penalty against him  because his wife also thinks for herself.   Now, there is a great article written by Mark Paoletta, and this is  dated March 11. I won't go through the whole article, but he says:  ``D.C. Circuit Judge Nina Pillard, for example, voted not to rehear a  case rejecting President Trump's refusal to produce his tax returns in  response to a congressional subpoena. That was exactly what her  husband, the ACLU's litigation director, advocated in an article  reviewing the lower court decision.''   Now, Justice Thomas is being told he needs to recuse himself because  he has a wife who thinks for herself. We can't have that, these  liberals say. Yet, the hypocrisy rises higher and higher with every  comment they make about Justice Thomas and/or his wife.   ``Ninth Circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt, a liberal icon, participated  in a case even after his wife, the chief of an ACLU chapter, commented  on the lower court opinion. Her ACLU chapter even submitted a brief to  the district court. Reinhardt defended his decision not to recuse,  writing his wife's `views are hers, not mine, and I do not in any way  condition my opinions on the positions she takes regarding any  issues,''' even though he took the same position that his wife took.   The article said: ``Ethics experts defended Reinhardt's decision,  noting that `Judge Reinhardt is not presumed to be the reservoir and  carrier of his wife's beliefs. . . . A contrary outcome would deem a  judge's spouse unable to hold most any position of advocacy, creating  what amounts to a marriage penalty.' ''   Exactly. And liberals will not apply that standard to liberals, yet  they come after Justice Thomas with their fangs bared, viciously  attacking him and his wife.   What happened to the old ideas of liberals being these caring,  compassionate people who would never judge one's spouse by the acts or  thoughts of the other? Well, those have gone by the wayside, and we see  exactly what is at play here.   The article says: ``The Supreme Court has long rejected this  `marriage penalty.' ''   Further down, it says: ``While any lower court can substitute a  recused judge with another judge, there is no one to replace a Supreme  Court Justice who recuses.''   We lost my constitutional law professor in the last year, David  Guinn. He was a tough professor but a great teacher. He continued to be  an incredible resource up to the end of his life. He used to say there  is only one court that owes its existence wholly to the U.S.  Constitution. Of course, that is the U.S. Supreme Court. All other  courts, as he would say, rely completely on the auspices of the  Congress for their existence, for their continued existence, and for  their jurisdiction.   It is interesting to look at this, and it is a great point that is  being made by some scholars. Since the Supreme Court is set up as a  separate branch, that is actually the one that Congress does not have  authority to set up rules for recusal, for the Supreme Court.   In this article, Mr. Paoletta says: ``Consistent with the Court's  policy, even though Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's husband, Marty  Ginsburg, practiced law at a firm that represented parties before the  Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg never recused herself. Law professor  Jane Ginsburg, the Justice's daughter, wrote an article about a case  pending before the Supreme Court. The petitioner cited Jane's article  in its brief, and Justice Ginsburg voted for the result advocated by  her daughter.   ``Marty Ginsburg solved a complex tax problem for his client, Ross  Perot's company EDS, and Perot endowed a chair named after Marty  Ginsburg at Georgetown University Law Center. When Perot and EDS  appeared several times before the Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg did  not recuse. Nor was she required to.''   I would add, nor did any of these people attacking the Black  conservative, Justice Thomas, bother to advocate their new position  back then.   ``If reporters mean to tighten recusal standards, they should prepare  to levy a marriage penalty on all judges' spouses, not just the  Thomases.   ``But the press now singles out Justice Thomas, calling on him to  recuse because of his wife's activities. Ginni Thomas is a longtime  conservative activist who works with groups that take public  positions on issues and sometimes even file amicus briefs at the  Supreme Court. But unlike the spouses and children of other judges,  Ginni does not practice law, much less write briefs. She merely builds  conservative coalitions to pursue shared political aims. None of her  activities require Justice Thomas to recuse.    ``Even so, the press criticized Ginni Thomas for honoring  conservative leaders at an awards luncheon because those individuals  subsequently filed amicus briefs at the Supreme Court. Historically,  this has not required recusal. Ginsburg once donated an autographed  copy of her VMI opinion to the pro-abortion NOW Political Action  Committee, which auctioned off the opinion at a fundraiser in 1997.  Moreover, in 2004, she spoke at a lecture named after herself for the  NOW Legal Defense Fund''--that is, the National Organization for  Women--``on whose board she served in the 1970s. Two weeks before that  lecture, Justice Ginsburg voted in favor of a position advocated by the  NOW Legal Defense Fund in an amicus brief.   ``None of those activities required Ginsburg to recuse, but the press  has  [[Page H4121]]  attacked Thomas for stoking concerns of a hyperpartisan court by  attending conservative events. Thomas' critics conveniently ignore the  numerous instances of liberal Justices attending similar events, such  as Justice Sotomayor giving speeches to the liberal American  Constitution Society.   ``These recent stories have also ignored Justice Ginsburg's partisan  attack on Donald Trump during the 2016 Presidential campaign. The  Justice called him `a faker' and criticized him for not disclosing his  tax returns. She even voiced concerns about Trump being President. The  day after he was elected, Ginsburg again objected by wearing a collar  that traditionally signaled she would be dissenting in a case, though  there were no cases handed down that day. Yet, she sat on a case  challenging a congressional subpoena for President Trump's tax returns,  and she decided plenty of other cases involving President Trump and his  administration. No one talked of impeaching Justice Ginsburg for her  conduct.   ``The media are weaponizing baseless ethics charges to smear a  conservative Black Justice. Thomas infuriates them because he expresses  views they consider unacceptable for a Black man to hold, and because  an increasing number of Justices are aligned with those views and may  be ready to issue rulings that undercut longstanding liberal  precedents. But going after his wife is despicable. And it won't  work.''   It is also interesting that the majority in H.R. 1 attempts to go  after--without naming Justice Thomas, it requires the Judicial  Conference of the United States, which is chaired by the Chief Justice,  to establish a mandatory code of conduct for the Justices of the U.S.  Supreme Court. This is potentially unconstitutional. This is according  to testimony before Congress by Hans von Spakovsky.   He makes a good point: ``Article III states that the `judicial power  of the United States shall be vested in one supreme court and in such  inferior courts as Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.  . . . The Constitution, not Congress, created the Supreme Court. It is  an independent, coequal branch. In the same way that the Justices  cannot dictate what ethics rules apply to Members of Congress or the  President, it is highly questionable whether Congress can dictate the  ethics rules that apply to the Supreme Court.''                                time  1330    Since the Judicial Conference was established by Congress, ``for the  benefit of the courts it had created,'' and ``is an instrument for the  management of the lower Federal courts, its committees have no mandate  to prescribe rules or standards for any other body.''   According to the Chief Justice, Justices use the current code of  conduct for the lower courts as guidance as well as ``a wide variety of  other authorities to resolve specific ethics' issues.''   The Supreme Court has ``never addressed whether Congress may impose  those requirements on the Supreme Court.'' But a serious constitutional  problem under Article III with Congress trying to impose such mandates  on the Justices, although they comply with the current provisions  voluntarily.   So very good points, but just interesting how selective things have  gotten.   Now, most judges and most judicial standards will indicate that if a  Justice has spoken out and taken a position on a case that has come or  is before the Court, it indicates an opinion before the case has  concluded that that Justice should be recused. But we know two of the  Supreme Court Justices actually appeared, performed same-sex weddings  before they came out with their opinion. So that certainly seems to  raise questions that people attacking Justice Thomas never actually  raised back during those days.   It was interesting to be in here and hear the colloquy between the  majority leader and the minority whip and hear the majority leader go  back to the allegations raised by President Biden about all these  leases that are not being utilized for drilling. Quite interesting,  because there are some very legitimate reasons about why they are not  utilized. And one of the things that has done tremendous damage to  investment in additional wells, one thing, there has been encouragement  for banks to look the other way. Do not get involved in fossil fuel  development, which is rather interesting; could lead to our own demise  as a Republic when we have been the most blessed country when it comes  to natural resources of any country of which I am aware.   Our world is jealous. And yet, we routinely put off-limits those very  resources we desperately need, even though we produce them more cleanly  for the environment than any other country that we are buying them  from, particularly China, Russia, others that have gotten control--some  in Africa.   But one article here by Peter Hasson about ``Biden's Misleading Spin  About Oil Production Under Him vs. Trump.'' ``But the White House's  framing omits a key fact: while domestic oil production in 2021 was  higher than it was in 2017, it was lower than it was in 2018, 2019, and  2020, Federal statistics show.''   And the significant reason for that is that drilling doesn't occur  overnight. Production doesn't occur overnight. It is a work in  progress. So that one President, when he comes into office, actually  inherits the preparation to drill or the killing of drilling by the  prior President.   So when President Trump took office, his first year, the drilling and  production numbers were a result of what had happened before he took  office. And thus, when President Biden takes credit for production  numbers in his first year, of course, he doesn't want to acknowledge  it, but those were the results of actions taken during the Trump  administration. But after that, he does deserve to get credit for the  damage or the good that is done.   An article by Thomas Barrabi and Ariel Zilber points that, ``If  President Joe Biden came out forcefully on the side of increasing U.S.  oil production, the price of a barrel could fall quickly, experts told  The Post--even if it takes a while to bring that new energy online.  Just looked at what happened Wednesday''--this article is from March  9--``in the wake of the United Arab Emirates and Iraq saying they'd up  production by an estimated 800,000 barrels a day: The global price of  oil dropped by $22 a barrel within minutes.   ``If Biden signaled full-throated support for U.S. drillers to get to  work--and perhaps allowed the restarting of the Keystone XL pipeline  from Canada--global oil prices could similarly fall sharply, the  industry experts told The Post.''   And I have noticed that when there is good news about the production  of oil or natural gas, that the price doesn't fall quite as quickly as  it goes up after bad news, but it should be noted that after years of  not replacing oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve of oil, the SPR,  President Trump not only saw to it that America became energy  independent for the first time in decades, but they started putting oil  in that Strategic Petroleum Reserve, so that in the event of an  emergency, we would have oil to keep going.   It was not put there for a President that has done damage to our  ability to produce what we need, to try to get out from under the  criticisms from people that can't afford where he has driven the price  of energy. And in fact, I would humbly submit that by President Biden's  starting to take a million barrels of oil per day from that Strategic  Petroleum Reserve, he is setting America up for a catastrophe. Because  there are interruptions in the production of oil and natural gas. They  come time to time, and especially when there is war activity.   Now, President Biden used a claim that there is a wartime emergency.  Yet, under our Constitution, only the U.S. Congress has the authority  to declare war, and no such war has been declared. And in fact,  President Biden has made very clear, we are not putting troops in  Ukraine.   And I was hearing on the news today that actually things that were  announced by this administration that would be helping Ukraine fight  off Russia have not arrived. There were announcements, but the help  that was supposed to be coming from the United States has not come that  will help them fight off Russia.   So we can hear all the grand pronouncements about how evil Putin is.  But at times, they are just that. They are pronouncements.   Because we are not giving the help to Ukraine that is being promised.  Is this some kind of show without putting actions behind it? A lot of  Ukrainians  [[Page H4122]]  think so when they look at the Biden administration. Because they are  desperate. They are fighting with all they have.    I heard the majority leader casting aspersions at Republicans  thinking Putin is some great guy. He is a thug.   And yet, who was it that put back in Putin's head that the United  States has no problem with him attacking innocent countries and  invading innocent countries? Well, we can go back in the second half of  the Bush administration, George W. Bush administration, when President  Bush and Secretary Condoleezza Rice got upset, as many of us did, when  Putin's Russia invaded the country of Georgia. And he slapped some very  serious sanctions on Russia to try to send a message: Don't go invading  other countries.   So when Biden became Vice President, Obama became President, one of  the first things they did, they sent a Secretary of State named Clinton  with a red plastic button that they misnamed in Russian. They meant to  call it a reset button. But the people working for the Obama/Biden  administration and for Secretary Clinton were not smart enough to  properly translate the word, so it didn't mean reset.   But they went over there with the intention of sending a message that  President Bush, he overreacted when you attacked Georgia. And the  message from Obama, Biden, Clinton was, We won't overreact like that  when you invade countries you shouldn't. We won't. We don't have a  problem with it. That was Bush. That was Condoleezza Rice. They had a  problem with your invading Georgia, but we don't have a problem like  that.   What was Putin supposed to think? Exactly what he thought.   Number one, this Biden, Obama, Clinton, they are weak people. And  they are giving me a green light to invade Crimea, which he did. And  what happened? Nothing. The Obama/Biden administration sent blankets  over there. It is hard to stop a tank with a blanket; that is what was  sent.   But Putin got that message. And then Trump comes in. And he can say  flattering things about Putin, but he knew that Putin is not stupid,  and he knew that he could be vicious, and he made very clear, you don't  invade under my administration, or you will pay a big price. But once  President Trump was gone, and we got back to the old policies of the  Obama/Biden administration, Putin knew he had a President that he could  push around. And that was accented when President Biden telegraphed  that we could be okay with a minor incursion. If it is just a small  invasion, we probably wouldn't even react. That was the message that  was heard in Russia.   And at times, it is almost as if there are people in this  administration that have been paid off by Russia.                                time  1345    Well, I guess some people in the Biden family have been paid off, but  that is another matter. At times, though, it does seem like with the  change in policy of standing firmly against China's devastating  activity when it comes to stealing our secrets, patents, and  copyrights, and the lack of action by this administration, it does seem  like, gee, it makes you wonder if somebody is getting paid off in this  administration. Then you realize, oh, yeah, the Biden family has made a  lot of money from China.   People want to talk about maybe Clarence Thomas should recuse  himself, I wish they would apply those standards to people who benefit  in this administration from the failure to stop China.   In any event, just mark my words, this administration, President  Biden, releasing a million barrels of oil a day from our strategic  petroleum reserve is really going to come back to hurt us. When we are  in an emergency situation and we need that oil, it is not going to be  there because President Biden was hoping he could ameliorate some of  the anger of voters by the prices that we are seeing at the gas pump  and the prices we are seeing in inflation.   That is the thing, when energy prices go up, it affects every price;  because food, the things we use to stay warm or to house ourselves,  even electric cars cannot be produced without the use of fossil fuel-- can't--they will some day, but they can't right now. You got to have  fossil fuel or you cannot make a car; not for production, not cheap  enough to be bought by the American public.   Since I have been here in Congress, I filed a bill to have a huge  cash prize to anyone who could develop the type of battery, capacitor,  some way to hold megawattage of electricity for at least 30 days  without significant loss. One of these days somebody is going to come  up with that, an ability to hold electric. When that happens, we won't  need fossil fuel at all. Whoever comes up with a way to do that is  going to be mega wealthy.   Once we have that ability, we should be able to capture lightening.  There are all kinds of ways we can have energy. I have been told, oh,  no, we already can capture energy because some place they have water in  a lower reservoir and during off-peak time they pump the water up to a  higher reservoir so that during peak times they have the water flow  down and that turns turbines and that produces electricity. That is  storing energy, but it is not storing electricity.   That energy has to then be converted back into electricity by turning  the turbines. Some day we are going to have the ability to have energy  held in massive quantities, but right now we don't have that ability.   The batteries that are being used in vehicles, we are heading for all  kinds of headaches when enough people buy electric vehicles and we have  to do something with all of those toxic batteries. It is going to be  bad. It is going to be horrendous for the environment if too many  people start buying electric vehicles.   There is a great article by Kevin O'Scannlain in March of this year  titled ``The Red-Herring of Unused Leases,'' which is what the majority  leader brought up. It says: ``The fact is, natural gas and oil  companies hold numbers of `nonproducing' leases--which is far different  from the claim of `unused' leases mentioned by the White House,'' and  by our majority leader.   Here are some key numbers: 1,548, that is the number of nonproducing  offshore leases, according to the Federal Bureau of Ocean Energy  Management; 13,000, that is the approximate number of nonproducing  onshore leases, according to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management:   ``Context: `Nonproducing' means exactly that. These are leases that  have not yet been developed to the point of actual production--the  average time from onshore lease sale to production is 3 to 4 years; 7  to 10 years for offshore leases--and those that have not produced  commercial volumes of oil and gas.''   ``Polling released last week shows that Americans know the stakes  involved overseas and at home. They overwhelmingly support--by a 90  percent margin--increased U.S. production over reliance on foreign  energy. That means lawmakers and regulators need to address that.''   ``The first, by some members of the Biden administration, including  White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Thursday, is that American oil  and natural gas producers are sitting on hundreds of unused Federal  leases and do not need access to more. The second, by some industry  opponents, is that ramping up U.S. production will not help the  Ukrainian people today.   ``Psaki has made the claim about `unused' Federal leases before. It  has become a line at the White House pivots to when pressed to explain  why it isn't doing more to support American oil and gas production-- with soaring demand putting upward pressure on prices and with much of  Europe at the mercy of its top energy provider, Russia.''   Here are key facts about Federal leases:   ``The law already requires companies to either produce oil and/or gas  on leases or return the leases to the government--the so-called `use it  or lose it' provision. . . . `' It is already in there. Generally, it  is required in the first 10 years.   ``When a company acquires a lease, it makes a significant financial  investment at the beginning of the lease in the form of a nonrefundable  bonus bid and pays additional rent until and unless it begins  producing.   ``For Federal onshore, the Mineral Leasing Act prevents any one  company from locking up unproductive excessive Federal acreage.  [[Page H4123]]    ``Developing a lease takes years and substantial effort to determine  whether the underlying geology holds commercial quantities of oil and  gas. The lengthy process to develop them from a lease is often extended  by administrative and legal challenges at every step along the way.''   Every company is familiar with lawfare, going to court, being drug  repeatedly into court to stop the use of a lease.   ``The argument about `unused' leases is a red-herring, a smokescreen  for energy policies that have had a hamstringing effect on the world's  leading producer of natural gas and oil. It suggests American producers  have been motivated by desire to manipulate the market during the  current crisis in Europe. This is false. American oil and gas producers  are able and willing to do their part to support American energy  leadership, including providing energy that can help allies abroad.    ``Ultimately, energy policies affect the energy investment climate.  Specifically, they impact the ability of producers--typically  accountable to shareholders--to take the risks involved in spending  billions of dollars to find and develop oil and gas. Mischaracterizing  the way Federal leases work does not help foster new investment and  risk-taking.''   ``The time for helping Ukraine with American energy was months ago.  Then, the Biden administration support for robust U.S. production might  have helped deter Moscow from thinking that European nations were so  dependent on Russian energy might do less to oppose Russia the  aggressor.   ``Instead, the administration discouraged American energy. For more  than a year it has halted new Federal leasing--key to future energy  investment and production. It canceled energy infrastructure, blocked  development in parts of Alaska, entertained new taxes to punish the  U.S. energy industry and chilled future investment by signaling that  oil and gas would not be part of America's future energy mix. All last  summer, the administration called on OPEC+, the oil cartel, to increase  its production more rapidly in the face of rising energy costs,  bypassing the American producers.''   Let me go back and readdress ANWR. We lost Don Young. We had a  wonderful service and tribute to him. It was a great funeral, a great  service for a great man. I got to sit beside Don Young for years in the  Natural Resources Committee because I became the second most senior  person on Natural Resources. Since I made Republican leaders mad, they  were not going to allow me to be chairman, and we sit by seniority, so  I sat by Don Young for years.   Don would get so upset when people would pretend to speak for Tribal  groups in Alaska or for the Alaskan people, and say, they don't want  ANWR--well, there was one little Tribe that didn't, but the rest sure  did. He would take Members of Congress on trips to ANWR. So much of the  Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, that area that was designated by the  Carter administration, it is beautiful, it is pristine, there is  wildlife in abundance.   Don always wanted to make sure that anybody that would listen and  cared to know the truth could see for themselves in Alaska--here is  this massive wildlife area that has been set apart by Congress. Well,  here is this little bitty area comparatively where the Carter  administration said: You know what, there is nothing there. Nothing can  live there. This is a great spot, and we will allow drilling here. For  decades, drilling was not allowed in the one place that it would have  been okay to have drilling.   When the Trump administration says, hey, there was a designated  place. And despite commercials where you see all this wonderful  wildlife, that is not in the part designated for drilling. All the  beautiful mountains and all, that is not the part designated by  President Carter for drilling. It would bless the heck out of Alaska  and their people because of the revenue it would bring.   It would be a blessing for America to further be independent and to  further have the ability to encourage countries like Ukraine, and to  discourage countries like Russia from picking on them because we have  enough of the energy needs, we can fill enough energy needs. They don't  have to worry about begging a ruthless dictator, like Putin has become.   Yet, year after year we have had people trying to stop it, and then  once Biden was sworn in as President he did the same thing. No, we are  going to put that back off limit. It is really a shame.   This article says: ``The current situation is a reminder that  American energy abundance requires foresight and planning, investment  and policy support. This is the path to sound energy policy that keeps  America safe and strong and allows American energy to support allies.''   I am hoping--since I am not going to be in the next Congress--I am  hoping that the bill I filed years ago that would provide a big cash  prize to whoever comes up with the method of storing massive amounts of  electricity for long periods of time efficiently, I am hoping that that  won't be so futuristic that we couldn't have a majority actually pass  that.                                time  1400    Because once we do that, there is no need for fossil fuels. We will  have all the energy we need, and you could even produce cars. Let's  face it, natural gas is such an important feedstock for so many of the  products we use every day that we have come to rely on as necessities,  as essential, including things in vehicles themselves.   In fact, in Texas, our air and water have been getting cleaner year  by year. A lot of that is due to moving from oil and coal into natural  gas; much cleaner.   In fact, here are some oil and gas facts:   In March of 2020, before the lockdowns began, the United States  reached its highest level of energy production by January 2021. For the  first time in nearly 50 years, U.S. was producing more oil than we were  consuming. In just over a year, we have seen a 4 percent surplus of  domestic oil and gas production fall to a 4 percent oil and gas  deficit.   President Biden directed the Secretary of the Interior to halt new  oil and gas leases on public lands and waters. President Biden canceled  the Keystone XL pipeline which would have transported 830,000 barrels  of oil per day from Alberta to refineries on the Gulf Coast of Texas.   The Biden administration has created significant regulatory  uncertainty by threatening new and excessive burdensome regulations on  the oil and gas industry, including the EPA methane rule and the DOI  waste prevention rule.   The Biden administration has rescinded Trump administration  permitting improvements, including the NEPA reforms, the WOTUS reforms,  and the ESA reforms.   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has failed to approve  natural gas pipeline applications leading to a backlog of pending  applications that discourage economic growth and new energy  development.   The U.S. Department of the Interior scrapped the Trump administration  decision that authorized expanded leasing and development in the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge and the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska.   The price of gasoline has risen from an average of $2.38 under  President Trump to approximately $3.53 today. It is a lot higher than  that. Today I noticed around $5 around here.   This is the largest year-over-year price rise in 30 years and leaves  little room to absorb the impact of potential massive oil and gas  sanctions on Russia.   So those are some facts.   I want to touch on one other matter here. The name of this article is  ``Republicans expose `uncommon' CDC, teachers' unions ties on COVID  school reopening guidance in report.''   This is from Jessica Chasmar, March 30.   ``Republicans accuse Walensky of downplaying the degree to which the  CDC departed from past practice to allow AFT to affect the policymaking  process.''   ``Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, official's  testimony claiming that the agency coordinated with teachers' unions at  an extraordinary level in crafting its school reopening guidance,  despite the agency's earlier claims that such coordination was routine  and nonpolitical.''   ``Republicans wrote that emails between the American Federation of  [[Page H4124]]  Teachers, the White House, and the CDC showed that the AFT's `cozy  relationship with the Biden administration's political leadership at  the CDC positioned the union to impose line-by-line edits' to the  reopening guidance, despite the CDC's `past practice to keep draft  guidance confidential.'''   So we find out the mental and physical suffering of children due to 2  years of closed schools in some places, we can, again, go back to some  of the teachers' unions that helped bring that about.   An article from the Daily Caller by Nicole Silverio, apparently NBC  actually edited photos of Lia Thomas to look more like a woman.   That is what Erica Denhoff alleged in the NBC's ``Today'' show, they  photoshopped her work to make transgender swimmer Lia Thomas look more  feminine.   And then this has application to January 6, work by the FBI, we still  need to get to the bottom, those who committed crimes and harmed the  Capitol need to be punished. But those who didn't, so many appear to be  sought and persecuted, not just prosecuted.   It has gotten kind of strange.   But Julie Kelly has a March 10 article about the Governor, Gretchen  Whitmer, an alleged kidnapping plot, and the trial that was going on  about that.   ``After it became clear during opening statements that the defense  could not argue their case without explaining the deep involvement of  the FBI's confidential human sources,'' so the judge reversed his  ruling, ``telling the jury that `it won't be possible to draw a line  between the government proving their case and entrapment.'''   ``One FBI official told his supervisor he planned to conduct a  `terrorism enterprise investigation' into the loose band of misfits  with no solid plans, much less the ability, to do anything nefarious at  the time. The alleged ringleader, Adam Fox, lived in the ramshackle  basement of a vacuum repair shop with his two dogs; if he needed to go  to the bathroom or brush his teeth, Fox had to use the facilities at  the Mexican restaurant next door.''   ``Secret gatherings and out-of-town excursions, courtesy of the FBI  and U.S. taxpayers, animated the scheme.''   Then she goes on to explain the extent to which the FBI and U.S.  taxpayers paid to have meetings to try to bring the conspiracy to  kidnap Governor Whitmer into actually going forward.   It really is shocking and does raise a serious question: When you  have a dozen or so FBI informants or employed people, many getting paid  in cash and benefits of tens of thousands of dollars, is it a plot then  by the FBI or is it really a plot by the people who hadn't had the  ability without the FBI to do anything about it?   So it is a sad time when the FBI seems to be using taxpayer resources  to create events that would not happen without their involvement.    So there is a lot of oversight that needs to be done and a lot of  housecleaning that needs to be done. It doesn't look like that will be  happening any time soon.   I am grateful that we are again beginning to see some of our friends  across the aisle getting back to basics and concern about civil rights  that have been abused by government entities.   We have got a lot of work to do, and I hope that we will at least  come together in stopping the Federal Government from being the source  from which criminal plots are made available and potentially real.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
