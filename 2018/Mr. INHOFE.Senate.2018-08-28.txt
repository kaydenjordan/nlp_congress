 Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Judge Charles  Goodwin of Oklahoma City on his confirmation today as a U.S. district  judge for the Western District of Oklahoma. Judge Goodwin most recently  served the Western District as a magistrate judge, and he has done so  admirably and faithfully since his appointment in 2013.   Judge Goodwin's service on the Federal bench, combined with his  career as a civil litigator before various Federal district courts,  U.S. circuit courts of appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court, and as a Federal  law clerk provides him with the experience, knowledge, and perspective  necessary to take on his new role of Federal district court judge.   Furthermore, Judge Goodwin has been a leader on Federal civil  procedure. He served as chair of the Western District's Local Civil  Rules Committee, and, while in private practice, he taught seminars and  authored articles on civil procedure for the Oklahoma Bar Association.  Judge Goodwin is also active in his community, providing legal  assistance to homeless veterans and volunteering in support of the  improvement of public education in Oklahoma.   During the process of looking for capable, well-qualified candidates  for the Western District, my office heard from many people in the  Oklahoma legal community who worked with Judge Goodwin for many years  and know him best. I think these colleagues and legal contemporaries  speak better to the type of man and judge he is, and I would like to  share some of their thoughts with you.   Kevin Donelson, current president of the Oklahoma Bar Association,  wrote, ``I have personally appeared before Magistrate Judge Goodwin on  a number of matters. He has been judicious and courteous in all of the  matters that I have appeared before him. The United States of America  and the Western District of Oklahoma would [be] lucky to have  Magistrate Judge Goodwin be a United States District Judge.''   Seventeen former past presidents of the Oklahoma Bar Association  wrote, ``Each of us knows Charles in person or by reputation and  believes that he is highly qualified for this position. As a lawyer and  a judge, Charles has always exhibited a high degree of ethical conduct,  professionalism, competence, hard work, and, as a judge, exceptional  judicial temperament. We are confident he would make an outstanding  District Judge . . .'' Mr. Harry Wood, a supervisor and then colleague  of Judge Goodwin's at Crowe & Dunlevy, wrote, ``In all my dealings with  him, I found him to be extremely capable, highly dependable, very hard- working, and well organized.'' He went on to say, ``I found him given  to decency, honesty, integrity, even temper and good humor . . . I  cannot think of anyone that has a higher level of character, integrity,  and judicial temperament.'' Mr. Daniel Webber, a former Assistant U.S.  Attorney and U.S. Attorney for the Western District, stated that Judge  Goodwin as a litigator ``had a strong reputation for being a diligent  but ethical advocate. I have never heard his integrity or his  temperament called into question.''   Finally, I will leave you with some words from Chief Judge Joe Heaton  of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. Judge  Heaton wrote, ``I have reviewed various indicators of Judge Goodwin's  productivity, such as the number of reports and recommendations  generated by him and the complexity of the matters assigned to him. I  believe his productivity to be fully comparable with that of the other  magistrate judges of this court.'' Furthermore, Judge Heaton states,  ``Based on his service here and his experience as a partner and  practicing lawyer with one of Oklahoma's largest law firms, I believe  Judge Goodwin is plainly qualified to be a U.S. District Judge.''   Based on Judge Goodwin's experience, expertise, and stature in the  Oklahoma legal community, I have fully supported his nomination as a  U.S. district judge for the Western District of Oklahoma and  congratulate him on his well-deserved confirmation.                            ____________________
