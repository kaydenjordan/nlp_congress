 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1733, which would  update a 2006 Department of Energy report on the energy and  environmental benefits of re-refining used lubricating oil.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1733 represents a commonsense bill aimed at saving  energy and protecting the environment by finding additional ways to  reuse lubricating oil.   Mr. Speaker, these measures may include increasing the collection of  used oil, distributing public information on sustainable reuse, and  encouraging the recycling of used oils.   Mr. Speaker, the U.S. is responsible for almost one-quarter of the  global lubricating oil market; however, unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, we  are currently behind our European counterparts in our ability to  recycle this product.   Mr. Speaker, this bill will help conserve energy and protect the  environment by providing a Federal strategy to re-refine lubricating  oil that can be used in all different types of gas and diesel engines.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my colleague from the Energy and  Commerce Committee, Mrs. Brooks from Indiana, for sponsoring this  bipartisan bill, and I urge all my colleagues to support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2872, the Promoting  Hydropower Development at Existing Nonpowered Dams Act.   Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague from the Energy and Commerce  Committee, Mr. Bucshon from Indiana, for sponsoring this bipartisan  piece of legislation. I would also like to acknowledge the committee  staffs from both the majority and minority sides for working together  in good faith to develop a bill that resolved the differences between  the two sides as we proceeded through the committee process in order to  get the bill onto the floor here today.   Mr. Speaker, I am a huge proponent of hydropower as a safe, reliable,  carbon-free way of providing energy to millions of Americans,  especially when the licensing process is conducted in a reasonable and  transparent manner that takes into account environmental safeguards as  well as the rights and interests of the affected local communities.   Mr. Speaker, I believe that H.R. 2872 encompasses all of these  objections. H.R. 2872 would allow FERC, in consultation with Federal  and State resource agencies, as well as Native American Tribes, to  establish an expedited licensing process for installing hydropower  generation at existing dams that don't produce electricity by exempting  these projects from regulation under the Federal Power Act.   Mr. Speaker, under this bill, FERC would be required to provide a  final decision on license applications within 2 years of receiving a  completed application for new generation projects at nonpowered dams  that are completely constructed as of the date of the bill's enactment  and which aren't generating electricity through hydropower. Eligible  projects, Mr. Speaker, must not result in any material change to the  storage, release, or flow operations of the dam.   H.R. 2872 would also require FERC to establish an interagency task  force, consisting of relevant Federal and State agencies, as well as  Native American Tribes, that would all coordinate the authorizations  necessary to license the facility.   FERC would also be required to gauge the safety of non-Federal dams  under consideration and to require the facility to meet the  Commission's dam safety requirements throughout the term of the  license.   Additionally, Mr. Speaker, FERC would work with the U.S. Army Corps  of Engineers, as well as the Interior and Agriculture Departments, to  develop a list of existing nonpowered federally owned dams with the  greatest potential for non-Federal hydropower development.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2872 would exempt hydropower applicants  from having to pay annual fees associated with the licenses until  construction actually commences on the project.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2872 represents a major step in the right direction  for increasing our ability to issue hydropower permits in a fair,  transparent, and expedited way, and I urge all of my colleagues to  support this notable bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Loebsack), an outstanding member of the  subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2880, the Promoting  Closed-Loop Pumped Storage Hydropower Act.   Mr. Speaker, as I have stated many times before, I am a strong  supporter of hydropower, which provides clean, renewable, carbon-free,  reliable energy for millions of American businesses and households.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I must commend my Energy and Commerce Committee  colleague Mr. Griffin from Virginia for sponsoring this important,  bipartisan piece of legislation. I must also applaud the work of the  committee staff from both sides of the aisle for their tireless work in  negotiating a bill that I believe all Members can fully support.   Mr. Speaker, closed-loop pump hydroelectric storage facilities  operate in a capacity similar to batteries in that when there is a  surplus of energy, water is pumped to an upper reservoir, and when more  energy is needed, that water can then be released to produce  electricity through the use of turbines.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2880 would require FERC to create an expedited  licensing process for closed-loop pumped storage projects within 2  years of receiving a completed application. FERC would also be required  to issue a rule establishing the new process within 180 days of this  bill's enactment.   Mr. Speaker, in order to ensure local stakeholder input and  collaboration, FERC will establish an interagency task force  representing Federal and State agencies, as well as Native American  Tribes, that would coordinate the authorizations needed to license the  facility.   H.R. 2880, Mr. Speaker, would also direct FERC to evaluate the safety  of any dam or other existing structure that would be associated with a  project and specify that potential projects could not cause significant  changes to surface and groundwater uses or adversely impact threatened  or endangered species.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2880 would, for the first time, allow additional  entities, including private partners, to join as co-licensees with  municipalities in order to take advantage of the municipal preference.  That preference would continue for such a private-public partnership  even at the point that the municipality does not retain a majority  interest in the project.   H.R. 2880, Mr. Speaker, also mandates FERC to hold a workshop and  issue guidance within 6 months of enactment to assist license  applicants for closed-loop pumped storage projects at abandoned mine  sites. Mr. Speaker, this provision would allow for these abandoned  mines, many of which may already have the infrastructure in place to  accommodate these projects, to be repurposed, potentially putting  unemployed mining communities back to work.   So, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2880 is a much-needed, bipartisan, critical  piece of legislation that would help to increase the number of low- carbon hydropower projects, while also taking into account the needs  and interests of impacted local stakeholders. I strongly support this  bill, Mr. Speaker, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Peters), another notable outstanding  member of the subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on this side, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
