 Madam President, I rise to express my support for the  substitute amendment to the House message accompanying H.R. 4346, which  is the vehicle for the so-called CHIPS Act.   Semiconductors are crucial to nearly every sector of our economy.  They are in our cars and trucks, medical devices, and 5G  telecommunications equipment. America created the semiconductor  industry in the 1960s. We ceded global leadership in the 1970s. We  regained it, to an extent, in the 1990s but have lost it again. In  1990, the U.S. share of semiconductor manufacturing was 37 percent. By  2020, that share had declined to 12 percent. As Mark Muro and Robert  Maxim of the Brookings Institution recently reported:         While the 1990s saw a significant expansion in U.S.       innovation capacity in semiconductors, the nation's       production capacity continued to decline. In some cases, this       owed to foreign countries out-competing the U.S. on labor       costs. But more can be attributed to the significant       subsidies foreign governments have been providing to build       and maintain fabrication plans--a level of support that the       U.S. hasn't matched.    The Senate is poised, with strong bipartisan support, to get the  United States back on track with respect to domestic semiconductor  manufacturing, which is critical for our national and economic  security. The substitute amendment provides $54 billion in grants to  domestic manufacturers and another $24 billion in tax credits through  the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors--CHIPS--for  America Fund. The substitute amendment also authorizes $102 billion  over the next 5 years for the National Science Foundation--NSF--the  Department of Commerce, and the National Institute of Standards and  Technology--NIST--a $52 billion increase over the Congressional Budget  Office--CBO--baseline.   These funds will be a ``shot in the arm'' for domestic manufacturing;  here is a list of some firms that plan to use funding to expand or  establish manufacturing facilities: Intel and TSMC plan to build  factories in Ohio and Arizona; GlobalFoundries wants to expand a  facility in upstate New York; SkyWater Technology and Purdue University  want to collaborate on a new $1.8 billion factory and research facility  West Lafayette, IN; and IBM and the State University of New York at  Albany want to establish a semiconductor research center in Albany.   While the substitute amendment is necessary, it is not sufficient. It  does not extend the Trade Adjustment Assistance--TAA--Small Business  Innovation Research--SBIR--or Small Business Technology Transfer-- STTR--Programs, for instance.   Fortunately, conferees are still working on those and other  provisions from the Senate-passed United States Innovation and  Competition Act--USICA--and the House-passed America Creating  Opportunities for Manufacturing, Pre-Eminence in Technology, and  Economic Strength--America COMPETES Act. I hope the Senate will have  the opportunity to vote on a conference report that covers many issues  the substitute amendment does not address.   Many Senators have spoken on the floor about the importance of the  semiconductor incentives in division A of the substitute amendment, and  I have just added my voice to that chorus. But I would also like to  highlight the science provisions included in division B, which are also  important. division B authorizes: $20 billion for the first-of-its-kind  NSF Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships, which  will accelerate domestic development of critical national and economic  security technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum  computing, advanced manufacturing, 6G communications, energy, and  material science; $9 billion--$4 billion over the CBO baseline--for  several NIST initiatives and programs, including a tripling of funding  for the Manufacturing Extension Program--MEP--and leverages the MEP to  create a national supply chain database, which will assist businesses  with supplier scouting and minimize supply chain disruptions; and the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration's--NASA--Artemis Program  to return Americans to the Moon as a prelude to sending humans to Mars.   Division B also extends the International Space Station through 2030  and supports a balanced science portfolio, including Earth science  observations and continued development of the Nancy Grace Roman Space  Telescope.   Division B codifies the Planetary Defense Coordination Office and  requires NASA to continue efforts to protect Earth from asteroids and  comets. Just 2 months from now, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test-- DART--will deliberately crash a probe into the minor-planet moon  Dimorphos of the double asteroid Didymos to shift Dimorphos's orbit.  The asteroid poses no actual threat to Earth; it was merely selected  for the test to assess our ability to deflect an asteroid on a  collision course with Earth through kinetic energy.   I introduced the Cleaner, Quieter Airplanes Act in the previous  Congress and again this year and am pleased  [[Page S3689]]  that division B directs NASA to continue research in aeronautics,  including the use of experimental aircraft, to advance aircraft  efficiency and supersonic flight.   Finally, division B requires the White House Office of Science and  Technology Policy--OSTP--to promulgate guidance to all Federal research  Agencies that would: prohibit Federal research Agency personnel from  participating in foreign talent recruitment programs; require covered  individuals on applications, e.g., principal investigators, to disclose  participation in foreign talent recruitment programs; and prohibit  awards in cases where covered individuals are participating in malign  foreign talent recruitment programs.   In the aggregate, the substitute amendment will help the United  States recapture and maintain its technological preeminence in so many  sectors. I want to thank and congratulate Leaders Schumer and McConnell  and Senators Cantwell and Cornyn and so many others who have been  instrumental in bringing the Senate to this point. As I said a moment  ago, however, our work does not end here. I entreat the USICA/America  COMPETES Act conferees to reach an agreement so that the Senate may  consider the myriad provisions not contained in the substitute  amendment--provisions that are equally important to our economic and  national security.   As with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, we are  demonstrating that the Senate can work in a bipartisan fashion to pass  bills that make life better for all Americans.                            ____________________
