 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor Natorra Moody for receiving the Alma-Bacon Georgia Library  Employee of the Year award for 2021.   Natorra has exceptionally high standards for herself, of her  coworkers, and of our library system, helping to maintain the highest  caliber of public service.   She is dedicated to serving her community by leading programs such as  a prom dress donation campaign which helps students who can't afford  formal wear by allowing them to borrow the dresses freely from the  library.   She regularly participates in community events as well to promote her  library and the stellar services it provides.   This past year, Natorra has taken on the role of managing the Appling  County Public Library during the renovation period and beyond. Her  dedication, hard work, and love originate from a simple volunteer  position at her local library when she was a high school student.   I thank Natorra for all she does to benefit others.                     Remembering the Life of Bill Roberts     Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the  life of a dedicated member of our community, as well as a fellow Young  Harris alumnus, Bill Roberts of Fayetteville, Georgia.   Bill was the recipient of the Young Harris Medallion, the highest  honor that is bestowed by the college for his love and support  throughout his years.   Recruited to come to Young Harris as a basketball star, Bill was so  much more, serving as a champion debater and officer of both the SPAT  clubs and Student Government Association. He earned a bachelor's degree  in economics and continued his basketball career at Mercer University,  proceeded to Georgia State to earn a business and accounting degree,  and finally received a law degree from Woodrow Wilson.   He served our great State of Georgia on the financial side,  overseeing massive construction projects like the Georgia Dome and  World Congress Center. Bill's expertise was put to use as a trustee of  the State's Employees' Retirement System where he served on the  Investment Committee and was responsible for investing retirement funds  to the humble tune of $12 billion.   Emeritus trustee for Young Harris, distinguished alumni, veteran, and  loved member of our community are just a few of the titles that Bill  retained. This is a tremendous loss that will be felt by many.                   Recognizing the Service of Pam Southard     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  service of an incredible Georgian, Pam Southard.   Pam has served as the executive director of the Greater Pooler Area  Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Bureau. She has selflessly put her  heart and soul into her position and worked to better the city of  Pooler in any way that she can.   As the executive director, Pam was instrumental in creating the  shuttle system to and from the annual St. Patrick's Day celebration in  Savannah. She also founded the annual Hearts for Heroes Gala Fundraiser  to help put Pooler, Georgia, on the map. This upscale, black-tie event  has sold out for the past 7 years and has been an incredible event for  our community.   Throughout her tenure as executive director, Pam has overseen  substantial business growth in the city of Pooler, thanks to her  guiding hand. Pam has truly been the embodiment of what it means to be  a servant to one's community.   Her retirement will leave big shoes to fill, and we will certainly  miss her. We are grateful for all that she has done for our great city  and wish her the best as she enters a new stage of her life.

He attended and graduated from  Nicholls School, where he was senior class president and played  basketball.   After high school, Jon would follow in his father's footsteps by  attending North Georgia University, joining the Corps of Cadets.  Military life didn't agree with Jon, and he graduated from Georgia  Southern University.   Jon would go on to be the president of Nicholls State Bank as well as  serving in leadership roles in several other banks. At the time of his  passing, Jon was serving as the executive vice president of FNB South,  where he had worked for almost three decades.   He was especially proud of the time he spent with the Coffee Regional  Medical board, further helping his neighbors.   Jon was a man who was loved and admired by those who knew him and  those whom he helped, which were many. My thoughts and prayers reside  with his family, friends, and community as they mourn this tremendous  loss of a friend, neighbor, loved one, and servant.                            ____________________
