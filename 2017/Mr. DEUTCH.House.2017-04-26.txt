 Mr. Chair, I thank my friend, the ranking member from  Michigan, for the time, and I appreciate the opportunity to join the  majority of my committee colleagues as a cosponsor of this bill. It  reflects the general consensus that Congress needs to step in to  increase the autonomy of the Copyright Office, while still respecting  its historic connection to the Library.   This bill is an important first step in reforming the Copyright  Office, but it can't be the only step. Through the hearings this  committee has held over the past few years, we have learned how truly  behind the curve the Copyright Office is.   I have worked with colleagues to find a bipartisan and consensus- driven set of reforms for the Copyright Office that would go beyond  just this step in the process of selecting a Register, as have the  chairman and Ranking Member Conyers and others on the committee.   It should be obvious that, to bring the Office into the 21st century,  we need to do more than just change the selection process for the  Register of Copyrights. It requires a massive overhaul of the IT system  of the Office to create both a smoother process for creators seeking to  protect their work and a system to enable the public to search the  broad catalog of American creativity.   It requires increased accountability and consultation with both the  creative and the user communities so that we ensure that the  improvements and investments meet the needs of all those who rely on  the Copyright Office to do its job well.   Establishing the Register of Copyrights with authority outside of the  Library of Congress is not a reflection on the Librarian of Congress.  It is a recognition of the reality that the Library and the Copyright  Office have two fundamentally different missions, and they deserve to  be empowered to pursue those missions. It is a recognition that success  for both of these important entities means allowing them to maintain  their historic connection but operate on a day-to-day basis with  greater autonomy.   I am glad that the chairman has taken up this first step, and I look  forward to working with him and Ranking Member Conyers and others on  the next steps as well.   This piece of legislation supports strong copyright laws in our  country. Having strong copyright means the ability for creators to be  able to do their work. It means the creation of jobs.   The reason that this piece of legislation has such strong bipartisan  support, the reason that it is supported by the thousands and thousands  of people who earn their living every day as a result of the creativity  that strong copyright laws protect, the reason they are supporting this  legislation is because it is an important first step.   I am glad to participate in this debate, and I look forward to  passing this bill, H.R. 1695, in order to take that first step to  promote stronger copyright, to provide the kind of autonomy that the  Copyright Office needs so that it can move forward rapidly with  modernization, and, most importantly, at this moment in our Nation's  history, to ensure that we have the strongest possible avenue to create  even more good jobs, well-paying jobs. That is what this legislation is  about.   Mr. Chair, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 1, line 18, insert after ``law'' the following: ``,       shall be capable of identifying and supervising a Chief       Information Officer or other similar official responsible for       managing modern information technology systems,''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 275, the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Deutch) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment will place a much-needed  priority on advancing the technological capabilities of the U.S.  Copyright Office.   I support the underlying bill to make the selection of the Register  of Copyrights more open and more transparent. I also support the  additional congressional oversight that will be necessary to ensure  that the Register is accountable to the American people.   I agree with Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Conyers, and my other  colleagues on the Judiciary Committee that it is important that this  bill move forward now. Making this improvement to the selection process  for the next Register is an important first step before the committee  advances broader Copyright Office modernization.   Even as we take this initial modest step to improve the appointment  process, we can do more to strengthen the Copyright Office for today's  economy. The Copyright Office's mission is to administer our Nation's  copyright laws for the public good.   Securing Americans' rights to their intellectual property fosters  creativity and benefits all Americans by advancing the arts and the  sciences. In recent decades, this mission has been undermined by  comically outdated information technology systems at the Copyright  Office.   My amendment makes a simple change to the underlying bill to ensure  that technology is always a part of the equation when selecting a new  Register of Copyrights. My amendment would require the Register of  Copyrights to be capable of identifying and supervising a chief  information officer.   The CIO or a similar official would be responsible for managing  information technology systems to advance the Copyright Office's  capabilities and keep pace with our 21st century economy. One would  assume that any qualified candidate for the Register of Copyrights has  the skills and experiences necessary to guide the Office's technology  office.   Why leave this vital aspect of the Copyright Office to assumptions?   Requiring the head of the Copyright Office to be ready to make this  vital selection is not an overly burdensome obligation. For practical  purposes, this capability is a necessity, and that is why my amendment  would make technology an explicit part of the selection process.  [[Page H2875]]    My amendment merely requires that the person who will serve as the  Register be capable of supervising the Office's chief information  officer. Whatever happens next as we move forward with modernization,  IT systems of the Copyright Office must keep pace with new advancements  in technology. If Congress expects real progress toward improving the  Copyright Office's technology, we must ensure that the leaders we  select are prepared for the job.   I thank my Judiciary Committee colleague, Ms. Lofgren. She made this  point in committee during the markup of this bill, and the language in  this amendment takes her suggestion a step further. It is a small  change to the underlying bill, but it sends a much-needed signal that  the work of the Copyright Office must include a focus on improving its  IT systems.   This is only the beginning of Congress' work to modernize the  Copyright Office. H.R. 1695 is a good first step, and I strongly  support the underlying bill, but any step forward toward modernization  must have IT improvements at the front of mind. I hope my colleagues  also support this change. I think it is a commonsense step.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), the ranking member.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Michigan. I  appreciate the strong support from Chairman Goodlatte, and I urge all  of my colleagues to support this good amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.
