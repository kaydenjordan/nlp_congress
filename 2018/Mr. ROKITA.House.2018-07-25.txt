 Mr. Speaker, I stand here today ultimately seeking  justice for the American people and to end what our President has  rightfully described as a witch hunt.   For too long, our resources have been wasted on Robert Mueller's  probe into Russian collusion in our 2016 elections. Not only has this  probe dragged on for over a year, but it has undermined our entire  system of justice at this point while giving Washington elites and  their biased counsel a pass to work above the law, exempt from any  boundaries.   Through my Mueller Resolution, I am calling for us to call for the  termination of the probe if no evidence of Russian collusion can be  provided. And, again, after over a year, no evidence has been provided.  It is time for the restoration of the rule of law back into our Justice  Department, and that is why I am imploring my colleagues to fight  alongside me by signing on to this resolution. Let's work together to  end the clear manipulation of power against our President.   The President has the American people's prosperity and security at  the top of his priorities.   Let's look at the results so far. Let's look at his track record. The  economy is booming, regulations have been cut, and we are leading the  world again.   This witch hunt against our President is unprecedented and it is  uncalled for.   The Democrats have become the party of obstruct and resist, obstruct  and resist, obstruct and resist.   The Dems call Trump's tax cuts crumbs, even though it benefits  millions of Americans. Those $1,000 bonuses that are the result of the  tax cuts and the economy booming are putting more food on the table,  more security in the home, help with childcare, and everything else.  They are anything, but crumbs.   The Democrats are calling for the abolishment of ICE, even though  they protect millions of Americans, even though they protect us. Since  when has this body, since when has a party become so resistant, become  so obstructionist against law and order, against law enforcement,  against our fellow citizens who are protecting us.   The Democrats are out of touch with the American people.   It is time to throw our full support behind the President.   Just look at this week in the Senate. Senator Corey Booker said that  anyone who supports Judge Cavanaugh, President Trump's next nominee for  the Supreme Court, is ``complicit in evil.''   Mr. Speaker, how far have we gone? How out of touch is one political  party in this Nation?   Let's support the President when he wants to put America First, and  all that means. We saw that with NATO, he is calling on the other  nations to finally pay their fair share, to do what is right, to do  what they agreed to. If we have to be the world's police force, at  least we should have some help paying for it.   And the same with what is going on at the U.N. We pay, we pay, we  pay, the taxpayers pay and pay and pay, yet we don't get the services  we deserve or the leadership that we also deserve. It is time to put  America First. Other countries have to help support.   Let's support the President in leading again. Let's support the  President in making America First again.                            ____________________
