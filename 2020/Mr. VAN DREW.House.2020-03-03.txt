 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4104, the Negro  Leagues Baseball Centennial Commemorative Coin Act.   In New Jersey's Second District we were home to the Bacharach Giants  in Atlantic City. The team was a top contender in the league and won  two pennants in 1926 and 1927.   The Giants were lucky enough to host players such as John Henry  ``Pop'' Lloyd, a player whom Babe Ruth himself once called the greatest  ballplayer of all time, anywhere, ever.   Pop Lloyd would end up retiring and coaching youth baseball in  Atlantic City until the day he died, and he was inducted into the  Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977.   Players like Pop Lloyd would lay the foundation for future stars such  as Jackie Robinson and Hank Aaron, who would change the game forever.  Yet, players like Lloyd, and the leagues they played in, are slowly  becoming forgotten to the annals of history.   We cannot let that happen. I thank the gentleman from Missouri for  introducing this important legislation to commemorate and honor those  players and the role they played in shaping America's very favorite  pastime.   May God bless him.                            ____________________
