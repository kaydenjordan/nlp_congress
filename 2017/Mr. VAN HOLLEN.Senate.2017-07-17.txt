 Mr. President, I wish to honor an outstanding  American, Captain Randy Dopp, on his retirement from American Airlines.   Captain Dopp distinguished himself with over 31 years of safe  commercial airline flying for Piedmont, USAirways, and American  Airlines. He has been well-known for his commitment to airline pilots  and to the flying community.   Over the years, I have relied on Captain Dopp's knowledge and  insights on issues relating to airlines, pensions, and aviation safety.  I know that his wisdom and service will be greatly missed.   I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Captain Dopp on his  accomplishments and congratulating him on his retirement.                            ____________________
