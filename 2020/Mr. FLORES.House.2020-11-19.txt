 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Vincent Anderson of Hewitt, Texas. Affectionately known as Pike by  his family and friends, he passed away on October 7, 2020, following a  courageous battle with cancer.   Pike was born August 18, 1944, in Sedalia, Missouri, to John Kenneth  Anderson and Genevieve Katherine Collier Anderson. As a child, his  family moved to Jackson, Mississippi, where he graduated from Provine  High School in 1962. In 1967, Pike graduated from Mississippi State  University, where he was a member of the Army ROTC program and the  Alpha Tau Omega fraternity.   Following Army flight school, Pike deployed to Vietnam, where he flew  AH-1G Cobra helicopter gunships for the Air Calvary. He was awarded the  Distinguished Flying Cross in 1970 for his service in the A Shau  Valley. In 1973, he was promoted to captain, and later, honorably  discharged at the conclusion of his active military service.   In 1977, Pike went on to earn his master's degree from the University  of South Alabama. Following graduation, they moved to Waco, Texas,  where he accepted a job with the Veterans Administration. After 23  years at the VA, Pike retired in March 2000 as the chief of  kinesiotherapy.   Pike served on active duty with the Texas National Guard during this  time from March 1986 to August 2005, when he retired from the U.S. Army  with the rank of chief warrant officer. Upon the second retirement, he  worked with the Military Order of the Purple Heart as a National  Service Officer assisting veterans with VA claims at the Waco VA  Regional Office. In 2008, he received the Kenneth Richardson Award as  the National Service Officer of the Year.   Pike retired from service with the Order of the Purple Heart as the  Region 5 Deputy Regional Field Supervisor in 2015. He remained active  with the local veterans community and served as a charter member,  quartermaster, and commander of VFW Post 6008 in Hewitt, Texas.   In addition to his many years of dedicated military and veteran  service, Pike Anderson served on the Hewitt City Council for 16 years,  including two terms as mayor.                                time  1700    He was instrumental in the development of several transportation  projects and the Veterans Memorial at Hewitt Park.   Pike contributed a great deal of his time to his family as well as to  the Episcopal Church of the Holy Spirit where he served on the vestry  and became a lay minister. Pike and Marcia, his wife of 52 years, were  blessed with three beautiful daughters and nine grandchildren. He  leaves behind a legacy of service to his family, the community of  Hewitt, and to our Nation.   Madam Speaker, Pike Anderson served his country proudly for many  years, and his legacy will be forever woven into our American history.  Pike was not only a public servant; he was a devout Christian and a  committed family man.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Anderson family. I have requested the United States flag be flown  over the Nation's Capitol to honor the life, legacy, and service of  Pike Anderson.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue to pray for our  country during these difficult times, pray for our veterans, pray for  our military servicemen and -women, and pray for our first responders  who keep us safe at home.                Honoring the Life and Legacy of Joe Earl West     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Mr. Joe Earl West of College Station, Texas, who passed away on 5  June 2020.   Joe West was born on 8 March 1932 in Woodward, Texas, to Joe C. and  Jozie Oakes West. He grew up on his family's  [[Page H5984]]  farm with four younger siblings; three brothers and a sister. At the  age of 15 his family moved to Cotulla, Texas, following the death of  his younger brother, Robby.   In high school, Joe quickly became enamored with Texas A&M University  and decided he had to see it for himself. Setting out from Cotulla, Joe  took a bus and arrived in College Station very late the next evening.  Upon his arrival, Joe discovered that there were no vacancies at the  local Aggieland Inn. But in an act characteristic of Aggie kindness,  the hotel clerk phoned A&M Veterinary Medicine Professor, Dr. Hal  Redmond and his wife, who graciously hosted Joe at their house that  weekend.   Joe's love for Texas A&M continued to grow after he enrolled, and he  quickly became an integral part of the Aggie community. By the  conclusion of his undergraduate studies, he had participated in the  Corps of Cadets, the Fish baseball team, and was elected to serve as  Senior Yell leader his senior year. In 1956, Joe graduated with his  Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from Texas A&M School of  Veterinary Medicine and was later commissioned into the U.S. Air Force  Veterinary Corps.   A lifelong learner, Joe earned his master's in radiation biology from  the University of Rochester before moving to California to pursue his  Ph.D. in comparative pathology from UC Davis. While studying there at  Davis, Joe met Carolyn Francis, a talented microbiologist; and it was  love at first sight. Shortly after their wedding, Joe received orders  from the Air Force Veterinary Corps to report to Washington, D.C. There  he taught his passion, radiation biology, to dentists, doctors, and  veterinarians working on radiation effects, including those of space  travel.   After 22 years of dedicated service, Colonel West retired from the  Air Force with many distinctions, including the Air Force Commendation  Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, and the  Legion of Merit.   Joe also served the Texas A&M University system for 18 years. During  that time, he served as president of the A&M Yell Leaders Association,  as a faculty adviser to the Corps of Cadets where he was a speaker at  the 2001 Texas Aggie Muster Ceremony in College Station. Some of Joe's  proudest accolades were being chosen as a Distinguished Alumnus of the  A&M College of Veterinary Medicine in 2001 and as a Distinguished  Alumnus of Texas A&M University in 2011, the latter being the highest  recognition that can be bestowed upon a Texas Aggie, and he was also  inducted into the Texas Aggie Corps of Cadets Hall of Honor in 2014.   Professionally, Joe excelled within his chosen field of veterinary  medicine. He was a delegate to the American Veterinary Medical  Association, the president of the Texas Academy of Veterinary Practice,  and a highly regarded clinical pathologist at the Texas A&M Veterinary  Medical Diagnostic Laboratory.   Following retirement, Joe contributed a great deal of his time to his  family and to the A&M United Methodist Church in College Station. Joe  was blessed with four children and three grandchildren with whom he  enjoyed spending time, sharing his love of Texas A&M, and teaching them  all how to live by the Aggie Code of Honor.   Madam Speaker, Joe served his country proudly for many years, and his  legacy will be forever woven into our American history. Joe was not  only a public servant, he was a proud Texas Aggie, a devout Christian,  and committed family man.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the West family. I have requested that the United States flag be flown  over our Nation's Capitol to honor the life, legacy, and service of Joe  Earl West.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country during these difficult times, for our military men and women  who protect it, for our veterans, and for our first responders who keep  us safe at home.            Honoring the Life and Legacy of Wallace Lee Edge, Sr.     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Wallace Lee Edge, Sr.   Wallace Lee Edge, known as Lee to his family and friends, was born 17  March 1919 in Bryan, Texas, as the seventh of nine children to George  P. and Mae Harris Edge.   Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor at the age of 21, Lee  answered the call to service and enlisted in the United States Army.  Upon completion of basic training, Lee was promoted to sergeant and was  trained to lead an artillery battery.    Lee participated in Operation Overlord, landing on Utah Beach along  with thousands of other ``Tough Ombres'' serving in the famed 90th  Infantry Division.   Serving in the ``A'' battery of the 343rd Field Artillery Battalion,  Lee earned the affection and respect of the men he served with. As they  made their way across France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, and  Czechoslovakia, Lee participated in some of the fiercest fighting in  Europe, including in the Battle of the Bulge. For his meritorious  service in the war, Lee was awarded a Bronze Star and Bronze Arrowhead.   Upon returning from Europe, Lee embarked on various ventures before  settling down in Houston where he worked at Sears, Roebuck for almost  25 years.   In August of 1961, while working at Sears, Lee met the love of his  life, Francis Rudek. A month later he proposed, and by November of that  year, they were married. During their marriage, they lived the American  Dream, raising four boys and building a family in Houston, Texas.   Nothing was more important to Lee than his family. On Independence  Day of 1974, while on a family vacation to the Brazos River near  Millican, Texas, their 11-year old son, Wally, began to struggle in the  water. Lee dove in fully clothed to save him, however, he perished in  an unsuccessful attempt to save his first-born son.   Lee Edge's life was dedicated by service to his God, his country, and  his family. Lee is survived by his wife Francis, his sons, James,  George, Ron, and three grandsons that would have been the pride of his  life, Douglas, Matthew, and James.   Madam Speaker, Wallace Lee Edge, Sr. served his country proudly for  many years, and his legacy will be forever woven into our bright  American history. Lee was not only committed to his country, but he was  a man of faith who was wholeheartedly committed to his family and to  his community.   I have requested that the United States flag be flown over our  Nation's Capitol to honor his life and his legacy.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country during these difficult times, for our veterans, for our  military men and women who keep us safe, and for our first responders  who keep us safe at home.                Honoring the Life and Legacy of Lee Wayne Russ     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Lee Wayne Russ, a courageous law enforcement officer who paid the  ultimate sacrifice in service to others. Twenty years ago, on 29  October 2000, he lost his life while protecting innocent persons.   Lee Wayne Russ was born on 19 June 1952 in El Paso, Texas. The son of  a police lieutenant and a registered nurse, he was instilled with the  value of service to others from a very early age. He began his career  in law enforcement and joined the Ward County Sheriff's Office in 1989.   On that fateful day in October of 2000, Deputy Russ was the first  officer to respond to a domestic disturbance in progress at a home in  Monahans, Texas. As he entered the home, he immediately took action to  disarm the suspect and protect the victim, Ms. Norma Sepulveda Esparza.   In the struggle that ensued, Lee received multiple stab wounds that  would ultimately prove to be fatal. As the suspect resumed his attack  on Ms. Sepulveda, Lee summoned his remaining strength to retrieve his  service revolver and fatally shot the attacker before succumbing to his  own injuries.   That day, domestic violence claimed the lives of two innocent people,  Mr. Russ and the person he was protecting, resulting in six children  losing a beloved parent. Any law enforcement officer will tell you that  domestic disturbances are among the most dangerous situations for an  officer to encounter. When the 911 call came across the radio, however,  Lee did not hesitate to put himself in harm's way in service to  another.  [[Page H5985]]    A warrior and a protector up to his last breath, Lee's final act was  his valiant attempt to save the life of someone he had never even met.  He truly exemplified the words of Jesus in John 15:13, ``Greater love  hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.''   Lee was surrounded by a community of friends where he was known for  his kind and generous personality and his quick sense of humor. He had  a reputation as an exceedingly fair and just peace officer who could  diffuse tense situations. He took his oath to protect and serve  seriously on and off duty, and he never turned down a request for help.   Representative of his studious nature, he knew the Texas Penal Code  backwards and forwards, and he continually sought out additional  opportunities to become a better peace officer through training and  education.   When people share stories of Lee, they often recall the small details  that made him unique. He would not drive a patrol car without his  signature beaded seat cover and a rope on the gear shift to fidget  with. His regular trips to the library gave him a new stack of  paperback novels, often 2- to 3-feet high, that he would quickly work  through and then exchange them for others. He kept notepads next to his  bed, his phone, and anywhere else he might suddenly feel the need to  jot down a reminder or to write a note to a loved one. He distrusted  computers and resisted learning how to use one; until, that is, he  found out he could play solitaire on one.   Two decades later, his legacy lives on. Lee's story is told in police  academy training sessions to illustrate the power of the will to  survive and how to fight for the protection of others. In recognition  of his service and sacrifice, the Ward County Sheriff's facility now  bears his name. There, the Lee Russ Memorial Law Enforcement Center,  includes a bronzed portrait of him where he watches over his brothers  and sisters in blue.   Above all else, Lee should be remembered for his love for his family.  He was a beloved son, brother, uncle, and father. Left to carry Lee's  legacy are his three children now grown, Jason Russ, Benjamin Russ, and  Miranda Russ Henderson. His two grandchildren, Barrett Russell  Henderson and Madison Renee Henderson, will grow up with the lessons  left from their Grandpa Russ and the stories of his humor, his bravery,  and his kindness.    Madam Speaker, Russ was a true American hero, a man of faith, and a  dedicated family man. His life embodied selfless service, and it serves  as an example to us all.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Russ family on this unfortunate anniversary, and I have requested  the United States flag be flown over our Nation's Capitol to honor the  life, legacy, service, and sacrifice of Lee Russ.   As I close today, I ask all Americans to continue praying for our  country during these difficult times, for our military men and women  who protect it, and for our first responders who keep us safe at home.                 Honoring the Life and Legacy of Billy Gibson     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Billy Brannon Gibson of Huntsville, Alabama, who passed away on 6  October 2020. Bill was born on 1 November 1920 in Blount County,  Alabama, to Laura and George W. Gibson.   When World War II broke out, Billy wanted nothing more than to wear  the Marine uniform and to join the fight against the Axis Powers. It  would take Billy two attempts to become a Marine. His first try was in  1941; and at 6 foot 3 inches tall, Billy was deemed too tall for his  weight. He tried again about 2 years later, before which he ate a half- dozen bananas and drank a quart of buttermilk in order to gain more  weight when he arrived at the recruiting office. He also bent his knees  as he was measured for his height, putting him at an even 6 feet. His  efforts were successful, and they enlisted him in the Marine Corps at  that time.   Billy quit his job at the cotton mill, trained on 60-millimeter  mortar equipment, and then was qualified as a sharpshooter. He then  headed out to the South Pacific. His first stop was Guadalcanal where  his military career almost ended when he got hit in the head and  shoulder by a military vehicle. His right ear was dangling by a thread,  and his shoulder was broken. His superiors wanted to send him home. He  begged to go on to fight in Okinawa, but he kept being told he was not  fit for combat. They ultimately agreed to let him go fight and fight he  did.   After his company landed on Okinawa, he was part of the battle  referred to as ``82 days of hell and rain.'' He does not recall being  scared all the time, but he did say his worst scare came from a rat.  Just before they had made it to the front line, he and two buddies  stopped at a torn down house where they were going to sleep. During the  night, a rat jumped out of the attic and hit him in the chest. He said  that event was the closest he ever came to dying up to that point.                                time  1715    Later during the fight, he almost drowned in his foxhole. A mortar  round exploded less than 3 feet away from him, killing all five men  around him.   Billy once said that the greatest adventure you can ever have is to  go into mortal combat and beat the enemy. He is proud of what he and  his fellow marines did on behalf of our country.   At least one marine credits Billy with saving his life. He and Billy  were behind a bluff trying to sneak up on a sniper in a cave. As his  buddy was moving from behind one boulder to another, he got shot in the  chest. Billy caught him and called for the corpsman to come tend to  him.   He did not see how his buddy would survive those injuries.  Nonetheless, Billy got him to safety and went back to take out the  sniper.   Later, after the Marines had left Okinawa, Billy received a letter  from his injured marine buddy thanking him for saving his life. Billy  said he never felt like a hero. He said he was just doing his job.   Billy's outfit, Company A of the 6th Marine Division's First  Battalion, 29th Regiment, suffered 300 percent casualties. In other  words, Company A was basically wiped out three times. Miraculously,  Billy and four other marines were the only original company members who  were not killed or wounded.   After serving our country, Billy met and married his wife, Alma  Christine Gibson. They moved to Huntsville, Alabama, and Billy went to  work for NASA in the space and missile program. He was awarded the  prestigious Silver Snoopy Award for his work there.   Billy enjoyed attending his church, fishing, and playing in a local  bowling league, but his favorite pastime was golfing.   His grandchildren say that he was their hero and that he was  everything they dreamed a grandpa could be.   Billy was striving to make it to his 100th birthday, and, boy, did he  get close. Unfortunately, he passed away just 26 days shy of achieving  that mark and just 25 days shy of celebrating 73 years with his beloved  wife.   Left to cherish his memory are his loving wife, Alma Christine  Gibson; two sons, Gregory and Roger; two daughters, Cathy and Karen;  seven grandchildren; and 15 great-grandchildren, four of which are my  grandkids.   Madam Speaker, Billy Gibson was a true American hero, a man of faith,  and a member of America's Greatest Generation. His life embodied  selfless service, and he served as an example to all.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest condolences to the Gibson  family. I have requested the United States flag be flown over our  Nation's Capitol to honor the life and service of Billy Gibson.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country during these difficult times, for our veterans, for our  military servicemen and -women, and for our first responders who keep  us safe at home.         Recognizing Signalman Kenneth Gene Hamilton's 94th Birthday     Madam Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the life of  Navy Signalman Kenneth Gene Hamilton of Lamesa, Texas, who turned 94 on  5 November 2020.   Kenneth was born in 1926 in Lamesa, Texas, to Marvin and Lona  Hamilton. He has served a life of dedicated service, including his  enlistment in the United States Navy on his 17th birthday. Since he was  not yet 18, Kenneth  [[Page H5986]]  was required to provide written parental permission in order to enlist.  This selfless act was indicative of his passion and unwavering desire  to serve his country.   Shortly after enlisting, a troop train carried Kenneth to basic naval  training at Camp Wallace in Galveston County, Texas. After boot camp,  Kenneth was transferred to a base near the Chesapeake Bay to complete  advanced individual training as a signalman. Upon completion of this  training, he received his ship assignment and traveled to San Francisco  to join the rest of his crew.   Kenneth was assigned to a Merchant Marine ship that had a contingent  of naval personnel known as the ``armed guard'' on board. This group  included weapons personnel and signal personnel. This ship provided  logistic support to other vessels in the Pacific theater and assisted  in carrying ammunition.   In 1946, Kenneth completed his enlistment and, along with millions of  other World War II veterans, he returned home to raise a family.   Today, on behalf of a grateful Nation, we celebrate the life and  accomplishments of Signalman Kenneth Gene Hamilton in honor of his  recent 94th birthday.   Madam Speaker, Kenneth Hamilton has lived a long life filled with  love, joy, and a passion for selfless service. I am proud to recognize  him on this joyous occasion, and I know that his family and friends  love him and are very proud of him.   My wife, Gina, and I wish Kenneth many more years of health and  happiness and a happy birthday. We have requested the United States  flag be flown over our Nation's Capitol to recognize Signalman  Hamilton's 94th birthday.   As I close, I ask all Americans to continue praying for our country,  for our military men and women, and for our first responders who keep  us safe at home.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.  Palazzo).                           Honoring Mrs. Ruby Green     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
