 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  Sheriff Randy Royal, who recently passed away at the age of 57.   Sheriff Royal served Ware County in Waycross, Georgia, to the best of  his ability throughout his four terms. He was known as a man of faith  and deep commitment to bettering his community and those around him.  Everyone he worked with can attest to his exceptional work ethic,  focus, and innovative mindset.   Sheriff Royal selflessly worked without ever complaining, and his  legacy will surely last for countless years to come. I am thankful for  the life he lived, as Waycross is better off because of him.   My thoughts and prayers go out to Sheriff Royal's family, friends,  coworkers, and all who knew him during this most difficult time.                    Mighty Eighth Museum 25th Anniversary     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish a happy 25  birthday to the National Museum of the Mighty Eighth Air Force.   Located only minutes from downtown Savannah, where the Eighth Air  Force was activated in 1942, the museum features over 90,000 square  feet of exhibits, interactive displays, historical artifacts, and a  remarkable collection of aviation art.   Throughout its existence, the Mighty Eighth Museum has preserved  stories of courage, character, and patriotism displayed by the men and  women of the Eighth Air Force from World War II to the present.   One of the projects they worked on in recent years, is the B-17  restoration project. Once completed, the B-17 Flying Fortress ``City of  Savannah'' will be restored to its full combat configuration, including  operational systems and components. The goal of the project is to make  the finest static B-17 bomber display in the world.   As the former mayor of Pooler, I have a deep appreciation for the  museum and its contributions to the Pooler community. I am thankful for  all of the Mighty Eighth's wonderful volunteers and workers throughout  the past 25 years, and I am especially grateful for the men and women  the museum honors.                     Thiokol Chemical Explosion Woodbine     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor those who lost their lives or were injured during the tragic  explosion that occurred 50 years ago at Thiokol Chemical in Woodbine.   On Wednesday, February 3, 1971, a fire at the Thiokol munitions  factory just outside of Woodbine triggered a chain reaction of blazes,  culminating with an explosion that filled the sky with flames.   The horrible event caused the loss of 29 lives and at least 50 others  were injured. Those employees were heroes, as they were working to help  our country during wartime with commitment and courage.   Following the event, the Thiokol Memorial Project was founded to keep  the story of that terrible day alive and to remember the victims.   I have had the pleasure of meeting folks from the organization and I  have been encouraged by the work they have done to ensure every victim  is properly remembered and honored. The Thiokol Memorial Project  maintains a beautiful exhibit in Kingsland, Georgia.   Although it has been 50 years, the event and the victims will never  be forgotten.                      Recognizing Pharmacies Nationwide     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  pharmacies assisting in the COVID-19 vaccine administration across the  country.   Thanks to former President Trump's Operation Warp Speed, the vaccine  is now available to about 6,500 pharmacies nationwide. It is expected  that the COVID-19 vaccine will eventually be shipped to roughly 40,000  pharmacies across the country.   Many of the participating pharmacies have gone above and beyond in  their administration of the vaccine doses. For instance, recently, at  Costco in Oregon, an elderly couple scheduled vaccinations for  themselves within 20  [[Page H598]]  minutes and reported the efficiency and safety in receiving the doses.   As a lifelong pharmacist, I thoroughly understand the vital role  pharmacists play in fighting viruses, from administering flu shots to  COVID-19 vaccines.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all participating pharmacies for their  diligent work in ensuring safe and effective vaccine administration  across the country. We can look forward to a brighter future because of  them.                            ____________________
