 Madam Speaker, as we near the beginning of the end of the  COVID-19 pandemic, it is long past time to confront what my colleague  and dear friend, Representative Meng, has described as the additional  pandemic of hatred, violence, and discrimination against our Asian  American and Pacific Islander communities.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to support the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act  today.   I would like to address our AAPI communities directly: I cannot know  exactly what you are feeling in this moment, but as an openly gay Black  man in America, I know what it is like to be marginalized and to be  harassed because of who you are.   I turned 34 years old today, and while the end product may look okay,  there is a lot that I carry with me. I know what it is like to feel  both invisible and exposed, both unseen and targeted. I know what it is  like to have to fight for rights that you should just be able to take  for granted. And I know that in the United States of America no one  should ever have to feel this way.   So what I want the AAPI community to know is this: As surely as the  Earth revolves around the Sun, I will be with you always because we can  only get through this together.
