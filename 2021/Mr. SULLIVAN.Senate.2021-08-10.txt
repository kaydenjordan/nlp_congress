 Mr. President.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3627 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, my amendment would ensure that Federal  funds used toward the technology and materials we need to advance our  renewable energy sector is made and mined in the United States and by  our allies, not by the Chinese Communists.   We are currently dangerously reliant on China for roughly 80 percent  of materials and minerals vital to the U.S. renewable energy sector and  to our national security.   It is not only dangerous to our national security to be so reliant on  China, but it is also inhumane. China is using Uyghur forced labor to  source many of America's alternative energy imports.   We have these resources right here in the United States, and by  developing our national supply chains, we can create thousands of good- paying jobs, protect our national interests, and deny support to the  Chinese Communist Party.   However, far too often, extreme environmental groups seek to block  domestic critical mineral production right here at home.    We need to produce these materials here, not in China,  and I ask my colleagues to vote yes for this amendment.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President.    Mr. President, I also urge adoption of the Wyden  amendment, when he is talking about forced labor. But I want to point  out one important issue.   The amendment that we just voted on, my amendment, which bans the use  of Federal funds on renewable projects, critical minerals from all of  China, was opposed by the vast majority of the far-left environmental  groups in America.   They want to be able to import these products from China, even though  we have them and we have the minerals. So there is a difference between  the Wyden amendment and the Sullivan amendment. I urge its adoption,  but let's not be fooled here. The far-left, green agenda is to import  products from China and not allow mining and critical mineral  production in America. That is wrong.   I am glad my amendment just passed, but I urge adoption of the Wyden  amendment as well.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3805     Madam President, I call up my amendment 3626 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Madam President, my amendment would withhold American  taxpayers' support to the United Nations Human Rights Council until the  Department of State certifies that no members of the organization are  state sponsors of terrorism and the Treasury Department reports on the  prevalence of American sanctioned countries within the organization.   Right now, Cuba, which is designated by the State Department as a  state sponsor of terrorism, serves on the U.N. Human Rights Council  alongside authoritarian regimes and human rights abusers, Russia, and  Communist China.   Recently, the Biden administration asked this very flawed  international organization to investigate our own country's record on  human rights. This is an outrage, and the Congress should respond by  defunding the Human Rights Council until all of its member countries  actually respect human rights.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.    Mr. President, do I have any time to respond?    I ask for the yeas and nays.
