 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  and thank Penn State students who have spent the last year dedicating  countless hours to support a fantastic cause benefiting pediatric  cancer patients. I am talking about THON.   This yearlong fundraising effort culminates in an annual 46-hour  dance marathon to financially and emotionally support more than 4,500  families with children who are battling cancer.   THON was founded in 1973 by Penn State fraternities and sororities.  What began as a small fundraiser bringing in $2,000 in its inaugural  year has flourished into a campus-wide effort with more than 16,000  student volunteers across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   This year, Penn State students raised $11.7 million, and, to date,  students have shattered records and raised nearly $180 million, making  THON the largest student-run philanthropic effort in the world.   Of course, their dedication is to be applauded, but ask any Penn  State student and they agree: THON isn't about them; it is about the  children and the families fighting cancer.   Over the years, THON has supported more than 4,000 families with a  child battling pediatric cancer. Patients are treated at the Penn State  Hershey Medical Center, and because of THON, many of these families  never receive a medical bill.   THON is for the kids, and it is for the families to focus on  celebrating more birthdays, piano recitals, science fairs, graduations,  and every other milestone that a child should celebrate without fear.  THON exists so that one day parents never have to hear the words,  ``Your child has cancer.''   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of these students; but, more importantly, I  am proud of the children and the families who have the courage to fight  back against pediatric cancer.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate National FFA week. FFA is a national leader in agricultural  education, inspiring our Nation's young people to pursue careers that  help support a robust rural economy.   Agriculture is the backbone of Pennsylvania's economy. It is rooted  in American heritage, and our Nation's producers provide us the food,  the fiber, the building materials, and the energy that we all depend  upon.   By committing to FFA, young men and women are helping shape the  science, technology, and business of agriculture. Every time I see a  distinctive blue FFA jacket, I am reminded of the strong character and  impressive leadership abilities that come along with it.   FFA leaders have gone on to become Ivy League graduates, Federal  court  [[Page H1196]]  judges, innovative farmers, famous performance artists, and even U.S.  Presidents.   This week, we celebrate the important success of FFA and look forward  to what FFA leaders have in store for the future of rural America.                            ____________________
