 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding to me  and for bringing this measure to the floor.   I thank Chairman Engel; and I also thank my good friend from Texas,  Ranking Member   Michael McCaul, for his leadership on this particular  issue, and for making this bill a bipartisan bill, which is a very,  very important thing to do nowadays.   This bipartisan legislation will enhance the leadership of the United  States at the international standards-setting bodies for 5G mobile  telecom systems and infrastructure.   As we all know, and as has been mentioned, China is the most active  espionage power when it comes to industrial espionage, theft of  intellectual property, and actions against nations and regimes; and we  certainly see this as a threat.   Once China's 5G technology has been installed in a country, China  owns that nation's data, including the personal information of its  people. This theft results in unacceptable national security risks and  endangers allied information-sharing.   Market analysis shows that 5G technologies will create--if we do this  ourselves here--up to 3 million new American jobs and add over $500  billion to our country's gross domestic product.   This bill aims to increase cooperation between the United States and  its allies, and partners, in identifying and countering this risk from  China.   Furthermore, this bill will increase America's global leadership on  5G technology and provide an alternative to China's dangerous state-run  companies, which currently dominate the 5G market.    I want to thank the ranking member, Mr. McCaul, and Chairman Engel  for doing this bipartisan legislation. Again, we have got to make sure  that our priorities are clear and achievable when it comes to facing  this danger.   I ask all Members to support this legislation.  [[Page H32]]
