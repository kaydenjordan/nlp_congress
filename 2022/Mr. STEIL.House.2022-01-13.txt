 Mr. Speaker, it may be a new year, but the Democrats are  up to the same tricks, providing text of this legislation last night  for a vote in the morning.   They want to gut key voter integrity provisions, and they want to  bust the Senate's filibuster in the process to do it.   But I think it is important the American people understand some of  the key and most egregious provisions in this bill. Let me just  highlight the top four.   This bill guts voter ID laws. And the irony shouldn't be lost that  these are the same Democrats that want you to show an ID and a vaccine  card to be able to have dinner in cities like Washington, D.C., or New  York.   This bill puts Federal dollars into politicians' reelection  campaigns. I have heard a lot of complaints about elections in my time.  I have never had one person tell me our elections don't have enough  money.   This bill restricts States' ability to maintain their voter rolls,  voter rolls that are essential so we know who is eligible to vote.   And this bill mandates that ballots can be counted 7 days after the  end of the election, delaying the final results. Delaying the final  results does not instill confidence in our elections.   Instead, by working to remove key voter integrity provisions in our  elections, Americans will have less confidence in our elections. My  priority is to make it easy to vote and hard to cheat. This bill fails  that test, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
