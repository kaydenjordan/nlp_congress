 Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No.  1458, which I introduced. It will narrow the scope of the tangled web  of regulatory guidance that the bill calls for and keep politics out of  the process of reporting and addressing hate crimes against Asian  Americans. It addresses crimes, not incidences.   I don't think it is out of line to introduce a little precision to  the process and make sure the Agency officials who will be responsible  for running this program know what they are supposed to be looking for  and what they are supposed to be doing with all that information.   I can guarantee my colleagues that support of this change will result  in a bill that will fulfill its purpose to protect victims and  potential victims of hate crimes, and it will stop their attackers.   I urge adoption of the amendment.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
