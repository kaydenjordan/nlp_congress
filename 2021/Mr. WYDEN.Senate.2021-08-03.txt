 Madam President, I also rise today to recognize the  service of Ian Fergusson and his contribution to a deeper understanding  of trade law and policy.   For decades, Ian provided comprehensive and detailed reports on  economic history, trade policy, and key legislative authorities. He  worked on everything from Canada to the World Trade Organization to  access to medicine. Ian was instrumental in assisting me and my staff  on numerous occasions as we examined congressional delegation of trade  authorities, such as TPA, and the workings of multilateral  institutions, such as the WTO. He also provided clear and concise  information to support debates on the merits and implementation of U.S.  trade agreements, including the South Korea--U.S. Free Trade Agreement  and USMCA and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership--TPP--agreement.   I join my colleague in offering my sincere condolences to Ian's  family, friends, and his colleagues at CRS and will continue to think  of them during this difficult time.                            ____________________
