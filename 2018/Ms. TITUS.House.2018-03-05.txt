 Mr. Speaker, I am here to once again remind my colleagues  why the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository is an unworkable  project. There are design flaws that the NRC's own analysis show lead  to radioactive waste leaking into the water table, and transportation  plans would ship more than 70,000 metric tons of nuclear waste by train  and truck through 329 congressional districts for years to come past  your homes, your businesses, your schools, and your churches.   Now some of my colleagues want to make this bad situation even worse  by busting the caps on the amount of allowable waste to be stored,  increasing the danger and invalidating any existing studies.   If the proponents of Yucca Mountain and their industry donors are  really serious about solving the problems of nuclear waste storage,  they would follow the Blue Ribbon Commission's recommendations and pass  my consent-based bill rather than dumping nuclear waste into a State  that does not produce it and does not want it.   Nevada is not a wasteland.                            ____________________
