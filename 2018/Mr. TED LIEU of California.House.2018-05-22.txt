 Madam Speaker, Paul Ryan promised regular  order when he took over the speakership. He has broken that promise  repeatedly. We have voted on bills here on the floor that violated the  standard committee process.   The majority has employed a technique called marshal law that allows  them to bring up bills with little to no notice, and now we know we  have the most closed Congress in U.S. history. The majority has blocked  all amendments on most bills. That is a disgraceful way to run the  people's House.   Twenty-three amendments of mine have been blocked--simple amendments.  One of them basically says, hey, the Federal Government should invest  more in cybersecurity. We can't even get a debate on that.   Really?   Another amendment I have deals with anticorruption, and whether you  have a Republican or a Democrat or an Independent, you don't want  corruption. You don't want members of the executive branch making money  off the taxpayer's dime.   So one of these amendments basically says we are not going to  reimburse the President or other members when they go and spend money  on Mar-a-Lago or other Trump properties and have the Federal Government  pay money there because that flows to the President or his immediate  family. Can't even get a vote on that. Why? Because the Republican  leadership knows it would pass.   We need to open up this Congress and have a debate. We came here to  debate ideas, not to block them.
