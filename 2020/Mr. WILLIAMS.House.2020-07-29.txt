 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember one of  Texas' finest servants, Cathy Marchel.   Cathy went home to be with the Lord in January after serving our  Cleburne community for almost two decades with strength, grace, and  unmatched character. She took all of the gifts she possessed and used  them in powerful ways to improve her world and those around her.   She radiated joy with her beaming smile and gracious attitude. She  was a leader and a fighter and someone we all looked up to for  guidance. No one worked harder for their constituents than she did, and  her impact will be felt for decades to come.   Our community has lost a selfless, devoted servant, and many of us  have lost a dear friend. There is most certainly a void in her absence,  but we find hope in the promise that she is now with our savior, and we  look forward to the day when we all will be reunited.   May God bless the entire Cleburne community and the Marchel family.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
