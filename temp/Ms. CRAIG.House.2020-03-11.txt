 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate the Simley  Spartans wrestling team on their AA State championship.   Simley High School in Inver Grove Heights is surely proud of their  accomplishments, as are we all in the Second Congressional District. In  fact, their head coach, Will Short, called it a perfect season.   Congratulations to the Spartan wrestlers. They have demonstrated  excellence in their sport and a strong commitment to the success of  their team. They have delivered outstanding results that they can be  proud of in their school and their community.   I thank especially the parents, the coaches, the teachers, and the  mentors who have dedicated their time to making their season  successful.   Congratulations, Simley.                            ____________________
