 Mr. Speaker, on Friday this week, September 20, our  country will be welcoming the top official of the country of Australia,  Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who will be arriving in Washington, D.C.   It is an important event, I think, for both countries, because this  alliance between our two countries is so deep and the bond is so  strong. The times that we are living in are so critical in terms of,  again, just reaffirming all of the work that our two countries do  together in so many ways, whether it is in terms of our military  alliance, intelligence, trade, our cultures in terms of everything from  movies to literature to music. Again, it is a deep and rich bond  between our two countries.   Mr. Speaker, during the August break, we had a bipartisan group, a  number of us, who actually went to the country of Australia for a joint  Members of Parliament/Members of Congress conference that took place in  Perth, Australia. There were about a dozen Members, bicameral and  bipartisan. I can tell you that the prognosis is very good in terms of  the connection between our two countries.   As I said, the integration of our two militaries could not be deeper  and  [[Page H7759]]  more connected. Again, it is a relationship that goes back to World War  I, when U.S. troops, the first group that arrived in the expeditionary  force in World War I, actually fought under an Australian general, John  Monash. Obviously, that carried through during World War II,  particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.   In Vietnam, they were our ally, one of the few that actually fought  with our country during that conflict; and, obviously, in the Middle  East, Australian troops have been part of, again, operations, to this  day, between the two countries in terms of the fight against ISIS and  others.   When we were in Australia, again, the situation that I think is most  urgent and something I really think all of us need to pay attention to  is that the environment in the Indo-Pacific region is changing  dramatically.   We now have a leader in the country of China, Xi Jinping, who has  declared himself President for life and who has openly and brazenly  basically signaled that he is prepared to disregard all international  rules-based order, which has really been the foundation of that region  since the end of World War II, whether it is maritime law, where,  again, they are building islands totally in violation of maritime law,  or whether it is a claim of the Nine-Dash Line, which is a territorial  claim far out into the South China Sea and the East China Sea.   Again, what is happening there is egregious. It is harmful in terms  of safe passage and open lanes of maritime traffic in the region. They  obviously are engaged in an unprecedented military buildup, again,  developing missile technologies that put surface ships of both  countries and others in the region at great risk.   So we have a lot of work to do.   Rare earth minerals, which, again, China dominates. They have a  virtual monopoly. Everything from our cellphones to aerospace and  maritime equipment require the use of that.   Western Australia, in particular, has deep deposits of rare earth  minerals, and it is time for our two countries to work together to  create a different supply chain that does not rely totally on the  country of China to make that happen.   What we also heard was that the best way that our country can move  forward is to really, I think, point to what makes us most attractive  in the world today, which is our embrace of democracy, free speech,  openness, and generosity.   Again, those are policies which we heard loud and clear from our  colleagues in the Australian Parliament that they are looking to  America, which has been the leader since the end of World War II, to  promote, that type of international rules-based order.   That is really the question of the day for this administration, which  is in a go-it-alone trade war with China. Again, they have got the  symptom right, which is that China's behavior is egregious and malign,  particularly in terms of the trade practices that they engage in, but  the question is: How do you push back? How do you execute a policy that  should be multilateral, collaborative with our allies, to make sure  that the World Trade Organization actually has real teeth in terms of  enforcing egregious violations that China has been engaged in in terms  of intellectual property and government involvement in terms of trying  to capture different markets like solar panels and many, many others?   So, again, I just want to say to our friends in Australia that they  are welcome in this country. We look forward to, again, a very rich and  strong alliance moving forward. The coequal branch of our government in  Congress is part of that message and part of that policy.    Again, we look forward to many years of productive work together  based on common values as well as common interests and, obviously, the  embrace of democracy for the region and for the rest of the world.                            ____________________
