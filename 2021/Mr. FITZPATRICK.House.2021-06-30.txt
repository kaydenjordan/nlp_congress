 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of amendment  No. 15.   This important bipartisan amendment bans the transportation of  equines for the purpose of being slaughtered for human consumption.   Madam Speaker, currently, horses, donkeys, and others can be  transported inhumanely across our country and borders only to be  slaughtered for human consumption in Mexico and in Canada.   Moreover, this heinous practice is responsible for over 3,500 horses  being slaughtered in 2020 alone. These horses are not old or sickly.  More than 92 percent of these horses sent to slaughter are in good  condition, according to the USDA.   Madam Speaker, these innocent horses deserve better, and we must lend  a voice to the voiceless to help end the practice of American horses  being needlessly slaughtered. This amendment has the overwhelming  support of the equestrian community, including the Humane Society, the  SPCA, and Horses for Homes Coalition.   I thank Representative Carter for leading this amendment, along with  the other bipartisan cosponsors of this amendment, and I urge all my  colleagues across the aisle to support it and vote ``yes'' on this  bipartisan en bloc.
