 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 4669, the Maximizing Drug Coverage for Low-Income Seniors Act.   This past week, I joined my colleagues, Haley Stevens, Jahana Hayes,  and Terri Sewell to introduce this commonsense legislation that will  [[Page H8149]]  help to ensure that low-income seniors are matched with the Medicare  part D prescription drug program that is best for them.   I continue to hear from folks in New Hampshire who are struggling to  pay for Medicare prescription drugs, often being forced to choose  between groceries or rent, and the medications that they need.   Far too many Americans are forced to make these impossible choices  between basic necessities for their families and their prescription  medications. This legislation will help some of our most vulnerable  Americans afford the medications they depend on to stay healthy, and it  will save taxpayer dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this important  bill.                            ____________________
