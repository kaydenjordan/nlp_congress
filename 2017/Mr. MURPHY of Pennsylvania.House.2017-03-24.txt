 Mr. Speaker, in my district over the time  span since the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, was passed, I fielded  many, many a call from persons who said they could not afford health  care. In some of those instances, even though a person was able to  afford the premium, they could not afford the deductible.   A gentleman aged 55 and his wife said they would have to pay $27,000  out of pocket between premium deductibles and copays before they could  use their first benefits. He was one of the 19.2 million Americans who  chose to pay the fine rather than get on the Affordable Care Act,  ObamaCare. We suspect that many more will continue on with saying they  would rather pay a fine or find a way out rather than continue to pay  for it if this continues on as is.   In the past, we have been battling many things under this with regard  to mental health care. The past administration attempted to strip the  protected drug class status for lifesaving psychiatric medications. We  fought back on that. We also worked together, however, in a bipartisan  way to make sure we had assured things for mental health care.   This bill has several provisions which are extremely important. It  has $100 billion which States may use to help in their stabilization  fund to fund mental health care. There is another $15 billion focused  on mental health care. There is $500 billion for substance abuse.  Funding will be in there.   My hope is that States make a decision. It is in their hands with the  passage of this bill so they can make the right choice to continue  mental health care, and I trust they will do that.
