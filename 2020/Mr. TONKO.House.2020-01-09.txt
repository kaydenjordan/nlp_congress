 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I want to respond to something I keep hearing from my  Republican colleagues, which is the argument that we should abandon  important proposals because the Senate simply will not accept them.   We cannot control the Senate, but we have the ability and the  responsibility to pass strong legislation through this body and work as  hard as we can to get it enacted.   I believe in the prerogative and power of the House of  Representatives to do what is right, and so I can only hope that the  Senate will follow our example.   Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs.  Dingell), a champion on this issue.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Chair, might I inquire of the time that is remaining  for our side.    I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Ruiz.)    I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Soto).    Mr. Chair, H.R. 535 lists only PFOA and PFOS under  Superfund and leaves decisions for all other PFAS to EPA. EPA has  already committed to listing PFOA and PFOS under Superfund and has been  working on the listing since 2018. The bill will speed up that listing,  so that cleanup of existing contamination starts sooner, but does not  change how Superfund will apply.   The two PFAS that will be listed under Superfund by this bill have  already been phased out by industry under a voluntary EPA partnership  more than a decade ago.                                time  1900    They are not being made in this country anymore. So no one producing  airplane door seals or heart stents or any other product is using the  chemicals listed under the bill. The FDA is not approving heart stents  made of these chemicals.   Most of those products are actually made from PTFE, better known as  Teflon. The companies who make and use PTFE believe it is not  hazardous. If that is true, the testing regime in this bill will show  it to be true. And if it is true, the EPA will not list it under  Superfund.   The bill leaves the listing decision for PTFE and all other PFAS  currently produced in this country to EPA. It gives the EPA 5 years to  evaluate those chemicals and supplies them with the needed science.   This is a reasonable approach that will not regulate PFAS chemicals  that are found to be nonhazardous and will take no immediate action on  PFAS chemicals still being made.   I also want to note that FDA review and CERCLA listing are not  inconsistent. FDA review looks at whether a product is safe and  effective for specific uses. CERCLA focuses on whether a chemical is  hazardous when released into the environment.   Many items that have important, even lifesaving uses, are not safe  when dumped into the environment. And to be clear, the FDA is not  recommending that healthy individuals implant PFAS into their bodies.  The FDA is making a careful decision that someone in need of a heart  stent is served by this device more than they are harmed.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Dean).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chair, creosote is listed as a hazardous substance  under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and  Liability Act, CERCLA, for the purpose of Superfund cleanup sites for  the assignments of liability.    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 1 minute.    The mechanisms for reporting on potential toxicants should  allow citizens ready access to information on what they can do to alert  authorities to environmental threats.    The public is vital to the work of environmental  protection, and I look forward to learning more about the residents of  the Fifth Ward and surrounding communities, and the gentlewoman's  efforts to address creosote contamination. And I thank the gentlewoman  for bringing this to the attention of the committee and Members of  Congress.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire again about time remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas  (Mrs. Fletcher).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H124]]    I thank the House leadership for bringing forward this package today.  I want to explain why it is critical that Members support this bill.   The health and the safety of communities across our great country are  compromised by these dangerous chemicals. For their sake, let's not  pretend that nibbling at the edges with the latest NDAA is enough to  declare victory.   I have visited the communities and met the families who are dealing  with the fallout from PFAS exposure and environmental contamination.  They elected us to put their needs first, and they need more than half  measures.   I appreciate my Republican colleagues' willingness to work on cleanup  of Federal facilities, but that simply is not enough. I cannot in good  conscience go home this weekend and tell the people of Rensselaer  County: ``We are cleaning up DOD sites, but we have no plan for the  polluted industrial sites in Hoosick Falls, or any others like it  around the country.''   It just isn't right. We need to take action under Superfund and hold  PFAS polluters responsible, regardless of whether they are public or  private.   The bill also requires any national drinking water standard to, at a  minimum, ensure vulnerable groups, including pregnant women, infants,  and children, are protected.   I won't tolerate EPA adopting an unsafe standard, and I do hope  Members with impacted communities won't either.   The bill includes other critical provisions to reduce PFAS exposure,  empower consumers, and expedite cleanups. We have waited too long  already for the administration to act. I fear we will keep waiting, or  worse, deal with the consequences of unprotective actions.   Until we enact these provisions, we cannot say that Congress has done  its job.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I do not intend to oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, this bipartisan amendment builds on an important piece  of this bill, the guidance for firefighters and other first responders  to minimize their risk from PFAS chemicals. This provision was  developed by Representative Lizzie Fletcher, and I thank her for her  leadership on addressing this important concern.   Our first responders take enormous risks every day for the greater  good. Cancer from occupational exposure should not be among those  risks. Unfortunately, occupational-related cancers now account for 65  percent of the line-of-duty deaths for firefighters each year.   Last year, Pat Morrison of the International Association of Fire  Fighters testified before my subcommittee on the impacts PFAS in  firefighting gear have had on firefighters. This is the single largest  health-related issue facing the firefighting profession.   I thank Representative Fletcher for her work in protecting  firefighters, and I also thank the gentlemen from Georgia and  California for their efforts on this important topic.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the Woodall-DeSaulnier  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Khanna).    Madam Chair, I remind everyone that PFOS/PFOA are  dangerous contaminants that threaten individual lives and our  communities, as our firefighters have pointed out, in various, various  dimensions.   Madam Chair, I rise to support the amendment and the overall bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment would strike the Superfund  provision from this bill completely. It will significantly weaken this  bill and leave hundreds of impacted communities in harm's way.   What does the Superfund provision in this bill do exactly? H.R. 535  lists only PFOA and PFOS under Superfund and leaves decisions for all  other PFAS to EPA.   EPA has already committed to listing PFOA and PFOS under Superfund  and has been working on the listings since 2018. So this bill does not  prejudge EPA decisions. EPA has already made those decisions.   The bill will speed up that listing so that cleanup of existing  contamination starts sooner, which is critical. It also sets up a  reasonable deadline for EPA to make decisions on other PFAS chemicals  under Superfund to speed up any additional needed cleanups.   Superfund cleanups are essential to public health, and for impacted  communities, they can be the difference between health and sickness,  between life and death.   The question before Members on this amendment is whether cleanups of  PFOA and PFOS should start right away or whether impacted communities  can continue to wait.  [[Page H129]]    While EPA drags its feet, people in hundreds of impacted communities  across the country will continue to be exposed and continue to be  harmed. Pollution will spread from these sites into the environment,  into sources of drinking water, and into our agricultural resources.  And eventual cleanups will become harder and more costly.   Madam Chair, impacted communities cannot afford to wait. I urge my  colleagues, therefore, to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition, though I do  not plan to oppose this amendment.    Madam Chair, GenX is a group of PFAS chemicals that have  been a particular concern for several communities. Last year, the  Energy and Commerce Committee heard testimony from a member of one of  those communities, Emily Donovan, of the group Clean Cape Fear.   Emily testified about the burden of disease in her community,  including her husband's cancer, and the burden of having to educate and  protect her community without the protections and resources of our  Federal environmental laws.   Her group, Clean Cape Fear, had to seek donations to install drinking  water treatment for the public schools of her town so that the children  could have safe water to drink at school. That is just not right.   So I appreciate these North Carolina Members raising the issue of  GenX to help Emily and other people impacted by GenX. I thank the  gentlemen for their amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment and this bill.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I support the Hudson amendment, and I  encourage my colleagues to do likewise.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, though I do not intend to oppose it.   The Acting CHAIR (Miss Rice of New York). Without objection, the  gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Madam Chair, this amendment explicitly includes GenX  chemicals in the definition of PFAS covered by the legislation.   I want to be clear that GenX are PFAS chemicals and are already  covered by this provision, regardless of whether this amendment is  adopted.   I am happy to support, however, the amendment because we absolutely  mean for this funding to be available to remove GenX from drinking  water. But  [[Page H131]]  no one should interpret this amendment as implying that GenX are not  already covered within the definition of PFAS.   I also want to mention one important thing about GenX. We have heard  a lot today about how PFOA and PFAS are dangerous, but that newer PFAS  might be safer. I want to make certain that everyone understands, GenX  is one of those supposedly safer alternatives. It is a set of short- chain PFAS that were developed to replace PFOA.   GenX is a great example of why we need the moratorium on new PFAS  included in this bill, because if EPA had the needed science in hand  when GenX was introduced, communities in North Carolina, and  nationwide, might never have been impacted.   That is what we are trying to accomplish with this bill. We want to  help the communities that have been impacted and head off future  harmful pollution.   I thank the gentlemen for their amendment, and I urge my colleagues  to support this amendment and this bill.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the kind words from the  gentleman from North Carolina. I appreciate working with him. I  encourage my colleagues to support the Hudson amendment, his second  amendment, and I will do likewise.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This amendment would block implementation of the important public  health protections in this bill until the EPA administrator certifies  that its PFAS Action Plan is completed.   Let's be clear about something. This EPA is never going to complete  that action plan. EPA has already failed to meet the weak deadlines it  set for itself in that.   We were supposed to have a regulatory determination for PFOA and PFAS  in drinking water. We do not. We were supposed to have designations of  PFOA and PFAS under Superfund. In fact, in EPA's action plan they note  that they started that activity in 2018. They haven't gotten it done.   We were supposed to have EPA action to require reporting of PFAS  releases on the Toxics Release Inventory. We had to attach that to the  NDAA to get it done.   And, by the way, Republicans supported taking that action on NDAA.   But even these specifics are giving this amendment too much credit.  This is not a serious amendment because EPA's Action Plan is not  designed to ever be completed. Many of the action items are  characterized by the EPA itself as ongoing commitments.   Here is an example. EPA committed to holding responsible parties  accountable for PFAS releases into the environment. That task is an  ongoing commitment that can never be completed.   Evaluating new science, evaluating new PFAS, assessing new drinking  water treatment technology, these are all things EPA will continue  doing indefinitely.   In fact, one of the stated purposes of EPA's action plan is  ``preventing future contamination.'' When will EPA ever be done  preventing future contamination?   So this amendment would actually block the important provisions in  this bill from ever being implemented. It would harm public health and  leave our communities worse off. I urge all of my colleagues to oppose  this amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Under the Clean Water Act, many industries discharge directly to  municipal sewage treatment plants rather than discharge directly to  surface waters. To address this practice, the Clean Water Act  established a pretreatment program, which allows sewage treatment  plants to work with industrial discharge connections to ensure that any  industrial chemicals are properly treated or that these chemicals do  not disrupt the normal functioning of the sewage treatment plants.   However, a pretreatment program is only effective if the sewage  treatment plant knows which chemicals are being introduced into their  sewage treatment systems. Yet, there is no current Clean Water Act  requirement that requires industrial discharges to tell the  municipality that it plans to release PFAS-related chemicals into the  sewage system.   This amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Delgado)  would address this current loophole. I support this amendment, and I  appreciate the good work that the gentleman from New York has done not  [[Page H133]]  only for the residents of his congressional district but for the  residents of this country. This is an important amendment. I appreciate  the hard work he has done and the sensitivity he has shown.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Maine for  yielding.   I support the Pingree-Spanberger amendment, which would expand the  voluntary label for PFAS-free products to include carpets, rugs,  clothing, and upholstered furniture.   The PFAS-free label created under this bill was developed by  Representative Soto to help consumers who are trying to protect  themselves from PFAS risks. I thank Mr. Soto for his work on that  provision.   Expanding that label to cover carpeting, rugs, clothing, and  upholstered furniture makes great sense. Recent data suggests that  those consumer products can be a significant source of PFAS exposure  and that PFAS-free products are available on the market. Currently,  consumers have no clear way to know which rugs have PFAS and which do  not.   Manufacturers that are taking steps to produce these items without  PFAS have no way of distinguishing their products in the marketplace.  This amendment will give them that tool.   I congratulate both Representatives Pingree and Spanberger for their  sensitivity to consumers by placing this amendment before us. I urge my  colleagues to support the amendment and the overall bill.    Madam Chair, as the designee of the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence), I rise to offer an amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   I thank Congress Member Lawrence for her work on this amendment.   The amendment, Madam Chair, is simple. It would ensure that the  public is notified when any additional chemicals in the PFAS family are  designated as hazardous substances.   More specifically, this amendment requires the EPA to publish its  determinations on the remaining PFAS chemicals on its publicly  accessible website within 60 days.   Public reporting helps communicate how government is working for the  people. For agencies like the EPA, full transparency is necessary to  inform our communities about threats to public health and the  environment.                                time  2030    Our constituents have the right to know exactly what contaminants are  in the air we breathe and the water we drink. As she noted in her  statement in support of her amendment, in her home State of Michigan,  she knows the importance of clean air and clean water from firsthand  experience.   We know threats to our environment and public health do not  discriminate, and the Representative concludes that she knows that, too  often, it is the most important unrepresented and disadvantaged  communities that are left behind.   Mr. Chair, I urge support for the amendment from the gentlewoman from  Michigan, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his support of this  amendment, and I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment and  the overall bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mrs.  Dingell) having assumed the chair, Mr. Brindisi, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 535) to  require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to  designate per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances as hazardous substances  under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and  Liability Act of 1980, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
