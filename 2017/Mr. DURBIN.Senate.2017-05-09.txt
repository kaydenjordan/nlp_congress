 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, this weekend we saw a peaceful democratic  election in France, one of our key Western allies in the bedrock of  European stability after two terrible wars in the last century. What  happened just before the Sunday election in France? There was a massive  cyber attack on the leading candidate, the one who prevailed, Emmanuel  Macron. Whom do experts suspect was behind this cyber attack trying to  manipulate another Western election, trying to foster mistrust in that  nation's democratic institutions? Not surprisingly, Russia.   Yet none of this should surprise anyone. Not only had Russia been  subsidizing Mr. Macron's opponent, Marine Le Pen, who is seen as more  sympathetic to Moscow, not to mention trying to interfere in Dutch and  German elections as well, but we were warned about this by our own  intelligence agencies 6 months ago.   In early October last year, the U.S. intelligence community detailed  Russia's attack on America's election and warned us that other attacks  would follow. During a recent trip to Eastern Europe, a Polish security  expert warned me that if the United States didn't respond to an attack  on its own Presidential election by the Russians, Putin would feel  emboldened to keep up the attacks to undermine and manipulate elections  all through the free world.   What has this administration and this Congress done to respond to the  cyber act of war by the Russians against America's democracy? Has  President Trump clearly acknowledged Russia's attack on the U.S. and  forcefully condemned the actions? No. Has President Trump warned Russia  to stop meddling in the United States and other democratic elections in  France, Germany, and other countries? No. Has President Trump proposed  a plan to help the United States thwart any future attack on the next  election and to help our States protect the integrity of their voting  systems? No. Has the Republican-led Congress passed sanctions on Russia  in response to this attack on our democracy? Has it passed meaningful  cyber security legislation? No.   Quite simply, the failure of this President and Congress to address  the security threat is a stunning abdication of responsibility to  protect the United States and our democratic values.   As if the conclusions of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies weren't enough  to raise concerns, let's review what emerged just over the recent April  recess. For example, Reuters reported that a Russian Government think  tank, controlled by Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, developed a plan  to swing our 2016 Presidential election to Donald Trump and undermine  voters' faith in our electoral system.   The institute, run by a retired senior Russian foreign intelligence  official, appointed by Putin, released two key reports, one in June and  one in October of last year.   In the first, it argued that ``the Kremlin launch a propaganda  campaign on social media and Russian state-backed global news outlets  to encourage US voters to elect a president who would take a softer  line toward Russia than the administration of then-President Obama.''   The second warning said:         [P]residential candidate Hillary Clinton was likely to win       the election. For that reason, it argued, it was better for       Russia to end its pro-Trump propaganda and instead intensify       its messaging about voter fraud to undermine the US electoral       system's legitimacy and damage Clinton's reputation in an       effort to undermine her presidency.    It was also recently disclosed that the FBI obtained a Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Court warrant to monitor the communications  of former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page on the  suspicion that he was a Russian agent. Add this to the ever-growing  list of suspicious relationships between those in the Trump circle and  Russia, from Michael Flynn to Paul Manafort, to Roger Stone, to Felix  Sater.   In fact, just last month, the Republican House Intelligence Committee  chair, Jason Chaffetz, and the ranking Democratic member, Elijah  Cummings, said General Flynn may have broken the law by failing to  disclose on his security clearance forms payments of more than $65,000  from companies linked to Russia. Yet, incredibly, the White House  continues to stonewall requests for documents related to General Flynn.   White House ethics lawyer during the George Bush administration,  Richard Painter, wrote of this stonewalling: ``US House must subpoena  the docs. . . . Zero tolerance for WH [White House] covering up foreign  payoffs.''   Is it any wonder why, in recent testimony to Congress, FBI Director  Comey acknowledged an investigation of Russian interference in our  election, which  [[Page S2823]]  he said included possible links between Russia and Trump associates.   Finally, over the recess--on tax day, to be precise--there were  nationwide protests calling on President Trump to take the necessary  step to dispel concerns by releasing his taxes once and for all. The  concern over his taxes goes to the serious question as to how much  Russian money is part of the Trump business empire. In 2008, Donald  Trump, Jr., said Trump's businesses ``see a lot of money pouring in  from Russia.'' This was despite his father incredibly saying this just  a few months ago: ``I have nothing to do with Russia--no deals, no  loans, no nothing!''    It appears that the Russians were some of the few willing to take on  the financial risk required to invest in Trump's precarious business  deals. Any such Russian money, combined with the President's refusal to  formally separate himself from his business operations during his  Presidency, demand the release of his tax returns. Trump's response to  the mounting calls to release these returns--the usual--is to attack  everyone asking questions and blindly dismiss the issue as being  irrelevant.   Of course, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee had compelling testimony  yesterday from former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates and former  Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Miss Yates discussed  the urgent warning that she delivered to the White House Counsel on  January 26 that the National Security Advisor to the President of the  United States, General Flynn, had been compromised and was subject to  blackmail by the Russians. It was a warning she repeated in two  meetings and a phone call.   What did the White House do in response to the Acting Attorney  General warning them that the highest adviser in the White House on  national security could be blackmailed by the Russians? Nothing. For 18  days, General Flynn continued to staff President Trump for a phone call  with Vladimir Putin and other highly sensitive national security  matters.   Think of that. After being warned by the Attorney General that the  man sitting in the room with you, the highest level of National  Security Advisor, could be compromised by the Russians, President Trump  continued to invite General Flynn for 18 days in that capacity. White  House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said:         When the President heard the information as presented by       White House Counsel, he instinctively thought that General       Flynn did not do anything wrong, and that the White House       Counsel's review corroborated that.    Let's be clear. It is bad enough to have a National Security Advisor  who is subject to blackmail by the Russians. The fact that the Trump  White House didn't see that as an urgent problem is deeply troubling.   I am glad the Senate Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee held this  hearing yesterday, but the occasional subcommittee hearing is not  enough. Let's make sure we know for the record that this subcommittee-- chaired by Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican of South Carolina, and  Ranking Member Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat of Rhode Island--did a  yeoman's duty--not just yesterday but in a previous hearing, without  being allocated any additional resources for this investigation,  without being given additional staff. They have brought to the  attention of the American people some important facts about what  transpired in the Trump White House after it was clear that General  Flynn had been compromised by the Russians.   But the occasional subcommittee hearing like this is not enough. We  need an independent, bipartisan commission with investigative resources  and the power necessary to dig into all of the unanswered questions.  Until we do, the efforts of this committee or that committee are not  enough. It has to be a conscious effort on a national basis by an  independent commission.   For President Trump, these issues do not appear to be relevant, yet  there is a simple way to resolve the many questions that are before us.   First, disclose your tax returns and clear up, among other questions,  what your son said in 2008 about a lot of Russian money pouring into  your family business.   No. 2, answer all the questions about campaign contacts with the  Russians, including your former campaign manager Paul Manafort, former  National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, and former policy advisor  Carter Page.   No. 3, quite simply, explain the reports of repeated contacts between  your campaign operatives and Russian intelligence.   No. 4, answer all the questions about your close friend Roger Stone's  comments that suggest he had knowledge of Wikileaks' having and using,  in strategically timed releases when your campaign was struggling,  information that had been hacked by the Russians from your opponent's  campaign.   No. 5, explain your ties to Russian foreign businessman Felix Sater,  who worked at the Bayrock Group investment firm, which partnered with  your business and had ties to Russian money.   No. 6, provide all requested documents to Congress related to Michael  Flynn, who concealed his payments from the Russian interests. If there  is nothing to hide, this is your chance to clear up things once and for  all.   To my Republican colleagues I say again that these Russian  connections may constitute a national security crisis. We need to have  the facts. How long will we wait for these desperately needed answers  before we establish an independent commission investigation, as we have  done when faced with previous attacks on America?   Finally, how long will we sit by before passing additional sanctions  on Russia for their cyber attack on the United States of America? That  attack makes November 8, 2016, a day that will live in cyber infamy in  America's history. It is time for the Republicans and the Democrats to  show the appropriate concern for this breach of our national security.   We have a bipartisan Russian sanctions bill ready to go to the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee. What are we waiting for?   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I wish to express concern with President  Trump's nominee to serve as next Commissioner of the Food and Drug  Administration, FDA.   The FDA Commissioner is responsible for overseeing our Federal agency  tasked with protecting and promoting the public health through the  regulation of food, tobacco products, dietary supplements, drugs,  medical devices, cosmetics, and veterinary products. I am not convinced  that Dr. Scott Gottlieb is the right person for this job, based  primarily on his less than impressive record of defending women's  access to healthcare, his association with an ecigarette--or vaping-- company that has produced and marketed tobacco products to youth, his  stated desire to expand ``off-label'' communications between drug  companies and health providers, and his long-standing and vocal  opposition to the Affordable Care Act, ACA. If confirmed, I hope he  proves me wrong.   Of particular concern to me is protecting our Nation's food safety. I  was pleased that, in 2001, then-President Obama signed into law the FDA  Food Safety Modernization Act, marking the most comprehensive reform of  our Nation's food safety system in decades. Every year, 48 million  Americans suffer from preventable foodborne illness. More than 120,000  people are hospitalized each year because of food contamination and  3,000 die. Every 4 minutes, someone is rushed to the hospital because  the food they ate made them sick, and at the end of the day, eight will  die--which is why I have spent much of my career working on various  bills to strengthen food safety structures at FDA and the U.S.  Department of Agriculture, to create a single food safety agency, and  to support increased inspection and protection of foreign food imports.  Even with passage of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, more work  remains to be done. We must further beef up both foreign and domestic  facility inspections. We must ensure the FDA has sufficient staff and  resources to carry out their responsibilities. We must do a better job  of effectively tracking and tracing high-risk foods in the event of a  foodborne illness outbreak.   In addition, the FDA can and must do more to better regulate dietary  supplements. I was pleased that, in 2015, the FDA announced creation of  the Office of Dietary Supplement Programs to increase focus on and  regulation of the ever-growing dietary supplement industry. It is my  hope that this FDA office continues to receive the funding they so  desperately need to carry out their mission of regulating a $35 billion  dietary supplement industry and aggressively pursue wrongdoing.   Finally, ecigarette products continue to be a growing threat to our  Nation's youth. Last year, then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy released a  report, calling the skyrocketing use of ecigarettes among youth ``a  major public health concern.'' Ecigarettes are now the most commonly  used form of tobacco among young people in the United States. Over the  past 5 years, the number of middle school and high school students who  have used ecigarettes has tripled. Among young adults aged 18 to 24,  the number has doubled. While some research indicates that ecigarettes  contain fewer toxic substances than ecigarettes, vape from ecigarettes  is not harmless, and these products are a gateway to smoking. The  popularity of ecigarettes stems in part from aggressive marketing and  products aimed at youth, including the marketing of bubble gum, tutti  frutti, and marshmallow flavorings. The FDA must aggressively oversee  these products and ensure that they are not being marketed to children  or young adults. Any attempt to exempt these products from FDA  regulation will be met with extreme resistance from me.    Mr. President, the termination and removal of James Comey  as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation raises a critical  question as to whether the FBI investigation of Russian interference in  the last Presidential campaign will continue and whether the  investigation into any collusion or involvement by the Trump campaign  will be investigated by the FBI. Any attempt to stop or undermine this  FBI investigation would raise grave constitutional issues.   We await clarification by the White House as soon as possible as to  whether this investigation will continue and whether it will have a  credible lead so  [[Page S2849]]  that we know it will have a just outcome.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.
