 Mr. Speaker, I do agree. Whether it is in your personal  life, your business life, your family life--anything at all--your  family, the people, your colleagues around you, the people that you  work around demand some deliverable. Deliverable might be showing up on  time with a good attitude, but at least you delivered something.   I remember that speech from my good friend, the gentleman from Texas,  because I watched it. He started out and he said: What the hell is  wrong with this country?   Well, nothing is wrong with this country. The problem is with this  place.   There are a lot of good people on this side of the aisle, and maybe  we haven't produced a deliverable, but I would also say this: There has  been no help, no help at all from the other side of the building, the  other side of the aisle or down the street at the White House; no help  at all.   I have car manufacturers now coming to see me and they are saying:  Well, we are forced to build these electric cars; nobody wants them.  Then when they don't have anything else to buy, they buy them. And then  they don't work, so they bring them back in and they trade them in for  something else, and then they sit there and we can't sell them.  Congressman, what are you going to do for me?    My goodness, Joe Biden is the President.   The regulators, every single day another rule, another regulation,  they just keep coming and coming.   Members of Congress, I don't know that we are irrelevant, but if we  are not willing to stop funding these agencies that keep on prevailing  against the American people, well that is what we are going to be.   The Founders made each body to jealously guard its own power. Instead  of jealously guarding our power, we  [[Page H6034]]  have given it to bureaucrats; nameless, faceless people that have an  agenda that pass rules with the force of law. These rules that spend  all this money make your Thanksgiving dinner more expensive.   My mom went out to get a turkey for our family. My mom makes a turkey  for our family and we all get together. She called her son up to say  that the turkey costs $70.   Mr. Speaker, from lettuce to lumber, people can't afford in America  just to live their lives. They can't afford their bills; they can't  afford groceries; they can't afford gas in their car; they can't afford  their credit card payments while they try and just live the life that  they have lived.   As the slide or the poster over there shows, their bills have gone up  that much. They are paying, between the government and the increased  cost, an extra month of their pay; every year an extra month for things  that they didn't have to just 3 years ago.   This body is the only one that has the power of the purse. This is  the only body that can control the spending that is driving up every  single cost, every single cost. It starts here.   If we don't have the courage--we can have the conviction--people vote  for their Member saying: Well, this guy said when he goes to  Washington, he is going to fight the swamp. He is going to fight the  bureaucracy. He is going to fight the spending. However, when the bill  shows up on the floor and we see the amendment up there, oh, my  goodness, every single time you get 100 votes, 150 votes.   Mr. Speaker, it takes 217 to pass these amendments to cut spending.  If you said you are going to cut spending at home, then your  opportunity happens right here on the floor. If you are not going to do  it here, if you are not going to vote that way, don't go home to your  constituents and say, I am sorry you can't afford lettuce and a holiday  turkey. I am sorry you can't afford your bills: your car payment, your  home payment, your insurance payment, your heating bill. I am sorry you  can't afford it--because I didn't do anything to help you. Your  opportunity, the leverage, the moment is here. It is now.   We have been working on spending bills for months, and the reason  that we can't pass them here is because we are spending too much.   Oh, by the way, that is a fight among this side of the aisle that  actually some of us want to do something to save our constituents from  this overbearing weight of the Federal Government and the regulatory  agencies--and I have to say this to my good friend from Texas--with no  help whatsoever from the other side of the aisle. No help.    Mr. Speaker, there is no reason that we should do it.  There is not a person in this Chamber on that side of the aisle or this  side of the aisle that agrees with Vladimir Putin, the Russian  Federation, the invasion of Ukraine, the atrocities that have been  committed there. There is not one person that agrees with it.    At the same time, our country is under assault, our country is being  invaded, and our country can't afford its bills.   Before we have the audacity, the temerity to demand, under force of  law, that our citizens get up in the morning, go to work, and pay their  taxes to pay for the pensions and the salaries of government workers in  Ukraine--my goodness, are we tone deaf to the fact that the people in  this country, the people in the gentleman from Texas' communities, and  the people that I represent, can't afford to pay their bills? They  can't afford to pay their bills.   None of us agree with what is happening overseas in regard to  Ukraine, but we have a duty. We were not elected by Ukrainian citizens.  We were elected by United States citizens, American citizens that are  paying their taxes under penalty of law.   They will be thrown in jail if they don't pay their taxes. It is the  height of insult and injury to tell them you have to pay your taxes and  you can't afford a holiday meal, but you can rest assured that that  money is going to go over to Ukraine to pay for their salaries and  their pensions.   The American people are sick of it. They sent us here to do something  about it, and every time we have an opportunity, every single time we  have an opportunity, we need to seize that opportunity.   Quite honestly, it just comes down to this, Mr. Roy, when the Senate  demands this, when the President demands it, the Speaker of House, this  Republican majority, respectfully, just says no.                                time  1800     That is correct.    Of course not. My constituents, my bosses, just like your  bosses, were vehemently opposed to that last December's cram-down of  all this money to all kinds of things, omnibus spending, everything in  there. They didn't want it, and as a signal to what we would do if we  governed, Republicans, every single one, voted against it.   Now, 9 or 10 months later, we are supposed to act like, well, we  didn't get our work done so we are just going to continue that, but  don't worry about it. Forget about what happened 9 or 10 months ago.   The American people have not forgotten. Do you know how I know they  [[Page H6035]]  have not forgotten? Because I was at the grocery store on Monday before  I came here, and a woman came up to me with her grocery cart. She  recognized me and said: Don't the people that you work with grocery  shop? Don't they know how much this costs?   She knows, and she demands that we do better and that I be  accountable and not vote for things I voted against 9 months ago and  just act like they are okay. They are not okay 9 months later.    I imagine my district is just like yours.   I visited a local construction company with 400 hardworking  Americans. Men and women come in. They have steel-toed boots on, jeans,  jackets with stains on them. They come in out of the cold. They don't  have time to worry about what amendment or bill you got passed through  the House but there was no signature.   Here is what they worry about, to my friend from Texas, and I think  your bosses feel the same way: We sent you to Washington to make our  lives better. My prices are going up. My selections are going down, and  my choices are going down. The government is imposing itself on me  about whether I want to install a gas stove in my home or whether I  want to speak out about my political views and not end up on some list,  or if I want to go deer hunting today and worry that I got the wrong  ammunition or that my gun isn't configured so that the Federal  Government doesn't come arrest me.   They say: We are counting on you to do this, so don't come home and  talk to us about amendments and bills and ``I had a meeting with,''  because it doesn't affect my life. All the things that are happening to  me every day from this administration are affecting my life. I am sick  of it, and I am sending you down there to stop it.    There is always some excuse. When we have the House or the  Senate, or we have both and the Presidency, there is always some excuse  for why it can't be done.   I will tell you this. There is no excuse for the radical march of the  left creeping into everybody's life, into every decision that you make,  into everything you do. It just keeps happening.   Our bosses are not down here in Washington, D.C. They don't  understand committee rules and the process here on the floor. What they  understand is that they are getting up in the morning when it is dark  outside, packing their lunch, and kissing their kids good-bye before  they get on the schoolbus, and they don't know why this is happening to  them, but they sure know it is happening.   They think about the extra costs every single week when they are  trying to manage their budget. They are like: ``We are making more  money, but we still can't afford to live the way we did. We can't  afford our food. We can't afford, heaven forbid, if the car breaks  down.'' No, they don't understand why.    What they demand, to the good gentleman from Texas, is results, is  some product. They don't care about why it can't be done. They are not  asking for everything to change overnight. They know we didn't get here  overnight, but they want something, some win, to show them some light  at the end of this tunnel, but there isn't any. I haven't seen one yet.    Mr. Speaker, before I go, I will say that the gentleman  from Texas is right. We have to unite so that we can be effective  against these forces of evil that are destroying the American Dream. It  is not uniting for the sake of uniting. It is uniting around a purpose.   Our bosses are very forgiving. They are very gracious. They  understand if you fight the good fight and you lose. What they will not  accept, what they cannot accept, and what they should not accept is not  fighting at all or surrendering before the fight even begins.    Mr. Speaker, that is our job. Our job is to defend this  Constitution. My constituents, my bosses, know I carry one with me  every day.   It is a piece of paper, Mr. Speaker. It cannot defend itself. It  relies on the integrity, fortitude, courage, and conviction of good  people willing to come here to serve and fight on its behalf, like the  good gentleman from Texas.
