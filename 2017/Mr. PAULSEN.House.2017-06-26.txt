 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to congratulate Chaska  Middle School West, the Minnetonka School District, the Osseo Area  School District, and Salem Lutheran School in Loretto on being named  best communities for music education by the National Association of  Music Merchants Foundation. They have all been recognized for  outstanding commitment to their music programs.  [[Page H5169]]    Research has proven that music is vital to a student's education.  Music education benefits language development, spatial-temporal skills,  and can lead to a higher IQ and increased test scores. Music also  brings students together and gives them incentives to practice and  strive for more self-improvement.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the administrators, the  teachers, instructors, the parents, and the students in these schools  and districts for their impressive dedication to music education. They  put a lot of time and effort into their music programs, and all that  hard work is really paying off.                            ____________________
