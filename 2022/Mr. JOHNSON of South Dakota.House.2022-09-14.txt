 Madam Speaker, earlier this year, my  friend Mark Shlanta died at age 57. He had been a South Dakota  telecommunications leader since 1998.   Earlier this year, my friend Greg Dean died at age 58. He had been a  South Dakota telecommunications leader since 1999.   Earlier this year, my friend Rod Bowar died at age 60. He had been a  [[Page H7789]]  South Dakota telecommunications leader since 1976.   Earlier this year, my friend Bryan Roth died at age 59. He had been a  South Dakota telecommunications leader since 1998.   Now, losing one friend, losing one industry leader, is not easy. When  you lose four over the past few months, it can be almost more than  their friends and family can bear.   These were real leaders. Everybody around here talks about broadband.  It has been a hot topic in Congress for the last 2 years, every day-- broadband, high-speed internet, broadband, connectivity.   But I tell you, Madam Speaker, those four gentlemen were involved in  broadband long before it was cool and long before it was the hot topic  in Washington, D.C.   Mark spent 20 years as the CEO of SDN. Originally, it was the South  Dakota Network. He turned this into one of the most sophisticated State  networks in the country, and he expanded it by 50,000 miles of fiber- optic cable.   For 20 years, Greg, in his work with the South Dakota  Telecommunications Act, was probably the most influential person to  help set rural broadband policy in the halls of the State capital.   For 30 or 40 years, Rod, in his work as the CEO of Kennebec Telephone  Company, made sure that two small towns, Kennebec with 281 residents  and Presho with 472, had high-speed internet that would be the envy of  the largest and most cosmopolitan urban areas in the world.   For more than 20 years as CEO of TrioTel, Bryan worked to make sure  that that cooperative was the first telephone company in South Dakota,  all the way back in 2013, to have 100 percent of its customers  connected with fiber.   So, yes, Madam Speaker, these were titans of the rural broadband  arena.   But when I think about connectivity and these gentlemen's  contribution to it, I don't just think about rural broadband. I think  about the connections they made with their families and their  communities. It would have been hard to do more for Sioux Falls or for  Scouting or for his family than Mark did. It would have been hard to do  more for the Pierre community or Pierre athletics or his family than  Greg did. It would have been hard to do more for his church or the  outdoors or the Salem community than Bryan did. It would have been hard  to do more for Kennebec or for Presho or for the fire department or for  his family than Rod did.   The contributions of these gentlemen in their communities were  absolutely staggering. So, Madam Speaker, it is altogether appropriate  that we focus on the contributions to rural broadband of these four  titans of the industry. But I also think it is important to recognize  that when they thought of connectivity and when they made a  contribution to connectivity, it was about the human connection.   No one could have done more for the people and the places they loved  than Mark, Greg, Rod, and Bryan did.                            ____________________
