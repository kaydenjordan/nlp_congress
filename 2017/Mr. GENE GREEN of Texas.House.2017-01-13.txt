 Mr. Chairman, I oppose the Republican  resolution and support the Democratic resolution. We shouldn't deal  with affordable care without a solution. Just don't repeal. Let's see  what the replacement is so we don't, as Kentucky would say, buy a pig  in a poke.   Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to S. Con. Res. 3, the FY 2017 Budget  Resolution, the next step in the process of repealing essential  coverage and patient protections established by the Affordable Care  Act.   Moving forward with implementing the GOP's devastating ACA repeal  plan will lead to massive losses of coverage and consumer protections  for people enrolled in insurance and in the Medicaid program.   It will hamper the movement towards value-based payment reforms,  burden seniors with higher out-of-pocket costs on their prescription  drugs, and undermine prevention and wellness initiatives.   Repealing the ACA will leave every state with big increases in the  uninsured rate and higher uncompensated care costs, and threatens  coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.   Charging forward without even agreeing on a replacement plan is a  blatant abdication of the responsibilities we have as representatives  of the American people.   The effects of doing so are not abstract. People are going to get  hurt in very real ways.   The American people deserve to know how Republicans plan to avoid the  devastating consequences of ACA repeal, which include millions losing  coverage, chaos in the insurance markets, hospitals and states losing  billions of dollars and a hit to our economy.   In addition, the FY17 Budget Resolution shamelessly prioritizes  politics over patients by proposing to defund Planned Parenthood.   Denying patients the quality care--including breast exams,  contraception, and preventive and primary care services--will only  exacerbate the pain felt from coverage losses for the 2.5 million  patients who depend on Planned Parenthood each year for care.   The Resolution is bad for patients, budgets, and will upend our  health care system.   It fails the test of sensible policymaking.   The lack of any details on the ACA replacement Republicans say they  will enact fails the test of sensible policymaking: having the key  information before voting.   We should be taking steps to amend, not upend, the law.   I urge my colleagues to abandon this collision course and stop  working against the American people.   We should not be ``Making America Sick Again.''    Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had  I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 57. ``Nay''  on rollcall No. 58. ``Nay'' on rollcall No. 59.                            ____________________
