 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, the coronavirus has  brought to national attention the huge disparities in health status and  economic status of African Americans and other population groups in  this country.   We have seen how some financial institutions overlooked and denied  small, struggling businesses. This bill will do something about both. I  hope it does, and I am confident that it will.   After we have arrested the coronavirus, let's do something different  and help equalize America so that Blacks and other population groups  are not dying in disproportion to our population.   Let's make America the great equalizer, the America that has never  been and yet the America that we know can and must be, and let's save  our Postal Service.
