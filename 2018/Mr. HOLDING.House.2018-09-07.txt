 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6691, the  Community Safety and Security Act, and urge all of my colleagues to  support this bill.   I also want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman Handel, for her very  hard work in advancing this legislation.   In April, as we know, the Supreme Court held, in Sessions v. Dimaya,  that the term ``crime of violence'' was unconstitutionally vague. This  decision meant certain obviously violent offenses would no longer  qualify as violent crimes and, thus, made it more challenging to deport  illegal immigrants who have committed what we would all call violent  crimes.   Justice Gorsuch was the deciding vote in the case, casting his vote  for fear that vague laws invite arbitrary power. In his opinion, he  indicated that it was the duty of the legislature to add to the list of  what constitutes a crime of violence that could lead to a person's  deportation. This legislation does just that.   As a former United States attorney, I understand that clarity is the  cornerstone of justice. So by clearly defining what constitutes a  violent crime, we are not only strengthening our judicial system, but  also ensuring the safety of the American people.
