The Chair appoints the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost) to preside  over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1511                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 3219) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the  fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes, with Mr.  Bost in the chair.

The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen) and the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. Lowey) each will control 60 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 6 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to present an amendment to H.R. 3219, the  Make America Secure Appropriations Act. This legislative package  provides critical appropriations for national security, including for  the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the  Department of Energy's nuclear programs, and the Legislative Branch  bill.   My colleagues, this is the primary constitutional duty of the  Congress: to ensure the safety of the homeland and the American people.   This legislation is carefully crafted to meet that responsibility:  funding our critical military priorities, supporting veterans, and  making our borders more secure.   The core of this package is full-year funding for the Department of  Defense and the intelligence community. I thank Chairwoman Granger for  her leadership.   In total, the Defense portion of the bill provides $658.1 billion for  these functions, an increase of $68.1 billion in base discretionary  funding above the fiscal year 2017 enacted levels.   There is no doubt that this is a significant increase from the  current spending levels, and certainly from the last 8 years. But this  increase is vitally important to continue the process we started this  spring: to rebuild, repair, and re-equip our Armed Forces that we  started in the 2017 appropriations package.                                time  1515    Mr. Chairman, Secretary of Defense Mattis has quite correctly made  readiness and modernization of our forces his top priorities.   It is a fact today that we have too many aircraft that cannot fly,  too many ships that cannot sail, and too many troops who cannot deploy  either because they are not properly trained or there are not enough of  them.   So how did we get there? Because in recent years, we have been just  getting by--reducing investments in our military as the world becomes  more dangerous, and avoiding tough choices.   The package before us today will sustain a much-needed rebuilding of  our military after a half decade of cuts, while our troops remained in  constant combat, as they do today.   We provided prioritized funding to necessary but unfunded equipment  and weapons platforms. We have boosted missile defense, a program that  has taken on critical importance as North Korea, unabatedly, tries to  marry its nuclear warheads with new ballistic missiles.   We increased funding for the vital training that prepares our  warfighter for any contingency. This legislation also supports our  military families. After all, they serve, too. We included a 2.4  percent pay increase for our servicemen and -women, the largest such  raise in 8 years, and they deserve it.   Within the Military Construction and Veterans portion of this bill-- and I thank Chairman Dent for his leadership--military infrastructure  funding has increased by 25 percent above current levels. We continue  our efforts to rebuild our Armed Forces by ensuring that our  warfighters have the support they need.   We cannot forget those who have served. This measure increases  funding to the Department of Veterans Affairs to 5 percent over current  levels to provide veterans and their families with access to medical  care and other benefits they have earned and deserve.   Within the Energy and Water section of this legislation--I thank  Chairman Simpson for his leadership--funding is prioritized for  critical nuclear programs that will help strengthen our security and  deter threats around the globe.   We also support the maintenance of our Nation's waterways and support  the work of the Army Corps to also ensure the resilience and security  of our electricity infrastructure.   We recommit to opening Yucca Mountain as a safe and secure location  to permanently store the Nation's nuclear fuel and high-level  radioactive wastes, and we promote basic science programs, which lay  the foundation for new energy technologies.   Finally, Mr. Chairman, this package also includes funding for  important legislative branch functions--and I thank Chairman Yoder for  his leadership--improving security to ensure  [[Page H6336]]  that our Members, our staffs, and visitors to this wonderful Capitol  complex are always well protected.   Mr. Chairman, before I close, I offer thanks to members of the  Appropriations Committee for their hard work and tough decisions over  the past few months producing two appropriations bills, fiscal year  2017 and 2018, in less than 3 months.   As you know, we received the President's budget on May 23, just over  2 months ago, and since then, we have worked nonstop to put all 12  bills through the committee in record time. Each and every one of these  bills deserves to be sent to the President's desk. I look forward to  completing our work on all of our bills.   I also would like to extend my personal thanks to the entire  committee and to our remarkable staff for their hard work on these  bills and the eight yet to come.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Chairman, before I close, I just want to take  this opportunity to thank Mrs. Lowey for her work, and all of the staff  here for the remarkable things they have been doing over the last 3 or  4 weeks. While we may disagree strongly on some issues, our committee,  as Mr. Cuellar said a few minutes ago, works in a bipartisan way to get  our bills across the finish line.   To all the members of the committee and our staff and to the ranking  member, I thank them for the amicable way that all of us conduct  business. It is part of the history and tradition of our committee.   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her  comments.   Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, in closing, I would remind the  House that just yesterday we voted overwhelmingly in a bipartisan way  to impose tough new sanctions on three aggressor nations: Russia, Iran  and North Korea. Each pose their unique threats to our vital interests,  their neighbors, and to global stability.   But little in history would predict that sanction alone will change  the maligned behavior of these three regimes.   That is why we need to get this bill across the finish line, to  guarantee that our military is always prepared to meet any threat from  anyone anywhere, whether it be China in the Pacific; international  terrorist groups like ISIS, al-Qaida, Al-Nusra, al Shabaab, Hezbollah,  Hamas; and transnational drug smugglers and criminal gangs.   Mr. Chairman, I repeat: Congress' most important constitutional duty  is to provide for the common defense. This appropriations package  before us allows us to meet that solid responsibility.   I urge support of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
