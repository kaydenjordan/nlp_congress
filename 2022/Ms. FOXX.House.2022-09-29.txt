 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank my good friend from California for yielding time.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 7780, the Mental Health Matters Act, is a package  of bills our country would be better off without. For example, Title VI  of the bill, the Strengthening Behavioral Health Benefits Act, contains  dangerous policy which would threaten access to critical workplace  benefits.   How would this legislation drive employers to drop benefits? H.R.  7780 allows the Department of Labor, DOL, to levy civil monetary  penalties against plans and employers for ambiguous mental health  parity violations.   Employers who offer mental health benefits under the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA, do so voluntarily. They should  not be penalized for violating standards that are unclear and vague.  Republicans and  [[Page H8236]]  Democrats alike support mental health parity, which is why Congress has  passed multiple laws to ensure employers are able to meet mental health  parity requirements.   Yet, despite receiving explicit direction from Congress outlining  what DOL must provide to plans, the Department has yet to issue  guidance. Employers and plans have been asking the Department for years  to comply with the law and provide examples which illustrate compliance  and noncompliance, recommendations to advance compliance, and  clarifying information on how plans may demonstrate compliance.   However, instead of helping plans comply, DOL has blamed them for not  being able to read the minds of Washington bureaucrats. Providing DOL  with the authority to levy civil monetary penalties against plans and  increase their risk of litigation will only force plans to drop mental  health coverage.   This legislation would also increase DOL's budget for mental health  parity enforcement by an additional $275 million over 10 years, a sure  sign DOL wants to double down on its aggression toward employers. This  money would be better spent on compliance assistance instead of  targeting employers based on ambiguous standards.   Additionally, Title VII, the Employee and Retiree Access to Justice  Act, gets rid of arbitration clauses, class action waivers, and  discretionary clauses in employee benefit plans. This opens the door to  increased litigation against plan sponsors which could drastically  increase the cost of administering these plans.   Democrats are treating ERISA arbitration like a treacherous backroom  deal, but, in reality, arbitration settles disputes more quickly and  more often in favor of claimants than litigation. The only people who  benefit from months and years in litigation are trial lawyers.                                time  1130    This bill also contains provisions regarding the youth mental health  crisis. There is bipartisan agreement that addressing the mental health  of youth matters. However, we can't ignore the fact that Democrats  exacerbated the youth mental health situation by prolonging school  shutdowns.   At the behest of teachers unions, Democrat politicians from the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to school district  administrators kept classrooms shuttered, despite knowing that schools  were not major vectors of spread and that children were suffering from  this forced isolation. The results have been catastrophic.   In 2021, more than one-third of high school students reported they  experienced poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. According  to one study, from February to March 2021, the number of ER visits by  young girls for suspected suicide attempts was up by more than 50  percent compared to 2019.   School closures fail students, which is why we should be spending our  time addressing the massive learning loss students suffered because of  these shutdowns. This is a problem that cannot be neglected, especially  if we want to see these young people have as bright a future as  possible.   Lastly, H.R. 7780 includes the Respond, Innovate, Succeed, and  Empower Act, or RISE Act, the intent of which Republicans support.   While I agree that students with disabilities shouldn't have to jump  through hoops to obtain accommodations at school, this legislation will  have unintended consequences as currently drafted.   For example, this legislation forces colleges and universities to  accept outdated documentation from students who are claiming disability  status but who do not, in fact, have a disability. This legislation  should have been debated with stakeholders before being rushed to the  House floor, but, as usual, Democrats took a shortcut.   I encourage my colleagues to work across the aisle and utilize the  deliberative process to form more commonsense and targeted legislation  if they actually want to address our country's mental health situation.   H.R. 7780 is a bill that tries to do too much and none of it well.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Chair, our colleagues keep saying the goal is  compliance. Well, if the goal is compliance, then it is up to the  Department to define the standard. Employers do not know what the  standard is. Therefore, they do not know what is expected of them to  comply.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Good).    Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. McClain).    Mr. Chair, I would like to correct the record regarding a  comment Chairman Scott made at the Rules Committee Tuesday that  employers must offer mental health benefits.   Most health plans governed by ERISA are not required to offer mental  health benefits. Let me repeat myself: Most mental health benefits  offered by employers with ERISA plans are offered voluntarily.   Offering comprehensive health coverage is a valuable tool used to  recruit and retain employees. When employers choose to offer mental  health benefits, those benefits must be at parity with other benefits.  What parity means is a matter of debate, which is the root of the  problem here.   The Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 required mental health parity  for plans that choose to provide mental health benefits. When these  employer-sponsored plans cover mental health benefits, they must abide  by mental health parity laws.   The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 directed the Department  of Labor to provide additional assistance to plans to comply with  parity requirements. DOL has ignored Congress' mandate to provide  additional assistance to plans and is instead expecting plans to read  the minds of Washington bureaucrats or face litigation and fines.   The problem with this top-down approach is that employers do not have  to subject themselves to DOL's whims. Employers are choosing to cover  mental health benefits. They can just as easily choose not to offer  mental health benefits if Washington is intent on making it too  challenging or costly.   DOL should follow the law and issue additional guidance, specifically  standards, to employers and plans.   Helping employers would undermine the Democrats' long-term goal of  weakening employer-sponsored insurance and implementing government-run  healthcare.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1200     Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, passing H.R. 7780 would do a disservice to  students, workers, and job creators. This legislation has been weighed,  it has been measured, and it has been found wanting.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today to oppose the amendment offered by  Representative Porter and Representative Trone.   Much of this amendment is well-intentioned. The amendment authorizes  the Department of Education to conduct a study to better understand the  prevalence of mental health disabilities and substance use disorders on  campus.   The amendment also authorizes the Department of Education, in  conjunction with the Department of Justice, to issue guidance to  institutions on how they can continue to comply with the Americans with  Disabilities Act, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and other  legal obligations, when serving students with mental health  disabilities and substance use disorders.   However, this amendment has some issues. This amendment includes  broader language that could allow the Department of Education to  deviate from issuing guidance on complying with these existing laws and  open the door for the Department of Education to speculate on a variety  of other institution policies.   For example, language in this amendment could permit the Department  of Education to prohibit colleges and universities from enforcing their  codes of conduct when students engage in drug use that violate campus  policies, which would make campuses less safe and less able to support  students with mental health disabilities or substance use disorders.   Unfortunately, this amendment did not go through the normal committee  process, where it would be my hope that much of this language could  have been discussed and revised.   I believe we all want to ensure students struggling with mental  health disabilities are provided the appropriate legal accommodations  by their institutions. However, this amendment fails to do that.   Mr. Chair, I will oppose this amendment; I encourage my colleagues to  do the same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, we are hearing a lot lately about how bills are imperfect,  but we should go ahead and pass them.   Mr. Chair, we have an opportunity to improve legislation before we  pass it, but there seems to be no appetite on the part of our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle to act in a bipartisan  fashion to improve legislation.   Why in the world do we want to vote for things that are imperfect but  could be improved when there is a will to do that on our side of the  aisle?   It makes no sense.   This amendment needs work done to it before we could possibly support  it, and I suggest that we set it aside--set the bill aside--and work on  those things that need to be improved, demand that the Department of  Education do its job. Clean this up. Then we could pass good  legislation, maybe not perfect, but certainly better than what we are  facing here today.   Mr. Chair, I agree, don't let perfect be the enemy of the good. For  heaven's sake, let's pass good legislation, not legislation that isn't  as good as it could be.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment,  ``no'' on the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Republicans are committed to addressing the Nation's mental health  crisis, including in the workplace. Unfortunately, this amendment,  while spending $30 million, puts the cart before the horse and does  nothing to address the serious flaws in H.R. 7780.   If Democrats were serious about improving mental health resources and  implementing best practices in the workplace, they would strike the  provisions in the underlying bill that will make it more difficult for  employers to offer mental health benefits.   Still, the amendment, as written, is not ready for prime time. First,  I have concerns about the program's bloated $30 million price tag over  3 years. It is all too common for Congress to throw money at a problem  without any oversight or accountability to ensure that taxpayer dollars  are spent in the most effective way possible.   The amendment also establishes inappropriate criteria for the  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, to  examine. This includes how changes in workplace protocols or traumatic  grief from COVID-19 in the workplace contributes to adverse worker  mental health.   These criteria are overly prescriptive. Congress should let NIOSH do  its job in determining what kinds of workplace factors contribute to  poor mental health.   Further, the amendment directs NIOSH to report to Congress within a  year on whether the best practices have been developed and adopted by  relevant stakeholders. However, the Department of Labor's vague and  unclear guidance on mental health parity makes it challenging for  employers to offer mental health benefits; and H.R. 7780 would only  increase the risk for employers offering mental health benefits.   I am disappointed by the lack of effort to develop a workable  bipartisan solution to study the mental health of our Nation's workers  before this flawed legislation was rushed to the floor by Democrats.  This is a partisan amendment to a partisan bill, and a missed  opportunity to improve healthcare for workers.   I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment and the underlying bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   As I stated on the last amendment, this bill needs a lot of work.  Republicans are more than willing to work with our colleagues across  the aisle to make the bill better, to make this amendment better.   Again, Democrats' favorite ploy to solve a problem is to throw money  at it, but not have clear standards, not hold agencies accountable, and  not have a clear plan.   Republicans have plans for how to get things done better in this  country, and we would be so much better off if we could work in a  bipartisan manner to bring bills to the floor; have them go through  regular order; and spend time debating them together.   We want legislation that helps our situations in the country; not  throw money at it; not just say, well, let's try this imperfect  approach and see what will happen. Throw something against the wall and  see if it will stick. That is a rotten way to run this country, Mr.  Chairman. We can do better.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   This is a 5-minute vote.
