 Mr. Speaker, I was reflecting the other day. Last  week, we all joined together in this Chamber, we held up our right  hand, and we swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution  against all enemies, foreign and domestic.   That is an oath I have taken both as a Member of Congress--now on my  fourth term--and as a military pilot, something similar to that,  talking about the importance of the military to protect and defend the  Constitution. In both of these roles, I have seen firsthand the  sacrifice that men and women of the military have been willing to make  to defend their freedoms, to defend the Constitution, defend the  country.   This last month was especially tough for our Nation's security and  for our foreign policy. The 8-year decline of American global  leadership, under the President, came to a head. A sad trend built by  the Obama administration continued as the White House worked with our  enemies and abandoned our friends.   For one, the recent ceasefire in Syria was reached without United  States' input, ultimately empowering tyrants in Iran and in Russia. In  fact, to think about the situation in Syria, I want to remind people  there are half a million dead Syrians right now, innocent civilians.  And I have heard people say, completely incorrectly, that it doesn't  matter; they are all basically terrorists. Untrue. But let's say it is.   There are 50,000 children in Syria that did not get an opportunity to  go be a teacher or a police officer or a firefighter or a doctor  because of tyrants in Iran, because of Bashar al-Assad and because of  Russia empowering them and using precision-guided munitions to hit  innocent civilians and take their life away.   Last week, the U.S. abstained from a vote in the United Nations  Security Council on the biased resolution targeting our ally Israel.   Mr. Speaker, rather than turning on freedom-loving nations around the  world, we must stand with them. Nowhere is this more important than in  the fight against terrorism.   Before the holidays, a list went out from ISIS accounts with the  names of churches in the United States that should be attacked over the  holidays. Then, an attack in Berlin took the lives of 12 innocent  civilians and injured more than 50 in a Christmas market. On New Year's  Eve, there was a savage attack at a nightclub in Istanbul, killing 39  revelers and injuring dozens.   Both attacks were claimed by ISIS seeking to strike fear into  freedom-loving people around the world. While we all must remain  vigilant, we cannot give in to that fear, and we must continue to live  our lives.   What we need right now, Mr. Speaker, is a renewed American moment,  renewed American leadership after 8 years of decline. We need a  Churchill moment. I think about Winston Churchill after the bombs  rained down in London, and instead of hiding and cowering and talking  about how terrible it is, he goes out on the streets, rallies the  people, and says that you cannot shatter us. And the people unite  behind him.   It is time for America to exhibit the same kind of leadership  exhibited by George W. Bush in the bullhorn speech after the fall of  the World Trade Center. He showed Americans unity, strength, resolve,  and he reminded the world that our foundations will not be shaken even  if you shake the foundations of our biggest buildings. And you can  shatter our steel, but you can't shatter the steel of American resolve.  I haven't heard speeches like that in quite a while from the oval  office.   Mr. Speaker, it has been a rough election cycle for our country. It  has been a tough, very divisive, and difficult time, but now it is time  to come together. We are going to have our partisan differences and  battles, and that is fine. That is what we are out here for.   But, Mr. Speaker, America needs to remember our mission, our God- given mission. I believe that is to be an example of self-governance to  billions of people that don't have what we have, but are desperate for  it.   We used that kind of leadership in the cold war as millions lived  behind the Iron Curtain and saw what freedom could be. And there are  iron curtains that exist today; terrorism, strongmen, a resurgent  Russia--an iron curtain of soft expectations and low expectations of  people.   For the last 8 years, we failed to articulate that mission. Mr.  Speaker, we are a nation in need of remembering that mission, and it is  my sincere hope that this will change very soon.                            ____________________
