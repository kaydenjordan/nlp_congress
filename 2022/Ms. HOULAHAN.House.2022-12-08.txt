 Mr. Speaker, as students across this country are  readying to take their finals and midterms, I want to recognize  Albright College's work to innovate education in the United States.   Albright's Total Experience Learning Dual Enrollment program lets  high school juniors and seniors enroll in college courses and allows  them to complete an entire semester of coursework before they even  begin college. As a former high school chemistry teacher and leader of  a literacy nonprofit myself, I am so proud of this successful program.   Next week, the president of Albright College will be at the United  Nations, where Albright will be recognized by a science subcommittee of  the United Nations as the innovative K-12 educator model for the United  Nations International Year of Glass.   Without a doubt, the students and staff of Albright's Total  Experience Learning are force multipliers, and it is my honor to  represent and support all the forward-thinking constituents,  businesses, and academic institutions like Albright within our Sixth  Congressional District.                            ____________________
