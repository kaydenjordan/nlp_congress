 Madam Speaker, the President has a duty to protect our  borders and our people. He has the Constitution and the law of the land  on his side to declare this national emergency.   Democrats have blocked the appropriations for this border security,  but they had no problem when President Obama built 130 miles of border  wall. While they played political games, 76,000 people alone, in  February, streamed across our borders, but the United States has  endured because we are a land that believes in the rule of law.   Turning a blind eye to this law and allowing these open borders sends  the wrong message to the American people and our laws.   Madam Speaker, I am a country physician who has, unfortunately, been  in emergency rooms and in funeral homes with the families of those that  have died of illegal opioid overdoses. When we play political games  with American lives and American families, shame on us.   Madam Speaker, 85 to maybe 95 percent of these illegal opioids come  across the southern border where we have no fence, we have no barrier  to prevent these illegal people from bringing these drugs in.   We have got to secure this border with a wall. Let the President  secure our border; let the President protect our people; and let's vote  against this veto override.
