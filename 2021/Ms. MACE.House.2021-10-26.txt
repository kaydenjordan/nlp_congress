 Madam Speaker, today I rise in recognition of Belle Hall  Elementary School in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. They were recently  awarded the National Blue Ribbon School designation by the U.S.  Department of Education.   Belle Hall is one of 325 schools in the Nation, one of five in South  Carolina, and the only one in South Carolina's First Congressional  District to earn this distinction.   Led by their principal, Kevin Conklin, and the assistant principal,  Bonita Foster, and numerous dedicated teachers, Belle Hall attributes  their success to the tremendous level of support from their families,  from businesses, and from the community as a whole in Mount Pleasant.   I would like to recognize the PTA as well who has made significant  strides in increasing student learning outcomes for math and reading by  raising more than $100,000 a year to supplement one-on-one tutoring for  their struggling students.   As we all know, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented enormous  challenges for our schools, teachers, and parents. Belle Hall has  overcome these challenges and demonstrated excellence despite them.   Recognizing Barbara Melvin's New Position and Recognizing Jim Newsome's                                 Retirement     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate  Barbara Melvin on her new position as the new president and CEO of  South Carolina Ports Authority.   Barbara will be the sixth leader in the history of the port and the  first woman to lead a top 10 U.S. operating container port.   Barbara has been with the South Carolina Ports Authority for over 23  years, and I am confident in her ability to lead our State and our  region and our Nation.   Today I also recognize our much beloved outgoing president and CEO,  Jim Newsome.   Jim has been the keystone in providing supply chain stability in our  State and indeed our Nation and has developed visionary strategies for  the port of South Carolina.   For 13 years, Jim oversaw countless projects which extended the  port's reach and led to a doubling of container volumes over the last  decade.   I applaud Jim Newsome for his service and his incredible career on  behalf of the First Congressional District. We thank him for his  leadership, his passion, and his direction.                            Honoring Curtis Bostic     Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to an  incredible feat under extraordinary circumstances. South Carolina's  First Congressional District constituent, Curtis Bostic, was called to  action to assist an endangered employee based in Afghanistan. Their  communication was over 7,000 miles apart.   Mr. Bostic and his aides at the Christian relief group from  Charleston called Remember pulled off an evacuation using intelligence  reports from the streets of Kabul, Google maps, and a secure cell phone  application to communicate with the employee and his family as they  avoided all of the Taliban's roadblocks.   I am happy to report the employee that Mr. Bostic and Remember had  been working to assist has arrived in the UAE safely along with his  wife and three children who were all under the age of 10.   I applaud Mr. Bostic and Remember for their perseverance as many said  the evacuation would be abandoned and it would never happen. They  continued fighting for their employee's life and for the safety of his  children and their family with ultimate success.            Recognizing Truist Bank and Trident Technical College     Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank Truist Bank and  Trident Technical College for working together to create a new CDL  training program this summer in north Charleston.   There is an acute need for truck drivers right now, particularly  given the supply chain shortages and the issues we are seeing across  the country from COVID-19.   This CDL program will enable students to obtain their certificate in  as short as 9 weeks. Trident Technical College will have day and  evening sessions for students, and these programs will start about  every 3 weeks. I have heard there is already a wait list for the  program, and I couldn't be happier to hear it.   I commend Truist Transportation and Logistics Center and Trident  Technical College and Mary Thornely for their collaborative effort to  fill a much-needed void and gap in our supply chains and for bringing  the Lowcountry to the forefront of innovation and problem solving in  the private sector during COVID-19.                        Breast Cancer Awareness Month     Madam Speaker, October is National Breast Cancer Awareness  Month. In the U.S., one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast  cancer in her lifetime. Almost every one of us knows someone who has  been diagnosed with breast cancer.   Sadly and tragically, it is the most common cancer among women  worldwide.   On average, every 2 minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer,  and one woman will die of breast cancer every 13 minutes.   Over three million breast cancer survivors are alive in the United  States today.   In honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, I also recognize South  Carolina reporter from the Associated Press, Meg Kinnard, who had the  courage to talk about being diagnosed with breast cancer earlier this  year. Meg came home just a few days ago from her many treatments, and  she is now free from breast cancer. It is a heartwarming story, and I  wish we had the research and the resources to ensure every woman who is  diagnosed with breast cancer comes home cancer free.                            ____________________
