 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this morning, the Nation grieves with the  people of Lewiston, ME. After last night's horrible, senseless mass  shooting, the shooter remains at large, and we pray that there is no  more bloodshed after the horrors of last night.   The stories coming out of Lewiston are gut-wrenching--people gunned  down while just trying to enjoy their Wednesday night out at the  bowling alley and a restaurant--a bowling alley and a restaurant. These  are supposed to be places where families go to have a good time, but  now they have become sites--too many places--of tragic mass shootings  in America. It is beyond heartbreaking that mass shootings like this  continue to happen in our country.   My condolences are with the families and loved ones. I can just  imagine them sitting at home just wondering, why did this happen to us?  My prayers will be with all Mainers and first responders as authorities  keep working to locate the shooter. Today, our hearts are with  Lewiston.                     Speaker of the House   Mike Johnson    Mr. President, on the new Speaker, yesterday, after a monthlong  paralysis in Congress, House Republicans finally--finally--elected a  new Speaker of the House.   I spoke with Speaker Johnson last night and expressed my  congratulations on his election to the speakership. I told Speaker  Johnson the exact same thing I told Speaker McCarthy: In a divided  government, the only way we will avoid a shutdown, fund the government,  or pass the supplemental is bipartisanship.   I hope the new Speaker learns lessons from the disastrous experiences  of his predecessors--Speakers Boehner, Ryan, and McCarthy--and realizes  that coddling the hard right is disastrous both for the country and for  the Republican leadership because, like it or not, Speaker Johnson will  not be able to ignore the need for bipartisanship in divided  government.   Right now, the world is in crisis. Americans and the citizens of the  world--people across the world--are looking for a Congress that is  functional, decisive, and able to reach across the aisle.   We must work together to send Israel the help she needs. We must  stand with our friends in Ukraine, which majorities in both Chambers  have made clear they support. To allow Putin to succeed is to endanger  America's national  [[Page S5198]]  security, and it is alarming that a growing number of House Republicans  don't seem to care about this. We also need humanitarian aid to reduce  the suffering in the Middle East, in Ukraine, and elsewhere.   We must also finish the bipartisan appropriations process. Extremist  funding bills that make cuts way below the bipartisan June agreement  will not fly. If Speaker Johnson tries to send those cuts over here,  they are not going to happen. They will be dead on arrival. All they  will do is waste more time at a moment when every day counts. So he  cannot listen to these 30 Members of the hard right who somehow think  they have all the knowledge and all right on their side and then tie us  in a knot.   Again, whether House Republicans like it or not, this is divided  government. Bipartisanship is the only way we will be able to get  anything done. I hope and pray Speaker Johnson realizes this quickly.  If Speaker Johnson repeats the mistakes of Speaker McCarthy, if he  tumbles down the MAGA road, it will be inevitable that the House finds  itself trapped in even more chaos very soon. If Speaker Johnson lives  up to the label that Congressman Gaetz has given him, ``MAGA Mike,'' he  will fail, as the previous Speakers have. But if Speaker Johnson  chooses the bipartisan path, we can do great things for the American  people, just as we did last Congress with an evenly divided Senate and  a narrowly divided House.    I look forward to working constructively with Speaker Johnson and  congratulate him on his election.                              Government Funding    Mr. President, on the minibus, the Senate today will continue the  bipartisan appropriations process here on the floor.   Yesterday, Senators were busy voting through a number of amendments  offered by both sides. We held rollcall votes on 4 amendments offered  by our Republican colleagues and adopted 25 additional amendments, many  of them bipartisan, by voice vote. We have more amendment votes to hold  later today, and Members should expect to keep voting into next week.  It is my hope that we can wrap up work on these appropriations bills as  soon as next week.   When the Senate passes these three bills, they will be the only  appropriations bills passed in either Chamber that both parties  support, and I think that is key to remember as we move forward. As I  said a moment ago, when I spoke to the newly elected Speaker Johnson, I  said the only way we will solve our most pressing problems--funding the  government, avoiding a shutdown, passing a supplemental--will be  bipartisanship.   The Senate has been a model for how we can make bipartisanship  happen, and it is all to the credit of our appropriators, particularly  Chair Murray and Vice Chair Collins. I thank my colleagues for their  work. I look forward to holding more amendment votes today and into  next week.                        Domestic Supplemental Funding    Mr. President, on the domestic supplemental, as the Senate works on  America's needs on the world stage, including passing robust funding  for Israel, Ukraine, the Pacific region, and humanitarian aid for Gaza,  for Israel, and for Ukraine, we will also work to take care of our  needs at home.   Last week, the President released his emergency supplemental to help  our friends in Israel and Ukraine defend themselves. Now Democrats are  working with the administration on a domestic supplemental to support  the needs of American families.   Our domestic supplemental will fund bipartisan priorities for  Americans, like disaster response, securing American energy  independence, fighting the scourge of fentanyl, expanding access to  affordable high-speed internet, and so much more.   Among our greatest needs right now is addressing childcare, which  remains outrageously expensive for too many families and something I  want to see the Senate address. I have had many conversations recently  with my colleagues about how the Senate can make childcare more  affordable. We are at a cliff now. As of September 30, funding was  greatly decreased, and now childcare workers are being laid off and  childcare slots are being rescinded. Families are in turmoil when that  happens. We have to work on making childcare more affordable, and we  have to work on it on the domestic side and have to keep it in the  domestic supplemental and do everything we can to get it done.   Just as we have to work on national security on a bipartisan basis,  the Senate should absolutely work on America's domestic needs with  equal bipartisan fervor. You can't have one try to argue against the  other. We need both domestic help and national security. It is not an  either-or in this situation. The President has wisely offered a  supplemental on domestic issues.                          Nomination of Jacob J. Lew    Mr. President, on the nomination of Jack Lew, yesterday, the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee voted 12 to 9 to report out the nomination  of Jack Lew, President Biden's pick to serve as Ambassador to Israel.  Later today, I will file cloture on this most urgent nomination so Mr.  Lew can be appointed to the post of Ambassador ASAP.   The team at the U.S. Embassy is doing a heroic job right now under  terrible circumstances, including a wonderful charge d'affaires who  helped us during our visit.   Israel is in crisis. America needs to stand with her, and a most  urgent and obvious step would be to make sure we have an American  Ambassador in place.                                  Australia    Mr. President, finally, later this morning, it will be my honor to  welcome Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia to the U.S.  Capitol for a bipartisan meeting.   Australia is a key ally, partner, and friend of the United States.  The strength of the U.S.-Australia alliance is illustrated powerfully  by the AUKUS trilateral agreement and by our shared commitment to  enhancing Indo-Pacific security and by our strong economic bonds.   I will tell the Prime Minister that the Senate will keep working to  pass all of the AUKUS agreement, because our national security  interests align with respect to China. I was proud to work alongside my  Senate colleagues to include AUKUS Pillar II in the Senate NDAA, and I  will work with my House colleagues during the NDAA conference to ensure  its inclusion in the final bill. We are now working to make sure  Australia can receive the Virginia-class submarines that are an  essential part of the trilateral agreement.   So, again, I thank Prime Minister Albanese for meeting with us today.  I look forward to discussing the importance of AUKUS and finding new,  innovative ways to collaborate.                             United Auto Workers    Mr. President, on the UAW, I am so pleased to hear that Ford and UAW  may have reached a tentative agreement. I hope that this spurs GM and  Stellantis, as well as the UAW, to continue negotiating in good faith.   The bottom line is simple, the workers gave up plenty when the auto  industry was in trouble. Now that the auto industry is making large  profits, the workers need to share fairly in that.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, before I begin, I want to note that I am  wearing a dog tag given to me this morning by one of the families of  the hostages held in Gaza. So we pray and hope for their release.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 306.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 370.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, October 26, be  waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I have five requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:               committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs    The Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs is authorized to  meet during the session of the Senate on Thursday, October 26, 2023, at  10 a.m., to conduct a hearing.                  committee on energy and natural resources    The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources is authorized to meet  during the session of the Senate on Thursday, October 26, 2023, at 9:30  a.m., to conduct a hearing.                          committee on the judiciary    The Committee on the Judiciary is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Thursday, October 26, 2023, at 10 a.m., to  conduct an executive business meeting.                          special committee on aging    The Special Committee on Aging is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Thursday, October 26, 2023, at 10 a.m., to  conduct a hearing.      subcommittee on chemical safety, waste management, environmental                     justice, and regulatory oversight    The Subcommittee on Chemical Safety, Waste Management, Environmental  Justice, and Regulatory Oversight of the Committee on Environment and  Public Works is authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on  Thursday, October 26, 2023, at 10 a.m., to conduct a hearing.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk  that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate  resolutions, which were submitted earlier today: S. Res. 435, S. Res.  436, S. Res. 437; S. Res. 438, and S. Res. 439.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed  to, the preambles be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I would just note that one of these  resolutions condemns anti-Semitism, which we see on too many campuses  these days.                            ____________________     Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until  3 p.m. on Monday, October 30; that following the prayer and pledge, the  Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed  expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Maddox nomination; further, that the cloture  motions filed during today's session ripen at 5:30 p.m. on Monday.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 3:15 p.m., adjourned until 3  p.m. on Monday, October 30, 2023.                            ____________________
