 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Rachael  Parker. Rachael attended the Route 51 festival in Las Vegas on October  1.   Rachael worked as a record technician at the Manhattan Beach Police  Department for 10 years. She was known as the ``matron'' of the police  department's front desk.   Rachael always treated people the same, no matter their  circumstances. She loved her family, and had a passion for animals. She  rescued two dogs, that she loved more than anything else.   Rachael always went out of her way to help those in need. Everyone  knew her and remembers her as being a gifted, kindhearted, and caring  woman.   I would like to extend my condolences to Rachael Parker's family and  friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
