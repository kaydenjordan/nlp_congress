 Mr. Chairman, let me just say I believe that  we are missing out on the opportunity to effectively do our jobs.   As elected Members of Congress, we are here to fight for what is  right, what is fair, and what is just. When presented with the  administration's budget, it is Congress that is charged to serve as the  first line of defense for the needs of the American people.   And the agriculture bill before us, as a part of this omnibus, is our  attempt at doing just that. However, the progress made in the  agriculture bill will end here because we do not have a budget  resolution to conference, and it is entangled with other very  contentious bills, and that is most unfortunate.  [[Page H6844]]    In light of the draconian budget request presented by the President,  Congressman Aderholt and I, along with our bipartisan Agriculture  Appropriations Subcommittee colleagues, worked diligently to protect as  much of our country's agriculture and food and drug safety systems as  we could.   In order to inflict the least amount of damage, the funding  reductions were spread across several programs. But let me be clear,  the communities that make up this great Nation need these programs to  be robustly funded in order to keep us competitive in the global  marketplace.   The United States of America will not continue to be the Nation that  produces the safest, most abundant, highest quality, most economical  food and fiber anywhere in the industrialized world if sufficient  resources are not made available by this Congress.   While we were able to maintain McGovern-Dole at the 2017 level, the  Food for Peace program was reduced.   This bill provides $830.4 million for research and education  activities, which includes approximately $161 million in funding,  consistent with fiscal year 2017, for minority serving land-grant  institutions. These funds will assist in increasing minority  representation and participation in the multidisciplinary agriculture  community in fields such as agriculture research, agribusiness, as well  as farming and ranching.   At the same time, the Commodities Future Trade Commission was  deprived of the $2 million of funds that it needs to protect U.S.  customers from nefarious trade activity. Unprecedented language was  inserted into the bill that allows the CFTC Chairman to reduce the pay  and benefits of his employees if he deems it necessary to avoid a RIF  or furlough, whether or not it abrogates established collective  bargaining agreements.   And unfortunately, the amendment I submitted to strike that provision  was not made in order by the House Rules Committee.   Funding for the Food and Drug Administration remains flat, which is  in stark contrast to the Trump budget that sought to cut it by more  than $900 million. And still, funding for this agency that oversees the  safety of our food, drugs, and medical devices will not grow, despite  our significant dependence on their activities and the increasing  workload each and every year.   FDA is being forced to do more with less resources, and that limits  its ability to adequately protect the health, safety, and welfare of  the American people.   Nutrition. Mandatory funding for SNAP and child nutrition were funded  consistent with the current estimates. That is good. Additionally,  school kitchen grants are funded at $25 million, which the Trump  administration requested be zeroed out. I thank the committee for this.   Now, we just voted for a bill to provide aid for the victims of  Hurricane Harvey just as the potential impact of Hurricane Irma looks  over us. Instead of being proactive to ensure our citizens who have  been and will be impacted by impending natural disasters are protected,  we are going to the floor with a package which inadequately funds our  Federal agencies and does not completely meet the needs of the citizens  of this great Nation.   This approach to funding our government for fiscal year 2018 all but  guarantees our short term, if not a full year, continuing resolution.  But just like every year, Democratic votes will be needed to enact an  appropriations law. Working together on a bipartisan basis will be  absolutely necessary for it to move forward.   Mr. Chairman, we still have a lot of work to do to discharge our  obligations to the American people.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Chairman, regretfully, this bill falls  short.   I would like to thank Mr. Aderholt for his work as chairman of the  subcommittee, Chairman Frelinghuysen, and both of them for conducting  the Appropriations Committee markups fairly and collegially, and Mrs.  Lowey, our full committee ranking member, for her very strong and  inspiring leadership.   And with that, let me thank our staffs on the majority and minority  sides for all of their cooperation.    Mr. Chairman, I wanted to note a few concerns  with items in the en bloc amendment. I am not opposing it, but I want  to lay down some markers.   On the amendment by the gentleman from Florida relating to ag  research, my major concern about the amendment is that the intent is,  in effect, to earmark USDA competitive research grants. That really is  a no-no. USDA's Agriculture and Food Research Initiative is one of the  jewels in our bill. We have built up funding for it over time and have  zealously protected it against any efforts by Congress to say what  research is and is not funded.   The agency in charge, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture,  has a complex internal process for deciding what areas to focus on, and  that is free from political interference. For AFRI to retain its  credibility, we must not start micromanaging that process and  specifying research areas and amounts, as the amendment does.   My other concern is that cutting the Agricultural Marketing Service  by $2 million is not a wise choice. In many ways, AMS is the little  engine that could. Of critical importance to many Members on both sides  of the aisle is its role in overseeing the National Organic Program and  the Specialty Crops Program.   Similarly, on the gentleman's NRCS amendment, I want to point out  that cutting the National Agricultural Statistics Service, as the  amendment would do, is not a good idea. NASS is USDA's premier  statistics agency.   Anyone in the agriculture business can tell you that statistics are  extremely important to farmers, to ranchers, and industry. NASS  produces information on production and prices for virtually every crop  grown in the United States, and the major livestock categories,  floraculture, organic farming, farm income, land values, and even  computer usage on farms; so this is an important agency that needs  every penny that we give it.   The amendments relating to watershed and flood prevention operations  and specialty crops for Members on my side of the aisle, unfortunately,  make reductions to the Offices of General Counsel and the Chief  Economist, both very important parts of USDA.   Again, I do not oppose the en bloc amendment, but I did want to make  these points.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let me just inquire how much  time I have remaining.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Georgia has 7\1/2\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).  [[Page H7037]]                                     time  1845     Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for  his leadership, and the manager of this appropriations process.   I cannot start a discussion of my particular amendment, very  briefly--and I thank my colleagues for the amendment being included in  the en bloc--without again mentioning the devastation in the Gulf Coast  region and the need that we have on all aspects of recovery, and will  look forward to an effective investment for the long haul.   My amendment contributes to that aspect, and that is that the  amendment makes a modest $500,000 increase to the National Institute of  Food and Agriculture's Research and Education Activities account. The  intent of the amendment is to enable the NIFA to increase funding by  $500,000 to 1890 institutions, which are HBCU land grant colleges, to  support education, research, and scholarship at HBCUs.   The amendment is paid for by an offset of $944,000 in the chief  information officer account. The offset is budget neutral and reduces  outlays by $1 million, according to the CBO.   This particular amendment supports the work of the National Institute  of Food and Agriculture by making a modest increase that will help our  land grant colleges. It will help our land grant colleges in the  context of them contributing, one, to a better understanding of food  deserts, better understanding of expanding opportunities for research,  economic analysis, extension in higher education, and it also will be  supportive of colleges that, in many instances, are impacted by natural  disasters. The HBCUs have been leaders in agricultural research.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentlewoman.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Some of the colleges that I am speaking of will be  major contributors in the concept of expanded food access for many of  our communities.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank the gentleman for extending the time to  me. The amendment is a good amendment and it would benefit rural,  suburban, and urban areas by maximizing the potential for farming  activity in those areas where green space is limited or land is  underused. Again, the combination of agricultural fighting against food  deserts, which many of my constituents are facing now after Hurricane  Harvey, is an important extended impact that I think will be helpful as  we go forward.   I thank my colleagues for their support of the Jackson Lee amendment  No. 13.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding  me time.   Mr. Chair, I find it troubling that Congress, having enacted numerous  laws governing the oceans and coasts, and having put 11 departments and  4 different agencies in charge of administering those laws, now seems  to pause in the effort to bring consistency to that process.   The USDA has an extremely limited role in ocean policy, and it is so  little that I often wonder why the majority feels it necessary to stop  it.   I also wonder why anyone in a rural area would want the USDA's voice  to be excluded from any discussion of policy. Shouldn't the interests  of the farmers and the ranchers who are served by the USDA be taken  into consideration?   Mr. Chair, I support the amendment and I urge a ``yes'' vote.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from Rhode Island has  expired.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, what the Davis-Bacon Act does is  protect the government, as well as the workers, in carrying out the  policy of paying decent wages on government contracts.   The Davis-Bacon Act requires that workers on federally funded  construction projects be paid no less than the wages paid in the  community for similar work.   It requires that every contract for construction of which the Federal  Government is a party in excess of $2,000 contains a provision defining  the minimum wages paid to various classes of labors and mechanics.   The House has taken numerous votes on this issue, and on every vote,  this body has voted to maintain Davis-Bacon requirements. In fact, most  recently, during consideration of the FY18 security omnibus, the House  firmly rejected a similar amendment 249-178. I hope that we will defeat  the amendment before us today and move on to more substantive matters.   I would also note that it is somewhat ironic that this amendment is  being offered on the agriculture appropriations bill because the Davis- Bacon Act specifically protects rural community workforces. It requires  that prevailing wage determinations for rural counties be based solely  on local workforce costs. Wage data from urban areas must be excluded.   This requirement, I would note, came into force during the Presidency  of Ronald Reagan. I urge all Members to vote ``no.'' I urge my  colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa will be  postponed.                  Amendment No. 16 Offered by Mrs. Hartzler    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 16  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.    Since President Bush ordered Federal agencies  to comply with E-Verify back in 2007, this amendment, if it only  applies to hiring at Federal agencies, would do absolutely nothing. I  am not aware of any effort by the Trump administration to undo  President Bush's order, so it is a needless use of the House's time.   I believe the gentleman's language would also require every one of  the local county employees or local folks to be E-Verified. Wouldn't  this add another burden on USDA when it has to implement the new farm  bill?   If so, I would like to ask the gentleman what he expects would happen  in an emergency, such as we experienced from Hurricane Harvey, when  USDA may need to bring on employees quickly. They would have to wait  for E-Verify clearance.   I would also submit that it is not clear whether the language also  covers every single person who receives any of the funds in this bill  as a grantee. I think it is unclear and would risk requiring every  single one of the thousands of grantees to go through E-Verify. Then  you would impose a truly undue burden on many small farmers, ranchers,  and businesses that receive grants in this bill. I would strongly  oppose that.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
